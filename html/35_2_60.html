	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to recognize a group of extremely 
hardworking individuals from townships in the district of 
Nipissing.
<P>
	The Mattawa and Area Forestry Committee is made up of 
members from the Bonfield, Calvin, Mattawan and 
Papineau-Cameron townships and the town of Mattawa.
<P>
	Forestry companies like Calvin Forest Products, Clouthier and 
Sons Logging, Columbia Forest Products, Wunsch Forest Products 
and Tembec Incorporated are developing ideas for value added 
products to complement current production in the forestry industry.
<P>
	This forward thinking committee is hard at work developing new 
sectors for economic growth in the forestry industry in our area. 
Human Resources Development Canada and the Ontario ministries 
of national resources and northern development and mines provide 
ex officio help that is greatly appreciated.
<P>
	I congratulate this group of communities for looking to the 
future and not just seeing the problems, but instead actively 
working to be part of the solutions.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
kept my word and gone to the battlefront in Hamilton East and, lo 
and behold, my opponents are not there.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the finance minister, in the cosy comfort of this 
House, challenged me to meet him on the doorsteps of Hamilton 
East to talk about his broken GST promise. Where is he? Is the 
finance minister afraid to go door to door with me and defend his 
broken promise?
<P>
	I was on the doorsteps in Hamilton East last night, ready to go 
toe to toe with Sheila Copps but I did not see her, or any minister. Is 
she afraid? I will be there today and I will be there again tomorrow. 
I am looking forward to seeing them soon because, after all, there 
are only four days left until the vote.
<P>
	Is the justice minister afraid to defend the inept Young Offenders 
Act that I spoke about with young people last night? Is the Prime 
Minister afraid to defend his broken promises on the GST, 
immigration, child care, free trade and MP pensions?
<P>
	Once again I challenge the timid souls on the front benches here.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Douglas Kenny, who died last week, was a respected professor of 
psychology who became president of the University of British 
Columbia in the stormy years after 1968 when universities were 
torn apart by larger community demands for fundamental change in 
institutions and structures, and for radically new approaches to 
learning.
<P>
	As a pragmatic scholar, Dr. Kenny sought accommodation 
between the warring factions operating inside and outside the 
university. He also actively promoted international recognition of 
the University of British Columbia as a world leader in science, 
medicine and other disciplines.
<P>
	His epitaph may perhaps be found in Claude Bissell's phrase, 
borrowed from Arnold Toynbee: ``Halfway up Parnassus''. Dr. 
Kenny showed the way, and it has been for his successors, David 
Strangway and others, to try to reach the top of the mountain.

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last Wednesday, Micheline Paradis, a lawyer from the 
Lac-Saint-Jean riding, was appointed to the Quebec Court.
<P>
	She is the first woman judge in that region's 160-year history. 
When she began her career some 20 years ago, there were 
practically no female lawyers in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region.
<P>
	Today, over 50 per cent of the members of the regional bar 
association are women. This appointment opens another door and 
represents another step toward equality between men and women, 
thus enhancing Quebec's judicial system and giving it even greater 
credibility.
<P>
	I am happy to congratulate Ms. Paradis on how far she has come 
and I wish her the best of luck in her new career.

finished celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end of the second 
world war and people around the world thanked our vets for the 
freedom we all enjoy today.
<P>
	The Ridgewood veterans wing in Saint John is operated under 
the jurisdiction of the McKenna government and receives a grant 
from Veterans Affairs to operate. The McKenna government has 
decided to introduce rethermalized food for the vets. The meals are 
prepared in Toronto. Even the toast, bacon and eggs are shipped 
down frozen to Saint John and reheated.
<P>
	This process has been tried in other local hospitals in Saint John 
and has had terrible reviews from the patients, the doctors and 
other staff.
<P>
	The Legion is outraged that these veterans will be used as guinea 
pigs. Veterans Affairs has prided itself in the past on the 
humanitarian treatment of veterans.
<P>
	The present on-site food preparation is very good. For the sake 
of our veterans' health, dignity and quality of life, I ask the 
Secretary of State for Veterans Affairs to stop these unnecessary 
changes.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few weeks ago the Quebec government announced it 
would cut student aid for undergrad study  outside the province. 
Quebec will no longer offer loans to most CEGEP and undergrad 
university students who want to study in English in another 
province.
<P>
	This policy is discriminatory, unfair and totally unacceptable. 
Ottawa helps fund student aid in Quebec. In 1996, federal transfers 
will amount to $98 million.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development said he will 
investigate this matter to see what can be done to reverse the 
decision by Quebec. I urge him to act on this quickly since many 
Quebec students who study elsewhere are now scrambling to find 
other sources of funding. As an alternative I suggest that the 
minister allow Quebec residents who lose their loans to apply 
under the Canada student loans program in the provinces where 
they study.
<P>
	The Quebec policy should not be allowed to remain. It has no 
place in a fair, diverse and democratic society.

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the linguistic debate heats up once again in Quebec, we 
in this House are faced every day with the sorry spectacle of two 
regional political formations competing for the linguistic 
intolerance award.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois and its twin, the Reform Party, are unable to 
rally all Canadians around a common project. Both of them would 
rather try to destroy what they know they cannot control.
<P>
	In his latest report, the Commissioner of Official Languages 
draws an objective portrait of the linguistic reality. The situation in 
this country has greatly improved since the Official Languages Act 
was passed. Attitudes have also started to change for the better.
<P>
	I hope the commissioner's message will be heard and that the 
extremist attitudes of the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party 
will start to evolve.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given that, in Ontario, the rate of assimilation of francophones is in 
excess of 36 per cent and that francophones are still not allowed to 
run their own schools, given that Conservative Premier Harris is 
blithely chopping Franco-Ontarian organizations and that English 
is in fact the language of work in the public service in Ottawa, I 
would have thought that the primary duty of any Franco-Ontarian 
MP would be to look after the interests of his own constituents. But 
that is not what is happening.
<P>
	I may be naive but I think the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier 
is forgetting his primary duty to launch a crusade against the 
Quebec referendum act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	In other words, instead of opposing cuts imposed on

which are among the most democratic in the world.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the governments 
of the world, including Canada, have made strong representations 
to the Government of Nigeria to stop its alleged human rights 
abuses. The desire for peaceful, democratic change has been 
widely promoted.
<P>
	We have been making statements and innuendoes that something 
should be done. To this point these statements have had little or no 
effect on the Nigerian government.
<P>
	The minister is well aware that the imposition of sanctions and 
the boycotting of Nigerian oil would have little hope of success. If 
they did work, it would take a great deal of time.
<P>
	We encourage the Minister of Foreign Affairs to not only push 
for more rapid and concrete action against Nigeria but to consider 
demanding the outright removal of Nigeria from the 
Commonwealth until it improves its human rights record.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, major 
newspapers were reporting this morning that, next September, the 
``Team Quebec'' trade mission to South America will be led by 
Bernard Landry, the PQ finance minister and minister responsible 
for economic development.
<P>
	This is great news and we are pleased to see that the PQ 
government finally decided to follow in the footsteps of Team 
Canada. It is somewhat unfortunate however that, for the sake of 
political rhetoric, members of the PQ government made the 
deliberate choice of ignoring previous economic missions led by 
our Prime Minister.
<P>
	All economic stakeholders agree that Canada's prosperity is 
dependent upon its capacity to expand its export markets. Through 
this decision, the Quebec government is sending investors and 
financial markets a positive message.
<P>
	We wish every success to this Team Quebec mission and to its 
leader, who, this time, will have an opportunity to trade the

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
chief electoral officer of Quebec has now charged 50 students at 
Bishop's University with voting illegally in the referendum. Their 
fine is $500 for showing a commitment to their province of 
residence and to their democratic duty as citizens to vote.
<P>
	What is the fine for those who illegally discarded ballots, 
depriving citizens of the right to vote? One hundred dollars.
<P>
	These students turned to their member of Parliament to help 
them. And what did the member for Sherbrooke, the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, the erstwhile defender of 
federalism, have to say? He could not help them because it was a 
provincial matter.
<P>
	People have fought and died for the right to vote in this country. 
Taking away that democratic right only merits a fine of $100. 
Exercising one's responsibility as a citizen costs $500. Is this the 
democracy of the separatists?

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on June 15, 1996, the Bloc Quebecois will celebrate its 
fifth anniversary. Indeed, it was on June 15, 1991, that Lucien 
Bouchard, along with a few other members of Parliament, founded 
our party, which now has 131,250 members.
<P>
	At the time, the Conservatives, the Liberals and the New 
Democrats tried, with a rare show of unanimity, to muzzle the nine 
Bloc Quebecois members and to silence Quebec's claims and 
aspirations. It turned out to be a bad mistake on their part since, on 
October 25, 1993, 1,846,024 Quebecers elected 54 sovereignists 
members of Parliament. To top it all, the Bloc Quebecois became 
the official opposition.
<P>
	Quebec has a strong voice in Ottawa to defend its interests and to 
promote sovereignty. This shows unequivocally that Quebec chose 
to stand up for itself.
<P>
	It is with pride that we wish all Bloc Quebecois members a very 
exciting anniversary, and we invite them to join us in Sorel, on June 
15, to celebrate with us.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of

federal government stand up and protect the rights of victims from 
violent young offenders.
<P>
	It was only a few weeks ago that young offenders hijacked a 
school bus in my riding and threatened the lives of young students. 
This week another case of a young offender threatens some people 
in my riding.
<P>
	Three years ago a young offender was convicted in the 
unprovoked shooting murder of 63-year old Edward Francis 
McDermott. He was convicted under the Young Offenders Act and 
sentenced to the maximum sentence, a ridiculous three years. The 
murderer is set to be released and four psychiatrists have testified 
that he is too dangerous to go back on the streets. The murderer is 
being described as a psychological time bomb. Crown counsel is 
trying to get around the Young Offenders Act to keep him in prison.
<P>
	Penticton crown counsel should not have to find a loophole in 
the Young Offenders Act to protect society from violent young 
offenders. The Liberal government should act to make our streets, 
homes and playgrounds safe. So far it has failed.

	Such a statement is an affront to Newfoundlanders and it

Newfoundland is an equal partner in this nation. There is no

the leading role for itself in a whole series of sectors, so it can set 
broad standards and objectives, and giving the provinces a 
supporting role, that is, the role of administrator?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to tell you that this is the most pithy answer we 
have had from this minister. May he always be so concise.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said the following 
with respect to the federal proposal on unemployment insurance:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This offer was acclaimed everywhere in Quebec as a great step forward, if not 
the finishing line for a concrete solution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Are we to understand from what the minister said that the federal 
proposal in the area of manpower is not a starting point for 
negotiations, but, rather the finishing line?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental  Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a framework where each province will be able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3709"> 3709 </A></B>
<P>
exercise the responsibilities it wishes and where the Government of 
Canada will have its own responsibilities on this Canada-wide 
issue. Whether it involves ensuring a movement of workers within 
the country or whether it involves ensuring the various 
governments help each other in situations of exceptional crisis, the 
Government of Canada has its own particular responsibilities.
<P>
	This is why Quebecers who believe in Canada have said that the 
minister set a very good policy, and only those who do not believe 
in it are continuing to fight it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will note that the level of obscurity increases with the 
number of words: the more he talks, the less we understand.
<P>
	Can the minister deny that the attempt to set up a model where 
the federal government would establish standards and keep control 
and have the provinces carry out the programs is not a sort of back 
door revival of the spirit of the Charlottetown accord, which 
Quebec rejected for one reason and the rest of Canada for the very 
opposite reason?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I invite the Leader of the Opposition to make a bit of 
an effort. What we are saying is quite simple. We can keep on 
repeating it.
<P>
	We have the most decentralized federation there is. The 
Government of Quebec has certain responsibilities. It has a hard 
time assuming them all the time, and we are offering government 
assistance to ensure that this responsibility is carried out as well as 
possible. We have responsibilities as the Government of Canada 
and we are assuming them together with the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>

	We are going to improve things in various sectors, be it 
manpower training, mining, forestry, recreation, public housing, 
tourism, the environment, freshwater habitats, etc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday in this House, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If it is only a matter of transferring funds with no strings attached, then they will 
have to speak to someone other than me, because I am not in the habit of sending 
money anywhere without making sure the interests of Canadian taxpayers are 
protected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Are we to understand from what his colleague, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, says that the government does not 
trust the provinces to administer the taxpayers' money in areas 
which are exclusively a provincial jurisdiction, and furthermore 
has no intention of withdrawing from any areas except those  in 
which it does not have even a cent of financial involvement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I assume that my hon. colleague, the hon. member, is 
aware that the unemployment insurance fund, as it used to be 
known, is financed by all Canadians. Money is transferred from 
certain provinces to others. The Government of Canada has the 
responsibility of ensuring that these moneys are administered 
responsibly.
<P>
	Moreover, the provinces are responsible for education, which is 
rather closely related to occupational training. It is, therefore, all 
these constitutional responsibilities which the Government of 
Canada, in conjunction with the provinces, will be better assuming, 
thank to the reform proposed by the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I trust that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will educate his colleague, for he is barking up the 
wrong tree, absolutely.
<P>
	With the statements made by the minister yesterday, is the 
government telling us that, when it is announced that the federal 
government is pulling out of some area of exclusively provincial 
jurisdiction, this will be only under its conditions, with the 
provinces having no say in the matter whatsoever?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member trying to say that unemployment 
insurance is not a federal responsibility? If so, he had better take a 
refresher course on the Constitution.

to discuss the Constitution at the first ministers conference in June. 
Now, a week later, the Prime Minister is insisting that the 
constitutional amending formula be on the agenda at that

him change his mind?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

being confirmed in his position.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It was a very good weekend

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3710"> 3710 </A></B>
<P>
	I did not change my mind. If the hon. member would listen to 
the whole meeting with the press, Mr. Bouchard said himself:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``I am downplaying it a bit, because the Prime Minister says he 
will perhaps want to touch very briefly on the question of 
constitutional review, section 49 of the Constitution, but I 
understood that the Prime Minister would not spend a lot of time on 
it in any event''.
<P>
	I did not change my mind.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I said that we were to discuss section 49. As to how long we will 
take to discuss section 49, I say an hour.
<P>
	The premier of Quebec told me that he does not want to talk 
about it and he does not want me to help with a veto for Quebec. 
Since we need unanimity, if one of the participants says no, the 
meeting will be very short.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> They said no in Charlottetown.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes. But I am for a veto for 
Quebec. I hope the Reform Party will be too. If the premier of 
Quebec is not interested in that, the meeting will be short because 
of Mr. Bouchard's desire not to get Quebec a veto from the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we could follow the logic in that answer, the Prime 
Minister appears to be arguing that section 49 of the Constitution 
requires this first ministers conference to discuss the amending 
formula. But there have been at least three major first ministers 
conferences at which the constitutional amending formula was 
discussed: the two Meech Lake discussions and the full-blown first 
ministers conference with respect to the Charlottetown accord in 
1992.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister insist that another meeting is 
required to discuss the constitutional amending formula when these 
three previous meetings satisfy that requirement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a debate about whether or not it was done in the 
proper framework.
<P>
	If in reality we have talked two or three times about it, I do not 
think it will hurt to talk a fourth time. It will mean that we have met 
the requirements of the Constitution four times. Nobody will be in 
a position to say that we did not want to meet the obligations of 
section 49 if, according to the Reform Party leader, we will have 
talked about it four times while the Constitution requires only one 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Charlottetown accord discussions of the amending 
formula went on for several days. They were  preceded by 
consultations by officials. They resulted in formal proposals to 
amend the amending formula which were agreed to by 10 
provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	If that did not satisfy the section 49 requirement, what is it that 
makes the Prime Minister think a half hour discussion at this 
conference in June will satisfy that requirement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just explained that a lot of people including some 
lawyers have said there is a very specific need to have a meeting on 
it and we have called a meeting. In the agenda we stated clearly 
section 49 of the Constitution passed in 1982. We are officially 
meeting this requirement.
<P>
	Some would argue that we do not need to do it. I want to be on 
the safe side. I am respecting the Constitution and I am being 
extremely prudent. That is why people vote for my party.

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Last April 9, PACCAR announced that it was closing the 
Kenworth plant in Sainte-Thérèse, and this was confirmed in a 
letter that day to plant employees and the Quebec Minister of 
Labour. But yesterday the Department of Human Resources 
Development was still refusing to pay unemployment insurance 
benefits to laid off employees.
<P>
	Does the minister find it acceptable that his department is 
depriving over 700 people of unemployment insurance benefits, 
when it is clear that PACCAR announced the closure of the 
Kenworth plant on April 9, 1996?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the PACCAR issue is obviously 
a very difficult situation for workers and their families. I think we 
shared the hope of the hon. member and of many colleagues in this 
House that, perhaps, with the help of the Government of Quebec 
and the participation of the Government of Canada, together with 
employees and company directors, we could find a solution.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	It is true that the closure was announced, but there was also a 
strike. In addition, there was also this hope that the industry could 
be started up again.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member today that it is with great regret that 
we see that it is finally true that PACCAR, as we knew it, is closed. 
As I said, it is a source of great regret, because we had always 
hoped that the industry could be started up again. Just today, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3711"> 3711 </A></B>
<P>
fact, we have finally decided to accept the fact that the industry has 
closed its doors and that these people will be eligible for 
unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are talking about 700 people without resources for two 
months. It is my understanding that the minister recognizes that 
these people are now entitled to unemplyment insurance benefits.
<P>
	Can he guarantee us that he will do everything in his power to 
speed up the payment process, now that they are entitled to these 
benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are aware of course of the 
needs of these individuals and of their families. We have been 
following the situation closely. If we had accepted the fact that the 
plant had closed and that there was no possibility of starting it up 
again, I think that would not have been well received by most 
stakeholders.
<P>
	Today, however, as I said in my reply to the hon. member's 
question, we are accepting our responsibilities in this situation, 
because we recognize, as does the union, the company, and 
especially the workers, that the end has now come. We are going to 
do everything we can to try to help these employees, who have 
been going through some very rough times for quite a while now. 
We will do everything we can to try to help them as quickly as 
possible.

Canadians are really confused about the Airbus deal and whether 
there is something in the works behind the scenes to settle the $50 
million libel suit regarding Brian Mulroney out of court. CBC and 
its sources say yes. Government lawyers say no.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister what he thinks about this and 
what he has to say. Is there a deal in the works with Brian 
Mulroney? Yes or no? Has the federal government ever offered to 
settle this matter out of court? Yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the question of 
whether there is a deal in the offing is no.
<P>
	I cannot take responsibility for what the CBC may have reported, 
nor can I explain why it reported what it did. However, I can tell the 
House in response to the hon. member's question that so far as I am 
aware there is no settlement imminent. Indeed, there is no concrete 
proposal on the table to settle it.
<P>
	I remind the House that this litigation was commenced by the 
plaintiff. It is up to the plaintiff, if he chooses to do so, to instruct 
his solicitors to bring a proposal forward. That is well within his 
authority and he may choose to do so.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
regarding ministerial accountability, it may be that the minister 
does not know of any concrete proposal on the table, but regarding 
what we hear on the news, there certainly are some questions about 
it.
<P>
	I understand the minister is busy with the Young Offenders Act, 
section 745 and the Airbus deal, but I am going to ask him again.
<P>
	Contrary to what he is saying, that he knows there is no concrete 
proposal on the table, the Canadian taxpayer is going to have to pay 
the bill on this regardless of what the price is. I ask the minister one 
more time: Where is the cash going to come from when any 
settlement is ever arranged? Who is going to pay for the 
incompetence if there are federal bureaucrats involved and the 
justice minister's poor judgment on this? When is he going to 
accept ministerial responsibility?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, this is dealing with a matter which I 
believe is before the courts right now. Therefore, I do not know that 
the question is in order.
<P>
	The minister has not indicated whether or not he wants to 
answer. If the minister wishes to address himself to this problem, I 
will give him permission to do so.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the matter is before the courts, but 
the hon. member raises the question of whether discussions are 
under way for the payment of any money. I can tell the hon. 
member that no matter what may have been reported last night, 
there is no proposal, there is no settlement imminent and there is no 
discussion of payment of money.
<P>
	In the course of litigation-and I practised litigation law for 20 
years-the parties are always exchanging feelers and that is 
appropriate. However, as I said, the plaintiff started this lawsuit. If 
the plaintiff wants to instruct his lawyers to come to us with a 
proposal, it is within his authority to do so.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that there is no settlement imminent. 
That report to that extent was incorrect. There is no discussion at 
present of a settlement on those terms.

<P>
	CN employees responsible for repairing railroad track 
maintenance equipment at the Joffre station in Charny were told 
on Monday that their shop will be shut down. This means 100 or 
so jobs will be lost in Charny while the same number will be 
created in a shop in Winnipeg. By closing the only track 
maintenance equipment repair and overhaul facility in eastern 
Canada, CN could compromise the safety of rail transportation in 
the region.
<P>
	How can the minister give the people of Quebec the assurance 
that railroad tracks will remain safe when these tracks will now be 
maintained by a shop located in Winnipeg?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I was questioned last week about the changes made 
by VIA Rail, involving the transfer of 63 or 65 employees to 
Montreal, the hon. member did not raise concerns about the safety 
of the people in other parts of the country.
<P>
	The fact is that changes result from business decisions made by 
the major railway companies. We have a case here where my 
department is keeping a close eye on the safety issue. CN has an 
excellent safety reputation and record, and we at the department 
will continue to see to it that safety is not compromised by the way 
CN manages its operations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that the 
Minister of Transport realizes that what is at stake is rail safety in 
all of eastern Canada.
<P>
	Given that the minister has the duty, under the existing 
legislation, to ensure the safety of rail transportation, does he 
intend to impose a moratorium on the closure of the shop in 
Charny, pending an impact study by the National Transportation 
Agency?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is no. We have reviewed the situation from a 
safety point of view and our review has shown no increased risk. 
There is therefore no reason to try to reverse CN's decision.
<P>
	I should point out that CN is now a private company. It can make 
any business decision that fiscal reality dictates in order to 
streamline its activities. We do not have to review every business 
decision made by private companies.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
justice minister said that Bill C-45 will ensure that only the most 
appropriate and deserving cases are given consideration for early 
parole. In other words, the minister is creating categories of killers: 
good killers with special rights and bad killers without those rights.
<P>
	What is the difference between a good killer and a bad killer, one 
that is deserving of special rights and privileges over one that is 
not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first place we do not propose 
to repeal the section, as my hon. friend and his party would do, 
because we believe along with the vast majority of moderate 
Canadians that there is room for this in the law. We are not 
prepared to say that of the hundreds of people serving life for 
murder none of them should ever get the opportunity to come 
before a jury of peers from the community to ask for a shortening 
of the period.
<P>
	We have proposed a significant tightening of the section. We 
said for all those in prison now serving time for murder there will 
be a tight screening mechanism before they ever get to a jury. That 
screening mechanism means that only those cases where a judge 
says there is a reasonable prospect of success under the test in 
section 745 will ever get to a jury. We have also said that any such 
jury would have to be unanimous in shortening the period of parole 
and eligibility, whereas now it is only two-thirds.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest these measures will strengthen section 745, will 
improve it and will ensure that it is those exceptional cases of 
deserving applicants who get the remedy provided for.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the real 
penalty for multiple killers should be consecutive sentences. 
Clifford Olson should be serving 11 consecutive life sentences, not 
looking for early parole.
<P>
	This serial killer, Clifford Olson, and those who are in jail today 
will still have the right to apply to a superior court judge for a 
hearing under Bill C-45, and a jury hearing may be granted.
<P>
	Why has the justice minister not simply scrapped section 745 
instead of introducing a bill that still allows Clifford Olson and 
hundreds of other first degree murderers to apply for early release?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

passage of the bill we introduced yesterday, victims' families 
calling for the passage of the bill.

<P>
	Tomorrow, some 700 French-speaking employees of the CBC

As we know, these agreements are extremely important, as they 
drastically change the nature of labour relations at that corporation 
as a result of the Liberal cuts.
<P>
	Since the employer stated that francophones will have to read 
and vote in English, what does the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
intend to do to ensure that the CBC's francophone employees have 
access to a collective agreement in French before voting 
tomorrow?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and

Mr. Speaker, as the House knows, the CBC operates at arm's length 
from the government. Furthermore, I am well aware that the 
Commissioner of Official Languages has apprised the president of 
the CBC of the problem and that the president has given assurances 
he would take all necessary measures to comply with the law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
may I remind the minister that people will vote on the agreement

<P>
	Given her answer and the fact that the CBC's francophone 
employees do not have access to their collective agreement in 
French, that they must sign a petition and appeal to the 
Commissioner of Official Languages to get one, will the minister 
admit, without trying to dodge the issue, that this situation provides 
a concrete example of how Canada's francophones are indeed 
treated like second-class citizens?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday marked Environment Canada's silver 
anniversary, but it is safe to say the clouds hanging over the

<P>
	These last few years of pathetic federal-provincial relations 
concerning the environment and poor legislation, all courtesy of

putting the environment ahead of personal political gains?

welcomes the scrutiny of the Sierra Club and other environmental 
organizations.
<P>
	We have made advances on the environmental agenda. We have 
reintroduced a bill to ban MMT, something the Sierra Club 
supports. We have introduced tough regulations on new car 
emissions and we have created an environmental commissioner.
<P>
	We have important legislation that represents throne speech 
commitments that will address many of the concerns outlined in 
this report.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	From July 7 to 12, people from all over the world will meet in 
Vancouver to discuss AIDS. In Canada alone, it is estimated that 
15,000 people have AIDS, while about 50,000 more are HIV 
positive. Canada has had a national AIDS strategy since 1990. It 
has now reached phase II. However, the health minister has 
repeatedly refused to extend the strategy when it expires, in March 
1997.
<P>
	Given the imminence of the conference in Vancouver, will the 
Prime Minister use this opportunity to tell AIDS victims, 
community groups and members of the scientific community that 
there will be a phase III to the National AIDS Strategy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this issue has to do with next year's budget. The health 
and finance ministers will discuss it. I am not in a position to report 
on it at this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> No 
respect for the conference in Vancouver, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm, as he is being asked by his five 
major national partners on the AIDS issue, that the current funding 
for the strategy will be  maintained beyond 1997? This is important 
for AIDS victims.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the same answer applies for now. The issue is being 
reviewed. The Minister of Finance, along with each minister 
representing his or her respective interests, have discussions with 
the Department of Finance regarding the content of next year's 
budget.
<P>
	The budget is usually tabled in February. If an announcement is 
to be made before then, the concerned ministers will do so. I cannot 
answer the question right now, because it would be premature to do 
so.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the foreign affairs minister.
<P>
	The governments of the world, including Canada, have made 
strong representations to the Government of Nigeria about its 
alleged human rights abuses. The desire for peaceful, democratic 
changes has been widely promoted around the world. Can the 
minister tell the House the progress made in this area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the concern of the 
hon. member about the tragic and unacceptable developments 
taking place in Nigeria.
<P>
	The matter was first brought forward by the Prime Minister at 
the Commonwealth meetings over a year ago when he asked that 
Nigeria be suspended from the Commonwealth. Since then we have 
held a meeting of CMAG, the Commonwealth ministers advisory 
group, at which a decision was taken on a number of sanctions that 
could be applied. Those are now being presented to various 
Commonwealth members. We are also undertaking to talk to the 
Europeans and the Americans to see if they would share in 
applying a series of economic sanctions.
<P>
	I am hoping we will be able to get the full concurrence of the 
Commonwealth and these other partners so that we can make a 
very strong international statement that we will not accept the 
violations going on in Nigeria.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the minister 
whether he thinks it is time to stop threatening, talking and 
discussing sanctions and to start taking some real action by 
proposing that Nigeria be expelled from the Commonwealth until it 
is in a position to deal with this matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is presently suspended. I think it is the clear intention of

and initiatives will have the necessary impact.

	There will be a meeting with Chief Ikimi, the foreign affairs 
minister of Nigeria, in London next week, at which he will be 
presented with these alternatives. If the alternatives are not 
accepted and if we cannot get the kind of response and change we

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Recent American research shows that dioxins, which are cancer 
causing substances, are more dangerous to health than originally 
believed. In Canada safe dioxin exposure levels for humans have 
been under review for over a year.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House when he will inform the public of 
Health Canada's revised dioxin safety levels?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member will know exposure of 
Canadians to dioxins has declined over the last 20 years. This in 
part is the result of the effectiveness of controls that have been put 
in place to prohibit the creation of these unwanted substances.
<P>
	Health Canada, as all members in the House will acknowledge, 
has been reviewing all available information on dioxins, as have 
other countries such as Sweden, Germany and the United States. 
Canada's current guidelines are similar to all other countries with 
the possible exception of the United States.
<P>
	While we have no plans at this time to revise the guidelines, 
Health Canada will not hesitate to pursue any necessary additional 
measures if the dioxin data indicate we need to do so.

the insurance coverage for the contractor responsible for refloating

so several millions more will have to be spent.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans make a commitment 
before this House to claim the entire costs of this operation from 
those who are in reality the only ones responsible, that is to say the 
Irving Company?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
member would please answer the question. Page 22 of the red book 
said any changes to the GST would be revenue neutral. This clearly 
is not, since it will cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a 
year.
<P>
	Will the finance minister admit today that not only is he 
incapable of keeping his promise to abolish the GST, but that he has 
reneged on his page 22 promise of revenue neutrality. Is he not just 
like Sheila Copps?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, let the hon. member understand that on June 17 Sheila 
Copps will win an overwhelming majority.
<P>
	Second, let the hon. member understand that his own party 
talked about ripping the heck out of the GST and scrapping it. 
Then, when the finance committee came to me, his own party 
recommended harmonization. His own party recommended 
broadening the base. His own party has flip-flopped back and forth

reconsider his decision not to attend this very important 
conference, particularly in view of the letter which his own

``If you choose not to attend, Canadians and representatives from 
other countries will receive a signal that Canada is less than 
committed to fighting this disease''?

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order in regard to a motion I placed on the Order Paper. 
The motion is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, a message be sent to the Senate 
respectfully requesting a free conference with Their Honours to consider the 
issue of the relationship between the two Houses of Parliament with respect to 
the accountability process for the main estimates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	My point of order will address the issue of where the motion 
stands on the Order Paper. I do not feel it should be the subject of a 
private member's motion but a matter that can be moved under 
Routine Proceedings under Motions. I will also address the issue of 
the necessity of a procedure that has fallen into disuse.
<P>
	I understand that historically conferences with the Senate are to 
work out disagreements with respect to legislation. In fact it is part 
of the legislative process. However this is the first time that the 
Senate has been asked to account to this House for its spending. 
Consequently it is the first time there has been a disagreement or 
misunderstanding on how to proceed in this matter. There is no 
mechanism nor are there any references to meetings with the 
Senate on this issue. That is why a free conference may serve the 
purpose.
<P>
	As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, messages sent to the Senate are 
usually made under Motions. In addition there is the definition of 
section (p) of Standing Order 67 which describes motions that can 
be made under Routine Proceedings. These motions are for the 
maintenance of the House's authority and ``the management of its 
business''. My motion is such a motion.
<P>
	The estimates of the Senate are not an issue of ministerial 
responsibility, which I will explain further, but are a matter of the 
Senate as a whole and consequently a matter of this House as a 
whole. If this House needs to take action on such issues, then there 
should be a quick mechanism through which it can take that action.
<P>
	We need this conference to manage our business of supply and 
maintain the authority of the elected House. The deadline to deal 
with the estimates is June 21 or possibly earlier. We are under a 
deadline and we need to get together with the Senate soon.
<P>
	I refer you, Mr. Speaker, to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 
745 which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Either House may demand a conference-to communicate resolutions or 
addresses to which the concurrence of the other House is desired-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citation 746(3) states: ``The free conference is a meeting of 
managers attempting, by discussion, to effect an agreement 
between the two Houses''.
<P>
	Although citation 748 of Beauchesne's says that conferences 
between the two Houses are now obsolete, a motion for a free 
conference with the Senate is still on our books. It can be found in 
Standing Order 67(1)(h).
<P>
	Citation 750 of Beauchesne's makes a qualifying point:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While still theoretically possible under the Standing Orders, both the 
conference and the free conference have been effectively replaced by the 
exchange of Messages between the two Houses and the attendance of Ministers 
at the committees of both Houses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citation 751 goes even further:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What may be described as less open and ostensible means of communication 
arise from the fact that representatives of the government sit in both Houses, so 
that every public question is presented by the executive to both Houses-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I mentioned earlier, the matter of the estimates of the Senate 
is not a matter of the government. It is not the Leader of the 
Government in the Senate who is responsible. The responsibility 
lies with the Senate as a whole. It does not matter if ministers from 
this House attend Senate committees or that a minister sits in the 
other place.
<P>
	This is a unique situation. The arguments set out in citations 750 
and 751 do not apply because ministerial accountability does not 
apply in this case. The use of a free conference is therefore justified 
and suitable to this particular issue.
<P>
	Since it is a matter respecting the authority of the House or lack 
thereof to consider the management of its business, it is therefore a 
matter to be considered under Motions. I understand that it has 
been a long time since such a conference has been sought. However 
with respect to the relationship of the two Houses regarding the 
main estimates in modern times, it is fitting that an archaic rule 
will be necessary to attempt to bring the accountability practices of 
the Senate from the 1880s to the 1990s.
<P>
	In conclusion, I view this situation as a very serious one. Outside 
of voting down the funds of the Senate, we in this House are 
virtually powerless to do anything about the issue of the main 
estimates of the Senate.
<P>
	I would like to give this process another chance. We need to 
come to some agreement with the Senate so that the public can 
have confidence in this institution and the way it accounts for the 
spending of their money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address a few issues raised by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	I disagree with his interpretation of the rules whereby Standing 
Order 67(1)(h) could be used for such a purpose. I also believe that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3718"> 3718 </A></B>
<P>
his reading of Beauchesne is inaccurate, or at least the 
interpretation thereof is inaccurate. Let me deal with both issues.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Standing Order 67(1) refers to debatable motions. Standing 
Order 67(1)(h) refers to a conference with the Senate. That may be 
quite true. However, <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and 
Forms</I>, sixth edition, as my colleague across the way has just 
indicated, under the general rubric of conferences, it is referred to 
under the heading ``Intercourse Between the Two Houses''. 
Citation 743 reads in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When the House of Commons does not agree to the Senate amendments, it 
adopts a motion which states reasons for its disagreement. This is 
communicated to the Senate by written Message.</BLOCKQUOTE>
It then lists the steps that are to be followed following that kind of a 
disagreement on Senate amendments to a bill or a motion coming 
from the House. This of course has never occurred. Therefore, the 
prerequisite for invoking Standing Order 67(1)(h) that the hon. 
member brings to our attention has not, in my opinion, been 
satisfied.
<P>
	With respect to the calling of such a conference, citation 745 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Either House may demand a conference upon the following matters: to 
communicate resolutions or addresses to which the concurrence of the other 
House is desired; concerning the privileges of Parliament; to acquire or to 
communicate statements of facts on which bills have been passed by either 
House; to offer reasons for disagreeing to, or insisting on, amendments-</BLOCKQUOTE>
The House has not made that kind of determination to make the 
request to the other House. Therefore, that has not been satisfied 
either. That is citation 745 which follows citation 743 under the 
general rubric to which I referred.
<P>
	For all of these reasons the criteria have not been satisfied. There 
is absolutely no provision under which the standing order in 
question should be allowed, that is to say, a motion under Standing 
Order 67(1)(h), nor is the interpretation of citation 745(1) of 
Beauchesne accurate as presented to the House by our colleague 
across the way.
<P>
	It is quite true of course that this House can invite another House 
or a committee of another House for a review of whatever, 
presumably estimates and other things. If the House wants to do 
that-and I understand that such an invitation has been sent-that 
is one thing. However, the fact that such an invitation has been sent 
does not at all satisfy the prerequisite which I have just outlined. 
Therefore, I believe the hon. member's point of order should be 
rejected by the Chair.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, although we are dealing here with 
procedure, I wonder if the House would give its Speaker the time to 
get more information on the matter. In the first place, the point is 
well taken. I also accept the  other side of the argument which has 
been put forth by the government whip. I will look at this particular 
procedure and I will return to the House as soon as I can with a 
decision on this matter.

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the former member of Parliament for 
Kitchener, Joe Flynn.
<P>
	Joe Flynn died Monday morning in Kitchener. He served in the 
House between 1974 and 1979. He retired in 1979. After that, he 
took up a position on the Canadian Pension Commission where he 
served with distinction until 1984.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	Joe Flynn is remembered best as a son of Ireland. Joe talked 
endlessly about Irish tales, the Irish past and his own Irish heritage.
<P>
	He was born in Ireland in County Cork in 1921 and came to 
Canada in 1925. He came, like nearly all Irish immigrants, as a 
poor boy from a poor family. But as the greatest Irish poet of this 
century once wrote, ``but being poor I have only my dreams. I have 
spread my dreams under your feet''. Those dreams for the Flynn 
family led very far.
<P>
	The dreams that his parents spread out beneath the Flynn feet led 
one son to the House of Commons as the member for Kitchener and 
another son to the office of the chair of Metro Toronto and 
unfortunately to the Conservative Party. But Joe was the Liberal 
member for Kitchener with great pride between 1974 and 1979.
<P>
	In 1939 when war broke out, Joe Flynn joined His Majesty's 
Canadian Navy, with more emphasis on the Canadian than on His 
Majesty. He served with great courage during the second world 
war.
<P>
	In 1948 he came to Kitchener and raised his family in that city. 
His role in the community was notable. I list a few of his 
accomplishments, probably the major one being that he raised 
seven children in the city of Kitchener. Today several of his 
children occupy posts of considerable distinction.
<P>
	He was active in the Knights of Columbus, the Sales and Ad 
Club. He was the past president of the K-W Blue Line Club and the 
founding director of the Kitchener Rangers Hockey Club. Many of 
us who attended Rangers games remember Joe's booming voice 
when he sang with great pride O Canada. He was a founding 
member of St. Teresa's Catholic Church and at the House of 
Commons chaired the committee on veterans affairs.
<P>
	He was a model immigrant. He was a model resident of 
Kitchener. He was a wonderful member of this House.

moved for leave to introduce Bill C-302, an act to establish an oath 
of allegiance to the flag of Canada.
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, this legislation will adopt an official 
oath of allegiance to the flag of Canada. No such oath presently 
exists. The flag is an important symbol in our lives. We remember 
British fishing boats flying it in support of us. We look with pride 
when it is raised at the Olympics. We see it on the sleeve of our 
peacekeepers. It is a unifying symbol of respect and tolerance 
throughout Canada.
<P>
	The oath can be recited at school or before meetings, wherever 
the flag is prominent. The bill calls on a committee to consult with 
Canadians regarding the wording. As this will be an oath which 
will be used by Canadians, it is important that they participate in its 
wording. Canadians are proud of their flag and what it means to us 
and to the world.
<P>
	This legislation will give Canadians an official oath to 
acknowledge its importance in all of our lives.

	The bill will provide recognition of the importance of victims' 
rights in criminal law. It will achieve a greater balance between 
the rights of the victims and the rights of the accused and those 
who are convicted of crime.
<P>
	This bill works to protect the rights of victims and deals with 
restitution, the right to information and the right to be heard. We 
have a responsibility to the protection of victims' rights in this 
country. I call on all members to support this bill.

Code (aiding suicide).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I have the honour to introduce a bill 
that would amend the Criminal Code to allow people with terminal 
or incurable illnesses, who are often suffering terrible pain, anguish 
or indignity that cannot be relieved by palliative care, to seek the 
assistance of a physician to end their life at the time they choose.
<P>
	The current legislation, which dates back to 1892, can be 
extremely cruel to those who are dying and to their families and 
loved ones.
<P>
	Sue Rodriguez and Austin Bastable are two people who lived 
their lives and faced their deaths with great courage and dignity. 
They urged the Minister of Justice in their final days to introduce 
this legislation.
<P>

promised a free vote on this issue. I join with many Canadians in 
urging them to honour that promise.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-305, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (protection of children).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the purpose of the bill I am 
introducing today is to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code, 
the section that allows corporal punishment of children by 
parents and teachers.
<P>
	Condoning corporal punishment can lead to physical and 
psychological injury and even ultimately to the death of children. It 
contributes to violence in society and is contrary to both the charter 
of rights and freedoms and the UN Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.
<P>
	Section 43 allows punishment causing bruising and contusions. 
It allows children to be struck with belts and other objects. It is a 
relic of a bygone age and has no place in a democratic society that 
respects and values children.
<P>
	Finally, I would note that several European countries have ended 
the legal approval of corporal punishment with very significant, 
positive results. I urge the government to uphold the rights of 
children and repeal this harmful and discriminatory section of the 
Criminal Code of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill 306, an act respecting a national refugee awareness 
day.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I have the honour to table a bill 
establishing a national refugee awareness day on April 4 of each 
year. Because of my origins, this is something I hold dear. The 
Geneva Refugee Convention was signed in July 1951. It has been 
ratified by Canada.
<P>
	On April 4, 1985, the Supreme Court of Canada handed down its 
decision in the famous Singh case saying that the charter of rights 
and freedoms applied to refugees as well. This day will help make 
Canadians more aware of the often dramatic situation of refugees.

caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which 
has not been recognized for its value to society.

alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or impair one's

alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable by 
avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

<P>
	This petition asks Parliament to halt immediately all testing of 
explosives at the National Defence Proof and Experimental Test 
Establishment located at Nicolet-Sud in the riding of Richelieu. 
According to the petitioners, this testing is causing shock waves 
that are damaging to both property and people and therefore is

<P>
	The first is from residents of my riding of Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley. They are concerned that Parliament does 
not include among human rights a right to behaviour that is 
considered morally wrong, that marriage plays a pivotal and 
societal role in the stability of the family, and that any legislation 
such as Bill C-265 which might weaken the family unit is the 
antithesis of a sensible social policy.
<P>

upheaval that might be caused by its passage into law.

	The House resumed from June 11, 1996 consideration of Bill 
C-26, an act respecting the oceans of Canada, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee; and of motions in Group No. 11.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for Richelieu has the floor to conclude his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
around 9 o'clock last night, I received the unanimous consent of the 
House to complete my speech. As the Chair interrupted my speech 
at 9.30 p.m., I have the opportunity today to complete my speech 
on the motions in Group No. 11 put forward by the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I will not only conclude my speech, but also recap the reasons 
behind our amendments to this bill. The government seems 
uncomfortable with its bill, for it could not get any Liberal member 
yesterday to explain the relevance of these amendments and of the 
bill itself.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois reiterated the reasons behind its proposed 
amendments to this bill yesterday and we will do so again, 
forcefully, today. This hastily introduced bill does not meet the 
people's demands, the government's objective to cut spending, or 
users' expectations. Yet, users told the committee they were ready 
to share costs, provided this is done in a reasonable manner and 
they can specify what their needs are in relation to the fee structure, 
navigational aids on the St. Lawrence, as well as icebreaking and 
dredging.
<P>
	What hurts stakeholders is that the government based its bill on 
the IBI report, which in no way reflects the reality. All the 
witnesses who appeared before the committee said they were 
appalled to see that the government's hare-brained bill is based on 
that report.
<P>
	This unfair bill has been condemned not only by members of the 
opposition, and not for partisan purposes, but also, for logical 
reasons, by well-known associations that realize what a heavy price 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3725"> 3725 </A></B>
<P>
they will have  to pay, in economic terms. This could lead to 
enormous job losses along the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	This bill will result in unfair competition, making it impossible 
for us to compete with ports in Halifax and Philadelphia. The unfair 
fee structure will compromise any expansion plan for these 
businesses and even threaten their very existence.
<P>
	Speaking of the unfair fee structure, it is funny to hear the 
minister invoke fairness and the user-pay principle to justify the 
division of Canada into the three regions referred to in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	If we read this proposal, we notice that all the regions, and 
particularly those of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, will pay 
part of the marine services provided to Newfoundland, which 
happens to be the province of origin of the minister responsible.
<P>
	Ships going to Newfoundland will benefit from substantial 
rebates paid for in part by ships elsewhere. Moreover, according to 
the minister's policy, the port of Churchill, in Manitoba, would not 
have to pay for coast guard services.
<P>
	The bill creates a situation which could be described like this: 
``Look, since you are my friend, I will give you an exemption. This 
port is in my riding, so it will get an exemption. We are indebted to 
that region, so we will also give it an exemption''. And then: ``The 
coast guard is under the responsibility of the transport department, 
but it will be transferred to the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans''. And finally: ``You will have to pay for the costs related to 
the coast guard. Ports in the St. Lawrence will pay this amount, 
those in the second group will pay that amount, while those in the 
third group will pay that much'', without knowing the impact of all 
this on the companies using these services. The government does 
not even know about the impact. No economic impact studies or 
economic forecasting were done to see what kind of operating cost 
increase companies will face.
<P>
	This is what we object to, and we want the government to think 
things out thoroughly. After all, there is no urgency to establish a 
new policy which could greatly hurt the economy of a region, 
particularly Quebec. But the Liberal Party has a history of always 
targeting Quebec. Such is the story of the Liberals and their leader.
<P>
	If the government could not find a single person to speak in 
favour of its bill, it is because there is something wrong with it. It is 
because people, and particularly the 21 Liberal members from 
Quebec, know this is a terrible blow to all Quebec businesses that 
will be affected by these changes.
<P>
	The government cannot find a single speaker. Last night, we kept 
asking for a Liberal member to give us one reason why motions in 
Group No. 11 should be passed, in fact not only those motions, but 
all the other ones, the  bill itself. We were interested in the 
justification for the bill, but nobody wanted to explain it to us.
<P>
	I can understand why Liberal members would hide behind their 
desks and not want to comment on such an unacceptable bill. I can 
also understand that they would see this bill as breaking their 
promises, the promises in the red book. The bottom line is that they 
are ashamed to have to appear in the House to defend a bill like this 
one.
<P>
	This bill has been rejected by all the people directly affected by 
the amendments, in other words the users, and it has also been 
rejected by the general public, when they see how unfair it is for 
ports in the St. Lawrence. This unfairness will reduce, not to say 
eliminate, the competitiveness of affected businesses.
<P>
	We therefore say: Let us wait a few months, go back to 
committee and, instead of hiring a firm like IBI, whose report just 
went through the motions, make sure that users, all those who are 
affected or who believe in the survival of shipping, who believe in 
the development of ports along the St. Lawrence, who believe in a 
fairer distribution of costs, are consulted. We agree with the 
government that costs must be reduced, but why is this not done by 
charging according to dimensions and not tonnage, for instance?
<P>
	If we heard today that tariffs would be set according to the 
dimensions of vessels, all regions would be treated equitably. But 
no, the tariff goes by tonnage. Certain regions do mostly 
transhipment, while others are primarily unloading points. 
Adopting a different fee structure for every region would hurt and 
do a flagrant injustice to Quebec ports.
<P>
	In this regard, there is talk of going back to the table, looking at 
the issues and taking the time to think about them. If the 
government is so keen on seeing the bill passed at report stage 
today, it should at least have the decency to defer third reading until 
the fall.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	This would give users time to lobby the minister, to try to get 
him out of his office and convince him to change his decision. This 
would also give him the time to consult the members of his own 
party and to come back in the fall and say that, through certain 
procedures, the bill can be amended at third reading to make it 
more acceptable.
<P>
	This is quite simple. Like some of their Liberal colleagues, the 
members of our own party regularly refuse to come to the House to 
speak to this bill because they are so ashamed of it. Furthermore, 
what can we say once we realize the new fee structure is unfair to a 
given region of Canada? Since there are so many disputes, we 
should go back to the drawing board. Let us take this month to 
consider the issue more carefully, now that all the parties are aware 
of the problems, that the responsibilities for dredging, ice breaking 
operations and other fee-generating operations to be carried out on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3726"> 3726 </A></B>
<P>
the  St. Lawrence will be reassigned, that the costs will be shared 
by users.
<P>
	However, let us make sure that users will not be adversely 
affected and forced to declare bankruptcy, shut down their 
operations, or put projects on hold, as is the case for some 
companies in the Sorel area, such as Fagen, and also Richardson, 
the grain elevator company, which are greatly concerned that the 
new fee structure might affect their projects for the future. These 
companies were prepared to invest a lot in the Sorel region.
<P>
	I could also talk about my riding, in the region of Bécancour, 
which has the largest industrial park. A major dock, entirely built 
by Quebec and used by all the industries in Bécancour's industrial 
park, will be hard hit. This will hurt, among other things, major 
industrial development projects in that park.
<P>
	This fee structure could adversely affect one of the most 
important economic sectors in Canada and in Quebec, because of 
the minister's stubbornness. We say to the government: stop this 
stubbornness, postpone the adoption of this bill for a few months 
and listen, not to the official opposition or to the third party, but to 
those who are directly concerned.
<P>
	Let us have the committee accept briefs, submissions and 
claims, to help the minister make a better decision in the fall. This 
is what the official opposition is asking. We are not doing this to 
stall the government's bill, but because the witnesses heard by the 
committee said that something had to be done and that the famous 
IBI report should be ignored.
<P>
	I also read a release put out by the Montreal region, in addition to 
the one sent by the minister, saying that the city's economy might 
be significantly affected. It was not the Bloc Quebecois saying this. 
It was the president of the executive committee of the Conseil 
régional du développement de l'Île de Montréal, the president of 
the executive committee of the Montreal Urban Community, and 
Patrice Simard, president of the Metropolitan Montreal chamber of 
commerce. These are not sovereignists or members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. These are business people who want to work with the 
government to defray the cost of using the St. Lawrence Seaway, as 
well as look at the new fee structure and so on. They are prepared to 
pay, but they say that the government is on the wrong track.
<P>
	They sent official requests to the Canadian government and 
obtained the consensus of the shipping industry to submit this 
document to the government, which has turned a deaf ear and wants 
absolutely nothing to do with it. It is stubbornly going ahead with a 
bill that is not at all in the interest of those it claims it wants to 
protect.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	As for what is at stake for Quebec and for Montreal, this letter 
said: ``Shipping is a fundamental activity for the economy of 
Quebec. All port activities in Quebec will be affected by the 
proposed fee structure''. This was what Mr. Ménard, the minister 
responsible for Montreal Island, had to say.
<P>
	The port of Montreal handles 20 million tonnes of cargo per 
year. I said it yesterday and I say it again today, 726,000 containers 
go through the port each year. All this activity has created 14,000 
direct and indirect jobs, in addition to generating revenues of $1.2 
billion annually. Many industries in Quebec are dependent on this 
mode of supply.
<P>
	Furthermore, the port of Montreal is in stiff competition with 
ports on the eastern American seaboard. Fifty per cent of 
Montreal's container traffic has as either its point of origin or its 
destination the industrialized regions of the U.S., the Midwest, 
New York State, New England. Since 60 per cent of goods passing 
through the port of Montreal are then loaded onto rail cars to be 
shipped to various destinations across the continent, the minister's 
planned fees will also have a negative economic impact on 
Montreal's rail traffic. The Canadian government's projected 
charges are a threat to the port of Montreal's competitive position 
in the U.S. shipping market, as well as to the supply lines for 
Quebec industries.
<P>
	Such was the conclusion of the minister who joined forces with 
the group I have just referred to in criticizing the bill. It is not a 
member of the official opposition who is today asking the 
government to change its tune and not blow the shipping industry 
out of the water. Some 14,000 direct and indirect jobs in Montreal 
will be affected, not to mention those in all the ports along the St. 
Lawrence. They are the reason I am asking the minister on their 
behalf today to listen carefully to what I have to say.
<P>
	Yesterday, the House allowed me to speak longer in order to 
make the reasons for our actions clear to the government. I could 
repeat them here, since you offer me the opportunity and the time. 
The Bloc Quebecois has issued several press releases as a result of 
our consultations and the mail and phone input we have received. 
Our correspondents were asking the Bloc Quebecois to save them 
from this insensitive government. We have issued our press 
releases in order to make the minister aware of the situation. But 
since he continues to turn a deaf ear, now the press has got into the 
act.
<P>
	Look at what the business publication <I>Les affaires</I> used as a 
headline. This is not a Bloc Quebecois publication, a Parti 
Quebecois publication, a sovereignist publication. It chose as its 
headline: ``The fee scale proposed by the Coast Guard primarily 
penalizes the users of the St. Lawrence. The St. Lawrence shipping 
community sees this as a concession to the Halifax lobby''. This 
minister has been like a weather vane, letting himself be turned this 
way and that, first promising to protect this or that  port, and then 
blowing in still another direction when the west wants this or that 
port 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3727"> 3727 </A></B>
<P>
protected. Then he had to find the money, so he got the idea to raise 
the charges for Quebec ports.
<P>
	Its always the same, whether the government is Liberal or 
Conservative, the insensitivity to the Quebec reality is unchanged. 
It is worse when it is a Liberal government. Almost all of the harm 
done to Quebec by the federalist regime has had the Liberals 
behind it, the present leader of that party in particular.
<P>
	In this article, the journalist for <I>Les Affaires</I><B> </B>spoke of all the 
reactions along the North Shore, the economic threat, the costs 
industries would have to recover. Once again, we must quote the 
minister, for he ought to take heed and to defer the adoption of this 
bill on third reading at least until the fall, by which time he will 
have had the opportunity to find out more about the harmful effects 
of the bill.
<P>
	On Saturday, March 16, a headline in <I>La Presse</I> read: ``Maritime 
services: Quebec's bill goes up''. No one can say that <I>La Presse</I> is a 
Bloc Quebecois publication, an official opposition publication. It is 
the voice of Power Corporation, of the Liberals. Their very own 
paper is telling them that they are overdoing it in raising the 
charges to Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The columnist, Mr. Arcand, goes on to say: ``Each revision hits 
Quebec a little harder''. Quoting Mr. Massicotte, he gives 
examples of the charges proposed by the Coast Guard for 
maintaining navigational aids such as buoys, lighthouses, shipping 
control, radio beacons.
<P>
	The latest Coast Guard proposal, dated February 26, proposed a 
set rate for Canadian vessels of $3.40 per ton gross tonnage, or in 
other words per 100 cubic feet of cargo. With this proposal, the 
charge would rise to $4.48. A laker has a gross tonnage of 25,000, 
which would mean $112,000 per ship for navigation aids alone.
<P>
	With this amendment, one vessel alone would have to pay 
$112,000 more a year. Clearly things are unfair, costs are being 
allocated crazily. We must come back to reality and have this 
changed.
<P>
	``In the context of cut-throat competition with east coast 
American ports and even those of the Mississippi'', the journalist 
went on to say, ``many shipowners, exporters and importers fear 
that the St. Lawrence River is becoming too expensive. Montreal 
could lose a lot of traffic''. The cost will stop the ports from 
competing. And what will the ships do? They will head to 
Philadelphia and the east coast. This bill will harm industry in 
Quebec and Canada and will send it to the United States.
<P>
	This is perhaps what free trade is understood to be. This is not 
free trade was supposed to be, and we can talk about it. While they 
were in opposition, for eight years,  throughout the debate on free 
trade, even during the electoral campaign, the Liberals were tearing 
at their clothes in an expression of rejection. Once in office, they 
were the first to sign NAFTA.
<P>
	Yesterday, when the President of Mexico was praising free trade, 
the Prime Minister was applauding non stop. The Liberal Party has 
always been the party of double speak: one way for the electoral 
campaign and one for after their election.
<P>
	In another vein, <I>The Globe and Mail</I> said: ``Making deal to 
replace GST evading Ottawa''. Even that paper spoke of the 
injustice this bill creates. Raymond Giroux, a journalist for <I>Le 
Soleil</I> said: ``A gunboat on the St. Lawrence''. That says a 
mouthful.
<P>
	It is not a Bloc member who said that, but a journalist who has 
been following the economic situation for years, who has an in 
depth knowledge of this issue, who has consulted users, the public, 
read the documents submitted to the committee and heard the very 
accurate arguments presented by the critic for our party, the 
member for Gaspé.
<P>
	Our colleague from Gaspé too has conducted many 
consultations; in an attempt to get the government to see it was on 
the wrong track, he gave an exceptional speech when this bill was 
first introduced.
<P>
	I mentioned the member for Gaspé, but I should also talk about 
the fascinating speech the member for Trois-Rivières gave last 
night. As we know, he is a former industrial commissioner, a senior 
official in the Quebec government. Yesterday, in 10 minutes, my 
illustrious colleague from Trois-Rivières briefly summarized the 
problem in eloquent terms indeed. It seems to me that the few 
Liberal members who were here were amazed at the logic of his 
arguments since they were nodding in approval without even 
realizing it.
<P>
	As I was saying before, my illustrious colleague has spent many 
hours researching this subject. In Miami, they throw rats on the ice 
during hockey games; for our part, we are proud to have our own 
book worm, our expert in research, our friend from Trois-Rivières. 
He is so good that now our party's research branch consults him, 
not the other way around. That says a lot.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Yesterday, the member for Trois-Rivières pretty much covered 
all aspects of the problem in just a few minutes. I must also 
congratulate the member for Châteauguay who, after the member 
for Trois-Rivières, gave his own description from another angle, 
reviewing the issue from the Montreal point of view and explaining 
how terrible the impact of that bill would be for the Montreal 
region.
<P>
	We all know the numerous observations of the member for Lévis 
enlightened all members in the House; we hope they were also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3728"> 3728 </A></B>
<P>
useful for the minister and will  help him decide to postpone the 
passing of this bill for a few months.
<P>
	The member for Lévis spoke for several minutes after the 
brilliant performance of the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, and we had the impression that 
the government finally understood because no Liberal member 
asked to be heard. Not one member spoke in favour of the 
government's bill. The whip raised his arms to the sky and tried to 
convince a Liberal member to speak for the bill, but he found no 
one. Nobody dared to support that bill. This is very significant.
<P>
	When a government party cannot find a single speaker to support 
a bill in such a serious debate, at the end of a session when the 
hours are extended hours because the government said the matter 
was urgent, when not one government member will accept to work 
overtime to speak in favour of this supposedly urgent bill, then 
there is a problem. Not one speaker from the Liberal Party has risen 
in support of this bill.
<P>
	Of course, I understand them, they are ashamed. They are getting 
ready to end a difficult year, a year of shame, of broken promises, a 
year, in fact, in their party's image, a party that, during the election 
campaign, can promise anything, but once in power, forgets its 
promises and is content to encourage its buddies to make a few 
backstage deals.
<P>
	The former heritage minister was good at that; the defence 
minister, with a $150,000 contract given to a buddy, is good at that; 
the immigration minister, who uses his discretionary powers and 
signs as a priority documents allowing into Canada criminal 
immigrants who had been refused under the usual rules, is also 
good at that. So, this is a ``scheming'' government, a government 
unable to make the decisions that would satisfy the people as a 
whole and, in this case, users as a whole.
<P>
	Actually, this bill could go in the direction that all the people 
want, that is, cost reduction in all departments, but, at the same 
time, this reduction should not hinder industry, which creates jobs. 
As I said earlier, it is not a few jobs, but 14,000 jobs in the Montreal 
area that are affected.
<P>
	I talked earlier about the reporter from the newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> 
who wrote, and I will conclude here: ``Ottawa has managed until 
now to keep the lid on this volatile issue. The St. Lawrence River 
will come out a loser, unless premier Bouchard and the business 
community react strong and loud. Ottawa will not understand 
anything else''.
<P>
	This was not said by the Bloc or the Parti Québécois, but by a 
journalist at <I>Le Soleil</I>, who, after analyzing the situation, concluded 
it would be disastrous for the St. Lawrence if this bill was passed.
<P>
	I would like to have another hour to comment more fully on this 
bill, and my colleagues told me they, too, have more to say. I know 
the hon. member for Champlain, for example, a former 
businessman with experience in this area, could shed new light on 
this issue for the government. He has had frequent business 
dealings with St. Lawrence users. In that regard, this brilliant 
businessman and dedicated member for Champlain will have an 
opportunity later to speak to this bill.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	That is why I wish I had a few more hours, with the unanimous 
consent of the House, to explain things to the government and the 
minister, but I will conclude, to leave some time for the hon. 
members for Lévis, Trois-Rivières, Gaspé, Champlain, and other 
ridings to add their own voices, the voices of their regions and, in 
fact, the voice of common sense.
<P>
	In closing, I hope that, if the government stubbornly refuses to 
withdraw its amendments, it will at least have the decency and 
sensitivity to defer third reading until the fall. I challenge it to do 
that. You will then see all the lobbying that will be done to make it 
realize that this bill needs major amendments.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
resume this marathon debate which has already lasted three 
afternoons, 11 hours, 77 motions and as I recollect-my counting I 
think is accurate-11 orators in a row from the opposition party.
<P>
	There has been some comment made here on the absence of 
interventions but one should always remember that one gains 
nothing by iteration and reiteration if nothing new is said. When 
the debate opened on the first evening, I was very much taken by 
the witty and informative address of the hon. member for Chambly, 
by the vigorous imagination of the member for Gaspé, but I have to 
report, not in anger but with sadness, a certain decline in quality. 
That comes from repetition. It seemed to me that the ghosts who 
operate in this Chamber and outside may have become tired. 
Certainly by last night I felt tiredness had set in with the ghosts.
<P>
	I was hoping in the spirit of the first evening when the member 
for Chambly gave us as the sacerdos musarum, the carmina non 
prius audita, the new songs, new visions, new attitudes that 
something in the same vein would continue. Instead we have had 
Mount Pelion piled on Mount Ossa in the poet Flaccus' words, 
forgetting that it is not by the number of speeches, it is by the 
weight and content. In a certain sense we are returning again and 
again to the same themes. I see no particular point in adding to 
these labours of Sisyphus beyond saying that in the debate from 
now on, could we hope for something new, something rather 
exciting, something not very tiring?
<P>
	To comment specifically on Group No. 12 which has been put 
forward by the hon. member for Gaspé and which pertain to the fee 
setting provisions of the oceans act, Motion No. 76 modifies clause 
47 which provides the minister with the authority to fix fees for a 
service or use of a governmental facility provided under the oceans 
act. Motion No. 78 modifies clause 48 which provides the authority 
to fix fees in respect of products, rights and privileges provided 
under the oceans act. Motion No. 80 modifies clause 49, according 
to which the minister may set fees for regulatory processes or 
approval provided under this act.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	These motions would subject the ministerial fee setting authority 
to a condition outlined in Motion No. 82, namely that the House of 
Commons be required to adopt a resolution debated for three hours 
in its ordinary course of business before a fee could be fixed.
<P>
	This amendment in our view would clutter House business and 
cause delays and additional administrative processes when this 
government is committed to modernizing Parliament, to 
streamlining its internal processes. That would be a step backward.
<P>
	In any case, the intent of these motions is already addressed in 
existing governmental policy. There already exists a regulatory 
parliamentary review process. It is government policy to consult 
with affected users on any fees proposed. This serves to ensure the 
minister is in touch with the views of his clients.
<P>
	Clause 50 of the bill clearly describes the consultation 
requirements the minister must comply with before fixing a fee. 
The clause also provides for the referral of fiscal regulations to the 
Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations.
<P>
	Quite obviously Motions Nos. 76, 77, 78 and 80 serve no 
purpose and should be defeated.
<P>
	The last motion in this group, Motion No. 82, proposes to 
authorize the standing committee to make regulations relating to to 
the minister's powers to fix fees. I have already spoken of this 
neo-Montesquieuian confusion of powers when of course we 
respect the separation of powers as a basic issue of 
constitutionalism. Do not try to mix up legislative and executive 
powers unless you have a clear vision of where you are going. In 
this sense the motion is not well thought out and does not deserve 
support.
<P>
	Treasury Board is the central federal authority mandated to make 
regulations pertaining to fiscal issues. The board is there to ensure 
consistency and fairness in regulations such as those provided 
under the oceans act.
<P>
	The Bloc motion implies that Treasury Board is not ensuring this 
consistency and fairness and suggests the authority to make fiscal 
regulations should be exercised by a standing committee. This is 
entirely contrary to  government policy and established 
parliamentary practice. Indeed in its aspect of all power to the 
assembly, it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3730"> 3730 </A></B>
<P>
what we might refer to in our law schools as a Henry VIII clause. 
Need I say any more?
<P>
	All of the motions in this group should be defeated. The House is 
here to improve the quality of the legislation put before it, not to 
hinder the progress of government. I hope I have not spoken too 
long because I do not want to set a bad example for this House. 
Brevity is the art of wit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is always 
with pleasure that I rise to speak when the subject-matter of the bill 
under consideration is close to my heart. The hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra and parliamentary secretary, who knows the 
customs and practices of this House as well as I do, will have to 
graciously accept, as part of his parliamentary duties, the fact that 
the hon. member for Richelieu has decided to use not only all the 
time he was allotted, but time he was given by unanimous consent 
of this House. I think it is very good for parliamentary relations that 
the system allows this.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Parliamentary Secretary, how things work here-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Excuse me, 
you must always address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> I apologize, Madam Speaker. I was not 
trying to initiate a conversation between the parliamentary 
secretary and myself. The point I would like to put across, through 
the Chair, is that British parliamentary rules are such that the only 
way members of Parliament can express their views and make 
themselves heard of the government is through the procedures 
made available to them in Parliament. From time to time, our 
friends opposite may find their decisions are not approved as fast as 
they would like. What can I say? It goes with the territory.
<P>
	Now, coming back to Group No. 12. As the official opposition 
critic, the Bloc Quebecois critic on this matter, I would like to 
discuss the substance of the motions in Group No. 12. The 
substance is quite simple to understand.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I will not read them in full, but we are talking about five motions 
tabled by the Bloc. The gist of these motions is that, whenever the 
minister's power to fix fees is referred to in clauses 47, 48 and 49, 
the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, wants to promote 
transparency, as it has been its goal since the beginning of the 
proceedings at report stage of Bill C-26.
<P>
	Such transparency would be ensured by Motion No. 82, which 
reflects the other ones, and which provides, as regards the 
minister's power to fix fees:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-26 be amended by adding after line 35, on page 30, the following 
new Clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``49.1 The fixing of fees under sections 47, 48 and 49 is subject to adoption 
by the House of Commons of a resolution debated for three hours in the 
ordinary course of the business of the House.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of this motion is to promote transparency and to 
provide all elected members of the Canadian Parliament an 
opportunity to express themselves, regardless of their political 
affiliation. Such a procedure would only require one afternoon, in 
fact three hours. It would in no way delay any other decision which 
the minister may make.
<P>
	I hope it was not the minister's intention to fix these fees in 
secret. The minister must give members of this House the 
opportunity to express their views.
<P>
	We could discuss the issue for a long time, or we could, as the 
hon. member for Richelieu did on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, 
ask the government to postpone the bill at least until the fall, and to 
review its form as well as its content.
<P>
	My goal here is to get the message across. The spirit of the letter 
must be preserved. If we manage to do that, we will have fewer 
problems in administering the act afterwards. The hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra pointed it out to the Chair. The member for 
Gaspé is also trying to make the best of the situation by improving 
the bill, even thogh the Bloc Quebecois is devoted to sovereignty. 
But as long as we are a part of Canada, I will try to improve this 
bill, because it will apply to Quebecers too.
<P>
	Whatever the political suasion of people in my party or of 
Quebecers in general, I will do whatever I can to make laws of this 
Parliament easier to implement and to live with. I urge hon. 
members to read once more motion No. 82, which underlies all of 
this, and see for themselves that openness is our goal.
<P>
	I have even been generous enough to suggest a three-hour 
debate, which is really not long, you have to admit. It would be 
more of a technicality, but at least, the exercise would take place. 
Nobody in Canada could suggest that we have not given it a try. But 
time flies, and since a number of my colleagues would like to speak 
to Group No. 12, I will yield the floor to the next speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Minister of Fisheries has unilaterally decided to charge the 
shipping industry fees for Coast Guard services, including the 
provision of aids to navigation and ice breaking services. Clauses 
41, 47, and 52 of Bill C-26 give the minister the power to charge 
these fees.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Several amendments to these clauses were put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois for the following reasons: to make the fees 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3731"> 3731 </A></B>
<P>
principle more equitable and to force the  minister to co-operate 
with the industry and the provinces before fixing or increasing the 
fees. These changes would prevent the minister from making 
unilateral decisions without holding public consultations, as he has 
done for the fees he wants to charge as of June 1996.
<P>
	In fact, all the witnesses who appeared before the fisheries and 
oceans committee decried the decision making and consultation 
process of the Coast Guard, especially the fact that the minister 
went ahead with the fees without assessing the economic impact on 
the shipping industry and all the other industries that rely on 
shipping.
<P>
	Also, 75 per cent of the witnesses asked the minister for a 
moratorium on the fees until the impact studies ordered by the 
Department of Fisheries come out next fall. The witnesses also 
recommended that the minister cooperate with the shipping 
industry in carrying out economic impact studies. Lastly, the St. 
Lawrence River and Great Lakes stakeholders reached a clear 
consensus against the minister's proposal which they, along with 
the Ontario and Quebec governments, found unacceptable.
<P>
	Dismissing all these recommendations and objections, the 
minister is apparently determined to go ahead with this fee 
structure and does not care about its possibly devastating effect on 
jobs in the shipping industry, a very important sector of the Quebec 
economy.
<P>
	Moreover, several questions on the department's fee structure 
policy remain unanswered. First of all, this whole policy is based 
on the regionalization that divides Canada into three regions: the 
West, the East and the St. Lawrence region. This rather artificial 
division was advanced by the Coast Guard under pressure by the 
maritimes and the West. Each new proposal by the Coast Guard 
means higher fees for boats in the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes 
region.
<P>
	The minister mentioned fairness and the user-fee principle to 
justify this regional division. Yet, when we read the proposal, we 
see that all the regions and especially the St. Lawrence and Great 
Lakes area will pay part of the marine services to Newfoundland, 
which is the minister's province, since the boats that go there will 
get substantial reductions at the expense of boats in other regions. 
Moreover, according to the minister's policy, the port of Churchill, 
in Manitoba, will not have to pay for Coast Guard services.
<P>
	Another major problem is that the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes 
ports are increasingly less competitive than American ports. On the 
one hand, boats using the St. Lawrence Seaway to go to the United 
States without stopping at any Canadian port will not pay for Coast 
Guard services, thus greatly threatening the competitiveness of the 
St. Lawrence and Great Lakes ports.
<P>
	On the other, the user pay principle advocated by the minister is 
not respected in a number of instances, in particular for the ports of
<P>
Sept-Îles and Port-Cartier, which will pay up to $5 million annually 
for the use of a single buoy.
<P>
	Finally, the user fees the minister would like to impose are only 
the tip of the iceberg, since they only include navigational aids such 
as buoys, lighthouses, and so on. The other services the department 
intends to charge for are the dredging of Seaway harbours and ice 
breaking in waterways.
<P>
	These other fees may turn out to be much higher than those for 
navigational aids, and there is reason to be concerned about the 
survival and ability to compete of ports along the St. Lawrence, 
particularly the port of Montreal and a number of ports in the 
regions such as those of Matane, Rimouski and Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the effects of 
this fee structure in my riding, the riding of Champlain, on pleasure 
boats, pedal boats and other small craft. These should be exempt 
from this tax in disguise. The riding of Champlain abounds in 
hunting spots and lakes and is known as a tourist centre.
<P>
	This disguised tax, or user fee structure as the government calls 
it, will harm the tourist industry, which provides the riding with 
jobs it needs to survive. Imagine the impact of charging user fees 
for pleasure boats on the economy of a region such as mine. We do 
not yet have all the details, but there is talk of charging fees for 
pedal boats and sailboards. I do not know where they will hang the 
plates, but I am sure they will think of something.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	You can imagine what fees on rowboats and canoes will do to the 
tourist industry in my region. Small and medium sized businesses 
which depend on the rental of this kind of equipment during the 
summer season will have to pay these fees. Will they have to be 
paid annually, every five years, every four years or every three 
years? I do not yet know how it will work. We could have big 
surprises. Will these fees be progressive? All that to collect a few 
million dollars because the finance minister needs money. It is 
absolutely outrageous!
<P>
	And think about what it will cost to collect that money. How will 
the government find all the people who own a pedalboat, a 
sailboard, a rowboat or a canoe? It is practically impossible and 
unmanageable. Again, in the end, it will be the small and middle 
income people who will pay the bill, who will pay the price for the 
federal government's financial problems. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois and myself, who represent the riding of Champlain, will 
oppose Bill C-26.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3732"> 3732 </A></B>
<P>
follows: the hon. member for  Lévis-Quebec Bridge; the hon. 
member for Regina-Lumsden-Hollinger Inc.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, this bill is 
divided into three major sections. Part III, with which we are 
dealing now, describes the powers of the minister. The amendments 
in this group, and many of the amendments being proposed in other 
groupings dealing with part III, describe limits to the minister's 
power.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 76, 78, 80 and 82 limit the minister's power. These 
amendments state that any changes to the regulations with respect 
to fees or other parts of the bill must be debated in the House of 
Commons for three hours prior to being enforced or enacted.
<P>
	I cannot see any reason why the House would not support these 
amendments. I commend my friend, the hon. member for Gaspé, 
for moving them. When we seek to limit the power of government, 
we end up doing Canadians a service.
<P>
	I am not saying that the minister is not acting in good faith or not 
trying to do the best job he or she can, whoever the minister of the 
day is, but it is important that there are limitations on the minister's 
powers.
<P>
	In this case, if the minister chooses by regulation to increase or 
change the fee structure, it will be debated in the House for three 
hours. That will give Canadians and their representatives an 
opportunity to have some discussion before it takes place. Frankly, 
I cannot see any reason why the House would not support these 
amendments. Certainly Reform will be supporting them.
<P>
	Reform will not be supporting Motion No. 88 because it 
proposes that the standing committee would be the body to fix fees 
in the future. I do not have a great deal of parliamentary experience 
but I do not believe that standing committees are used in any other 
areas to fix fees. I do not believe it is appropriate for the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans to be fixing fees with respect 
to regulations in this legislation.
<P>
	It is appropriate for the standing committee to review changes to 
regulations. I am certainly in favour of having the fee regulation 
process opened up so that everybody can see how it works and 
provide their input prior to the changes being made.
<P>
	However, I do not see the standing committee being the body to 
actually draft the regulatory changes or make the changes to fee 
structures and so on in the future. I simply do not believe that the 
standing committee is the appropriate body to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak again in this debate, this time on the 
motions in Group No. 12.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	But before I go any further, with your permission, Madam 
Speaker, I would like to pay special tribute to our venerable 
colleague, the member for Richelieu, who surpassed himself these 
past few hours, last night especially, when he made an improvised 
speech that lasted a good half hour and in which he succeeded in 
casting the government in a bad light and in forcing it to think. The 
few members who were around, even those in the government 
members' lobby, heard the relevant and judicious speech delivered 
by our colleague.
<P>
	We saw how his experience as a former Conservative member 
served him well because he knows the rules of procedure. We saw 
how generous the member for Richelieu is, deep down inside, 
because he succeeded in rallying all the members present, as well 
as all those representing the region that will be affected by the bill. 
This man is really a natural leader.
<P>
	I would now like to recall the principal points of the speech I 
made last night in the House. First, the whole process by which the 
government presented this bill is questionable, very negative and 
lacks transparency, starting with the study made by a private firm 
called IBI, study that was denounced and ridiculed by all kinds of 
experts, all interested parties and all stakeholders. As I mentioned 
yesterday, one witness who appeared before the committee went as 
far as to say that this report was not worth the paper it was written 
on, which says a lot.
<P>
	It is all the more serious not only because the report was paid for 
by the public purse, but also because this document that is not 
recognized by the people involved forms the basis of the minister's 
rationale for implementing these fees. So if we want a healthy 
debate where everybody agrees on the general parameters, we are 
off to a very bad start. We do not have this basis for discussion 
since the document in question is not recognized by the people 
involved.
<P>
	Then, under pressure from the official opposition, the fisheries 
and oceans committee heard witnesses. There again we saw the 
same attitude on the part of the government, an attitude of non 
transparency, of narrowmindedness, a kind of military attitude in 
some way-it is understandable-from the commissioner to the 
minister, who both happen to have the same profile. It is an attitude 
of non openness to the very sensible and very sincere arguments 
presented by witnesses who came maybe not to talk about their 
survival, but about good management, in the public interest.
<P>
	Unfortunately, our colleagues opposite did not listen seriously to 
the evidence presented to them and made absolutely no effort to 
follow up on it. There was a huge gap between the comments made 
by the commissioner of the coast guard, our first witness-I sat on 
this committee as an associate member-and the comments made 
by the other witnesses, the users, who came to criticize the 
commissioner's position and to tell us how  they perceived the 
situation and how they intended to co-operate. In point of fact, by 
this operation, the government is trying to get money from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3733"> 3733 </A></B>
<P>
users-though we do not know at what cost and what the impact it 
will have-to the tune of $160 million by the year 2000, in four 
years.
<P>
	Witnesses mentioned three major grievances concerning the 
approach adopted by the government and it is obvious users are 
also upset for three basic reasons. First, no impact study was done 
to evaluate the impact of the fee structure although several 
witnesses talked about the potentially destructive effects of this 
new fee structure. Secondly, no detailed description has been given 
of services actually provided by the Coast Guard to users, despite 
the fact that the term user-payer is used. The government wants 
them to pay because they use services but there is not precise 
description of those services. I find that approach a bit clumsy and 
arrogant. If they said: ``From now on, you will have to pay a 
precise fee for such and such a service'', that could facilitate a 
positive dialogue between the parties. Instead, people are plainly 
told they are getting a service for which they will have to pay a 
given amount.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Finally, despite what users wanted, the Coast Guard made no 
effort, in their opinion-and this is the third complaint-to 
streamline its operations. This would have reduced potential costs 
to users all the more. These then are three aspects of the debate to 
bear in mind, because they illustrate the almost extemporaneous 
and extremely arbitrary position taken by the government in this 
matter.
<P>
	Yesterday, I related a number of distressing facts, but I would 
like to carry on in this debate. It was said, among other things, that 
Canada is being arbitrarily divided into three regions with different 
rates for each: the west, the centre-Quebec and the Great 
Lakes-and the maritimes. Three different rates for three different 
regions, to the great chagrin of the federalist witnesses.
<P>
	We were told that for a 25,000 tonne vessel-as the member for 
Richelieu said earlier-with respect only to aids to 
navigation-buoys-the cost would be $112,000 a year. That is 
awful. Imagine the shipowner with 12 or 15 ships. He will have to 
pay $112,000 per ship just for aids to navigation, the least 
expensive of the three items, the others being ice breaking-the 
most expensive-and dredging-of both the St. Lawrence and 
approaches to harbours and wharves. That means $112,000 for a 
single 25,000 tonne vessel, just for aids to navigation.
<P>
	Another fact we should take into consideration is that a foreign 
vessel entering the largest inland waterway in the world-the St. 
Lawrence River-en route to an American port will pay nothing. 
There is no charge to such a vessel for aids to navigation and ice 
breaking, because it is not stopping in Canada, but going directly to 
the States. This will no doubt increase competition between 
American ports on the Great Lakes and the  ports along the St. 
Lawrence. There will therefore be no charge to foreign vessels 
heading directly to the United States.
<P>
	Another item that arose out of the committee's deliberations 
concerns ice breakers and ice. The fact is that, in the case of the 
ports along the North Shore, such as Baie-Comeau, Port-Cartier 
and Sept-Îles, there is no ice. There is no ice in Halifax, another 
major port, either. Except that user fees will be charged for 
ice-breakers in Port-Cartier, Sept-Îles and all along the North Shore 
whereas Halifax will not pay a cent for ice-breaking. Members 
must know that Halifax is the home port of the big ice-breakers that 
come all the way up to lake Saint-Pierre, where I come from, so the 
economic impact on the region will be dramatic.
<P>
	Finally, I want to say a few words about Trois-Rivières, in my 
riding. For the port of Trois-Rivières only, the new fee schedule 
will entail additional costs of $500,000 per year for navigational 
aids and buoys alone, not including ice-breaking and dredging. 
This is awful and unacceptable. Everybody will have to pay these 
new fees even though there was no debate.
<P>
	This measure is based on an accounting approach not even 
tempered by political sensibility and not taking socioeconomic 
consequences into account. We must put all our energies in 
denouncing such a politicy.
<P>
	Hopefully the government will come to its senses and postpone 
until the fall third reading of this bill to allow all stakeholders to 
make their opinion known once and for all, after having heard from 
the minister and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hopefully the minister and his whole department will bow to 
public pressure and come to their senses in the best interests of 
everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this is 
the third opportunity I have to address this bill and the amendments 
in Groups Nos. 11, 12 and 13.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Before beginning to seriously address this bill, I want to voice an 
objection against what the member for Vancouver Quadra said, 
despite the kind words he had for me. He said the last Bloc 
Quebecois speakers were running out of arguments. True, this is a 
political arena and we play the game. The member for Vancouver 
Quadra came to politics after an outstanding university career and 
he is fast learning the political role in this House.
<P>
	However, he must recognize that the role of MPs, especially 
those of the party I represent, is to express their views and that this 
role is inalienable. Members of the Bloc Quebecois, at the risk of 
repeating themselves, properly exercise their parliamentary right to 
speak. It is about the only thing we have here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3734"> 3734 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to point out to the member for Vancouver Quadra 
that we have been debating this bill, its inherent nature, for two 
days and that there are also Quebec members in his party. There 
are about 20 Liberal members from Quebec and they are absent 
from this debate. I do not mean they are not in the House. What 
I mean is they do not show any interest whatsoever in this debate. 
They are invisible on this matter. They are not taking to heart the 
interests of their constituents because they might be at odds with 
the national caucus of their party.
<P>
	This is not the first time. It has happened on several occasions. I 
remember when Ontario Liberal members tried to quash, annihilate 
and have declared ultra vires the regulations under the Drug Patent 
Act. Quebec Liberal members remained quiet then also so as not to 
go against the impressive representation of Ontario Liberal 
members which had won 98 seats out of 99.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of my colleague from 
Vancouver Quadra that Bloc members have not only the right but 
the duty to speak up on this bill, to take it completely apart to try to 
explain what is at stake to people who voted for the Bloc Quebecois 
but also-this is politics-to those who, in Quebec, voted for the 
Liberal Party, which is not doing a very good job at defending their 
interests in this matter. Of course, they would have to forget 
partisanship and realize what the dangers of this legislation are.
<P>
	The fees are arbitrary. The minister in charge, a former 
professional soldier, is the only one in his army who marches in 
step. He knows it all. He is the one who decides what is good for his 
government and his department.
<P>
	I will give you an example. Clauses 25 and 26 deal with 
regulations concerning fees and extraterritorial fishing zones. I 
would like the member for Gaspé, through you, Madam Speaker, to 
allow the member for Vancouver Quadra to listen to the important 
remarks I am going to make. I know you agree, Madam Speaker, 
since you are not saying anything. Silence gives consent. I assume 
you have recognized how right I am.
<P>
	All this to tell the member for Vancouver Quadra that when you 
write, in clause 25, ``The Governor in Council may, on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs-''
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	A little further it says: ``The governor in council may, on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans''. This 
may seem harmless. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, who 
is also an expert in administrative law, will understand that this 
would deprive the House of its only power in the decision to 
legislate or regulate.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra knows, the old 
wording was: ``The governor in council may, by  order'', that is to 
say, after the House of Commons has made a decision to that effect. 
But this government, as it is wont to do, is now trying to make the 
presence of members representing all the regions of Canada 
irrelevant, because bills like this one affect everybody.
<P>
	Therefore, if the minister can decide with his friends, in a Sparks 
Street restaurant, to regulate, to raise fees, to designate or eliminate 
an area, to redefine boundaries, he can do so. It used to be said that 
the only thing he could not do was to turn a man into a woman, but 
even that is possible today.
<P>
	Through you, Madam Speaker, and with all the respect I have for 
my colleague, I wish to say that the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra is nonetheless a not-so-young man-no offence-who has 
been left with the burden of defending this bill to save his Liberal 
friends and colleagues from Quebec, who are hiding behind the 
curtains or in the lobby on the other side.
<P>
	They have nothing to be proud of, unlike the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra, who, at his age, had the courage and the heart to 
stoically rise in this House to defend what I would not have 
defended, but at least he is doing so with conviction and 
intellectual honesty. Such is not the case for the Liberal members 
from Quebec.
<P>
	I would like him to suggest that his minister defer third reading 
of this bill until the fall and finally listen to reason and realize that 
this bill will have a disastrous, unspeakable impact on the Quebec 
economy, and on transport in particular.
<P>
	Are the senior members of the Liberal Party currently deciding 
to do to maritime transport what they did to rail transport, that is to 
say, deprive Quebec of most of its traffic, leaving only pleasure 
boats to sail without hindrance on the St. Lawrence? Did they 
decide to favour other means of heavy transport, even if this 
benefits our American friends' eastern ports? We have a right to 
ask this. I would like the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, in an 
ultimate effort to be fair and honest, to set the record straight and 
be fair to Quebecers in this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to add that I support the point the hon. member for Chambly made 
quite eloquently about the major impact this bill will have on 
Quebec in particular.
<P>
	Since the rules of this House do not allow us to speak of the 
absent, I am delighted to see that the minister responsible for 
Quebec is here. I think that references to someone's presence are 
allowed. At any rate, he is here and he has been all ears, especially 
since the remarks made by the last few speakers, including the very 
significant remarks made by the hon. member for Richelieu, have 
also attracted another minister from Quebec, I think.
<P>
	It seems that our efforts to catch the attention of ministers from 
Quebec through our arguments are  starting to pay off. Great. We 
commend them for being here and for listening to what we have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3735"> 3735 </A></B>
<P>
say. We must take advantage of their being here to go over the 
economic considerations coming into play.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Let me remind the House that the Minister of Finance told the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to come up with savings of $120 
million over four or five years.
<P>
	For this year alone, the finance minister's order is for $20 
million. What were the options? The minister first considered 
implementing a fee structure. I need not elaborate on this subject, 
as my colleagues discussed it at length, but I feel that there would 
be room for improvement and, if the Liberals agree to defer 
consideration of this bill at third reading until the fall, this might be 
a good time to invite suggestions.
<P>
	Here is what I have to suggest, in my personal capacity and as a 
member from the Quebec City area, after wondering if it would not 
be possible to further streamline coast guard services. Indeed, this 
is an option the administrator of the port in Trois-Rivières had 
come up with some time ago. He said: ``At present, all of eastern 
Canada is divided into three areas and administered by three 
separate regional directorates. Why not consider merging the three 
into a single regional directorate for the whole region? This would 
cut costs by at least $17 million, with $2 million in savings coming 
just from moving icebreakers from the maritimes to bases located 
closer areas where the Coast Guard operates''.
<P>
	It is surprising indeed that nine icebreakers are currently based 
in Halifax, when we know that the eastern coast of Nova Scotia is 
ice free year round. That is incredible. Icebreakers are based in 
locations where there is no ice. To break the ice in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence, they must travel 460 kilometres from their home base. 
Only four icebreakers are based in Quebec City's harbour. In 1993, 
there was an incident and it took more than five days for an 
icebreaker to travel to Lac Saint-Pierre, to break the ice that 
completely paralysed marine traffic.
<P>
	Since 85 per cent of the goods transiting through the Cabot Strait 
are headed for ports in the St. Lawrence, it would make sense to 
establish the regional centre in Quebec. A journalist recently said I 
wanted to have the centre in Saint-Romuald, in my riding. I am not 
asking for that much. I am not trying to convince the minister 
responsible, but the centre should at least be located in Quebec, in 
the most appropriate location, since that is where icebreakers are 
needed, in the St. Lawrence River and in the gulf.
<P>
	There are other issues which come to mind. The <I>Louis S. 
Saint-Laurent</I>, an icebreaker, costs $56,500 a day. It is the most 
costly ship to operate in the whole coast guard fleet. If we stopped 
using it, we would save $12.4 million. Why are we making this 
request? It is because the <I>Louis  S. Saint-Laurent</I> has not been used 
to break the ice in the last five years. It was used for all sorts of 
other tasks. In other words, we were able to do without it.
<P>
	It comes down to one thing: Why would rescue operations not be 
taken over by others? The Auditor General of Canada tells us they 
could be taken over, for instance, by the Canadian Navy, since it 
already does rescue work. I am not saying the coast guard is not 
doing a good job in Quebec, quite the contrary. However, since we 
must streamline operations, we should, instead of increasing fees, 
better integrate these services.
<P>
	I know that other members wish to speak on Group No. 13.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Since there is only a half hour left to discuss this group, I will 
conclude by paying tribute to the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra and by asking the Secretary of State responsible for Quebec 
to use his influence within the Liberal caucus, so that third reading 
be postponed until the fall to allow the various stakeholders to 
make suggestions.

Motions Nos. 76 and 88 in Group No. 12 are deemed to have been

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
rise again on what looks like the end of our odyssey. We have had a 
good debate. I appreciated the last several interventions from the 
Bloc with wit and brevity which, as we have said, is a delightful 
fact in a debate on a hot, muggy Ottawa afternoon.
<P>
	The suggestions made in the debate have been valuable. I have 
listened and I have heard what has been said. There is a distinction 
between those two phrases. It is part of the government's attitude to 
respect parliamentary debates and to acquire wisdom from the 
process of give and take. On that basis we can certainly look 
forward to a valuable third reading.
<P>
	I have to make some comments on the motions as presented 
which are without prejudice to positions I might take on third 
reading.
<P>
	In the atmosphere of goodwill that attends us in the twilight 
hours of this debate I hate to say that Motion No. 77 would create 
an administrative nightmare and an expensive one at that. It would 
obligate the minister to calculate the costs of the facility or service 
for each beneficiary on a sector specific basis. It would provide an 
administrative, expensive, time consuming need to calculate cost 
per individual user. It would rigidly and arbitrarily preclude the 
minister from choosing any other  fee implementation scheme, 
even if it were preferred by the beneficiaries.
<P>
	The government feels this would not meet favourably with the 
many Canadians who have expressed to us that they want to avoid 
excessive governmental regulation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3737"> 3737 </A></B>
<P>
	Motion No. 79 proposes the same thing. The minister has to 
calculate the cost of providing a protected right and privilege to 
each beneficiary on a sector specific basis. The government feels 
that would be impractical.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 81, technically we feel it is incorrect. 
Clause 49 refers to fees in respect of regulatory processes or 
approvals. The proposed amendment refers to the use of facility or 
service. Therefore, technically the motion is not relevant to the 
provision it seeks to modify.
<P>
	Motion No. 83 concerns clause 50 of the act which pertains to 
consultation and publication requirements. It would obligate the 
minister to consult with all beneficiaries before fixing a fee and to 
seek a recommendation from the Marine Advisory Board regarding 
the proposed fee. It would obligate consultation in perpetuity. We 
think it would be an administrative nightmare and on that basis we 
suggest against its adoption.
<P>
	Bloc Motion No. 84 deals with the same clause. It would 
obligate the minister to consult with the provinces before fixing a 
fee. We do not think the minister should be so obligated.
<P>
	Motion No. 85 deals with clause 50. We feel it again attempts to 
fetter the discretion of the minister.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 86 and 87 were put forward by the hon. member 
for Skeena who has made very thoughtful contributions to the 
parliamentary committee and in this debate. Motion No. 86 would 
allow any interested person the right to object within 30 days of 
publication. The minister must appoint an investigator. It would be 
a very heavy administrative burden with astronomical costs at a 
time when we are stressing economy: cutting back on big 
government and costs.
<P>
	The Canada Oceans Act is based on consultation, co-operation 
and partnership. It is in that spirit that we have approached it. We 
are therefore recommending that members reject Motions Nos. 77, 
79, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86 and 87.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We believe the act will provide the legislative foundation upon 
which federal, provincial and territorial governments can work in a 
full spirit of co-operative federalism, sharing in decision making 
on a basis of functional utility in the good interests of all 
Canadians. In recommending the rejection of these motions, 
nevertheless, I assure hon. members that I have benefited by their 
valuable contributions to the debate and that I will pass on their 
views to the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was a bit surprised that the government member spoke to 
our motions in this group before the Reform Party had spoken, but I 
am glad he did.
<P>
	I am very pleased to hear the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra 
thinks we should not consult with provinces like British Columbia 
that he is from. He thinks we should not have any obligation to talk 
to the various users and beneficiaries, for example the Marine 
Advisory Board. He thinks that we should not talk to any of these 
people, that it would be time consuming. He is right. It would be a 
total waste of time because clearly the minister of oceans does not 
listen to anybody anyway.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes in the user pay concept but it also 
believes in-and I think I have even heard a few Liberals use 
it-user pay, user say. That has not happened. Furthermore, it is 
abundantly clear from the words of the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra that they have no intention of changing their tune and 
giving the users any say or any input into the various fees and 
policies they come up with.
<P>
	I am not a regular member of the committee that dealt with the 
matter but I sat in on a lot of the meetings. It was pretty clear what 
was being said by the users the government was pretending to 
consult with. They understood the user pay concept, the need for 
them to pay for the services they used, and they are to do that. 
However first they wanted to make sure they were paying a 
reasonable amount for it. They had no idea of the true costs of the 
coast guard.
<P>
	They are prepared to pay for them but they should be 
implemented after an economic impact study to determine the real 
costs and how to bring them forward in a manner that does cripple 
the industry.
<P>
	I have risen in the House several times and referred to the 
minister as the minister of oceans. I specifically and intentionally 
leave off fisheries. It is not the minister himself, but certainly the 
department has all but destroyed the east coast fisheries and many 
species over the years. Now it is doing a hell of a job of doing the 
same thing on the west coast. If the bill were implemented in an 
irresponsible and improperly thought out and possibly premature 
manner, it would do the same thing to the oceans the minister's 
department has done to the fisheries.
<P>
	The Reform Party policy dealing with user pay has three basic 
concepts: first, the users should pay for what they use; second, they 
should only have to use those things they need; and, third, it should 
be on a commercially fair and reasonable basis.
<P>
	With regard to the coast guard, it has not opened its books. We 
do not even know if it keeps books, in the regular concept of it. We 
do not know if there somewhere sits a coast guard as a business 
with a ledger showing its expenses, its revenues, where it spends  
money, where its costs are, and what it is doing to control costs. 
There is none of that. Nobody has opened the books.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3738"> 3738 </A></B>
<P>
	The coast guard is saying: ``Trust us. There is a lot of costs out 
there and you should pay them''. Then it says: ``We are even going 
to be real fair in implementing this. We are only going to charge 
you 20 per cent so how can you possibly object?''
<P>
	If the 20 per cent represents 100 per cent or more of the 
reasonable costs of that portion of the service they are applying to 
cost recovery and to the marine users, perhaps they are paying too 
much.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	The coast guard says this is something the users should be able to 
absorb without any harm. The minister says that yes, a study is 
need but he has done one. He has consulted with the Mariport 
group which stated in a report that the users are going to be able to 
accept the impact of this with no harm.
<P>
	Why should we believe some of the other things we are being 
told if this is the justification the minister is using? The person 
from Mariport who did the report has recanted the entire report. 
The report found there would be no unbearable impact and that 
these costs could be absorbed based on the information the 
department supplied.
<P>
	The department changed all of the parameters after the report 
came in. The department told the consultant it was going to do this, 
this and this, (a), (b) and (c). On the basis of that the department 
wanted a study done to see if it was feasible and absorbable by the 
users. The department then turned around after the fact and said it 
was going to scrap (a), modify (b), double (c) and add (d), (e), (f) 
and (g). The consultant said they were now looking at fees that 
were four times as much as what they were led to believe would be 
imposed when they did the study. There is no credibility at all in the 
ministry or in the minister in the way these fees have been 
introduced.
<P>
	As far as an impact study, the minister has said there should be 
an economic impact study. That is a great idea. It is exactly what 
the users asked for so it seems they may be on line. The only 
problem is that the users said they needed to do an impact study to 
see how to implement this and the minister said something totally 
different. He said they were going to go ahead and implement it.
<P>
	The minister's own notes state that they know there will be 
damage and problems; they know there will be loss of business to 
American shippers which is going to cause problems. He stated 
they are going to wait and see what kind of devastation the bill does 
on the industry and then do an economic impact study to see what 
they did wrong and how much damage it caused. That is a pretty 
backward way of approaching this.
<P>
	Reform has a total of six amendments and the Bloc has two in 
this group. Contrary to what the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra said, we do not think it is unreasonable to consult with 
people. In fact, we are here as the representatives of people, at least 
that is what I and my colleagues in the Reform Party are here for. 
We did not get elected to be the rulers.
<P>
	It is absolutely despicable that the Liberal Party says it should 
have no obligation to consult with the provinces that are impacted 
by this. It says it should have absolutely no requirement to talk to 
the marine advisory board which is supposed be the expert on this. 
It says it should have no obligation whatsoever to talk to the users 
who are going to be impacted by this. Given that the Liberals never 
listen when people do talk, I suppose they are trying to save the 
taxpayers money by not bothering with a process that they will end 
up ignoring.
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member says, I implore members 
opposite to join with us in bringing in reasonable measures. We 
need measures that limit the powers of the minister and ministers 
who follow him in the future, that limit the powers of the 
government, and which make it necessary that we, the elected 
representatives of the people, must actually talk to the people so we 
know what it is they want us to represent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, following on the 
words of my colleague, when we look at these motions they deal 
with principles: the principle of fairness, the principle of 
efficiency, and the principle of cost effectiveness.
<P>
	Last year the coast guard announced to the Canadian shipping 
industry and ports that it was going to start charging fees for 
services that heretofore had been paid for by the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party and I believe in the concept and principle of 
user pay. It is not right that Canadian taxpayers living in Winnipeg, 
Calgary, Thunder Bay, or in Vancouver for that matter, should be 
subsidizing Canada's shipping industry any more than they should 
be subsidizing any other industry. In principle, we believe the 
government is going in the right direction.
<P>
	There is a serious problem with this legislation. We on this side 
of the House would like to be able to support this legislation but if 
these amendments cannot be passed by the House, I fear we will 
not be able to support it. The powers granted to the minister under 
this legislation are so broad and there is no provision for 
accountability that down the road regulations can be changed at 
whim.
<P>
	The minister does not even have to go through the process of 
gazetting. He does not have to go through the process he currently 
is required to go through in order to raise additional money. We 
fear that in the future there will be a powerful temptation on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3739"> 3739 </A></B>
<P>
part of whoever is  fulfilling the role of Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans to use this legislation to raise additional money.
<P>
	That is why we view these amendments and this part of the 
regulations, sections 81 through 89, as important. We believe 
strongly that this is a window of opportunity to ensure for all time 
that any future changes to the regulations with respect to fees for 
services the coast guard may charge will have to be dealt with fairly 
and up front, in a manner that is going to require Parliament's 
perusal.
<P>
	The way it is set up now, unless these amendments are adopted, 
there is no requirement for scrutiny down the road. There is no 
requirement for any future changes to come back to the House or to 
come back to the standing committee. There is no requirement for 
any kind of review. We argue strongly that this is wrong in 
principle. It does not provide anything for the shippers and the 
people who depend on the shipping industry.
<P>
	We on the standing committee heard witnesses from coast to 
coast telling us about their concerns with this new fee for service. 
They talked about the viability of their businesses. They were not 
in the shipping industry, but were people involved in the oil and gas 
business, people involved in the aggregate business, people 
involved in other bulk products such as iron ore, grain, lumber and 
coal. We heard from all these people. They have real concerns 
about how viable their businesses are going to be down the road as 
the government moves to higher and higher user fees.
<P>
	Each and every witness who appeared before the committee said 
that before the coast guard implemented user fees, it ought to be 
able to justify those fees on the basis that the services it is 
providing are actually priced at fair market values. It should be able 
to justify that the services it is providing are actually services the 
customers want and need and that they are being delivered 
efficiently.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary knows there are many instances 
where witnesses appeared before the committee and said: ``You are 
proposing to charge us for something that we can do ourselves for 
far less cost. We are willing to take that responsibility on. We will 
go out and service that navigational aid. We will go out and look 
after our own ice breaking. We will go out and look after it 
ourselves. We do not need the government to do it. We do not need 
the coast guard to do it''.
<P>
	The people who are being forced to pay the user fees ought to 
have that opportunity and that right. With the way the legislation 
now reads, there is no requirement on the part of the government or 
on the part of the minister to sit down and negotiate a deal with 
these people in good faith.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	A hue and cry went from one end of the coast to the other after 
the coast guard announced its intent to collect  a user fee last year. I
<P>
would suggest that there has been a fair bit of movement on the part 
of the coast guard to take into consideration the concerns of many 
of the people we heard at the standing committee and this is a good 
thing.
<P>
	However this legislation is our window of opportunity. It is our 
way of guaranteeing as parliamentarians that Canada's shippers 
and shipping industry are not going to be faced with costs down the 
road that they will have no opportunity to address and which 
parliamentarians will have no opportunity to review.
<P>
	I represent a riding that has a significant marine shipping 
industry. There could be changes to the regulations that we as 
parliamentarians may never know about unless the affected bodies 
complain to us. That is no way to run the country. For us to say: 
``We can do as we like until people yell and complain at such a 
level that we obviously have to stand back and take a different 
approach'', is no way to govern the country and no way to change 
or enact regulations.
<P>
	In closing, these amendments are important to the Reform Party. 
We would like to be able to support the bill. We would like to say: 
``In principle the oceans act is a good bill. There are still some 
things we would like to see changed but on balance we can support 
it''. However unless we get the motions passed that demand some 
accountability from the minister, the department and the 
commissioner of the coast guard, I fear we cannot support the 
legislation.
<P>
	Recently we found out that boaters from one end of the country 
to the other-never mind people who depend on the shipping 
industry-but boaters are going to be forced to pay a registration 
fee. If a person owns a rowboat or a canoe an annual fee will have 
to be paid to the government. For what?
<P>
	These matters have to be debated in the House Commons and the 
standing committee. Right now they are not. Some bureaucrat on 
Kent Street dreams up a regulation and says: ``This is where we can 
make more money. We can tag those guys. We have not tagged 
them before''. In essence it becomes a hidden tax and it is passed 
without any scrutiny, without any accountability. In some instances 
parliamentarians are not even aware of it.
<P>
	We insist that these amendments be passed. If they are not 
passed, the Reform Party cannot support the legislation.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak on Group No. 13. These are, again, 
very important motions. Since this is that last group of motions, let 
me start with a brief preamble, nothing too long.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3740"> 3740 </A></B>
<P>
	During the report stage here in the House, every time I rose to 
speak on the 13 groups of motions with, as the hon. member for 
Chambly put it, a hand held out in co-operation and a new 
approach to constitutional negotiations, because I did not want to 
launch a constitutional debate, I only wanted to make the 
government realize that to reach this bill's goal, which is to 
implement an integrated oceans management strategy, it had to 
create some kind of partnership.
<P>
	I wanted to draw the government's attention to the fact that, in 
my opinion, the government's major partners are the provinces, 
because they are the ones that formed Canada. For each part of this 
bill-there are three-I asked the government not to forget about 
the provinces and to consult with them right at the beginning and, 
in some cases, to work with them.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Since we are talking about Motions Nos. 84 and 85 concerning 
the fees stipulated in clause 50, let me say again that I am asking 
the government to consult with the provinces, because it is within 
their territories that the action will take place. In many cases, we 
want the provinces to levy the fees.
<P>
	In order to improve transparency, I am urging the government in 
Motion No. 85 to consult with the standing committee. I want to 
reassure the House that consulting with a House committee is 
nothing to worry about, especially since the majority of the 
standing committee members are from the Liberal Party. That is 
what my motions on this issue are all about.
<P>
	As for the other motions, Motions Nos. 77, 79 and 81 presented 
by members of the Reform Party, I regret to say that we are not in 
agreement with them. We think that the idea of setting fees by 
specific marine sector runs counter to what the witnesses who 
appeared before the standing committee were saying. The majority 
of witnesses objected to the government's proposal of dividing the 
country into three regions. I therefore cannot go along with the 
Reform Party's motions.
<P>
	However, in order to show you that, in the House and in 
committee, we have taken a non-partisan approach for the good of 
the cause, the Bloc Quebecois will support the Reform Party's 
Motion No. 83, since the purpose of this motion is to force the 
government to consult with the users of services.
<P>
	It would be only natural to consult the users, given that, in the 
case of fees for navigational aids for commercial vessels, the 
government has often used the expression ``user pay''. But there is 
also the expression ``user pay, user say''. I think that this is the 
thought behind the Reform Party's Motion No. 83, which the Bloc 
Quebecois will support.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 86 and 87 are very interesting and very forward 
looking. I would not want to get into the wording as such. But I am 
very interested to see that they  contain the idea of a two way 
communication. Motion No. 83 provides that users shall be 
consulted. Motion No. 86 specifies how users shall be informed. 
The idea is a very good one and we will support it.
<P>
	Time is flying and I must quickly wrap up. Motion No. 86 sets 
out when the information shall be published and how must time 
shall elapse. Motion No. 87 provides for a process of feedback. It is 
not enough to announce something. You must make sure that it will 
produce the expected results. If someone in Canada can show the 
government that it is on the wrong track, there has to be a review 
mechanism. The Bloc Quebecois will therefore support the Reform 
Party's Motions Nos. 86 and 87.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that I have appreciated 
working with parliamentarians from all parties, especially 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, who sometimes got quite carried 
away. You cannot blame them for their enthusiasm, with all they 
had to say, and their responsibility as representatives of the people 
of Quebec. I think we should be proud of the work they did.
<P>
	We hope that the work we did as the official opposition will 
bring the government around to delaying third reading of this bill, 
because they need to go back to the drawing board. On that note, 
and in the hope that the government will be understanding about 
third reading, which, we hope, will take place as late as possible 
next fall, the Bloc Quebecois is ready for the vote.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand that, under an 
agreement made earlier, if there is no other speaker at the report 
stage of Bill C-26, the question is now to be put. I would remind 
you also that, under a further agreement, the question is deemed to 
have been requested on Motion No. 77 and to have been deferred.
<P>
	Furthermore, as requested by the whips, the bell will be rung for 
only 15 minutes instead of 30.
<P>
	The vote is on Motion No. 77. Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House will now proceed 
to the taking of the deferred divisions at the report stage of Bill 
C-26.

on Motion No. 1 necessitates the question being put on Motions

	If Motion No. 77 is negatived, we will have to put the question

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-35, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
(minimum wage), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, let me first say that I am very pleased to 
present Bill C-35, amending part III of the Canada Labour Code to 
increase the federal minimum wage rate.
<P>
	In the 12 years I have been sitting in the House, I have never 
missed an opportunity to stand up for the most vulnerable in our 
society. The bill we are studying today goes precisely in this 
direction. I will not go as far as to describe it as a revolutionary 
measure that will change the life of millions, but it is a 
long-awaited amendment, because the federal minimum wage rate 
has not been changed for ten years. It is $4 an hour since 1986.
<P>
	With Bill C-35, our government wanted to kill two birds with 
one stone. First, it provides that, as of next July 17, the federal 
minimum wage rate will really increase. It also includes a 
mechanism ensuring that, from now on, the rate will be 
automatically adjusted according to the economic realities of the 
various regions of our country. After studying several different 
formulas, our government chose to align the federal minimum 
wage rate with those established by the provinces and territories. 
This dynamic initiative is quite logical, practical and fair.
<P>
	It is logical, because 98 per cent of the workers that are paid the 
minimum wage rate are employed in industries regulated by 
provincial or territorial legislation. Every province or territory 
regularly adjusts its minimum wage rate to meet regional 
requirements. Indeed, the economy and some of the market 
conditions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3752"> 3752 </A></B>
<P>
vary from region to region. And so does the minimum wage. Thus, 
across Canada, it varies between $4.75 and $7 an hour. If we had 
established a federal minimum wage, we would have gone against 
this reality.
<P>
	Our formula is also practical, because it simplifies the process 
for keeping these rates up to date. By harmonizing our rate with the 
provincial rates, we avoid having to make statutory changes on a 
regular basis to reflect change in each of our regions.
<P>
	Therefore, this initiative reflects our government's commitment 
to simplify government processes and reduce red tape wherever 
possible. Besides, business people will no longer have to worry 
about rate differences between both levels of government. Their 
employees will always be sure to get a pay equivalent to that of 
their peers.
<P>
	This is unquestionable proof that the Canadian government is 
willing to co-operate with the provinces in order to give taxpayers 
good service quickly and at the best possible cost. We have always 
said that we should analyze which jurisdiction is in the best 
position to deliver a service, and adapt our operating procedures 
accordingly.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	This is what we did in the case of Bill C-3 and this is what we are 
doing now with Bill C-35.
<P>
	I hope my colleagues opposite, and especially members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, will recognize that we are serious and consistent 
in our approach. We have always said that Canadian federalism was 
flexible and dynamic. Here we have further proof that we can 
improve our operations without resorting to useless and 
unproductive jurisdictional squabbles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-35 clearly reflects the strong commitment of the 
government to decentralization and to eliminating duplication and 
overlap. This amendment to the Canada Labour Code increases the 
federal minimum wages in a new and innovative way by aligning 
them with provincial rates based on regional economies. This 
clearly demonstrates our strong commitment to work with the 
provinces and territories to establish which jurisdiction is in the 
best position to deliver a specific service to Canadians.
<P>
	In this case it is clear we are happy to harmonize our rates with 
those of the provinces and territories and to follow their lead in 
setting an appropriate increase in the future.
<P>
	I strongly believe that everybody will gain from this simple and 
dynamic initiative. I also believe this new system will be practical, 
efficient and reliable.
<P>
	However, should it be proven otherwise, the federal government 
will be ready to intervene to protect the  interests of minimum wage 
workers. Those workers are generally not unionized and have little 
bargaining power with their employers. We retain the power to set 
our own federal minimum wages in the event that a province 
withdraws this floor or sets it an an unreasonable level.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I can say that Bill C-35 is based on the indisputable principles of 
justice and equity. It eliminates any possible discrimination 
between workers under federal jurisdiction and those under 
provincial or territorial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It also allows for more balanced and sounder competition 
between businesses in any given region because now the 
obligations will be the same for everyone.
<P>
	As far as equity is concerned, I would like my colleagues in the 
House to note that the new minimum wage rate will apply to all 
employees under federal jurisdiction, whatever their age. You will 
remember that in some Canadian provinces rates for young people 
and adults still differ. However, in order to be fair to our young 
workers, we chose to implement one single rate, that of the adult 
workers, to all businesses under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Before the government decided to harmonize the federal 
minimum wage with that of the provinces and territories, it did 
what it always does: it consulted the major stakeholders.
<P>
	The provincial governments welcomed the proposal, which will 
simplify the procedure and guarantee fair treatment of all workers 
in a given region.
<P>
	On the management side, there were no opposition since the vast 
majority of employers under federal jurisdiction are already paying 
their employees the equivalent of the minimum wage in force in the 
various regions of the country.
<P>
	The unions supported this measure because it implements the 
long awaited increase of the federal minimum wage and it also 
provides for automatic adjustments in the future.
<P>
	All the interested parties recognize that this proposal is 
reasonable and that it takes into account the realities of today's 
labour market.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	I must say, that in my work as Minister of Labour, I am 
impressed by the spirit of co-operation in our sector. I am delighted 
by it, because I am convinced that it is through dialogue and 
consultation that we will maintain effective and harmonious labour 
relations in Canada.
<P>
	I think this attitude also reveals that labour and management are 
aware of the great challenges we must fact together at the dawn of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3753"> 3753 </A></B>
<P>
the new century. Their sense  of responsibility and maturity are the 
envy of a number of other industrialized countries.
<P>
	I therefore set myself the objective of channelling all this 
goodwill positively in order to amend our Canada Labour Code and 
to adapt it to the new realities of the labour market in Canada. We 
are currently working very hard to modernize part I of the Canada 
Labour Code, which concerns the labour relations process and 
structures in industries under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Already, the members of the task force under Andrew Sims have 
agreed on a whole range of recommendations. Rarely have we seen 
the process of consultation achieve its objectives so successfully, 
and we must congratulate all those who have helped build this 
impressive consensus.
<P>
	One major question, however, remains unanswered: the use of 
replacement workers during a legal strike. The members of the 
Sims committee have made two different suggestions. Other 
options were suggested by different experts, but I wanted to see for 
myself the mood of the people.
<P>
	This is the reason why, during the month of April, I participated 
in consultations all over the country. Almost all stakeholders 
mentioned the problem of substitute workers and the relevance of a 
potential federal act respecting strike breakers. I took good note of 
their opinions, recommendations and warnings.
<P>
	Consultations on Part I being completed, I am determined to go 
ahead rapidly. Officials at the bureau of legislation review are 
currently preparing the amendments I want to submit very soon to 
my colleagues in cabinet and to Parliament.
<P>
	At the same time, our analysis of Part II of the labour code, 
which deals more specifically with health and safety in the 
workplace is progressing rapidly. Dozens and dozens of changes 
have been proposed and in this case also, an important consensus 
has developed. There is consensus on 90 per cent of the changes. 
There remain only a few questions for the minister to answer.
<P>
	Finally, we are starting to study Part III of the Code on labour 
standards. This is the part I consider most crucial for the coming 
years. Everywhere in the country, a great nervousness and a strong 
concern can be felt in the face of the rapid changes occurring in the 
workplace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is why the second priority I have chosen as Minister of 
Labour is the workplace of the future. The shift from an industrial 
society to the information age, globalization, demographic changes 
and the imperatives of budgetary control is causing tremendous 
worries in society. How we work and how we prepare for our 
working lives are changing profoundly and irreversibly.
<P>
	To begin with, fewer and fewer people are working year round, 
nine to five, Monday to Friday, for one employer on common 
premises according to established  rules. Over the past decade the 
number of self-employed Canadians has grown twice as fast as 
traditional job opportunities. In Canada more than three quarters of 
a million men and women are working out of their homes, and that 
number is expected to double in the next five years. Furthermore, 
two-thirds of these home based workers are employed by a 
company which has its headquarters somewhere else.
<P>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	At first glance some of these facts appear disturbing. It is true a 
large number of workers are resigning themselves to 
self-employment, part time jobs and home based jobs because they 
have been unable to find traditional work. Sometimes they 
accumulate two or three part time jobs.
<P>
	However thousands of Canadians deliberately choose this type 
of work. Usually they do so to more effectively balance family and 
work related responsibilities. A growing number of workers are 
doing so to improve the quality of their lives or to make better use 
of their creativity, expertise and spirit of entrepreneurship.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously, this more individualized and independent approach 
to work does not suit all workers. Therefore, in co-operation with 
the private sector, we must continue to do everything possible to 
create jobs of all kinds.
<P>
	At the same time, we must seriously look at the challenges to 
industrial relations in Canada because of the new trends.
<P>
	Several questions come to mind: What should be the role of the 
government when work becomes more individual than collective? 
How do we define the workplace when a considerable number of 
employees work at home? How do we better protect transient 
workers who do not enjoy a continuous employer-employee 
relationship? How can freelancers and contract workers have 
access to some kind of social benefits, of security? How do we 
prevent abuses on both sides?
<P>
	These are questions we must answer very quickly. The Sims 
report touched on the subject in its last chapter entitled <I>Beyond the 
Code</I>. Last year, the Donner report carefully studied the whole 
issue of work distribution. Several researchers in the area of 
industrial relations are also working on this issue.
<P>
	This is why I thought it would be appropriate to take a few 
minutes during our debate to raise the awareness of my colleagues 
regarding these issues and to ask them to take part in the 
brainstorming I want to have on the future of work. This is an issue 
which has a direct impact on Canadians. It is at the basis of our 
ability to adapt to change and compete in a global economy in the 
years to come.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3754"> 3754 </A></B>
<P>
	In the meantime, I would invite all hon. members to fully 
support Bill C-35 before us now. This is a simple piece of 
legislation aimed primarily at bringing justice and fairness to those 
who are at the bottom of the pay scale. They are entitled to the 
dignity of work. They deserve our support and our help. We have 
the duty to provide it to them.
<P>
	I trust you will find there is unanimous consent, once my 
colleagues opposite have stated their position, to go into committee 
of the whole, proceed with the report stage and third reading and 
refer the bill to the Senate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the request from the Minister of Labour. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is no unanimous 
consent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his speech. First of all, I want to 
say that the official opposition will support Bill C-35.
<P>
	I just discovered that, in his own way, the Minister of Labour 
follows the principles of Mao Zedong because he proposed several 
bills in a series that, we know, will culminate in the presentation of 
a legislation on replacement workers and the more comprehensive 
reform of the labour code that the minister will propose, naturally.
<P>
	We must not underestimate the impact, the importance of 
legislation like this one, because it affects the most vulnerable 
people in our society.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The minister is right to remind us that the minimum wage 
issue-and I will get back to this later on-is all about individuals 
who generally share three characteristics. More often than not they 
are not protected by a collective agreement. Their jobs are unsure, 
often in sectors more sensitive to economic contingencies. 
Moreover, very often these jobs are part time.
<P>
	It is a good thing the government decided to put an end to a 
situation that was absurd for two reasons. First of all, the federal 
government had not increased the minimum wage since 1986; it 
was still at $4. Later on I will show how this $4 rate ties in with the 
poverty levels. We had a ridiculous situation where a worker 
working for a company under federal jurisdiction was not entitled 
to the same wage as other workers in British Columbia, 
Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour, with this bill, is correcting an unfair 
situation by ensuring that, in a given province, all workers will be 
entitled to the same minimum wage.
<P>
	I have looked at this bill carefully. I want to point out that we 
will reach heaven once we have antiscab legislation and once we 
have revised as fully as possible the Canada Labour Code, which is 
very complex, with its three parts. I want to let the minister know 
that I am deeply interested in these issues. We would be very happy 
to work in committee, because the labour market is, as we have 
pointed out, about to undergo major changes.
<P>
	I need only give my family as an example. I believe it is typical 
of what is going on in the labour market. My father is almost sixty, 
and has had only one career. He made an honest living, but has 
always worked for the same employer. I turned 34 in May-I know 
I do not look that old-and this is my third career. We know that, 
by the year 2000, workers will go through five or six careers, and 
that the employer-employee relationship will be considerably 
weakened because of the increase in home teleworking.
<P>
	This means that, as lawmakers, we must look carefully at the 
protection we want these workers to enjoy.
<P>
	The minister has introduced a bill that we will support and that 
covers, if I read right, six main points. To start with, the minimum 
wage would be harmonized with that in effect in the various 
provinces, and that we agree with. That is central to the bill and we 
support it.
<P>
	Let us remember, for the benefit of our audience, perhaps, the 
reality of the minimum wage across the country. We have said that 
the federal minimum wage has not changed since 1986 and stands 
at $4. It Alberta, the minimum wage is $5, but a distinction is made 
between workers under l8 and those over 18. This distinction will 
be done away with. Unless I am wrong, the minister feared, rightly, 
that it would not stand the test of the Canadian charter of rights. 
Such distinctions based on age will be tolerated less and less as 
time goes on.
<P>
	British Columbia is the wealthiest province. I do not know 
whether you have been to Vancouver lately, but I have and I was 
astonished at the meaning of wealth in a province. British 
Columbia has the smallest debt. There is a correlation between the 
debt of a province and its ability to provide services. I was 
surprised to find that in B.C.-to give an example with which I am 
familiar-25 medications are made available to people with AIDS.
<P>
	You will understand, then, that this global wealth index is 
reflected in the minimum wage. It will come as a surprise to no one 
that the minimum wage in our westernmost province is the highest 
at $7 per hour.
<P>
	Prince Edward Island, which expects to have increased its 
minimum wage three times between 1991 and 1997, will reach the 
Canadian average of $5.40.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3755"> 3755 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	The minimum wage in Manitoba is $5.40; in New Brunswick, it 
is $5.50; in Nova Scotia, it will be increased from $5.35 to $5.50 in 
February.
<P>
	In Mike Harris' Ontario, where, as you know, the situation is not 
always rosy, the minimum wage is $6.85 but we understand that, 
with its industrial structure, Ontario may be in a better position 
than Quebec to support a slightly higher minimum wage.
<P>
	Quebec's minimum wage is $6.45, but one might think-I do not 
know if the minister has a scoop on that subject, but there is a 
rumour going around-it could be increased in the very near future, 
thanks to the bread and roses operation. This beautiful operation 
came about because of a willingness to link social awareness and 
economic awareness.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan, the minimum wage is $5.35; in 
Newfoundland, about which we have talked a lot in the House in 
the last few weeks, it is $4.75; in the Northwest Territories, it is $7 
and in the Yukon, $6.86.
<P>
	So, there is a variety of viewpoints that may appear to be 
discriminatory toward workers and that cannot be explained. One 
cannot explain why there are two rates in effect in the same 
province or territory.
<P>
	So, the minister has done something useful in proposing a bill 
aimed at harmonizing the wages that will be in effect on the same 
territory.
<P>
	Second, if Bill C-35 is passed, the general rate will apply 
regardless of occupation, status or work experience, which is also 
desirable.
<P>
	Third, there are still people who do piecework and therefore are 
not paid by the hour. My understanding of the bill is that the 
minister is making provisions so that, where applicable, an 
employee will never get less than the minimum wage.
<P>
	Fourth, as it was said, the minimum wage based on age will not 
be permitted any more.
<P>
	And fifth, the federal government-I had some questions about 
that, but the issue will probably be raised in committee of the 
whole in a few minutes-retains the authority to clearly set the 
minimum wage. The minister has been discreet on that matter, but 
he will be able to explain it, if it is indeed the legislator's intent.
<P>
	This is essentially what the minister is proposing.
<P>
	I would be doubly satisfied because, as I have said, we agree 
with the minister's logic. We are happy to see that the proposed 
harmonization really provides an increase in the minimum wage, 
given that the federal government was the jurisdiction with the 
lowest wage rate. We are happy to see that workers will no longer 
be discriminated against because of their age.
<P>
	Of course, this legislation will affect a limited number of 
workers, as the Code protects only 10 per cent of the  workforce. 
According to department officials, only 2 per cent of those 10 per 
cent will be affected. So, while we must recognize that the 
legislation has limited scope, it is important for the workers 
concerned.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear the minister saying that, all through his 
career, which I followed from a distance, he has always stood up 
for the poor in our society. This awareness was apparent when we 
discussed the Program for Older Workers Adjustment or issues 
related to social legislation. The fact is that we witnessed a 
considerable erosion of what the minimum wage represents in 
relation to the policies needed to fight poverty.
<P>
	Let me remind the minister that he should-and perhaps would 
like to in the coming days-review the report tabled by the 
National Council of Welfare, as I did last night. The report was 
tabled in October 1993 and is entitled <I>Incentives and Disincentives 
to Work</I>.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The National Council of Welfare is an organization which is 
affiliated with the Department of Human Resources Development 
and which must regularly report on the evolution of poverty levels.
<P>
	I simply want to tell you about what the 1993 report said: 
comparing the reality of the minimum wage in 1976 and in 1992 
leads to two findings. In 1976, most people who were paid the 
minimum wage had an income above the poverty line. In 1992, in 
every province, the minimum wage was below the poverty line.
<P>
	It goes without saying that this situation is not the exclusive 
responsibility of the Minister of Labour, but involves the whole 
issue of policy directions. But the fact is that, as we speak, the 
minimum wage in effect in every province is below the poverty 
line.
<P>
	This means that, for some people, there is no incentive to work. I 
often meet, in my riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, in 
Montreal, people who have difficult choices to make. When they 
are beneficiaries of income security programs, it is sometimes 
more advantageous for them, particularly couples with children, to 
remain on these programs than to work. As a society, we have to 
have to wonder about this.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Human Resources Development also has 
something to say about that, but the fact is that the minimum wage 
is now below the poverty line.
<P>
	Let us take 1976 as an example. Collectively speaking, 1976 was 
a particular year. The minister surely recalls that, in 1976, a very 
progressive government came to power in Quebec. It is therefore a 
benchmark I like to refer to. In 1976, in Newfoundland, a person 
with a salary comparable to the minimum wage had an annual 
income of $5,200, an amount which was 5 percent above the 
poverty line.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3756"> 3756 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1992, the minimum wage in Newfoundland gave an 
income of $9,880, which was 74 per cent of the amount needed 
to be at the poverty line. As you can see, there has been 
significant erosion of what the minimum wage buys for those 
who must live with it.
<P>
	The same thing goes for Prince Edward Island. In 1976, the 
minimum wage meant an income of $4,992, which was 3 per cent 
above the poverty line; in 1992, this income was $9,880, or 76 per 
cent of the amount needed to reach the poverty line. I could give 
the numbers for all 10 provinces. This is a fact that the Minister of 
Labour, who invites us to ponder, should not forget.
<P>
	Without underestimating the scope of Bill C-35, of which the 
Bloc Quebecois supports both the principle and the 
self-explanatory references, it would have been interesting if the 
government had introduced a single bill proposing to harmonize 
the minimum wage and concrete measures to fight poverty.
<P>
	Let us never forget that. I hope we shall never discuss social 
policy or make reference to the minimum wage without keeping in 
mind that, overall, Canadian society is poorer than ever. There are 
in Canadian society people who are far from getting richer. Poverty 
is reaching classes that until now were believed to be protected 
from it.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of what the National Council of 
Welfare told us in its report last year. It wrote that 4.8 million 
children, women and men, that is one Canadian out of six, live in 
poverty. Poverty is defined as spending more than 56 per cent of 
one's income for basic needs such as clothing, food and housing. A 
person who spends more than that for basic needs is poor, 
according to the National Council of Welfare.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	One Canadian out of six, or 16 per cent of the Canadian 
population, is in that situation. We have a fairly precise knowledge 
of the patterns of poverty. For example, single parent families 
headed by females are now significantly poorer. In 1994, the 
poverty rate of single mothers aged less than 65 with children 
under 18 was 57 per cent.
<P>
	Now, one Canadian out of six, or 16 per cent of the population, 
lives in poverty, but the situation is much worse in certain segments 
of our society. We know that 57 per cent of lone-parent families 
headed by women with children under 18 years of age live in 
poverty. There is something very worrisome about this grim reality.
<P>
	I appreciate the work done by the National Council of Welfare, 
because it showed us some possible ways to eradicate poverty. 
Since we have two ministers sitting side by side, two ministers 
from Montreal, which is quite something, who are committed to 
promoting liberty and equality, I want to take this opportunity to 
remind the House that the National Council of Welfare indicated  
that, if the Canadian government had invested $15 billion, we 
would have been able to eradicate poverty in just one year. Since I 
cannot say that to the Reform Party, I have to tell the government 
majority.
<P>
	I am now quoting, for the listening enjoyment of the Minister of 
Labour, the National Council of Welfare: ``In spite of the grim 
reality, it is not wishful thinking to think we will win the war 
against poverty. According to Statistics Canada, to help all the poor 
improve their lot would have cost $15 billion in 1994''. This is a 
huge amount. Of course, we are not saying this is insignificant, but 
it is surely not exaggerated for a country where the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments spent some $350 billion in 
1994 and where the value of all produced goods and services 
exceeded $750 billion. Is this not a reason to be hopeful? Should 
this not be the way to go?
<P>
	It would have been very interesting for the Minister of Labour to 
put forward with this legislation a more general one providing job 
creation and full employment measures aimed at getting people out 
of poverty.
<P>
	To conclude, I ask for the unanimous consent to refer Bill C-35 
to a committee of the whole after the intervention of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the terms 
of the bill before us are under the guise of giving more powers to 
the provinces. If it did that, I would be all for it, but I suppose Bill 
C-35 is a small step toward eliminating useless, outdated 
regulations. The Canada Labour Code covers less than one million 
workers.
<P>
	In 1986, the last time there was a change to the federal minimum 
wage, only one-tenth of one per cent or roughly 7,000 workers 
under federal jurisdiction were directly affected. While updated 
estimates are not available from department officials, there is a 
presumption that little has changed in that length of time.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	In 1935, Canada ratified the ILO Minimum Wage Fixing 
Machinery Convention, 1928, which specified that workers would 
be guaranteed a minimum wage in cases where wages were 
exceptionally low.
<P>
	It was 1965 before Canada actually began setting minimum 
wage rates. Since the provinces regulate over 99 per cent of 
Canadian minimum wage earners, there was not much need for 
expediency. Since there have been only sporadic changes in the 
rates since 1965, it is evident that the federal minimum wage is not 
necessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3757"> 3757 </A></B>
<P>
	Back in the 1930s an argument may have been made to justify 
a minimum wage in some countries to ensure that workers were 
not taken advantage of by single industry employers.
<P>
	There is a general misconception that without a minimum wage 
workers would be exploited. Employers want the best workers 
available and often compete to hire them. Low wages often show 
there is an abundance of workers available, which is just an 
example of the supply and demand concept.
<P>
	The minimum wage, rather than bringing the poverty level up, 
has the reverse effect. It encourages exploitation. It protects highly 
trained, well paid workers against competition from the young who 
lack experience and the unskilled people who require on the job 
training.
<P>
	Unions, whose mandate it is to protect jobs and increase the 
wages of its members, support minimum wage rates to protect 
themselves from cheaper or trainee labour. Naturally, when asked 
to respond to the initiative aligning federal minimum wage rates 
with provincial rates, labour groups wanted the federal government 
to show leadership by maintaining a single rate that is higher than 
the provincial and territorial minimum wages.
<P>
	Business groups, on the other hand, indicated the change would 
have virtually no impact on their operations as the lowest paid 
wages were competitive with and generally higher than the 
provincial wage rates.
<P>
	In the last 10 years Canada has entered into international trade 
agreements with the U.S. and Mexico which include labour 
co-operation. There were also agreements with the provinces to 
cover the provisions of these accords.
<P>
	If a minimum wage is deemed to be necessary to meet 
international agreements and conventions, the government could 
guarantee the continued existence of a minimum wage by 
concluding federal-provincial agreements on minimum wage rates. 
This would eliminate the perceived necessity of section 178(2) 
which gives the governor in council power to set rates should it 
disagree with the rate set by a province or territory.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources boasted a new spirit of 
co-operation between the federal and provincial governments to an 
Edmonton group last week. If this spirit of co-operation really 
exists, section 178(2) can be deleted. The understanding works out 
to ensure that the provinces maintain reasonable minimum wage 
standards.
<P>
	High wages cannot be decreed but must be arrived at through 
years of experience in the workplace. In the nineties, advances in 
human rights, collective bargaining and consumer awareness make 
minimum wages, especially in the federal context, irrelevant.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Natural 
Resources, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-23, an act to establish the 
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the 
House on Bill C-23, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act.
<P>
	In 1946 when the Canadian nuclear industry was in its infancy, 
Parliament passed the Atomic Energy Control Act which gave the 
federal government control over the development, application and 
use of nuclear energy. Fifty years later, despite the dramatic 
changes in the size and the scope of the nuclear industry, that 
legislation has never been significantly revised or updated. Clearly 
changes are long overdue, changes that this House can help bring 
about today by supporting Bill C-23 at second reading.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to review the key elements 
of this proposed legislation so that hon. members will have a true 
appreciation of why Bill C-23 is important for the nuclear industry 
and for all Canadians.
<P>
	I will talk about the paramount importance of worker and public 
safety and environment protection and a more modern and 
effective regulatory framework that focuses on these goals. I will 
talk about reduced overlap and duplication, improved efficiency of 
the federation, increased competitiveness and job creation but, 
most important, I will demonstrate that Bill C-23 is a bill of good 
government.
<P>
	When the current legislation establishing the federal role in the 
nuclear sector came into force, Canadians could only dream about 
the benefits of nuclear technology. Today each and every one of us 
in this House and each and every one of our constituents has 
experienced those benefits firsthand.
<P>
	Nuclear power now accounts for approximately one-fifth of 
Canada's electricity supply. The nuclear sector has brought 
tremen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3758"> 3758 </A></B>
<P>
dous economic benefits to our nation by ensuring a safe and 
reliable source of energy, supporting industrial growth and high 
technology jobs and contributing to our balance of trade. Nuclear 
technology has also brought enormous social benefits. For decades 
nuclear isotopes have been crucial for a range of medical uses.
<P>
	The nuclear industry has grown to the point where it affects the 
lives of Canadians in many different ways. Yet the law governing 
the industry has not changed significantly since 1946. The focus of 
regulation is no longer the security of atomic secrets as it was in the 
1940s, but it is now on the health, safety and environmental impact 
of using nuclear technologies.
<P>
	Societies expectations about how and why government should 
regulate the nuclear sector have also changed considerably. For 50 
years the Atomic Energy Control Board has used its authority 
under the current act wisely and effectively. The AECB has been 
influential in the development of strong safety cultures at Canada's 
nuclear reactors. Its vigilance with regard to safety is one reason 
why the safety of Canada's nuclear sector is second to none in the 
world.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the status quo is no longer acceptable to Canadians 
or to this government. The current legislation's deficiencies have 
been noted by the courts, the media, special interest groups, 
committees of this House and Canada's auditor general.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-23 addresses these shortcomings by providing for more 
explicit regulation of nuclear activities and by ensuring that the 
regulatory body will have the legislated powers needed to fulfil its 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Canada's nuclear regulatory agency will be given a clear 
mandate to focus on public concerns about the safety of nuclear 
facilities and the environmental impact of nuclear activities in 
Canada.
<P>
	In keeping with this mandate, the AECB will be renamed the 
Canadian nuclear safety commission. This name change will help 
Canadians better identify with the principal role of the commission 
and will eliminate confusion with the Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited or AECL, the crown corporation responsible for the 
development and support of Candu nuclear reactors.
<P>
	The Canadian nuclear safety commission will continue to have 
responsibility for nuclear security issues. Bill C-23 will ensure a 
firm basis for implementing Canada's nuclear policy and fulfilling 
our obligations with respect to the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. Under the non-proliferation policy, for example, the use 
of certain nuclear materials including uranium must be fully 
accounted for by Canada's nuclear customers. Bill C-23 clearly 
defines the new commission's responsibility for ensuring the 
proper accounting of these materials.
<P>
	Nuclear matters are a federal responsibility. Over the past two 
decades this has led to some jurisdictional problems and to some 
overlap and duplication in regulations. The federal government has 
worked with the provinces to address the issue. For example, the 
government recently introduced amendments to the Canada Labour 
Code that would allow the government to adopt provincial 
legislation governing labour matters including labour relations and 
occupational health and safety, and to delegate responsibilities for 
administering these laws and regulations back to the provinces.
<P>
	The proposed nuclear safety and control act includes similar 
interdelegation mechanisms that will give the Canadian nuclear 
safety commission the authority to enter into agreements with each 
province to adopt other relevant provincial standards, codes and 
laws that would then apply to nuclear activities. This would 
effectively establish a regulatory regime that respects provincial 
jurisdiction. The legislation also allows for the responsibility for 
administering regulations in these areas to be delegated to the 
provinces.
<P>
	This new power to co-operate with the provinces is expected to 
reduce regulatory duplication between federal and provincial 
orders of government. In so doing it will help reduce administrative 
costs and establish greater certainty for the industry, thereby 
increasing the competitiveness of Canada's nuclear sector. This 
increased competitiveness will in turn preserve and create high 
tech jobs in Canada.
<P>
	By explicitly referring to health, safety and protection of the 
environment, the proposed legislation will clearly match the 
commission's mandate to public expectations of its role. The 
government is committed to protecting the health and safety of 
Canadians and our environment.
<P>
	The proposed legislation will permit the Canadian nuclear safety 
commission to order the clean up of radioactive contamination 
when responsibility for the contamination is unclear, under dispute, 
or where the polluter refuses to act. Currently the AECB does not 
have this power. This is precisely the kind of protection for 
Canadians that the auditor general called for in a report to the 
House in 1994.
<P>
	It is also worth noting that the high standard for worker 
protection enshrined in Bill C-23 has received significant support 
from labour. In fact I have received a letter from the Canadian 
Labour Congress urging quick passage of Bill C-23.
<P>
	As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources I am pleased to inform the House that Bill C-23 has a 
strong environmental focus which is in keeping with the 
concerns of all Canadians and with the promise made in the red 
book that the Liberal government would lead in protecting 
Canada's environment.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3759"> 3759 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-23 will explicitly require that the environmental effects of 
a proposed nuclear facility be assessed as part of the commission's 
licensing process. However I assure hon. members that the 
legislation will not in any way change the process for ensuring that 
the requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
continue to be met. In addition, Bill C-23 will make it possible to 
substitute the commission's hearing process for that of the CEAA.
<P>
	The proposed legislation also contains many other 
characteristics of a modern regulatory system. The power of 
federal inspectors will be enshrined in the law. The maximum 
penalty for offences will increase dramatically from $10,000 to $1 
million.
<P>
	The new commission will also have the clear authority to order 
remedial action where necessary and to require financial 
guarantees for decommissioning, thus ensuring that owners meet 
high environmental standards.
<P>
	At the same time the proposed legislation is intended to conform 
with the mining reclamation trust provisions of the Income Tax 
Act. This means that mining companies could be eligible for 
certain tax benefits, if they are required to settle such a trust as a 
licence condition.
<P>
	Bill C-23 authorizes the new commission to charge fees to 
recover the costs associated with its regulatory activities. Although 
the AECB has collected fees from licensees to recover costs since 
1990, its authority to do so is not explicitly legislated.
<P>
	Bill C-23 proposes that the number of members of the 
commission be increased from the current five to seven. The 
government believes it is important to have a sufficient number of 
commissioners to deal expeditiously with all licensing decisions. It 
has become apparent that the current complement of five board 
members, only one of whom is full time, is insufficient. We believe 
the commission needs members who represent a wide range of 
expertise to deal with the broader set of issues now considered by 
this regulatory body.
<P>
	These objectives can be achieved by increasing the number of 
positions on the commission. The cost of this increased 
representation, which amounts to approximately $100,000 per year, 
will be funded from internal reallocations.
<P>
	Like any other modern regulatory agency, the new commission 
needs certain authority to function effectively. Consequently the 
commission will be declared a court of record and will have the 
authority to conduct formal public hearings, compel witnesses to 
appear, take evidence and control its proceedings.
<P>
	Bill C-23 responds to the calls from many quarters for a modern 
law that will reflect the federal government's responsibilities and 
powers relating to the regulation of the nuclear industry.
<P>
	The legislation will enable the federal government to ensure the 
nuclear industry continues to operate in a manner that protects the 
health and safety of Canadians and their environment.
<P>
	Bill C-23 is an important step toward avoiding unnecessary 
regulatory overlap and duplication between the federal and 
provincial orders of government. It will also ensure that federal 
regulations are applied in a fair and just manner.
<P>
	The steps will minimize the cost to the nuclear industry and 
allow it to pursue opportunities in an increasingly competitive 
world, creating new jobs for Canadians and contributing to the 
country's economic growth.
<P>
	The commission will be better equipped than the current Atomic 
Energy Control Board to conduct public hearings and 
environmental assessments. It will have clear powers to inspect 
nuclear facilities and other premises where licensed activities are 
carried out, to enforce federal regulations, to order environmental 
clean-ups, and to seek suitable penalties.
<P>
	Further, the use of additional commissioners will enable the 
commission to work in a cost effective manner while ensuring 
balanced decision making that fulfils the public interest.
<P>
	Clearly the proposed legislation represents good government in 
action. The legislation acts on commitments outlined in the recent 
speech from the throne for sustaining our environment and for 
ensuring a modern regulatory regime that will meet the needs of the 
21st century.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	Based on an open and honest discussion of Bill C-23 and its 
many merits, I am confident hon. members on both sides of the 
House will join me in voting to send the legislation to committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the purpose of this bill is to create the new Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission. As my colleague has just pointed out, the old 
legislation dates back to 1946, so it can certainly be described as 
outmoded.
<P>
	This commission is primarily a monitoring body, and whenever I 
hear monitoring, I wonder who will do this. Will the number of 
monitors be increased? What will their qualifications be? What 
will this all cost?
<P>
	The commission's mandate is also to monitor the impact of 
nuclear activities on health. This is very important. In my riding I 
see people from Russia who have been the victims of nuclear 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3760"> 3760 </A></B>
<P>
accidents. They take years to recover. They need fresh air and good 
food as well. It is obvious that there can never be too many 
protective precautions taken.
<P>
	The commission will also be responsible for safety, which is all 
very well and good. The environment needs more looking after, as 
we are told, and I feel that the commission will be better able to 
protect our environment. Very often the opposition is criticized for 
doing nothing but finding fault, but I think that, when a bill is 
worthwhile, that must be acknowledged. The Bloc acknowledges 
the definite quality of this bill.
<P>
	The commission may also set national standards. I believe that it 
is important, yet my colleague was saying earlier that ertain powers 
can be turned over to the provinces. Here again-alas, too 
often-that can lead to quarrelling. I wonder why more powers are 
not turned over to the provinces.
<P>
	The commission will also play a role in implementing policy and 
international commitments concerning the non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. Finally, it has a major role to play in 
co-ordinating emergency measures, for instance in the event of a 
leak at a nuclear plant.
<P>
	Where nuclear energy and radioactive emissions are concerned, 
it is essential that safety be a government priority. Clearly, the old 
Atomic Energy Control Act which, as I have said, dates back to 
1946, was essentially focussed on national security.
<P>
	Today, as everyone knows, there is a far wider use of sources of 
radiation. The legislation must, therefore, be brought up to date. 
The new bill is an improvement over the old. Still, Quebec has 
voiced certain concerns relating to workers in the nuclear industry 
who were not covered by either the Canada Labour Code or any 
provincial legislation.
<P>
	This legal vacuum posed certain safety problems, in nuclear 
plants for instance. The Act to amend the Canada Labour Code, 
passed this March 26, filled the need. It also contains the concept 
that a person may not be held responsible for an incident if he or 
she has taken all reasonable steps.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	But here again, we must agree on the meaning of the word 
reasonable. Who is going to define it? I do not think we can be half 
reasonable. There are however a number of questions to be 
answered when we look to the courts of law for an exact definition 
of the criteria of the word reasonable. As for the expression 
``exercise diligence'', ``diligence'' is a big word, but it must be 
clarified in this legislation, in the application of the standards in 
effect, to prevent an error occurring.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would like this to be included in Bill C-23, 
as it is in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	The Canadian commission would also monitor the use of 
instruments with a radioactive component. Hospitals also use 
radioactive equipment in certain treatments and diagnoses. The 
commission would inspect this equipment and ensure it meets 
safety standards. Business does its own inspections and sends 
samples to the experts on the commission. Both large and small and 
medium size business do so.
<P>
	The commission claims to charge companies using its 
radioactive source services the actual cost of the inspection. 
However, certain companies claim that the federal government is 
not doing everything in its power and that, very often, it is too 
expensive. Therefore, business has a different story.
<P>
	The big power companies argue that it is the consumers who end 
up paying for the ever-increasing fees set by the commission.
<P>
	We are also in favour of cost recovery so that a balance can be 
struck. Annual fee increases would, I feel, be improper. A 
commission like this one is sometimes used to generate profits, 
even when the fees are said to serve other purposes.
<P>
	This bill should require the commission to consult with licensees 
and consider their views before imposing or raising user fees.
<P>
	This, of course, is a sensitive issue. Some argue that the safety 
benefits are priceless, that safety standards could always be more 
rigorous, regardless of the implementation costs. But there is a 
limit. Few people feel that a regulation's advantages and 
disadvantages should be assessed before it is imposed on 
governments, businesses and individuals.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois recognizes the need to act very carefully in 
this regard, as well as the risk of giving too much weight to 
economic interests compared to the significant safety needs. Let 
me give you an example. I was in committee earlier and mention 
was made of imposing a tax to register small boats such as pedal 
boats. This shows how a government can take advantage of the 
people at any time. A supposedly noble motive turns into a money 
grab. The initially noble motive becomes perverted.
<P>
	It is, however, necessary to consider the possibility that the 
commission may have the mandate to conduct its own cost-benefit 
analysis of the regulations and standards it applies and intends to 
apply in the future. This would better protect the interests of 
businesses and their customers.
<P>
	A number of conclusions can be drawn from the many nuclear 
disasters that have occurred around the world. It can be said that we 
all played sorcerer's apprentice with nuclear energy.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3761"> 3761 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	In certain respects, we went much too fast. We did not have the 
expertise, but we thought it would be the best form of energy in the 
world. We are paying the price today.
<P>
	Man has played sorcerer's apprentice with some extremely 
dangerous products. We became involved in the production of 
nuclear energy without being able to effectively deal with the 
consequences. We became involved in the development and 
production of nuclear energy without really knowing all the facts. 
We generated tons of nuclear waste without being able to process 
them effectively, and that is a tragedy.
<P>
	Our governments have failed to effectively manage health and 
environmental hazards. Our governments also proved to be 
incapable of exercising effective control. It is no wonder that, every 
time an attempt is made to develop or use new nuclear 
technologies, environmental organizations cry out against the idea 
and the public itself is wary, and rightly so.
<P>
	We must not overlook the fact that the nuclear arsenal currently 
available worldwide could totally destruct humanity and the public 
is perfectly aware of this. I would not take much to blow up the 
planet, just one madman, and in this world of ours there is no lack 
of madmen.
<P>
	We all know that there are huge stocks of nuclear weapons, 
plutonium and heavy water in Russia, and that our governments are 
afraid a black market might develop. Non democratic countries and 
terrorist groups could then have access to atomic weapons or 
anything they need to build such weapons.
<P>
	How can we expect those who develop and sell new technologies 
to be able to exercise control? In a great many cases, they should 
exercise control but do not even have this control they should be 
exercising.
<P>
	It took the federal government 50 years to come to the 
realization that this ill-conceived legislation does not adequately 
protect the people of Quebec and Canada. How do you expect 
nuclear wary people to trust this government and the new 
commission after that? Even with the right tools, will the 
commission be able to ensure adequate monitoring?
<P>
	It will also be difficult to restore public confidence. I just cannot 
believe that passing this bill will solve all our problems. Prudence 
dictates we must give ourselves monitoring standards. In fact I 
suspect this government is trying to make us forget about the Prime 
Minister's last visit to Russia, when the purchase of nuclear waste 
to be processed in Canada was discussed. Members will recall that 
there had been an outcry over this decision. And for a very good 
reason.
<P>
	The government could probably have resolved another problem 
by dealing with the nuclear energy issue and  introducing a bill on 
this subject. It is clear from analyzing nuclear energy research and 
development investments made in Canada that almost all the 
economic benefits in that area go to the same province, and this 
province, as you know, is Ontario.
<P>
	In Quebec, we inherited the unemployment insurance-which I 
call and will always call poverty insurance-while Ontario gets 
money for research and development. We are still, unfortunately, 
the forgotten ones.
<P>
	Who, in this federation, benefits as much from the federal 
government's generosity? Who else in this federation has such an 
interest in seeing Atomic Energy of Canada maintained? Who else 
in this federation benefits as much from the spinoffs of this 
industry? No one else. Ontario is the only one.
<P>
	Had this government been serious in its approach, it would have 
seized the opportunity to look at this issue. The government greatly 
favours the development of nuclear energy, but does so only as a 
service to the Ontario industry.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	While amending the current act, the government should make a 
formal commitment to better distribute its R and D money between 
the provinces, particularly those which receive the least, such as 
Quebec.
<P>
	But the government did just the opposite when it recently 
announced the closing of EACL regional offices in Montreal. 
Montreal was hit again, not to mention the decision affecting 
Varennes and before that, the Maurice-Lamontagne Institute.
<P>
	I would also have liked to see the government clearly affirm its 
will to promote R and D for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As we 
know, nuclear energy can be used for the best and for the worst 
purposes. It can be useful and it can kill. It can save lives and it can 
eliminate thousands.
<P>
	The public will only accept atomic energy when it will see its 
peaceful applications and its usefulness in everyday life.
<P>
	It will only accept atomic energy when it will see that the 
government gave itself the means to control almost perfectly-I 
am tempted to leave out the word almost, but let us keep a margin 
for human error-all the risks related to its use and its 
development.
<P>
	Another important problem we should have been able to tackle 
openly in considering this bill in the House is the financing of 
Atomic Energy of Canada, the financing of CANDU reactors 
throughout the world. Financially, Atomic Energy of Canada is just 
as much of a bottomless pit as the Hibernia project off 
Newfoundland may turn out to be.
<P>
	Since this agency was created, billions of dollars have been sunk 
into it, and the government is only able to sell  CANDU reactors by
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3762"> 3762 </A></B>
<P>
financing them with money from Canadian and Quebec taxpayers. 
If that is not a scandal, what is?
<P>
	In reality, the sale of CANDU reactors, with their supposedly 
safe technology, is nothing more than a clever way of subsidizing 
Atomic Energy of Canada. This government would have done 
better to overhaul Atomic Energy of Canada's operating methods. 
The days when the government could squander taxpayers' money 
have long gone, and gone, I hope, forever.
<P>
	When a government slashes employment insurance, 
unemployment insurance, and gets ready to cut pensions and OAS, 
when a government attacks the poorest members of society, it 
should first clean up its own act.
<P>
	Yes, Bill C-23 represents a step forward. The Bloc Quebecois 
will vote in favour of this bill.
<P>
	I pointed out a number of things, and some amendments could 
probably be made.
<P>
	I am still critical of the fact that this bill should have been 
presented 10, 15 or 20 years ago, and at least at the beginning of 
this Legislature. But we we always have to wait. At a certain point, 
the government wakes up, but it is always ordinary citizens that get 
it started. In other words, this government needs a good push 
before it says: ``Oh dear, we have not been careful enough. For 50 
years now, safety has been lacking in the nuclear field''. In 1996, 
they told themselves it was time to get moving.
<P>
	This government is like that. The preceding government was no 
better. So, listen to the opposition for a bit longer. We are making 
some very good suggestions, because we listen more carefully to 
our constituents, and our constituents have a lot to tell us. I say that 
the average citizen is incredibly wise.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	When in power, a governement realizes that it is inevitably 
drawn away from the people. After three or four years, it realizes 
that the people are on one side and it is on the other. At this point in 
time, those who represent the people best are, of course, the 
opposition parties, and particularly the official opposition because 
it does not lean to the far right. When the left has good ideas, they 
are well received, when the right has good ideas, they are also well 
received. The important thing here is good ideas.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that this bill is a good bill and that it is 
long overdue. We will follow it closely because a bill in itself is not 
much, what counts is the way it is implemented. In that regard, we 
will be there to call the government to order if need be.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise tonight to express general support for the changes 
included in Bill C-23, the nuclear safety and control act.
<P>
	In part they reflect the changing background against which this 
act was originally written. The main present day concerns involve: 
the health and safety of Canadians working in and around 
radioactive material from the initial stages of mining right through 
to such things as nuclear power stations; medical and educational 
purposes; disposal of radioactive waste, both low level and high 
level; environmental concerns for all, especially for people living 
in the vicinity of nuclear power facilities; the safe disposal of 
nuclear waste; and the safe transportation of such hazardous 
products.
<P>
	I express general support for the method of putting this 
legislation together. This included reasonably extensive 
consultation with the four provinces which use nuclear power or 
mine uranium: Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec and New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	We understand there are concerns from the Government of 
Saskatchewan that Bill C-23 might hamper discussions regarding 
regulating the uranium mining and milling industry. There is also 
the possibility that Saskatchewan may wish to develop proper 
regulations of its own and may wish to license uranium mining and 
milling. Apparently the federal government's legal beagle so to 
speak has said that Bill C-23 does not interfere except where 
federal oversight is needed to maintain the federal role in nuclear 
matters.
<P>
	Reformers approve that regulating is being done on a cost 
recovery basis after some consultation took place with the industry 
about the fee schedules, with fees being phased in over a fairly 
extended period of time since the start of the procedure in 1990. I 
believe Canadians would strongly approve that hospitals and 
universities should be exempt from such fees.
<P>
	On the possible objections to Bill C-23, what bothers me the 
most is that it has taken 50 years to revamp an act which was 
passed in 1946. The government of the day, and whether it is 
Liberal or Conservative it never changes, always blames the other 
for taking so long to get something done, or for putting an act in 
place and the other one has to follow through on it. I remind the 
Liberals that probably for 38 years out of the past 50 years their 
party was the government so that excuse no longer washes.
<P>
	I also understand from a departmental briefing that changes to 
the Canadian Labour Code are needed regarding employees in 
nuclear industries if we do not want to have the federal government 
intervening in labour matters which are more properly dealt with 
by the provincial governments. This is a concern. I sincerely hope 
somebody has ensured that the changes were made. That was 
mentioned in a departmental briefing yesterday afternoon. They 
also mentioned that an update was needed on that point. I would 
appreciate it if the minister or the parliamentary secretary could 
confirm that for me.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3763"> 3763 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	Another concern arises where the federal government possibly 
will not do all in its power to eliminate overlap and duplication 
with the provinces by delegating responsibility for administration 
and inspection. Would there be one environmental assessment 
needed for the federal government and the provinces? Another is 
provincial inspections for normal health and safety of employees. 
The provinces could add radioactivity which would then not 
require that a separate federal inspector race around the country 
checking on this.
<P>
	I caution that every effort must be made to protect the safety of 
Canadians as cost effectively as possible. Nuclear disasters are a 
terrible risk to all of us and we have to have zero tolerance for 
serious accidents. We also recognize that uranium has tremendous 
potential to supply the energy needs of future generations, once 
adequate research has resolved the problems of the safe disposal of 
nuclear waste.
<P>
	We also recognize that uranium mining and milling is a 
developing industry which is significant for provinces such as 
Saskatchewan. The regulatory process must be kept clear, timely 
and based on science rather than politics or fearmongering.
<P>
	I also wonder about this government when, on a trade mission, it 
sells a nuclear reactor to China. Yet there seems to be great concern 
in this country, especially from the Reform Party, on human rights 
in that country. Where is the government coming from? Is it more 
in love with the almighty dollar than it is with human rights? I am 
concerned about this.
<P>
	In conclusion, when I was young I read the story about Rip van 
Winkle. I would have to say that after 50 years it is Rip van 
Liberals. Something hit them on the head and they woke up to the 
fact that they had to make this outdated policy more modern. They 
say it may be better late than never and I guess it is better late than 
never.
<P>
	We will support the bill. It is long overdue. I can do nothing but 
blame this government for the length of time it has taken.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is intended to replace the 1946 Atomic Energy Control Act. It is 
destined to remedy some of the problems encountered in the 
existing act and replace the Atomic Energy Control Board with a 
nuclear safety commission as described in Bill C-23.
<P>
	It seems to me one area of progress is that the new commission 
will have the authority to order remedial actions and seek financial 
guarantees for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. This is a 
very important central theme when it comes to nuclear power. This 
is important because in May 1995 the auditor general estimated 
that nuclear waste disposal solutions will cost at least $10 billion, I 
repeat $10 billion, over the next 70 years. He estimated that the 
federal  government's share of this cost would be around $850 
million minimum, and that this cost could increase if the federal 
government had to assume responsibilities for nuclear waste 
producers who fail to meet the clean-up and decommissioning 
obligations.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	This bill requires that all reactors and mines produce 
decommissioning plans by as early as January 1, 1997 which 
include cost estimates for so-called cradle to grave waste 
management responsibilities associated with the facility. This is a 
very good initiative embodied in the bill.
<P>
	In a cursory look at the bill itself, the language in clause 24(5) 
needs to be strengthened to ensure that licences necessarily contain 
a condition that the applicant provide a financial guarantee in a 
form and to an extent acceptable to the commission itself.
<P>
	Every effort must be made to ensure that the real cost of nuclear 
power production is absorbed by the producers and consumers. It 
must not be externalized, postponed or pushed into the future to be 
paid for at some later date by the Canadian public.
<P>
	At the present time, the decommissioning and nuclear waste 
disposal costs at Ontario Hydro are carried as an internal debt. In 
other words, as far as I was able to determine, no real dollars are 
being set aside for future decommissioning. Perhaps it is being 
done on paper, but that is the extent of the provision being made 
right now for future generations. When needed, Ontario Hydro 
would then borrow the money.
<P>
	I have been informed by the Minister of Natural Resources that it 
is Ontario Hydro's intention to change this practice in the near 
future and to begin to set aside real dollars in an external fund. This 
is an urgent matter. When the time for decommissioning comes, 
one is not certain that the utility will be in a position to borrow the 
required funds. Only through setting aside dollars in an external 
special fund that is known and visible to the public can the long 
term interest of the public be properly served.
<P>
	In addition to setting aside real funds for decommissioning 
reactors, the cradle to grave management of nuclear waste also 
requires that an appropriate amount be set aside for that purpose. 
Here again the auditor general has warned us of the magnitude of 
the nuclear waste problem over the next decades. It seems only 
reasonable to say at this stage that the new commission must ensure 
the necessary funds be made available.
<P>
	For example, there are some 130 tonnes of radioactive sand in 
Elliot Lake which must be stabilized. By contrast in the United 
States, there are only 200 million tonnes of radioactive tailings. By 
law there, the tailings must be properly stabilized. Mining 
companies have already spent $2 billion to accomplish this. Here in 
Canada the mining company in Elliot Lake is talking of posting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3764"> 3764 </A></B>
<P>
some  $4 million in the form of a bond to cover the stabilization of 
the tailings. You can see the difference in approach, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	It is hoped the new commission will ensure that in both the 
private and the public sectors-I hope the production of nuclear 
electricity will be in the public sector-the full cost of nuclear 
power will be paid by producers and consumers from start to end, 
from production to the final disposition of the spent materials, from 
cradle to grave as it is commonly said.
<P>
	Another aspect of this bill requires attention. Bill C-23, which is 
entitled an act to establish the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission and to make consequential amendments to other acts, 
allows for the incorporation of provincial laws in the nuclear safety 
and control act and the delegation of administration and 
enforcement to the provinces. This legislation could lead to the 
devolution of regulatory powers for nuclear energy to the 
provinces. With provincial budget cuts of the magnitude that have 
been announced, for instance in Ontario, one wonders whether the 
delegation of administration and enforcement is desirable and in 
the public interest.
<P>
	Premier Harris and his government have shown a real interest in 
deregulation in areas of environmental protection and public 
responsibility by government. For instance, the Ontario 
government's red tape commission is presently examining 
proposals to increase toxic effluents from mines into water bodies. 
Second, the omnibus Bill 26 opens up conservation areas for 
development. If this were not enough, omnibus Bill 26 shifts the 
liability for abandoned mines and tailing sites from the private to 
the public sector.
<P>
	The risks associated with nuclear power are, as we all know, to 
be watched. They require direct federal regulatory approaches. 
They require a federal presence, a federal responsibility in order to 
ensure the safety of Canadians and their environment.
<P>
	In a cursory review of the bill, I notice that clause 24 needs to be 
strengthened. I would say the same for clause 42 which deals with 
indemnity and liability under the Nuclear Liability Act, and for 
clause 46 which deals with the treatment of contaminated land.
<P>
	The Nuclear Liability Act must be mentioned in this debate 
because it is an act that needs to be revisited. It needs to be 
strengthened. The liability in our statutory legislation is too low. 
Times, costs, inflation and other factors require that the 
government bring this legislation to the House and modify, 
increase and modernize the approach that was perhaps adequate 
when that legislation was passed a few decades ago but is no longer 
adequate now. Therefore I urge the government to bring the 
Nuclear Liability Act into this House with the necessary 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(2005 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to make two points. First, the nuclear industry is 
most likely the most subsidized industry in Canada. It has received, 
since its inception, over $5 billion of direct payments. Even now, in 
times of austerity, we will find an item in the budget of the 
Department of Natural Resources for a direct grant which exceeds 
$100 million, maybe in the range of $142 million or $145 million. 
Last year it was twice as much. It is an industry that is constantly 
being subsidized by the public at large. It is a subsidy that must 
come to an end. If everybody has to tighten their belts, from those 
who have to go on unemployment insurance to those who receive 
pensions, then the subsidies to industry also have to stop.
<P>
	Second, our dependence on oil and nuclear sources of energy has 
to be examined and gradually changed. We need to plan for the 
future by shifting our dependence from the non-renewables such as 
fossil fuels and our dependence on the renewables as represented 
by the rather costly and, at times, dangerous nuclear source of 
energy to renewable sources.
<P>
	However, in order to do that research and development have to 
be activated. Emphasis should be shifted from the continuous 
support for nuclear and fossil fuels to sources that range from 
biomass to solar and other forms of energy that are definitely 
within reach if the funds are put into research and development that 
are required in order to enhance and accelerate the process of 
reaching these potential alternatives that are definitely available to 
humanity.
<P>
	Therefore, I hope this bill represents a temporary measure. It 
recognizes our dependence on nuclear power. I call on the 
government to ensure that this dependence is not increased, that the 
constant subsidization of the nuclear industry is eliminated, that we 
ensure that the liability is adequate, and that we move to the 
discovery of technologies that will provide Canadians and society 
at large with clean and safe sources of energy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know the members opposite are keen to hear another speech on Bill 
C-23, the nuclear safety act.
<P>
	As members know, I have a new role within the party and I do 
not have a lot to do with this bill, but I did spend several months as 
the critic in the natural resource area and did quite a bit of work in 
this area. Therefore, I would just like to make a few comments 
before the bill passes.
<P>
	As has been mentioned already by our critic, Reform members 
will be supporting this bill, but there are a few things we would like 
to see changed. However, this is a good bill and long overdue.
<P>
	The comments made by the hon. member for Davenport were, by 
and large, very accurate and very well taken. His concern with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3765"> 3765 </A></B>
<P>
decommissioning costs,  with the true costs of the creation of 
electrical power from nuclear energy being reflected in the cost to 
the consumer, is an accurate statement and something that has not 
been done. It has created an enormous liability for the federal 
government and provincial governments, but specifically for the 
federal government as it is on the hook for billions of dollars. That 
is an unfortunate and should have been addressed years ago. This 
bill starts the process of correcting that but it has been a long time 
coming.
<P>
<B>(2010 )</B>
<P>
	We can do a few things to strengthen the bill. It has been 
mentioned by several people that the bill has been a long time 
coming. The minister promised it a year ago, again last fall and it 
finally came in this spring. We are grateful for it after a 50-year 
wait. It increases some of the fines and punishments that can be 
dished out. The existing punishments are ridiculously low. A 
maximum of $10,000 can be charged under the old act, which is a 
laughable amount.
<P>
	The bill deals with the overlap and duplication of arrangements 
between provinces and the federal government. However, 
Reformers have several concerns about the bill.
<P>
	First and most important is the treatment of radioactive waste. I 
mentioned that the bill has been a long time coming. While we 
have been waiting, in the last year or two there have been 
developments which are placing the federal government and the 
taxpayers on the hook for big bucks. It is going to end up costing a 
lot of money.
<P>
	This has been delayed not only by this government but by 
previous Liberal governments that had introduced bills and then let 
them die on the Order Paper. It was introduced by the 
Conservatives who also let it die. Now finally, hopefully, we can 
get through the bill quickly and get royal assent.
<P>
	In 1994 the Atomic Energy Control Board Secretary General 
J.G. McManus said about the old Atomic Energy Control Act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The deficiencies of the Atomic Energy Control Act have been noted by the 
courts, the media, special interest groups and parliamentary committees. They 
include the lack of formal powers for AECB inspectors, an inadequate ceiling 
on the $10,000 on fines, no stated provision for public hearings, lack of explicit 
power to recover the cost of regulation from the users, an inability to hold 
polluters financially accountable for their actions or for the AECB to initiate 
remedial action and recover the costs-the AECB is handicapped by its 
statutory underpinnings which reflect the needs of another age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is really a synopsis of the speech by the hon. member for 
Davenport and almost a synopsis of mine. However, I should go 
through it in just a little more detail for the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	There are no nuclear reactors in British Columbia. It is not a big 
issue and I doubt that it ever will be because I do not think that 
there is a chance to get public approval for a nuclear energy plant in 
British Columbia. I cannot foresee that day. However, people in 
B.C. are very environmentally concerned and this is very high on 
their list of concerns. As taxpayers they are also concerned about 
the amount of money that may be required to fix this long lasting 
nuclear problem.
<P>
	Nuclear waste is a big problem. To dispose of low level waste in 
Ontario is going to cost at least $300 million. That is just an 
estimate. If anything goes wrong in the transportation or the 
disposal it could be much higher. That is just $300 million to start.
<P>
	I have been to the high level waste test sites where they are 
trying to find ways to dispose of the high level wastes in Pinawa. 
To bury this high level waste will cost from $13 billion to $16 
billion and that is just an estimate. If track records mean anything it 
is likely to be much higher. The problem for everybody across 
Canada is that the tab will have to be picked up by the Canadian 
taxpayer.
<P>
	I think members on the other side are trying to make the nuclear 
sign with their hands. So I will go on for a bit longer about this 
particular cause.
<P>
	Over the last 20 years if there had been a fund established to look 
after the decommissioning costs of the nuclear sites and the wastes 
generated, then this would almost be a housekeeping bill. No one 
would much care about the details because at least the dollars 
would have been looked after. However, there was nothing set up 
20 years ago and billions of dollars are going to have to be paid by a 
generation that did not benefit from that electrical energy.
<P>
<B>(2015)</B>
<P>
	This is a principle which I would hope the Liberal government 
would pay attention to on more issues. The government is now 
concerned that the generation which will benefit from this 
electrical power should be the one that pays for it. If we translated 
that into other government legislation, we would not have a 
national debt which is pushing $600 billion.
<P>
	If the government was concerned about ensuring that the 
generation which is benefiting from programs or benefiting from 
government largesse was the one paying the bills, who could argue 
with that? However, governments have saddled future generations 
with excessively high tax rates and problems such as this one which 
will cost billions of dollars to correct.
<P>
	When I talk to high school students about this intergenerational 
transfer of wealth and the fact that people in the federal 
government have been satisfied to saddle them with these bills, 
they are upset. We cannot blame them. They will be paying the 
taxes, the pensions, UI premiums and everything else at 
excessively high  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3766"> 3766 </A></B>
<P>
rates. When I mention to them that there will be another $13 billion 
or $15 billion for a nuclear clean-up and that their environmentally 
conscious generation will have to pay the bills which their fathers 
and grandfathers ran up, they are not impressed. It is not right.
<P>
	The principle should be that if we create an environmental mess, 
we should clean it up. If the government has a problem, it should 
pay for it now. It should not ask our children and our children's 
children to clean up the mess which is being created now. 
Procrastination has created the problems. It is unfair both 
financially and environmentally to put off what should have been 
done a long time ago.
<P>
	With respect to the funding of the clean-up, there is no fund in 
place. It is a real problem. There are some bookkeeping entries and 
yes there is an obligation. However, as the hon. member for 
Davenport has pointed out, there is no fund. If it is going to cost 
$10 billion or $20 billion to clean up this mess and we ask where 
the money will come from, the government will say that it will 
come out of general revenue when the time comes. That may be 10 
or 20 years from now. If that is not another intergenerational 
transfer of wealth I do not know what is.
<P>
	The government is going to ask somebody to pay for it down the 
road. When we think of the clean up of the tailings from mines, the 
clean up of some sites such as the Bruce power plant and so on, we 
should start setting aside a significant amount of dollars now so 
that the current consumers and producers will fund those clean-ups. 
Reformers believe that the policy of pay as you go certainly applies 
to environmental clean-ups and definitely to the nuclear industry.
<P>
	In April I received a letter from the Saskatchewan minister of 
energy and mines, the hon. Eldon Lautermilch. It was in response 
to a letter I had written to him concerning this legislation. He said 
that there was concern about overlap and duplication in the 
regulation of the uranium mining and milling operations and that 
therefore they were disappointed with the limited provisions within 
the act to delegate administration to the provinces.
<P>
	That lack of ability to delegate responsibility is something we 
will address in committee with an amendment to try to at least give 
the power to delegate. In other words, we will try to reduce the 
amount of duplication between the federal and provincial 
governments and allow the federal government to delegate to the 
provinces on that issue. Saskatchewan would be the major 
benefactor of that.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	We have suggested that the act could be amended to allow for a 
clearer division of responsibilities between the federal and 
provincial governments in the whole area of the clean up of the 
tailings from uranium mines that have  now been decommissioned. 
There are problems with leaching and with who is responsible for 
the clean up. On the one hand it is a provincial resource and on the 
other hand it has been regulated by the federal government. We 
have to solve the financial mess and the environmental mess that 
goes with that.
<P>
	We have general concerns about the independence of the board 
from politicians. We do not want a board that is made up of people 
who have been appointed because they have a paid up Liberal card. 
We want to make sure that people who are appointed to this board, 
a superboard with superpowers, will be qualified and will be the 
right people.
<P>
	We have suggested that board members not be appointed by a 
House of Commons standing committee but could be approved or 
vetoed by the committee. In other words, let us have people who 
have general qualifications. They could come before a committee 
and say what they were going to do and why they should have the 
job regardless of their political background and we could be 
satisfied with their qualifications. That would be an improvement 
as well.
<P>
	We have a small problem with the make up of the board. In 1985 
the Nielsen commission said the board was too small and the size 
of the board has been increased somewhat. That was a good idea 
but it has still been left that just two members have to be full time 
members. We think two full time members on this board is not 
going to be enough. This board is going to have a lot of powers and 
a lot of responsibilities. With the responsibilities the board has 
been given under this act, more members will be need.
<P>
	This new act is going to add legitimacy to this commission. The 
confidence Canadians have in the nuclear industry will increase if 
they see that the commission has powers and follows through on 
some of the problems that the member for Davenport, the auditor 
general, the Nielsen report and other reports have consistently 
identified for all to see.
<P>
	To give Ontario credit, hearings on the nuclear industry have 
been held from time to time and in times past all these hearings 
have been public hearings. But the act does not specify that any 
hearings relating to the nuclear industry must be public hearings. It 
should be changed so that hearings must be held. Canadians can 
then be assured that the process is very open and that nothing is 
hidden from them and nothing is being done behind closed doors.
<P>
	I know the government, given its track record for example on 
constitutional issues, would never want to do something behind 
closed doors I am sure. Well maybe I am not entirely convinced but 
certainly that is an amendment we will be proposing because we 
want things out in the open.
<P>
	In conclusion, we welcome this act. As it goes to committee we 
are going to find widespread agreement on the act.
<P>

<P>
	I will put in a little plug for my private member's bill which also 
deals with the nuclear industry and the need for liability insurance 
in order to protect the Canadian taxpayer and the Canadian public. 
There is some room for that which is not addressed in this act. 
There is a necessity to update the nuclear industry regulation into 
the 21st century so that Canadians can have confidence that the 
regulation and control of the industry will make it as safe as 
possible.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-25, an act respecting 
regulations and other documents, including the review, 
registration, publication and parliamentary scrutiny of regulations 
and other documents, and to make consequential and related 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
move that Bill C-25, the new regulations act, be approved in 
principle.
<P>
	Let me say how pleased we are to have had the benefit of 
prestudy by a subcommittee of the government operations 
committee in the last session. Even though the subcommittee's 
hearings were interrupted by the prorogation, the input we received 
has allowed us to make some slight technical modifications to the 
bill that result in an overall improvement without altering the 
substance of the bill. We are very much appreciative of the 
assistance provided by the government operations subcommittee 
and the members of the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny 
of Regulations who sat on the subcommittee.
<P>
	Regulatory reform continues to be an area of broad interest to 
Canadians. There are many avenues which the government is 
pursuing in a way to improve the way it regulates. The new 
regulations act offers important  improvements to the Canadian 
system of regulation established almost a quarter of a century ago 
by the Statutory Instruments Act. This act will streamline the 
regulatory process and reduce delays in the current process by 
which regulations are made at the federal level in Canada. This will 
allow regulations to be changed more readily to respond to new 
circumstances and needs.
<P>
	Although these reforms were announced as part of this 
government's broader efforts toward building a more innovative 
economy and improving jobs and growth, the problems created by 
the current regulatory process have been identified many times 
during the past few years. Calls for changes have been most 
recently heard in the course of the public consultations that took 
place during the government wide regulatory review in 1992 and 
1993. As well, the reforms aim to modernize and reform the legal 
framework for regulation making at the federal level.
<P>
	The Statutory Instruments Act was designed for an earlier era of 
regulation. It is complex, cumbersome, slow and overburdened and 
this imposes a real cost to all Canadians. Outdated and 
inappropriate regulatory schemes can impact negatively on respect 
for law, competitiveness and economic growth as well as upon the 
working relations of the regulated private sector and government 
regulators.
<P>
	Outdated regulatory schemes that are not well tailored to 
changing circumstances increase the government costs of obtaining 
compliance. Delays in modernizing and improving regulatory 
schemes reduce the ability of government to respond to new 
developments in the fields of health, safety, the environment, 
international trade and federal-provincial relations.
<P>
<B>(2030 )</B>
<P>
	The negative impact of a slow and cumbersome regulatory 
process is also experienced by Canadian businesses because of 
outdated and inappropriate regulations that tend to reduce 
competitiveness and economic growth, generally speaking.
<P>
	The limitations and the delays that are created by the existing 
regulation making system result in hidden, but very real, costs to 
all Canadians in the form of increased expenditure of revenues 
spent in enforcing outdated and inappropriate regulations and 
reduced competitiveness in the global marketplace.
<P>
	No one could seriously dispute that the current regulatory 
process must be reformed in order to keep pace with the current 
realities of regulation in the 1990s and into the 21st century. Bill 
C-25 will improve the regulatory process for the benefit of all 
Canadians. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that reform 
of the Statutory Instruments Act calls for a careful balancing of 
different interests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3768"> 3768 </A></B>
<P>
	In the new act, the objectives of streamlining, simplifying and 
expediting the regulation making process  are achieved without 
compromising equally important goals of ensuring adequate 
opportunity for notice, public comment and effective oversight by 
Parliament of the creation of binding, subordinate legislation.
<P>
	It is important, therefore, to emphasize that the reforms being 
proposed in the regulations act are largely technical improvements 
that would not radically alter the existing process. Rather, they will 
clarify existing legal uncertainties that give rise to debate and 
delay, simplify steps where appropriate and modernize the process.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that the new regulations act will 
preserve and strengthen the fundamental principles and objectives 
of the Statutory Instruments Act, which provides legal safeguards 
necessary in making binding laws such as regulations.
<P>
	These objectives include ensuring the legality, transparency and 
accessibility of regulations and providing a meaningful opportunity 
for parliamentary oversight of the executive in the exercise of this 
law making power.
<P>
	The new act will improve the capacity of government to respond 
quickly and effectively to public concerns as well as to changing 
rapidly for the circumstances of the global economy. It will also 
reduce the overall volume of regulations that go through the system 
and provide an expedited process, where appropriate, and allow for 
a more effective use of incorporation by reference. It will create a 
framework for achieving important administrative improvements 
in the way government departments handle regulation making as 
well.
<P>
	By facilitating amendment or replacing an outdated regulatory 
scheme, regulating departments will be better placed to implement 
new ideas about how to regulate more effectively, and at a lower 
cost, to all Canadians.
<P>
	The reforms found in Bill C-25 will create a new regulations act 
that will be better tailored to the contemporary regulatory climate.
<P>
	I would like to briefly outline some of the key elements of 
reform that are found in this bill. They are a simpler, more 
principled definition of regulation and other plain language 
improvements; an appropriate view of different classes of 
documents, including an expedited process for documents that do 
not require legal review; a revised exemption power that will now 
be subject to an express public interest consideration; a 
codification and clarification of the law by expressly authorizing 
the incorporation by reference of international and other standards 
into regulations, subject to an express accessibility requirement; a 
modernized process that allows for the creation of an electronic 
registry of regulations; and finally, maintenance for government 
accountability for regulations through parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	The new regulations act will relieve the system of documents 
that do not need to be subject to the regulatory process or at least to 
the whole process, either because they are not substantive or truly 
regulatory in the sense of establishing generally binding rules of 
conduct, or because their legality and accessibility are assured in 
some other way. This will allow the attention as well as the 
resources of the regulatory process and of the Standing Joint 
Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations to be focused on the 
important legal instruments that warrant that attention.
<P>
	With respect to the provisions on incorporation by reference, it is 
important to understand that they do not create a new regulatory 
technique. They merely clarify and codify a legal technique that is 
currently being widely used across Canada, and whose legitimacy 
has been recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada. This 
technique is widely employed in Europe and has been advocated by 
the Standards Council of Canada and many international bodies, 
including the International Standards Organization in Geneva.
<P>
	Incorporation of standards into regulations, particularly as they 
are amended from time to time, is an important way for 
government to promote the goals of international and 
intergovernmental harmonization of regulatory standards. Reliance 
on the expertise and timeliness of international and interprovincial 
standards writing organizations is of significant value in promoting 
Canadian competitiveness, particularly in contexts of rapid 
technological change. The usefulness of this technique in 
promoting Canadian competitiveness was recognized in the 1993 
report of the finance subcommittee on regulations and 
competitiveness.
<P>
	I am confident that ministers and cabinet can be relied on to 
ensure that incorporation by reference of standards that exist as of a 
certain date or as amended from time to time will be employed in 
appropriate circumstances and that the bodies creating the 
standards are expert and reliable such that Canadians will be 
satisfied with the standards that are being adopted.
<P>
	While these provisions on incorporation by reference simply 
reflect the current law and practice, I would like to draw members' 
attention to the fact that we are also proposing a significant 
improvement over the current practice in that the new regulations 
act would create an expressed statutory duty on regulating 
departments to ensure that incorporated materials are accessible.
<P>
	I also want to emphasize that the improvements offered by Bill 
C-25 will not be at the cost of the equally important objectives of 
the regulatory process, including necessary parliamentary review 
of regulations. The new act will not only preserve but strengthen 
the role currently played by the Standing Joint Committee for the 
Scrutiny of Regulations by providing that all regulations that meet 
the new simplified but principled definition of  regulations will 
stand permanently referred to that committee, together will all 
other documents that are required to be registered. The standing 
joint committee will be free at any time to call for review and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3769"> 3769 </A></B>
<P>
comment on regulations that incorporate materials, and in so doing 
will have access as well to the incorporated material. The structure 
of the current Statutory Instruments Act limits the instruments that 
are referred to the standing joint committee in a way that the 
proposed act will not do.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	Clear cost savings and environmental benefits will result from 
the proposed electronic registry with a reduced reliance on paper. 
The registry will also ultimately provide regulated communities, 
interest groups and the public generally with quicker and more 
direct means of consultation and commentary on proposed 
regulatory changes.
<P>
	We are well aware that not all Canadians are computer literate 
yet and that access to laws published in paper form will continue to 
be the method of choice for many Canadians. Therefore, I would 
like to emphasize that the proposed electronic system is intended to 
supplement and not replace the existing system of paper, 
publication and access. Regulations will continue to be widely 
available in paper format. They will be published in the Canada 
Gazette which is accessible through local libraries and by 
subscription. Under the act paper copies can also be requested from 
the Office of the Clerk of the Privy Council or from the 
departments responsible for the regulations.
<P>
	The regulatory process provided for in the Statutory Instruments 
Act is too complex and burdensome to be able to keep pace with the 
changing regulatory needs. The overall effect of the reforms 
contained in Bill C-25 will be less stress on the existing system by 
reducing the number and volume of regulations subject to the 
general regulatory process while preserving the important value 
embodied in the original scheme.
<P>
	The result will be a system that is more responsive and efficient, 
which will be in a better position to give the federal government a 
renewal that modernizes the existing regulatory process and put in 
place regulatory schemes that better address the need and the 
interests of Canadians, both the general public and the regulated 
communities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
first opportunity I have to speak to Bill C-25, entitled Regulations 
Act. This bill had been introduced in the House last fall under the 
number C-84. Before that, there was the famous Bill C-62, the 
Regulatory Efficiency Act. I think the hon. member for 
Fundy-Royal remembers it. Bill C-62 died on the Order Paper 
and, as he was saying, Bill C-84 was introduced last fall.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member for Fundy-Royal should remember 
the saying that the bird that sings best does not always sing the 
longest. He would certainly have heaped less praise on Bill C-84. I 
would just like to remind him that I was a member of the 
sub-committee he mentioned. That sub-committee convened once 
to set up and, a second time, for about half an hour, in the building 
facing us, to meet the officials who came to explain the bill to us. 
Unfortunately, that meeting was interrupted by the bell calling us 
in. We came to vote and, after that, we never heard about the 
sub-committee on Bill C-84.
<P>
	We had made some recommendations to the justice department, 
particularly to the solicitor general of Canada. We had told him it 
would be worthwhile to examine that bill in committee, before 
second reading, because of its effects on the daily lives of 
businesses, of citizens, of all Canadians. That committee should 
have been made up of members of the Joint Standing Committee on 
the Scrutiny of Regulations.
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	As you know a committee was created some 20 years ago, 
pursuant to Standing Order 90, I believe, namely the Joint 
Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations, which I co-chair with 
Senator Lewis. The main purpose of this committee is to scrutinize 
all regulations under federal legislation. The work load of the 
committee is staggering. Every year, we must study between 800 
and 1,000 statutory instruments. We report to the House and make 
recommendations to the department concerned. We have a team of 
lawyers working for the committee.
<P>
	This committee of experts would have been in the best position 
to give advice to the House. We know what happened last fall. The 
House adjourned for the Christmas recess. In February, the session 
was prorogued to the end of February. All the bills which had died 
on the Order Paper reappeared on the legislative agenda under a 
different number and Bill C-84 became C-25. In spite of these 
cosmetic changes, the content of the bill is still the same.
<P>
	When I told my colleague opposite that sometimes the bird that 
sings best does not sing the longest I meant that, if I were him, I 
would not have dared to praise this bill and present it to the House 
as if it were the best thing since sliced bread. On the contrary, I 
believe the member should think twice about it, and I am going to 
give him arguments which hopefully will make him change his 
mind.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, your silence tells me you support my approach. 
Silence gives consent, obviously. Through you, I will make my 
arguments known to the member for Fundy-Royal. Regulation is 
defined as a series of rules established and enforced by the state to 
limit or clarify the nature of a society's economic and social 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3770"> 3770 </A></B>
<P>
activity. Regulation is made following the adoption of a law. That  
is our rule, the one we know now, the one that has always prevailed 
in this Parliament.
<P>
	In practice, most regulations are drafted and adopted by Cabinet. 
There are an average of 800 new regulations each year. They deal 
with all kinds of things, some very significant, others less 
significant, from the diameter of dimes to the fission of the atom. 
Regulations are always important and must be consistent with the 
spirit and letter of the enabling act. So, in practice, regulations are 
proposed by Cabinet and adopted by the governor-in-council.
<P>
	Regulation has become the most common form of public 
intervention. It would be unthinkable to monopolize the House and 
its 295 members every time a regulatory change is needed. If the 
House was called upon to make these changes, it would soon be 
completely paralysed. The regulatory process is something useful 
that we all want.
<P>
	It is governed by the Statutory Instruments Act. The revision 
process was initiated in January 1993 when the finance committee 
called for a comprehensive review of the regulatory process. Bill 
C-25 is the final result of this reform undertaken more than three 
years ago.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, it is almost identical to its predecessor, Bill 
C-84, which was introduced during the first session of this 35th 
Parliament. In December 1993, the subcommittee on regulations 
and competitiveness of the Standing Committee on Finance of the 
House of Commons released its report entitled <I>Regulations and 
Competitiveness</I>, in which it included the results of its analysis of 
the impact of regulations on competitiveness.
<P>
	The then Conservative government gave the report a rather good 
reception. The Bloc Quebecois does not deny the fact that the 
current process can sometimes, and I would go as far as saying 
quite often, lead to delays and thus additional costs. So, it was in 
everyone's best interest to try to review the regulatory process so 
that our corporations which rely on it could benefit from it, by 
reducing their production costs or simply their operation costs.
<P>
	The objectives of the parliamentarians were to develop a 
regulatory system that could produce a high quality product while 
eliminating all the garbage by improving the drafting, 
implementation and evaluation of regulations.
<P>
	Since several recommendations found in the subcommittee 
report support a more comprehensive framework for the regulatory 
process and for the role played by the Treasury Board president and 
secretariat in that process, the government should have included in 
Bill C-25 additional obligations at some other stages of the 
regulatory process.
<P>
	For instance, the government could have racked its brains a bit 
more-although that is not its forte-and tried to elaborate some 
more on the decision to regulate. It could have asked 
parliamentarians or the appropriate authority to hold hearings and 
consultations, to develop the regulations and do a cost-benefit 
analysis of the regulations.
<P>
	It could also have defined the powers of the Treasury Board 
president and secretariat. Thus the government would have 
respected the will of the elected members of the last Parliament and 
put into place a more restrictive legislative framework for the civil 
servants. Remember this: the legislative framework is the 
watchdog of the subdelegation of powers as we see it.
<P>
	If we let the civil servants do as they want, without any legal 
restriction whatsoever, we may after a while find ourselves with 
legal monsters, a court overload never ever seen before and 
administrative costs a hundred times higher than those we wanted 
to avoid in the first place with this defective regulation.
<P>
	What I understand also is that, since the administration of justice 
is a provincial responsibility, the federal government keeps its 
money and sees to it that others foot the bill. It legislates on 
principles but never on anything more definite. It says: ``The courts 
will decide.'' But the provinces are the ones who pay the courts. 
They are the ones who pay the judges. That costs a bundle.
<P>
	What is saved with one hand is spent with the other. The hon. 
member for Fundy-Royal did not dwell on that because he is not 
known for helping taxpayers or the provinces save money.
<P>
	As it is, Bill C-25 does not provide any framework for the 
regulatory powers of the Treasury Board. Several stages of the 
regulatory process, that is, the decision making, the preparation of 
the regulation, the consultation of all those concerned and the 
cost-benefit analysis, remain the responsibility of the civil servants 
pursuant to Bill C-25.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board is under no legal obligation 
to develop such directives and the regulatory agencies are under no 
legal obligation to respect them. This is swell.
<P>
	I will take Bill C-25 as is but I will not examine it in detail.
<P>
<B>(2055)</B>
<P>
	I will not do a clause-by-clause review. However, I must admit 
there are some good things. First off I said we must try to reduce 
costs associated with the regulation process as well as the 
repercussions it can have on businesses.
<P>
	Section 2 of the old Statutory Instruments Act gave an 
ambiguous definition of statutory instruments or regulations. It was 
confusing. Sooner or later, lawyers  from the department or the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3771"> 3771 </A></B>
<P>
private sector take the matter before the courts. Then people 
complain about the cost.
<P>
	Therefore we have grouped under the word ``regulation'' general 
implementation texts established under a federal law and creating 
unilaterally binding rules of conduct. This is fine, but we must still 
take into consideration the way the government sees privatization.
<P>
	It happens on a regular basis. Airports are privatized. We have 
autonomous Crown corporations like Post Canada, Atomic Energy 
of Canada, Telesat Canada and numerous other agencies which are 
creations of the federal government but still have powers of their 
own. Their enabling act empowers them to adopt standards and to 
legislate.
<P>
	These people, companies, interests, are not touched by Bill C-25. 
This was a concern for the Standing Committee on scrutiny of 
regulations, of which I am a joint-chairman. We received 
complaints from people affected by the regulations. We could 
easily see there was something wrong. The legislator's intent had 
not been respected.
<P>
	Since their regulation did not stem from a statute of Parliament 
but rather from an independent agency, we could not check it or 
make recommendations to the House. Bill C-25 does not change 
that; the situation will be the same and could even get worse. We 
talked, for example, about the corporation created from scratch by 
the federal government to provide air navigation services. That 
corporation, like others, will be exempt from control under Bill 
C-25.
<P>
	Already Bill C-25 has the pernicious, and I almost said perverse 
and secret effect of excluding all parliamentarians from the 
decision making process. This is again a new approach, a Liberal 
type of neo-federalism whereby management is all done behind 
closed doors. They make regulations which, more often than not, 
give preference to major contributors to their slush fund.
<P>
	They can adopt standards that apply only to them, that are 
profitable only for them. They can do it secretly, without 
publishing the information so the adversaries will not know about 
it, so that the Tories will not know that Mr. Bronfman gave to both 
the Liberals and the Tories. Nothing is published, all is kept secret 
so everything looks fine.
<P>
	I can see where they are going. They come here and sit down and 
say that the past can vouch for the future. It is easy to say that with 
a $600 billion debt. It was not the Bloc Quebecois that invented all 
those standards. My great-grandchildren will still be paying for 
that debt.
<P>
	They can very well brag and say that if God had not created 
them, the world would be coming to an end, but I disagree. It might 
be the beginning of a better world, since the debt might not be so 
huge.
<P>
	I listen to the member for Mount Royal- You know, I think I 
preferred the great Groulx to Pettigrew.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> So you prefer that type of approach?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I was referring to the priest.
<P>
<B>(2100)</B>
<P>
	The regulatory process can be very onerous at times, but 
democracy has a price. All of us would like everything to be 
democratic, but we would rather not pay for that. Unfortunately, 
human beings will be human beings, Mr. Speaker. I know from 
your silence that you agree. I am sure my remarks are accurate, and 
I can assure you I have the best intentions. Even the Prime Minister 
would not stand up to contradict me. And the hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel will not do so either, because they know I 
am right. These people know that governing a country is important, 
and that the implications are enormous. Sometimes, when we make 
miserly economies, we run the risk of stalling the economy and 
doing more harm than good.
<P>
	I let the hon. member across throw me off track, but I will now 
go on. I was commenting on a few clauses in the bill. The hon. 
member for Fundy-Royal has praised incorporation by reference.
<P>
	It is not that simple. Clause 19 or 20 of the bill, I believe, deals 
with incorporation by reference. The hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel will no doubt agree that this procedure 
can be interesting when you need to incorporate things like 
automobile standards. Instead of putting them in regulations, it is 
more simple to say that we accept the standards set in such and 
such a book of specifications by General Motors on such and such a 
date. That is fine, but incorporation by reference can also have 
unwanted consequences.
<P>
	You will recall an incorporation by reference involving the 
number 6803, which states that calculating pension income for 
someone who has worked in the U.S. for some years and might be 
entitled to a pension requires reference to American Government 
Order no. 6803 to determine the amount of pension. Order 6803, 
however, may be cost of living indexed, and we who have referred 
to it, to an authority outside of Canada, attempt to comply because 
we are not the ones to decide, a foreign government is.
<P>
	It might have been wise to state, and I am in agreement with the 
government on this, that when there is incorporation by reference, 
this may include a foreign government such as the U.S. 
Government. This is not done, however, and so we find ourselves 
before the courts, who will tell us that it is unacceptable for a 
regulation passed in the United States to be applied by reference to 
Canadians.
<P>
	There will also be another problem. Some will say that the 
regulation was adopted in English only in the United States. Does 
that not contravene section 133 of Canada's  Constitution? This is 
going to be another problem. The intent was to lower the standards, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3772"> 3772 </A></B>
<P>
and then we will be forced to increase the number of justices on the 
Supreme Court from 9 to 27 overnight.
<P>
	So you see, in an effort to make savings, we are going to find 
ourselves with additional expenditures. Thus, although we start out 
with good intentions, when laws are badly written, we end up with 
legal monsters of a sort. It does not look like anything. We cannot 
make head or tail of it. We do not know what it is. After all, it 
probably does not amount to much. This could, however, reward 
and benefit friends of the party, who, thanks to vague and 
ambiguous documents, could end up getting some kind of norm 
applying only to them.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	One of my constituents, for whom I have the greatest respect, 
told me he had heard that the post office in Chambly was for sale. It 
could have been. When you do not need a post office any longer, 
you sell it. He was interested in bidding for it. So, I called Canada 
Post to ask if the post office was for sale. I was told that, no, they 
had not decided to sell it. So I ask for an assurance that if ever it is 
put up for sale there will be a public call for tenders. They replied: 
``Oh, no, Mr. Lebel, we cannot give you that assurance''. If they 
wanted to, the post office could even be given away. They are not 
under any obligation to follow the regulations of the House of 
Commons, to call for tenders, etc. If they want, they can give it 
away even if people are willing to pay a good price for that post 
office.
<P>
	The only rule Canada Post Corporation has to abide by is that it 
must come before the House of Commons every year to say it is 
making profits. As long as there are profits, nobody complains. 
That is what I was told and I know these people are acting in good 
faith. They will not give the post office away. However, I know that 
legally they could do so because they do not come under the control 
of the House of Commons.
<P>
	All we are doing here is giving them some appropriations when 
they are in the red. However, we do not ask them anything when 
they are making money. In this way, it is always the taxpayer who 
pays.
<P>
	What I just said pertains to incorporation by reference. There is 
another aspect to this bill. It also deals with the publication of bills 
and regulations. The rules are changed by saying: ``The Governor 
in Council may, by regulation, exempt from the application of the 
regulatory process a regulation or class of regulations that was 
prescribed under- the- Act as exempt from examination, 
registration or publication under that Act immediately before its 
repeal''. There was none. There were not many, but there were still 
a few.
<P>
	It says a regulation may be published, but also that it may not be 
published. No one can be convicted on the basis of the publication 
of that regulation, if means had  not been taken to make it known 
appropriately. But this provision is rather vague. It says that people 
should know about a regulation even though it was not published. 
They should have realized that; they are smarter than that. There is 
no strict rule. That is the bill's greatest flaw.
<P>
	I said at the beginning of my speech that the hon. member for 
Fundy-Royal should not have been so full of praise; I wonder if 
he did read the bill.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is still sitting; he is not rising to his feet 
because he knows I am right. He will not rise. The leader of the 
opposition agrees with me on this. The hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel will not rise either for the same reason. 
As for the Prime Minister, he is not rising because he agrees with 
me and will probably send you back to the drawing board since, as 
you know, this kind of wording makes it impossible to save money.
<P>
	Mention is made of defence mechanisms. ``No person may be 
convicted of an offence or subjected to a penalty for a 
contravention of a regulation''. The hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, who is responsible for international 
affairs, should listen. He should pay attention to clause 11. The 
Prime Minister may even step in at this time. Listen to this: ``No 
person may be convicted of an offence or subjected to a penalty for 
a contravention of a regulation that was not published in 
accordance with section 10 on or before the date of the alleged 
contravention''.
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	We are reasonable people. We do not want to convict someone 
who committed an offence unwittingly, someone who did not 
comply with unpublished regulations, regulations hidden in the 
minister's office. Fortunately not in the office of the hon. member 
for Papineau-Saint-Michel.
<P>
	However, it says here that this person can be convicted of an 
offence if it is proved that, on or before the date of the alleged 
contravention, the person had actual notice of the substance of the 
regulation or reasonable steps had been taken to bring its substance 
to the notice of persons likely to be affected by it.
<P>
	Again, what constitutes reasonable steps? Whatever seems 
reasonable to us invariably seems unreasonable to them. I guess the 
opposite is also true: What is reasonable to them can seem 
unreasonable to us. How can an agreement be reached then, if not 
through a tribunal, which will have the unenviable task of 
determining what is reasonable and what is not? I say to the 
Minister for International Cooperation that this is what I call poorly 
designed legislation. And I know that his department would not go 
for this kind of an enactment. He could not show up in Europe with 
something like this; they would send him packing, and I know he 
can do better than that.
<P>
	I must tell the minister that we, the humble people living in 
Canada, do not find it easy to submit to such  legislative 
imperatives. It is not easy, especially when we are told that, from 
now on, the regulations will be hidden and will be administered in 
such a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3773"> 3773 </A></B>
<P>
way that the taxpayer will not even know what is happening. It is 
their friends who will benefit. It reminds me of what family 
trusts did with $2 billion and was discovered two or three years 
after the fact.
<P>
	In any case, I can tell you that my father did not benefit from 
these $2 billion. Look elsewhere, but not in our house.
<P>
	There is something wrong in all this, and yet it is still going on. 
And this is nothing, just think of Bill C-62. I wonder if we are not 
having the same problem with Bill C-64, or Bill C-25 as it is now 
called, as we did with Bill C-62 regarding the standards of practice, 
since what is not prohibited in a statutory instrument is permitted.
<P>
	So, there was a general outcry. The media were quick to react, 
saying that this was not possible, that it was impossible to pass a 
measure such as Bill C-62. The minister backed off. He could no 
longer go ahead. He was knocked out, if I can put it that way.
<P>
	I wonder if, with Bill C-84, we are now once again facing the 
harmful effects of Bill C-62, but in an even more insidious way. 
This would really be dangerous. We would be missing an 
opportunity to reduce costs and all that, setting absolutely 
unbelievable precedents and leaving the door wide open to 
astronomical legal costs to correct these situations through the 
courts.
<P>
	Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois will vote against this bill. We 
could not vote in favour of it, despite the fact that initially I 
detected some rather interesting ideas in it, but there are too few 
good ones as opposed to bad ones.
<P>
	My mother, who is not as young as she used to be, was very well 
brought up. She did not want us to use certain words. One day, I got 
a nail through a foot and the wound looked real bad; my mother, not 
wanting to call a spade a spade, said that the wound was full of rust 
and bad stuff. Well, this is it: your bill is full of rust and bad stuff. 
You should amend it and put forward something palatable, 
reasonable and transparent. I am sure that this time the Prime 
Minister, even at this late hour, will jump up and applaud his 
ministers' initiative.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Has the hon. member concluded his 
remarks? Concluded.
<P>
	The hon. minister wants the floor on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(2115)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the hon. member has finished 
his remarks. The minister wishes to raise a point of order, and he 
now has the floor first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, being a new member of Parliament, 
I would like some advice. The hon. member opposite has 
repeatedly mentioned a member who is not  here, suggesting that 
he should jump to his feet because of the outlandish statements he 
made during his speech. I wonder if this behaviour is 
parliamentary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me point out to my colleague that 
the last speaker never mentioned the presence or absence of 
another member. If the hon. member is present, then he will no 
doubt jump to his feet, but if he is absent, the expression was no 
doubt used in a figurative sense. But since nobody mentioned the 
presence or absence of that other member, I think this is not a point 
of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is interesting but it is quite obvious 
that the hon. member did not say that the member in question is not 
here. The hon. member for Joliette is quite right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, judging by that last little go round you can tell this is a 
long, hot summer night. We are so fortunate to be here in the House 
discussing Bill C-25, which could only come from the minds of 
Liberals. The bill is a very complex piece of legislation. It is 
difficult to read, it is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to 
discuss. It is typical Liberal legislation.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the bill could almost be called frightening 
from the perspective of the average Canadian. Understanding the 
intent of the bill, which is suspect in itself, and based on reading the 
text, it is a challenge.
<P>
	We Reformers are up to challenges from the Liberals when they 
bring in complex legislation, thinking that perhaps the average 
Canadian whom we represent is not going to understand it. We are 
the watchdogs. We are leading the charge for average Canadians. 
We attempt to clarify complex bills with which the Liberal 
government tries to fool the people.
<P>
	Despite the complexity of the bill, it is clear that the government 
is following a trend which has already been set in other 
parliamentary democracies, like Australia. It is hard to believe but 
the trend is toward simplification and streamlining of the 
regulatory process. That is also hard to believe coming from the 
Liberal Party. It is to make the regulatory process more compatible 
with the present day needs of commerce, government and the 
public.
<P>
	Goodness knows, if there is one thing the public, commerce and 
government need is more simplified regulations. Any chamber of 
commerce, any business organization will tell you it costs 
Canadian consumers and businesses billions and billions of dollars 
a year because ineffective and unnecessary regulations are still on 
the books that some government in the past has put in place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3774"> 3774 </A></B>
<P>
	What this country really needs, and what this government 
should do, instead of trying to put in complex legislation, is do 
a cost test on every regulation we have and find out whether it 
is really worthwhile or whether it is just sitting there in a 
redundant state. There is no doubt that streamlining and 
simplification, in itself, are both desirable and necessary. 
However, we found a flaw in this bill and it is a deadly flaw. There 
is no provision for disallowance. In other words, the regulatory 
committee, the watchdog of the regulations, cannot disallow a 
regulation that is unlawful or ultra vires.
<P>
<B>(2120)</B>
<P>
	My colleague, the member for North Vancouver, sits on the 
Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations. It is a 
committee made up of members from the House and from the 
Senate. The task of the committee is to examine regulations that 
have been made by the government and its departments in order to 
determine whether they are legal and consistent with the intent of 
the legislation under which they are made.
<P>
	The vast majority of the regulations that pass through the 
committee are entirely in order. They may not be good regulations 
but from a legal point they are entirely in order. They generally 
require no comment.
<P>
	A small percentage have to be followed up with the department 
involved. Quite often the problem is simply a matter of correcting 
minor differences in the meaning between the English and French 
versions of the regulations or clarifying the meaning if a 
misinterpretation is a possibility.
<P>
	As I said, under this bill the committee does not have the power 
to disallow a regulation which is ultra vires or unlawful. This 
power is rarely used, but nevertheless is a very important power for 
the committee to retain. I think most Liberals would agree with me 
on this. The regulation watchdog must have the ability to enforce 
its decisions or those decisions could be rendered meaningless.
<P>
	Bill C-25 makes the provision for regulations to be referred to 
the committee, but contains no provisions for disallowance. This 
means that even if the committee found that a regulation was 
illegal, it simply could not disallow the regulation.
<P>
	It is the failure to include a disallowance procedure that makes 
Bill C-25 significantly different from the streamlining legislation 
passed in Australia. That government had the foresight to put in a 
disallowance clause so that the committee could do some 
meaningful work and make some meaningful decisions.
<P>
	My colleague from North Vancouver, in his wisdom and in his 
common sense, introduced a private member's bill that would add a 
disallowance procedure to Bill C-25.
<P>
	Everyone in this place knows that the chances of a private 
member's bill, no matter how good it is, no  matter how much
<P>
common sense it contains, no matter how it would help democracy 
in this place, no matter how much it would make the lives of 
Canadians better, no matter how much it would make the lives of 
Canadian business people better, has very little chance of getting 
through this House.
<P>
	The reason sits right across the way. This Liberal government 
allows very few private member's bills to proceed. I can talk 
personally about that. I knew halfway through this speech I would 
get to this private member's bill problem.
<P>
	My Bill C-201, for example, deals with the sentencing of drunk 
drivers who kill. Liberals know it is a bill that the Canadian people 
want. They know it is a bill that is long overdue. They know it is a 
bill that is going to create a deterrent to people who drink and drive, 
and as a result, kill.
<P>
<B>(2125 )</B>
<P>
	A Liberal legal mind is telling me that because of some legal 
complication my bill cannot be put through. Despite these legal 
minds in the Liberal Party or maybe because of these legal minds in 
the Liberal Party, they are unable to understand what the average 
Canadian wants.
<P>
	We have presented thousands and thousands of names on 
petitions demanding that Bill C-201 go through, at least to 
committee. This Liberal government, through the whip, through 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice, has not 
allowed any Liberal member who wanted to speak in favour of this 
bill to speak. That is shameful, absolutely shameful.
<P>
	My colleague from North Vancouver introduced a private 
member's bill that would add a disallowance procedure to Bill 
C-25. Everyone in this place, because of the hard headedness of 
this Liberal government-I take that back, soft headedness-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Empty headedness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be more kind than my friend 
from the NDP, although he is correct.
<P>
	No matter how much merit it has, the Liberal government will 
not let that private member's bill go through. As a result of its 
decisions Bill C-278, the private member's bill to have a 
disallowance procedure in this legislation, was defeated by that 
party.
<P>
	The real responsibility for the failure to provide a disallowance 
procedure lies fairly and squarely with the Minister of Justice. This 
is not the only mistake that has made since he came to this House.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice, despite several requests by our party, 
still has not explained why he refuses to incorporate that 
disallowance procedure. He has simply not allowed that procedure 
to go through, and has given no rationale or explanation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3775"> 3775 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal government and the Minister of Justice missed a 
tremendous opportunity when they left out the disallowance clause 
in this bill. As Reformers, the watchdogs of the Canadian people, 
the watchdogs of Canadian business, the watchdogs of all that is 
right and just in this country, we say shame on the Liberal 
government. We cannot support a bill that has a fatal flaw in it. 
This bill has a fatal flaw in it and we will not support it.
<P>

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECBRIDGE">QUEBEC BRIDGE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this House, on 
May 10, I asked the minister of Transport a question on the federal 
government's responsibility with regard to the Quebec bridge.
<P>
	Again, in his answer, the minister of Transport refused to 
acknowledge that the federal government had any responsibility 
with regard to repairing the Quebec bridge. Well, his government 
changed its mind because last week, on Friday, June 7, during a 
meeting at the Quebec Citadel, Canada's Prime Minister and 
Quebec's premier entered into an agreement establishing the costs 
to be assumed by the various parties: 60 per cent for CN, 30 per 
cent for the provincial government and 10 per cent for the federal 
government, through its Department of Transport which, until then, 
had refused to acknowledge its responsibility.
<P>
	Let me tell you a short story. This afternoon-it is purely a 
coincidence-I asked a question on another subject, the closure of 
a CN service shop, and the minister of Transport refused to 
acknowledge his responsibility in this area. So, in spite of 
everything, I remain optimistic regarding this matter, because of 
the minister's flip-flop on the issue of the Quebec bridge.
<P>
	But this is not the point. Now that the issue has been settled, I 
would like to ask the Minister of Transport, or his representative, 
what led him to change his answer, which he had given me on 
several occasions, including on May 10, and recognize that the 
federal government did have responsibility, since it is paying 10 
per cent.
<P>
	I would also like to ask him not to change his mind and to stand 
by this good decision regarding repairs to the Quebec bridge, which 
is a significant symbol in the Quebec City area. I would like to 
know the terms of the agreement, and how long the federal 
government's involvement-the 10 per cent previously 
mentioned-will last. I would also like to ask the minister if he 
recognizes that the federal government can pay immediately or as 
soon as possible, because people believe that the repairs only 
involve a paint job on the Quebec bridge, when in fact, important 
girders have to be replaced. It has been estimated that materials 
represent a third of the costs involved.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister why could we not use the 
services of a company in my own riding, namely Dominion Bridge, 
which actually built the bridge and recently acquired the MIL 
Davie shipyard. Since the government has given no money to the 
MIL Davie shipyard in the last three years, the Transport 
Department has a good opportunity to influence CN to have the 
work carried out by Dominion Bridge's workers at MIL Davie, 
because we know that its president, Mr. Tellier, is a former senior 
public servant. They say it is private, but we know that he has spent 
his whole life here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
address the question of the hon. member for Lévis concerning the 
government's contribution on the maintenance on the Quebec 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3776"> 3776 </A></B>
<P>
bridge. I would think that as a member from Quebec who has in the 
past harboured some suspicions about whether or not the federation 
actually works, the member would be standing in his place and 
congratulating the federal government on its announcement of a 
contribution toward the ongoing maintenance of the Quebec 
bridge.
<P>
	As the hon. member is no doubt aware, the Prime Minister and 
the premier of Quebec met last week and discussed various issues, 
including the Quebec bridge. That very successful meeting is 
further proof of the good work this federation can do when 
members of the federal cabinet meet with premiers of the 
provinces. They can work out some of their differences and do 
what is best for the country.
<P>
<B>(2135)</B>
<P>
	It was announced by the Prime Minister that an agreement for a 
maintenance program had been made. The hon. member is also no 
doubt aware of the framework of the agreement which was outlined 
during the press conference held by the Prime Minister and the 
premier of Quebec. It has been agreed that $60 million will be 
spent over the next 10 years on a maintenance program. Of that 
amount CN will contribute 60 per cent, the province of Quebec will 
contribute 30 per cent and the federal government will contribute 
10 per cent.
<P>
	We are very happy to see the province of Quebec working with 
CN, the owner of the bridge since 1993, to agree upon an 
accelerated maintenance program for this important transportation 
link for the people of Quebec City and all the people of Quebec. In 
addition to the 14 daily train crossings, 25,000 vehicles use that 
bridge every day.
<P>
	Deterioration of the Quebec bridge has resulted from its traffic. 
Now there is a tripartite agreement between the federal 
government, the government of the province of Quebec-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. The hon. member's time has 
expired.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HOLLINGERINC.">HOLLINGER INC.</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on May 28 on behalf of many Canadians I asked the Prime Minister 
to investigate the concentration of ownership in the print media.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry replied that there are no legal grounds 
for intervening on this issue. This is a very puzzling response. If I 
take this a step further, the federal government had no legal 
grounds to prosecute Canadians for paying for sex with minors in 
foreign  countries, that is, until it passed legislation on the issue. If 
the Liberals have no legislation to assist in their investigation of the 
concentration of media ownership, they should pass some.
<P>
	Freedom of the press is very important as is the public's right to 
know. When the newspapers and any other media are not in a 
competitive environment the fundamental principles of democracy 
are compromised. It is simply wrong that the Liberal government 
refuses to correct this situation.
<P>
	The Bureau of Competition Policy quickly approved the mergers 
of these newspaper sales, but the minister knows that the Bureau of 
Competition Policy is ineffective. It has no mandate to investigate 
concentration of ownership. The bureau does not at this time have 
the power to look into the problems of having one individual 
owning 53 per cent of all daily newspapers and 42 per cent of the 
circulation across the country.
<P>
	What Canadians need is a Canada newspaper act that would limit 
concentration of ownership of Canadian newspapers and encourage 
new newspapers to start. This new law would give Canadians more 
choice and would ensure more balanced news stories and editorials.
<P>
	Print journalists play an important role in this country. They 
inform Canadians about what is happening in their governments, 
their communities and around the world. They also represent and 
present opinions. These are basic functions of newspaper 
journalists. They also have responsibilities. They have the 
responsibility of telling us what is really going on from a balanced 
perspective. It is an awesome responsibility that is carried out by 
the frontline reporters. They carry out their tremendous 
responsibility by interviewing people, researching issues and 
investigating stories. I applaud them in their efforts.
<P>
	This line of work is not without risk. Around the world scores of 
journalists have been murdered carrying out their jobs. This is the 
price of effective reporting. Reporters strive to bring us the truth 
but they cannot do their jobs properly when newspaper budgets are 
slashed until one reporter is carrying out the work of three.
<P>
	In the case of the Regina <I>Leader-Post</I>, there is no longer a full 
time reporter dedicated to the agricultural beat. This has happened 
in a province where agriculture is the very heart of the economy. 
This is not being accountable to the readers; this is only being 
accountable to the bottom line of the newspaper's owner, Conrad 
Black, who is interested in greater profits only.
<P>
	Hollinger Inc. controlled by Conrad Black now controls 53 per 
cent of the daily newspapers in Canada. It means one individual is 
controlling the editorial content of 58 daily newspapers and 
dictating the activities of their reporters. As Peter C. Newman 
points out in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine: ``There isn't the slightest doubt 
that Mr. Black will use his 58 Canadian daily newspapers to  
promote his neo-conservative views,'' as he did with the Jerusalem 
<I>Post</I> just recently.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3777"> 3777 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure that 
newspapers are carrying out their responsibilities. When news is 
suppressed or censored because of the prejudiced views of one 
person, then democracy is threatened. In turn, the federal 
government is not serving democracy well when it does nothing. 
Doing nothing means the Liberal government agrees with Conrad 
Black that the ownership of newspapers in this country should be 
concentrated and democracy should be compromised.
<P>
	Why is this so? Why are the Liberals not acting? Is it because 
Conrad Black and the Prime Minister are good friends, as reported 
in the June 1 <I>Globe and Mail</I>? Or is it simply because political 
contributions have been made to the Liberal Party for ignoring the 
concerns of Canadians on this issue? Which is it? Canadians want 
to know. Canadians have a right to know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliame</B><B>ntary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden, I have some general comments.
<P>
	First, this government has no authority to freeze or block 
commercial transactions, as he suggested. He should also take a 
look at the provincial government's jurisdiction. He should be 
talking to his counterparts, the NDP government in Saskatchewan, 
when dealing with matters that are within the jurisdiction of a 
provincial government and not the federal government.
<P>
	Second, freedom of speech is guaranteed under the charter of 
rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Third, there are fundamental changes under way in methods of 
communication. Radio, television and now the Internet provide 
excellent vehicles for the exchange of information and opinion.
<P>
	The enforcement of the Competition Act is entrusted to the 
director of investigation and research who is an independent law 
enforcement official. The director has a longstanding enforcement 
history in the newspaper industry.
<P>
	In 1974 monopoly charges were laid against K.C. Irving Ltd. In 
1980 criminal charges were brought against Southam and Thomson 
for market sharing. In 1990 the director challenged the acquisition 
by Southam of community newspapers in the Vancouver area 
where Southam already owned the two daily newspapers. The 
director concluded that the acquisition of two community 
newspapers resulted in a substantial lessening of competition in the 
advertising markets served by these newspapers. This matter is 
currently before the supreme court.
<P>
	The focus of the director's examination is on the economic effect 
a transaction will have on competition in advertising markets. The 
director is not mandated to look at social issues such as editorial 
diversity. Newspaper advertising markets are local in nature. A 
newspaper operating in Vancouver cannot be said to be in 
competition for advertisers with a newspaper in Calgary. When 
there is only one newspaper in a community its acquisition does not 
constitute a lessening of competition but only a change of 
ownership.
<P>
	The director has closely followed developments in this industry 
since 1993 when he reviewed Hollinger's initial 19 per cent 
investment in Southam. Every subsequent acquisition of 
newspapers by Hollinger was reviewed to see whether there was 
any overlap between the newspaper being acquired and either a 
Hollinger or Southam publication.
<P>
	With respect to the latest acquisition of Southam shares by 
Hollinger, Hollinger and Power Corporation approached the 
competition bureau and made representations. The director 
reviewed the proposed transaction and concluded that it would not 
lessen competition in any newspaper advertising market.
<P>
	Finally, Hollinger's day to day conduct will continue to be 
governed by all the provisions of the Competition Act. Any further 
newspaper acquisitions by either Hollinger or Southam will be 
reviewed by the director.
