</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to provide additional information to that provided 
by the government House leader as to why the point of order 
raised by the member for St. Albert is not a valid one. 
In no way do the estimates which are before the House derogate 
from or usurp the authority of this House to adopt legislation, 
nor do they presuppose the will of this House in any way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, I would like to commend the hon. member for St. 
Albert on his continuing interest in the supply process and for 
the diligence of his research.  He will recall, through his 
active participation in the improved reporting to Parliament 
project, the initiatives that the government has taken in 
improving the information provided to parliamentarians over the 
last 12 months, initiatives in which the hon. member has been an 
active participant and which he has supported on two occasions in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the 1997-98 estimates process, the government 
introduced modifications to part III of the estimates on a pilot 
basis for 16 departments.  These changes were intended to improve 
the quality of the information provided to Parliament and to 
provide better information on strategic and future plans, as well 
as to lay the basis for providing performance information on a 
more timely basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in fact from the part IIIs for these pilot departments 
that the hon. member has drawn most of the information he uses to 
support his point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of order is based broadly on the precept that the 
estimates should neither anticipate enabling legislation, nor 
should appropriation bills be used to legislate.  This is a 
fundamental principle and one which the government wholeheartedly 
supports.  I am not going to question that principle at all.  I 
would just indicate that the point of order which the hon. member 
has made in fact does not apply in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member identifies five votes in which he claims that 
the government is seeking parliamentary approval of funds for 
purposes for which Parliament has not yet given legislative 
authority.  I will argue that this is simply not the case in any 
of the five votes which have been mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the hon. member may have come to his 
conclusion.  The part IIIs explain the government's plans for the 
next three years, not just the first year, 1997-98, which is the 
only subject of the appropriation bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of the five cases cited, the government has signalled 
its intention to modify the way it does business.  It has done 
this through tabling draft legislation for consideration by 
Parliament and, as it undertook to do as part of the improved 
reporting to Parliament project, it has done this by spelling out 
its plans in the part IIIs of the department concerned, not just 
for the main estimates here but for two additional years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In being asked to approve supply legislation, Parliament is 
requested to approve a series of specific votes.  It is the 
wording of these votes that provides the legislative basis for 
the expenditures of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous Speakers' rulings which the hon. member cited dealt 
with specific instances where this wording was considered 
inappropriate.  That is not the case with the appropriation bill 
at issue here.  In no case is the vote wording providing or 
seeking additional authority that has not already been granted by 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of the five cases identified the funds sought through 
the estimates process are needed for continuing operations of the 
programs concerned.  If the legislation authorizing the 
operational changes is approved by Parliament, and only if, in 
each case, then the funds will be spent in accordance with the 
new legislation.  If the enabling legislation is not adopted, 
then these same funds will be spent in accordance with existing 
parliamentary authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part IIIs from which the hon. member draws his information 
are all quite clear that they are dealing with future plans and 
in depicting any legislation at issue as proposed.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, part III states clearly, under Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Priorities over the next three years include continuing reform of 
safety nets and grain policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part III under the heading Environment Canada is equally 
clear: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed new CEPA, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
will result in a more efficient process for categorizing toxic 
substances. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to argue that these votes be struck down on 
the basis that the government has provided specific details on 
its future strategies is to argue that the government should 
retreat under a veil of secrecy.  That is precisely what we are 
trying to avoid as part of the improved reporting to Parliament 
project, a project that, I underline again, has received the hon. 
member's support, for which I both commend and thank him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a wonderful opportunity these documents provide. Parliament 
now has a three year planning horizon to help them understand the 
context within which new legislative proposals will operate.  I 
would go so far as to suggest that this level of future planning 
information and disclosure is probably unique among our fellow 
OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is similar for the three items where the hon. 
member claims that we are legislating through supply legislation. 
Again, this is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vote 35 for the Canadian International Trade Tribunal is simply 
for program expenditures.  That is the wording of the vote. 
There is nothing in these words that could possibly be construed 
as extending its mandate as the hon. member suggests.  The vote 
is neither providing nor is it seeking new or additional 
authority. It is merely seeking supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member notes, the Canada Communications Group item 
is statutory.  By definition, the amount shown is authorized by 
legislation previously approved by Parliament and by that same 
definition it is shown in the estimates or information as it does 
not form part of the appropriation bill that Parliament will be 
asked to approve.  It is statutory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final item with which the hon. member takes issue is the 
Canada Information Office.  The fact of the matter is that the 
order in council in question is presumed valid until repealed or 
set aside by a court.  Given this fact, the “program 
expenditures” referred to in the vote can be nothing but 
entirely consistent with that order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's arguments simply challenge the basis for the 
order in council and have nothing to do with either the supply 
process or any impropriety in the estimates themselves.  The 
order in council can be challenged, but once again it is valid as 
long as it has not been set aside, repealed or declared invalid 
by the government or by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the estimates that I tabled earlier this year 
contained two assurances.  I will repeat both here again. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual expenditure proposals included in votes seek authority 
during the 1997-98 fiscal year to make expenditures necessary to 
deliver various mandates which are under the administration of a 
Minister and are contained in legislation approved by Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the House of Commons Speaker's ruling in 1981, the 
government has made a commitment that the only legislation that 
will be amended through the estimates process, other than cases 
specifically authorized by statute, will be previous 
appropriation acts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in the estimates what we have done is have 
submitted for the vote of the House expenditures which correspond 
exactly to the wording of each vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The explanations given in part III, which once again are for three 
future years, explained the plans of the government in case new 
legislation or new policies are adopted.  In every one of the 
cases mentioned by the hon. member for St. Albert, the 
expenditures that are sought in supply are expenditures under the 
authority expressed properly by the wording of the votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yesterday when the point of order was 
brought up I permitted what was like a mini debate.  This is new 
information which I have decided to hear.  If there is anything 
else to be added, if you are going to make an interjection you 
will get one shot at it.  We are not going to go back and forth. 
Whatever you have to say on this point of order I will listen to. 
I will then take all the information, retreat and make my own 
decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the President of the Treasury Board with interest and 
I appreciated the compliments regarding the work we have done on 
the improved performance and reporting to Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point we want to make is that by the very definition of 
improved reporting to Parliament we are in command of better 
information in order for us to make appropriate decisions and 
vote according to the information laid before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government and the estimates, especially the part 
IIIs, have not provided that information to us or the minister 
is alleging that we are unable to discern from these part IIIs 
what monies are to be expended including the part IIs and what 
are for future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already written to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
regarding one item in this improved reporting to Parliament 
regarding TAGS.  TAGS is a very important program for Atlantic 
Canada because of the situation there.  The new improved 
reporting to Parliament contains three lines regarding TAGS.  The 
auditor general had to write three chapters on the issue.  The 
fisheries committee has been consumed with the issue since then. 
However, this improved reporting has given us three lines to tell 
us the government's initiatives, its plans, its hopes and 
aspiration for this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, what I am trying to tell you, Mr. Speaker, is that 
this improved reporting to Parliament has a long way to go. 
Perhaps this debate we are having today would indicate that the 
government has an obligation to clearly set out in the part IIIs, 
which is an amplification of the information in the part IIs, the 
Appropriation Act, so that we can understand what is in the part 
IIs and also provide their direction as to where they are going 
down the road in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw your attention to the points I raised yesterday regarding 
the Ports Canada Corporation.  In the part IIIs and in the part 
IIs the budget has been reduced to zero for this fiscal year. 
The corporation is still ongoing because the legislation has not 
been passed in this House.  Obviously the work the corporation 
was doing is still ongoing.  Obviously the money it is spending 
is coming from somewhere because the proposal by the minister is 
that budget be zero.   We are being asked to vote on that budget 
to say the budget is zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, the minister knows, the Minister of Transport knows 
that the work is ongoing and the methodology and the focus of the 
government will change once the legislation is passed.  Here we 
are in this particular instance, and no doubt it applies to the 
others too, where by our vote this evening, if we are to vote, we 
will endorse something the government intends to implement rather 
than voting for what has taken place so far.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about legislation, using the part IIIs, 
improved reporting to Parliament and how they outline initiatives 
that the government may wish to take.  Hence he used that to 
justify his argument about legislation to be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the government has an obligation to tell us what we 
are voting on.  We do not want to debate the issues of the 
estimates in a vacuum. This was the whole debate regarding the 
improved reporting to Parliament as far as the estimates, the 
performance documents and so on, and the whole debate circled 
around that.  But we do not want to try to determine the $50 
billion odd that we are voting on without having it in context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we ask the government to lay out its plans for the future. 
The performance documents will give us some historical 
documentation in the same format so we can assess the issues. 
But we specifically ask that the estimates be laid out clearly as 
this year's appropriations within the context of a wider vision, 
forward and historical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I tell the minister, and I use the TAGS example of three 
lines for a very major and important program that affects very 
seriously a major part of this country, that if the government 
feels that improved reporting to cover what it is doing this 
year, next year and how it is going to resolve the issue down the 
road can be covered off in three lines, that beats me.  I think 
that speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about the proposed environmental protection 
act.  Part IIIs talk about the proposed environmental protection 
act.  It was introduced in the last Parliament. I said yesterday 
that the part IIIs were introduced last February 20 and the 
identical documents were introduced on October 1, even though it 
now appears that with the intervening election the government's 
initiatives, agenda and list of priorities have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to vote an appropriation act based on the 
government's agenda as it was before the election, not as it is 
today.  We know, because the government did not table all the 
legislation that died on the order paper, that the government's 
agenda has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if the government had respect for this House it would 
have redrafted the estimates to reflect the new initiatives and 
it sought not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate for the International Trade Tribunal appears, again 
according to the part IIIs, to have been expanded and extended 
and legislation is required for that.  There is nothing in the 
part IIIs to suggest that the government intends to introduce 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On CCG, the Canada Communications Group, the minister talks 
about it being a statutory program.  I outlined in my argument 
yesterday why even though it is a statutory program we as 
parliamentarians are being asked to vote on it.  It is because it 
has a revolving fund and we vote on revolving funds.  Take that 
into consideration, Mr. Speaker, when you are doing your 
deliberations please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, when the minister talked about how they are valid until 
challenged and struck down here or in court, this is the highest 
court of the land.  I am asking you, and I asked you yesterday, 
not to defer this decision to a court, but this court; this court 
that defends the rights of the people and the rights of the 
Commons, that has the sole right to grant supply to the crown. No 
one else has it.  No one else has ever had it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that by our parliamentary democratic procedure that 
nobody else should have it.  If we are to believe in the theory 
of taxation and representation this House and this House alone 
retains for itself the right to pass these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to set aside the minister's 
arguments that this is a valid procedure until struck down by 
a court of law.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
you heard from the official opposition yesterday what our 
concerns were.  We indicated to you that there was a considerable 
amount of expert study into this matter.  This is not something 
that just a couple of researchers had looked at.  It had been 
done for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board has had an overnight look at 
this and has come back with some argument on it, and that is good. 
Mr. Speaker, you have now heard from both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go through some of the comments the President of the 
Treasury Board made but I do not think I want to duplicate 
anything and I believe my colleague from St. Albert has done a 
very good job on that.  However, I want to make two observations 
on the differences in the argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the minister said he was not seeking new 
authority, he was seeking supply.  We maintain that there is no 
legislated authority to seek supply for, and that is the big 
substantive difference in this argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I think all the way through the argument that was 
put to you by the government side, notwithstanding what the 
minister said, he needs to get the Canadian information office, 
for instance, established before seeking supply.  Therein lies 
the problem with the vote tonight. We are being asked to supply 
before we legislate.  It cannot be.  This party cannot vote for 
such an approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope, Mr. Speaker, that when you deliberate and look 
at this today and decide prior to the votes tonight you remove 
those items that are in fact illegal.  Give us an opportunity to 
approve or at least vote for the items that we feel perhaps could 
pass that test.  There is a very important test today that you 
are being asked by the official opposition to apply and look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Hon. members in the opposition had, to use a 
colloquialism, two kicks at the can.  I am going to have one last 
crack at it here.  The hon. President of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened with care 
and attention to the arguments being given.  I would submit to 
you that the first one by the hon. member for St. Albert that the 
part IIIs should be improved is certainly one with which I could 
agree.  Part IIIs should be improved.  In the course of the years 
to come we plan to give more information and more specific 
results.  However, I would also indicate that this fact does not 
affect the controversy on whether the five votes are properly 
submitted to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second comment that we should have redrafted the 
estimates because the government after an election has new 
priorities, I suggest that if we did that we would be committing 
the sins that the opposition is reproaching us for which is that 
before having legislative approval in the House we would be 
redrafting the estimates to show what our new priorities are 
before they have been implemented through legislation approved by 
the House.  Therefore, although I agree that the estimates should 
be drafted in the most appropriate manner possible, I submit they 
are at present drafted in the right way until new legislation has 
been approved by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the point that this House is the highest court of the land, I 
would not oppose the argument.  I would merely submit that when 
we have an order in council that gives the authority for a 
program to be implemented, that order in council remains as the 
legal authority until it is repealed or set aside and until 
Parliament perhaps, if it is the highest court in the land, 
declares that it is illegal. Until that point, that order in 
council is a valid basis for a vote to include supply.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point about the information office is exactly that.  The 
information office must be established first before seeking 
supply. I submit that the information office has been 
established.  It was established by order in council.  We and our 
lawyers believe that the order in council is valid. Once again it 
is held to be valid as the authority for establishing a program 
until it is repealed or set aside, which it has not been. 
Therefore the vote that deals with the information office is also 
under the authority of an order in council that is still valid 
and therefore means the creation of a proper information office 
for which we can seek supply because the information office has a 
legislative basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do think all the members who took part 
in this point of order are trying to clarify both sides.  As I 
said yesterday, I have been gathering information. I will take 
into consideration the material and opinions that have been put 
forward this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my intention to rule on this.  If it is at all possible, I 
will rule on this before the votes take place this afternoon. 
That is my intention right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first Oral Question Period, I asked the Prime Minister 
if he would be putting the Calgary Declaration to the people of 
Quebec.  He said he might, and, quite honestly, I was satisfied 
with his response.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand it is not easy for the Prime Minister to stand up 
to Mr. Bouchard and his separatist acolytes.  As the Prime Minister 
has spent his political career humouring and appeasing the 
separatists, he was displaying his exceptional leadership skills 
when he said he might put the Calgary Declaration to Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two months have passed since the Prime Minister said in the 
early days of this Parliament that he would perhaps put the Calgary 
Declaration to the people of Quebec.  I have remained patient only 
because I thought perhaps the Prime Minister needed time to discuss 
the idea with his advisors.  I thought maybe he needed time to 
formulate a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he put the time to good use?  No.  Instead of formulating 
a plan for submitting the Calgary Declaration to Quebeckers, he 
simply pretended it was not necessary to consult them.  Why bother 
consulting the people of Quebec on the Calgary Declaration, when 
they already know what it is about and already support the 
constitutional proposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why waste all that money holding public consultations in 
Quebec and risk displeasing the separatists, when you know already 
what Quebeckers think about the issue?  That is the message the 
Prime Minister was sending to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, on October 3, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs said in this House that the Calgary Declaration had support 
from British Columbia to Newfoundland. 
I found it strange when the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported on September 29 that 
a public poll showed that Quebeckers did not even understand the Calgary 
declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers do not know whether or not the expression “unique 
character” means the same thing as “distinct society”. They are not sure 
whether the Calgary declaration would give them the same powers, fewer 
powers or more powers. Yet, according to the Hon. Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Quebeckers strongly support the declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be better to consult with the people of Quebec on 
this before stating that they support it. And the Quebeckers I spoke to 
agree with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 31, nearly a month after questioning the Prime Minister 
about public consultations, I asked him if he had any concrete plans for 
consultations in Quebec. 
The reply I got was that the government still had no plans in that 
respect. One month later, the government did not even have a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, all the provinces and territories, except Quebec, 
were conducting public consultations or in the process of planning and 
preparing for consultations. Only Quebec was not in on this, and the 
government was still dragging its feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the public consultation plans of the provinces and 
territories. In fact, members of the Reform Party actively encourage 
their constituents to participate in these consultations. We want 
Canadians to take charge of their country's future. I had hoped that the 
Prime Minister would want Quebeckers to do the same, but this seems to 
be the least of his worries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am a particularly persistent man, on November 19, I asked 
the Prime Minister again—for the third time—whether he would be 
putting the Calgary declaration to the people of Quebec and respecting 
their democratic right to participate in constitutional consultations 
which are likely to change the face of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the Prime Minister replied: “We are not saying that we 
will not hold consultations in Quebec but at the same time we are not 
saying that we will”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After nearly two months, the Prime Minister has nothing to say 
and Canadians are losing patience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not let the Calgary declaration fail through 
negligence.  If it does not capture the interest of Canadians, if 
it is incapable of defining and embodying the future values and 
visions of Canadians, it will have failed for good reason.  But if 
it fails because the people of Quebec do not view it as a 
constitutional proposal that they have helped to forge and that 
reflects their desire for greater autonomy, then it will have 
failed because of the negligence of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec deserve to be heard.  I therefore urge 
the Prime Minister to set aside petty political considerations and 
to consult the people of Quebec without delay.  I urge the Prime 
Minister and the Liberal caucus to support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member.  As part of the hon. 
member's policy and platforms it is the position of Reformers 
that they consult with their constituents.  If the constituents 
do not agree with the motions or the suggestions put on the 
table, those members vote with the constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member consulted with his constituents of 
Edmonton—Strathcona?  In the last election campaign that 
position was not put forward by the Reform or the people who 
supported his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he consulted with his constituents?  If he has, what is 
their answer?  If the answer is not in support of the motion, is 
it a fact that he would then vote against it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify. I 
hope the member understands what I have addressed in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address his question, I had a town hall meeting.  I consulted 
a number of people in my riding on the issue.  There are 
different feelings about the Calgary declaration.  That is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in caucus and I have encouraged various people 
with different opinions on the Calgary declaration to actually 
communicate them to their provincial governments through this 
public consultation process.  Once the public consultation 
process is over we will know exactly how the people of Canada 
feel about it.  Then we as a political party can act on their 
feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the motion stands, we are only clarifying and encouraging 
Canadians to take part in what we feel is a very important part 
of the future of the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I begin by congratulating the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona for having the initiative to table in 
parliament such an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read the member's motion I felt a couple of things were 
missing but one in particular.  Toward the end of the last 
parliament one of our members, Len Hopkins from Renfrew, the dean 
of the last parliament, sponsored a private member's bill, Bill 
C-441, an act respecting the territorial integrity of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read one sentence on the principles: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Act reaffirms that the Government of Canada has a moral and 
a legal responsibility to maintain and protect the territorial 
integrity of the Federation as it presently exists, or as its 
territory may be increased in future by constitutional amendment 
or otherwise, and that this responsibility is based on the 
following principles: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on and on to indicate that Canada is a sovereign state, 
one and indivisible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of open debate, would the member consider 
including an amendment in his motion that would take in that 
member's private member's bill?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the 
comments and the question of my colleague from 
Broadview—Greenwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify that I am in favour of what he just 
mentioned and the fact that Canada is indivisible. I agree 
wholeheartedly with that private member's bill in the last 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this motion I tried to emphasize the importance of the 
Calgary declaration that is being considered right now as we 
speak.  It is important for Canadians to take the time to 
participate in the process.  It is a short process.  Most 
provinces are winding up the process by mid-February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am in favour of what the member just put forward it 
is important, instead of clouding it up with other issues, to 
stick to the content of the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my constituents who may have the same concern to 
include it in their comments as they submit them to the 
provincial government.  I thank the hon. member for his question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as a member of the unity team representing the municipalities, I 
am pleased to speak to the very important topic of unity.  We all 
know that this discussion is necessary and is on the minds of 
most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by telling the House what the Official Opposition has 
done so far to promote public awareness and discussion of the 
Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have circulated two letters to more than 4,400 municipal 
councils in Canada encouraging them to get involved in the 
process.  That is the first order of government, the level of 
government closest to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have circulated copies of the Calgary declaration to 
municipal leaders on demand.  We have circulated letters to all 
the premiers encouraging them to get involved with the municipal 
leaders in discussions.  We have asked the prime minister to make 
a copy of the Calgary declaration available to every household in 
Quebec.  We have posted a copy of the Calgary declaration on the 
website of the Reform Party of Canada, www.Reform.ca, including 
an analysis and survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some questions need to be raised about what the government is 
doing at this point in time.  What leadership has the prime 
minister taken to involve Quebeckers in awareness and discussion 
of the Calgary declaration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question needs to be raised.  What has the prime 
minister done to involve municipal leaders in the unity 
discussion coming out of the Calgary declaration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to elaborate on some of these points.  I will begin 
by addressing the issue of municipalities, governments that are 
part of the main stakeholders in the Canadian unity debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are looking for leaders who will work in positive ways 
to strengthen and to unify the Canadian federation.  There is no 
doubt that many of my former municipal colleagues in the House, 
and there are at least 60 of them, believe that the 
municipalities should be heard and taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipal governments provide direct service to citizens.  No 
one understands the real issues related to serving the public at 
that level as they do.  It is long overdue that the federal 
government recognize municipal governments as legitimate entities 
in their own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that in 1996 the current prime minister in Calgary, 
at a meeting of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 
acknowledged the importance of municipalities.  He indicated that 
he would do something more than just acknowledge them as an 
entity and their own rights.   We are still waiting for that to 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a newly elected member of Parliament and as Official 
Opposition deputy critic on national unity for municipalities, I 
want to make sure that municipalities are involved in building a 
better and more united Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last federal election national unity emerged as a key 
issue, certainly in my riding.  Federalists across Canada, 
regardless of political affiliation, were disturbed by the near 
failure of the federalist side during the last Quebec referendum 
campaign.  There is a deepening conviction among more and more 
Canadians that a positive resolution to the unity issue requires 
a two pronged approach.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is a vigorous, inspiring and far-sighted vision for making 
federalism work better, a vision of a 21st century Canada which 
appeals deeply to all Canadians, including Quebeckers.  This 
vision must reconcile and integrate the values and aspirations of 
importance to Canadians in every part of our country and at every 
level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a well defined, federal contingency plan for dealing 
with another referendum on sovereignty and/or a declaration of 
independence by Quebec.  This plan must be made clear in advance 
of any decision on such matters and what the consequences would 
be for Quebec and Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada, which now forms the official 
opposition in this House, is committed 100% to the task of 
building a better and more united Canada, a Canada that includes 
Quebec as a full, essential partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, we have committed to co-operating not only with 
federal and provincial governments but also with Canadian 
municipal governments to help develop a vision for a better 
Canada and to propose alternatives where these are needed, 
including in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last six years as a municipal official, it was my 
privilege to visit and speak to many municipalities across this 
country.  It is my conviction that public support is growing for 
a new non-constitutional effort designed to strengthen the unity 
of this country and that such an effort should focus on defining 
a vision of a better Canada which includes the following five 
elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, a stronger commitment from the federal government to the 
equality of citizens and provinces in law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a rebalancing of the federal and provincial powers to 
meet the demands of the 21st century that take into account the 
responsibilities of municipalities as the governments closest to 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, ensuring this rebalancing equips each province with the 
tools required to protect and develop the unique features of 
their economies and societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, reform the institutions of Parliament and the federal 
system to make them more effective and accountable to the 
representation of local, regional and public interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, ensure genuine consultations with the public involving 
them in any major changes to the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities are putting forth resolutions that will reconcile 
and integrate the principles and values of equality, uniqueness, 
balance of powers, effective representation and public 
involvement which go a long way toward defining the vision that 
Canadians are looking for to strengthen and unite the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have time to read the many letters that I have received 
from municipalities across Canada, but I will at this time 
indicate the meat of the letter that I sent to the premiers on 
September 18 which reads “Municipal leaders across Canada are 
already making clear that they have a stake in the future of our 
country.  Municipal governments frequently refer to themselves as 
the first order of government, the government closest to the 
people.  Could we encourage municipal leaders to participate and 
hold town hall style meetings in each community open to residents 
of the communities with the assistance of facilitators.  The 
information will be provided by the provincial governments with 
input from experts, including the participation of local MLAs, 
MPPs and MNAs. The key advantage of such a process and mechanism 
is the opportunity to transcend political partisan loyalties over 
commitments.  This is the kind of leadership I believe Canadians 
are looking for.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by saying that Canada is a federal union 
of provinces and territories and Canada desires a balanced 
federation where provinces and citizens enjoy equal status before 
the constitution and the law of Canada.  Canadians nationally and 
in each province and territory desire a country with better jobs, 
with brighter prospects for their children, with better health 
care, with more responsible and efficient government services, 
lower taxes, greater individual freedoms and more open and 
accountable government institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Government of Canada and the provinces should 
pursue only policies and legislation which express the 
aspirations of Canadians to build a better Canada, more equal and 
united from sea to sea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
having myself been a mayor for 10 years, I have much in common with 
the hon. member, who spoke about the importance of municipalities. 
However, he mentioned in his speech that municipalities were the 
first order of government.  I would remind him that, in the 
Constitution, the federal government, and not the municipalities, 
is the first order of government.  However, I agree with him that 
it is the order of government closest to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member if, in his opinion, 
constitutional changes indicating whether municipalities should 
come under provincial or federal jurisdiction are required. Does 
the hon. member think changes are required? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think this is an opportune 
time for this country to re-evaluate the relationship between the 
three levels of government.  The hon. member may know or may not 
know that there are other countries in the world which only have 
two levels of government and do not have three levels such as 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of history is that municipal governments existed 
long before the federal system came into being, way before 
confederation came about.  Even though the provinces always 
elaborate and keep saying the municipal governments are the 
creatures of the provinces, they have taken a very paternalistic 
approach to the relationship between provinces and 
municipalities, it is high time we have a little more equality 
among all three levels. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech by the Reform member on today's 
opposition motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat disconcerting that he seems to claim that, since 
municipalities are the level of government closest to the public, they 
should be the ones doing the consultations. They should be the ones 
reviewing the agreement—the term “agreement” is used, but it is 
saying a lot about a piece of paper signed in Calgary, since there is 
absolutely no agreement in it, only proposals made with everybody's 
input. Is the hon. member really saying that municipalities should be 
the ones consulting people on this meaningless piece of paper? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find even more disconcerting is the question from the Quebec 
MP who asked the member whether he thinks municipalities should come 
under federal jurisdiction. The Reform member says that everything is on 
the table and that this may be an opportune time to consider such an 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind the hon. member that municipalities are created by 
legislative assemblies—the National Assembly in Quebec's case. 
According to the Canadian Constitution, not our constitution, not the 
constitution we never accepted, but the Constitution of 1867, they come 
under provincial jurisdiction. It is not up to the municipalities to 
examine or decide whether an agreement or a piece of paper such as the 
Calgary declaration is good or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it strange that the Reform member, and the member who tabled 
the motion, are concerned about Quebec and the consultation process, 
given that, according to the media, the consultation in their own part 
of the country, in their own province, is a phoney consultation in which 
practically no one is interested or involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate it if the hon. member could comment on my 
remarks. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect the hon. member's 
comments and I respect his position.  I do know that municipal 
governments are under the responsibility of all provincial 
governments, including the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the object here is to encourage provincial governments 
to seek the assistance of municipalities to get into the milieu 
of discussion.  The downfall of the last attempts with Canadian 
unity was the lack of grassroots involvement.  If the hon. member 
believes in accountability to the people who elected and sent him 
to Ottawa, then I believe that the municipal governments and the 
citizens who live there and pay taxes are equally as important as 
the people who sit in the legislature at the provincial level.

Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like first of all to thank the member for Edmonton—Strathcona and 
also the member for Dauphin—Swan River for their initiative today and 
to explain why the Government of Canada will support this motion from 
the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian unity is not a partisan issue. We have our disagreements 
on how this country should be governed, and it is normal in a democracy 
that there be a liberal approach, a social-democratic approach, a 
conservative approach and a reform approach, or whatever we choose to 
call it. 
What is important, however, is that we all work together for the unity 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers have proposed principles that can gain the support of 
all Canadians, and as such can strengthen our unity. The Calgary 
declaration is not the only part to Canadian unity, but it is an 
important one to show that Quebeckers, just like Albertans, just like 
all Canadians, share values and can look forward to the next century 
with a shared purpose rather than in a spirit of division. That is the 
objective of this declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a wonderful declaration because it shows that in Canada, 
perhaps more than in any other country, we know that equality is not the 
same thing as uniformity. Equality is an important value that is being 
pursued further in Canada than anywhere else, along with diversity, 
which is also an important value, and this country finds its strength in 
diversity. Diversity is not at all at issue; it is a strength, and these 
two values go together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That diversity covers various features. There is of course the 
bilingual character of the country; there is the multicultural character 
of the country, there is the contribution made by aboriginal peoples, 
and there is the Quebec society, which is in a unique situation in North 
America, for reasons on which everyone can agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also new in the Calgary declaration is the fact that it is 
clearly stated that no special status is being created for anyone. All 
provinces have equal status. Either they are provinces or they are not. 
If they are provinces, equality of status always applies, but 
recognition of the equal status of the provinces should not prevent, in 
fact it should promote, taking into consideration the particular 
circumstances of each province, because we have a very diverse country, 
and circumstances in Alberta are not in many respects the same as those 
in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One province is totally unique by virtue of its majority 
language, its culture, its civil code, its own institutions, and 
that province is Quebec.  There can be recognition of this 
province's unique situation without creating a situation of 
inequality compared to the others, merely by stating that 
everything to be given to one province, in light of its particular 
situation, must also be available to the others if they should 
require it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are not jealous people.  They do not want anything 
for themselves that others would not be able to have.  They simply 
want assurance that, in this decentralized federation, their 
identity and their way of being Canadians “à la Québecoise” can be 
reinforced in the coming century with the assistance of other 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Canadians, Albertans and citizens from other provinces, 
are not jealous people either.  They are not saying that since 
they do not need it, they do not want Quebeckers to have it. They 
just said that anything that is available for a province must be 
available for the provinces because this is equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this way that we have reconciled the values of 
diversity and equality.  We must commend all the premiers for 
having done that and we must support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see how in this House the parties that 
believe in Canada speak with one voice.  We support those 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote a great Canadian, a key Canadian for this very 
moment in our history coming from the province of the hon. 
member. “I believe in a Canada where all provinces have equal 
status, but a Canada that allows Quebec to protect those things 
that make it such a unique part of our national character. do not 
think those two principles cancel each other out. The Canada I am 
describing might be familiar to many because most of us grew up 
here in the tolerant and diverse nation where we are equal as 
Canadians no matter where we live, but where the word equality is 
not used as a blanket to smother diversity.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with that fully. That is exactly the spirit of the 
Calgary declaration which was stated last spring, well before the 
Calgary declaration, by Premier Ralph Klein.  So it is not a 
partisan matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are with premier Klein and with all the premiers, in this 
initiative which is aimed at enhancing our key values. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Leader of the Opposition said recently, Alberta political 
leaders have chosen to act as big westerners, not little 
westerners on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to share this country with the hon. member from 
Alberta.  We will fight together to make sure that we will stay 
fellow citizens.  Whatever arguments we may have about social, 
economic and criminal policies, we will have the pleasure of 
fighting together in the same country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are are having a disagreement right now which is not a 
fundamental one.  It is a disagreement about how to speak to 
Quebeckers at this very moment.  It is not fundamental but it is 
something we have to discuss.  I am happy that this discussion 
will occur today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of view of the government today is that it is too soon 
for that.  As the member from the Bloc said, it is not so easy to 
consult with people even in a province where a premier like 
Premier Klein is strongly supporting the resolution of the 
Calgary declaration.  It is not easy because when people get up 
in the morning it is not their first preoccupation to listen to a 
debate about this declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean that people do not support it.  In fact, if 
they were strongly against it the likelihood that they would rush 
to these kinds of consultations would be greater.  However, I 
think they support the principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that polls are polls, but what is interesting are the 
polls that are compared with the ones we had in Charlottetown or 
Meech.  When we go into the details of the declaration, the 
support is even greater for the declaration in Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Quebeckers are asked “Do you support the Calgary 
declaration?”, the support is there, but not strong support.  When 
they are asked “Do you support citizen equality?”, there is very 
strong support. When they are asked “Do you support the equality of 
status of the provinces?”, there is strong support.  And when they 
are asked “Do you support the recognition of Quebec's unique 
character?”, there is very strong support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the more detail there is given on the 
declaration, the more people support it, and this is grounds for 
considerable optimism, even if the process of consultation in those 
provinces whose premiers support the process is not as easy as some 
would believe.  People are not rushing to share their points of 
view, but there are still grounds for considerable optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we headed with all this?  It is desirable for the 
premiers of the nine provinces and the territorial leaders who 
believe in a powerful united Canada, coming out of these 
consultations, to be able to find sufficient public support to 
enable them to submit to their respective parliaments a statement 
of principle, which will no doubt be fairly close to the Calgary 
declaration and will show the extent to which Canadians do, in 
fact, share the same values.  This will lead to declarations by the 
legislatures. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be a constitutional act.  We are not speaking about 
the Constitution now. It is a declaration of principles that 
shows that yes, we share values. If one day we are ready, 
especially if there is a premier in Quebec who believes in 
Canada, we will see if there is still support among the people 
for something that would be a more legal document that we may 
consider putting in the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach that we have with the support of the Leader of the 
Opposition and all the leaders in the House who believe in Canada 
and who support the step by step approach is something great and 
I am very proud to do it with all my colleagues in the House who 
believe in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the hon. minister for his very constructive 
remarks and his leadership on this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1120

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will know that many people, particularly in western 
Canada, continue to be concerned about the singling out of the 
unique character of Quebec society in the fifth clause of the 
Calgary declaration.  The concern is that this will be the seed 
of a new distinct society interpretive justiciable clause which 
could create two categories of provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. minister could address that concern.  Is it 
a legitimate concern?  How would he respond to the view that 
recognizing the unique character of Quebec society in some way 
derogates from the equality of all provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  It is a legitimate question, but I do not 
think the concern is well advised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been very clear since the beginning that with an 
interpretive clause, first, you cannot override what is clear in 
the Constitution.  It is something which helps to interpret the 
Constitution when the Constitution is not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it cannot give to one province more powers or privileges 
than it gives to other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be sure that it is very clear that this is not 
special status, what the Calgary declaration added is the 
principle stating that if any future constitutional amendment 
confers powers on one province, those powers must be available to 
all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is already what we are doing.  We could take the example of 
the manpower training agreements which we are negotiating with 
the provinces.  Alberta and Quebec have decided to use all the 
powers which the agreements give them, but Newfoundland did not 
feel that it needed them, so there will be co-management with 
Newfoundland.  Newfoundland will not have full autonomy in this 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is that everything is available for everyone. 
This is equality and we are committed to ensure that this will 
always be the case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rather surprised that the government is supporting the Reform 
Party's motion faulting the Quebec government, which will not be 
consulting Quebeckers on the Calgary declaration or at least has 
yet to decide to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what the minister has to say in response 
to three questions I have.  First, what does he think of the 
statement by Mike Harris, who trivialized the concept of unique 
character to the point of describing it in terms of Pacific salmon? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what does he think of the report in this morning's 
papers that only 4% of Albertans know about the Calgary 
declaration, that a televised report revealed last week that some 
people thought it concerned a labour dispute and that others did 
not know there was such a declaration?  How can he preach ethics to 
us, when the people of Alberta, the people voting for the Reform 
Party, are not aware of the Calgary declaration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he say that they are not speaking up probably because 
they support it?  I would like him to explain his remarks.  If 
people are unaware of something and they do not talk about it, it 
is probably because they agree with it.  That is what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the powers to be given to everyone, not just 
Quebec, I would ask him to list the powers that will be given to 
Quebec and the other provinces in Canada as the result of the 
Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start by answering the last 
comment. Should it become a legal text enshrined in the Constitution, in 
itself it would not confer any powers on anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it would reflect the values on which this country must 
build. One of these values is certainly ensuring that each constituent 
part of this country can develop on the basis of its own identity and 
particular values. We know how important this is to Quebec. I gave the 
example of occupational training, which is but one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example. Bijuralism is an asset to Canada. It is a 
great advantage to have two legal systems in Canada, and so is having 
two official languages. 
But this bijuralism needs to be strengthened, especially now that we are 
expanding our relations with countries whose legal culture is different 
from ours, and this ability to understand two different legal cultures, 
based on the fact that we have two in our country, gives us an advantage 
on countries where there is only one legal tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have decided, and I will close with this, to better harmonize 
federal legislation with the Quebec civil code. This will be very good 
for Quebeckers and for all Canadians.

on a point of order.  I believe we should have more time for 
questions.  I assume the minister would have a half hour spot 
here in this debate which would include his speech and questions. 
We have only had about 20 minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not looking for 
unanimous consent to extend debate, although I would certainly be 
happy to get that.  Under the rules of this debate I believe each 
speaker is given a half hour to make comments and then to answer 
questions unless they specifically state that they will share 
their time.  Did the minister do that or will we have the half 
hour? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members would 
know that in this debate the member moving the motion has a half 
hour.  After that it is 15 minute interventions comprised of 10 
minutes and 5 minutes for questions and comments. In the second 
round it goes to the method by which you are assuming it is all 
going.  After the first intervention we are at 10 minutes and 5 
minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would like 
to say a few words on the Calgary declaration. In my statement, I will 
elaborate on some of the points that have just been mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we are discussing this issue today following an 
initiative by the Reform Party, which wants Parliament to endorse the 
Calgary declaration. It also wants to blame the Government of Quebec for 
not holding consultations on the Calgary declaration. Behind all of 
this, we can also see that the Reform Party is starting to look for a 
way out, on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four aspects I would like to deal with quickly: Why the 
Calgary declaration, the consultation process, the absence of 
consultations in Quebec, and, finally, the reasons behind the Reform 
Party's initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the Calgary declaration? I have to go quickly and I will not 
have enough time in ten minutes to cover all the history behind this, 
but I will point out some main events. It should be remembered that 
following patriation in 1982 of the Constitution, which was not signed 
by Quebec and where Quebec was isolated, attempts were made to remedy 
this extraordinary error by the Liberal Party of Canada, but also with 
several premiers, some of whom are still around today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later, Brian Mulroney, the Prime Minister of Canada, and Robert 
Bourassa, the Premier of Quebec, tried in their own way to resolve this 
issue. 
Their argument was “Quebec has to be brought back in with honour and 
dignity”. As we all know, this led to the Meech Lake accord, which 
failed, and then there was the Charlottetown accord, which was rejected 
by the population. I do not want to spend too much time on these events 
that have been dealt with at length by others. This led to the arrival 
in the federal Parliament of regional parties, a trend that was 
maintained following the last federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But above all, this led to the 1995 referendum. Very often, 
federalists forget to mention that there were two referendums in Quebec, 
even three. In 1992, Quebeckers refused to endorse the Charlottetown 
accord, by which Quebec would have signed the patriation of the 
Constitution under the Charlottetown conditions. We must always remember 
that Quebeckers said that no, under those conditions, they would not 
sign. This is an important issue in this debate. 
It seems that federalists have a selective memory and that they forget 
that episode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, with a participation rate of over 93%, 49.5% of the 
population voted yes on the proposal for the sovereignty of Quebec 
accompanied by a offer to form a partnership with the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a panic, faced with this result, Ottawa did not know exactly how 
to react and took a hard line, with everything that implied under plan 
B, to attack Quebec, to make people think that the question was not 
understood, nor the issues, and everything else, and to come up with the 
greatest scare tactics that were ever used, on territory, etc. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, we know that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is 
now the leader of the partitionist movement in Quebec. He is spreading 
the idea everywhere, not just in Quebec, but outside the province too. 
All this led provincial premiers to say “We must do something”. But how 
can they do something when they have hardly any room to manoeuvre, when 
just about everything has been tried in the negotiations that led to 
Meech and Charlottetown? Still, they feel they must do something 
symbolic because there will be an election in Quebec and, should the 
Parti Quebecois win, another referendum will be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, the premiers decided to find a way to 
send a message to Quebec to the effect that they may be prepared 
to do something to please Quebeckers, because they do not 
want—and the Calgary exercise is primarily the result of this 
concern—the federalist party in Quebec, that is the Quebec 
Liberal Party, going into an election campaign with nothing but a 
promise to renew federalism and no concrete measures to support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the idea is to create the illusion that there will be a follow-up 
to this promise. That is why the premiers took a piece of paper on 
which they wrote great principles. The Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs himself said earlier, among other things, that should the 
agreement become part of the Constitution, these values would guide us 
in an eventual decentralization of power and so on. At the rate things 
are going, we better not hold our breath, because it could take a long 
time before anything comes out of this. The minister also talked about 
manpower training, which is a prime example of federalism at work, given 
that it took over 30 years to come up with a solution. This 
administrative agreement may be short-lived, because we never know what 
the federal government may decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we, as members of Parliament working in their 
ridings, know that the federal government is launching all kinds of 
youth training initiatives, but that it does not even respect the 
spirit or the lofty values by which it says it is guided.  It 
obviously has no interest in them whatsoever, nor in that 
agreement.  This is not a lofty principle, but a small 
administrative agreement to fool people into thinking that this 
system can evolve, can change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do not want to look like the only one criticizing the 
Calgary declaration, so I am going to quote from a number of 
newspaper articles I have come across recently. 
I will start with Lise Bissonnette of <I>Le Devoir</I>, who gives a bit of 
the context in which the Calgary declaration was arrived at, and I 
quote  “It confirms, nonetheless, that the stumbling blocks of the 
past are still with us and are crystallizing into three points that 
have always been viewed as essential in Quebec circles that believe 
in the renewal of federalism”.  And these three points are: the 
concept of political pact between two peoples, constitutional 
recognition of the distinct character of Quebec and its real 
significance, and the division of power between the two levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to explain that there has been failure on all 
three counts.  But I know that members opposite will say that Ms. 
Bissonnette is a nasty separatist, a sovereignist and whatnot.  I 
will therefore continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an article in <I>Le Soleil</I>, after a tour by the then 
premier of New Brunswick, Frank McKenna, the specific nature of 
Quebec was too much for the West to swallow.  The article refers to 
the non-inclusion of Quebec institutions as part of its unique 
character. They did not want to use the word “institution”.  Frank 
McKenna said “I tried, but there was too much resistance in the 
West”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best articles, headlined “A path filled with 
pitfalls”, is by Alain Dubuc—whom one cannot classify as a 
sovereignist unless he has undergone a recent conversion, and if so 
someone should let us know.  Allow me to quote from this article: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is normal, however, for Quebeckers to welcome this 
initiative with as much circumspection as the premiers put 
into formulating it. 
Quebeckers, leery after the failures of recent years, are 
sceptical and want to know where all this is headed before 
they voice an opinion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alain Dubuc himself says that we need to watch what happens 
elsewhere before we voice an opinion ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the premiers started off this new round, there was 
nothing to stir up any enthusiasm.  In their palpable 
discomfort, their careful language, their way of paying lip 
service to their love, the nine premiers bore less resemblance 
to politicians beginning to rebuild their country and more to 
nine men in a waiting room waiting to be called in for 
vasectomies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The author of this article is Alain Dubuc, senior editorial 
writer at <I>La Presse</I>. 
He goes on to list a series of traps, concluding with this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth trap is love.  Some premiers have expressed their 
love for Quebec.  But since it was obvious how terrified some 
of them were of public opinion, this message did not ring 
true, just as it did not ring true on the eve of the 
referendum.  Recognition and respect would be more credible 
and more than sufficient.

Corporation office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here another article headlined “Bones without flesh: 
Jonathan Sauvé urges his party to be wary of the Calgary 
declaration”. 
Who is Jonathan Sauvé? He is the president of the Quebec Liberal Party 
youth commission, who made this statement a few days after the Calgary 
declaration was issued. I hope he will stand by this statement during 
the provincial election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bones without flesh”. “The Calgary 
declaration: opening or setback?”. This is followed by a quote from 
Claude Ryan, saying that the declaration reflects mistrust of Quebec. 
This is Claude Ryan, the former Quebec Liberal Party leader, who is not 
known to be a staunch sovereignist either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also this document in which the Government of Newfoundland 
clarifies what is at stake, and the minister was quite clear on this, 
but I would like him to repeat this everywhere he goes. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why use the term “unique” instead of “distinct” to describe 
Quebec's character? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is found in this guide being distributed to the public. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “distinct” is reminiscent of earlier discussions. In many 
parts of Canada, it has taken a negative meaning. In addition, 
“distinct” conveys the idea of “separate”, which goes against 
unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the expression “unique character” 
suggests something that is special but does not adversely affect 
unity. Accordingly, the expression “unique character” more 
accurately conveys what we mean. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people want to play on words. If they want to recognize 
Quebec for what it is, why do they feel the need to get into a semantics 
debate to decide what word to use, if not because there is a degree of 
distrust, fear, apprehension and hesitation in many places? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you are about to interrupt me, so I will 
conclude this part of my speech and then I will answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly touch on the motivation of the Reform Party, which 
calls on their constituents to make sure this never happens by way of a 
constitutional amendment recognizing Quebec's distinctiveness. They are 
telling their supporters to express their views on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now their leader is saying that Senate reform should be included in 
there somewhere. Preston Manning is looking for a way out and trying to 
put the blame on Quebeckers because they are not holding consultations. 
That is what we are witnessing today and we will be discussing what 
their real intentions are throughout the day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is hard to come up with a speech more deplorable than 
the one we have just heard on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Choosing passages that suit the member from documents 
supporting the Calgary declaration in general terms— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Talk about the 4 per cent in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> He made no mention of scholarly papers 
like the one prepared by professor Benoît Pelletier explaining why 
the declaration is good for Quebeckers.  No, it is too long.  I 
have little to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out some fairly elementary mistakes. 
Earlier, the hon. member said that only 4 per cent of Albertans 
were aware of the Calgary declaration.  In fact, 4 per cent 
responded to the questionnaire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister says that I chose 
passages from people who support the Calgary declaration.  As far 
as I know, Alain Dubuc's editorial—I will send him a copy—contained 
little support for the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Bissonnette did not appear to be giving much support to 
the Calgary declaration.  Jonathan Sauvé of the Liberal Party did 
not give it much support either.  I will send him a copy because I 
imagine he has some free time and that he will take the time to 
read it in between two speeches on separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards what is happening in Alberta and the fact that a 
number of people responded, I remember a report we heard on a CBC 
radio station.  They were doing man-in-the-street interviews in 
Alberta. 
Of ten or twelve people, two or three thought it involved a labour 
dispute, the others had no idea what they were talking about and 
knew nothing about the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, before we go calling that support, let us wait and 
see.  I suggest he be prudent, because he knows very well that, 
before it gets support in Alberta and B.C., the Calgary declaration 
would have to be put to a referendum if it were to become a 
constitutional amendment.  Then there would be a real debate, and 
I am sure that the minister and many members of his government 
would find the results most surprising.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know very well the hon. member's secessionist views. 
Notwithstanding, does he think it is within the interest of well 
informed public debate in Quebec on this matter to take steps to 
inform Quebeckers about the content of the Calgary declaration, 
or does he want to leave them in the dark?  What is he trying to 
hide from Quebeckers with respect to the content of the 
declaration? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1995, barely two years ago—and 
these people do not know, because they are told all sorts of things by 
the federal government—a consultation process was held through the 
commissions on the future of Quebec. The process was criticized by this 
government, which claimed that it was a phoney consultation from which 
nothing would come out. Yet, during these consultations in Quebec, more 
testimonies were heard than in the best consultation process under way 
on the Calgary declaration. So, I hope they will reconsider, apologize 
and recognize that the process was in fact a great democratic exercise 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, the ball is clearly in the federalist camp. In the 
last referendum, 49.5% of Quebeckers voted in favour of sovereignty, 
along with a partnership offer. It is not true that Quebec will now 
support meaningless proposals that have no constitutional value and that 
are simply meant to gain support for Daniel Johnson in the next 
election. Federalists want the Quebec government to go along with this 
so they can ultimately put the blame on Quebec by saying “in any case, 
Quebeckers do not want it. Therefore, we will not support it because 
they do not want it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federalists from all parties and from the other Canadian provinces 
should start by agreeing among themselves. They should act while Quebec 
is still a province, because the countdown has begun. Let them agree on 
a substantial offer to Quebec and then we may have a debate. 
Otherwise, in the next referendum, people will have to choose between 
the insignificant Calgary declaration and its principles—some people 
even trivialized Quebeckers' unique character by comparing it to Pacific 
salmon—and sovereignty with a partnership offer. I am pretty sure 
which one of these two options will prevail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I just listened to the member from the Bloc.  It reinforces why 
it is important for all of us who believe in Canada and want to 
see Canada remain united in the future to get our act together 
and to be able to say something to Quebec that will be 
acceptable, if not to the hon. member who just spoke, which is 
unlikely, then to a great majority of Quebeckers who may wish to 
stay in Canada if they feel the rest of Canada is in a position 
to offer them the possibility of a relationship that satisfies 
both their own self-understanding and a vision of Canada that is 
acceptable inside Quebec and outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the motion by the Reform Party.  I welcome the news 
that the government intends to support it.  Certainly the New 
Democratic Party also intends to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons for doing that is the need to show that in 
spite of differences which may exist from time to time on other 
issues, and indeed from time to time on the constitution, on the 
unity file, there is the possibility of coming together on this 
day in support of this resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hoped this would be a foreshadowing of future events in which 
we could come together around something more substantial, either 
the Calgary declaration as it stands or the Calgary declaration 
as amended or as followed up on in respect of other concerns that 
have been raised and will be raised in the course of the 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very nature of consultation, it seems to me, is that one is 
open, and I presume the premiers are open, to suggestions on how to 
approve the declaration or how to move beyond the declaration in 
ways that address very legitimate concerns that have been raised.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one that comes to my mind is the concern raised by the 
aboriginal leadership in this country, that there is wording in 
the Calgary declaration which, in their judgment, does not 
reflect properly their status within Canada, their 
self-understanding within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my party share their concerns.  They are not concerns that 
would lead us to vote against this motion because this motion is 
about the consultation process.  I note that even the Reform 
Party, whose members drafted this motion, are very careful not to 
indicate support for the Calgary declaration.  Support for the 
premiers in their efforts, support for the consultation process, 
yes, but if one reads the motion very carefully, as I did, 
nowhere does it express support for the Calgary declaration.  I 
do not know whether that is intentional.  It could be intentional 
with good intentions.  On the other hand, it could be intentional 
with not so good intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps future speakers from the Reform Party could indicate the 
reason why.  It does not necessarily vitiate one's commitments to 
consultation to take a stand for oneself as to the worthiness or 
unworthiness of a particular resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can then go out, consult and find that there are legitimate 
criticisms, legitimate suggestions as to how it can be improved 
and how those suggestions can be acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in knowing from future Reform Party 
speakers just where they stand on the Calgary declaration as 
opposed to all the language of support for the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, again with respect to what has been said so far 
by the Reform Party in support of its motion, that much of what 
the first speaker said had to do with his insistence that the 
Government of Canada consult with the people of Quebec now, 
immediately, yesterday, on the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the minister say that he felt that the time was 
not right for that kind of consultation.  I tend to agree with 
the minister.  I say to the hon. member for Edmonton Strathcona 
that I think it would be a serious mistake to go into Quebec 
either through the instrument of the federal government or in 
some other way to create another round of expectations if we are 
not sure in the rest of Canada that we can actually say with a 
certain amount of unity and a certain amount of certainty that 
this is what we agreed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know what the people of Quebec think about this and 
we want to know their opinion on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point that has to happen, obviously.  If it were not to 
happen, then that would be a serious mistake.  When we reach that 
point, I do not think we should be fearful of the provincial 
government in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have a right as Canadians and the federal government 
has a right as the federal government to consult Quebeckers on 
this issue.  I do not say this out of caution or out of fear of 
what the view of the Quebec government is on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just offer it as a tactical reflection, if you like, that the 
worst thing that could happen is one more round in which 
expectations are created in Quebec and then Quebec finds one more 
time that the rest of Canada really does not have its act 
together and cannot agree among itself, therefore whatever 
expectations would be created by going through a process in 
Quebec now would be disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that that is the point of the Calgary declaration 
and the consultation process that it creates, to see if there is 
enough unity in the rest of the country—outside Quebec, that 
is—so that we can actually say to Quebec with some certainty 
that this is how we propose to redescribe and reconfigure our 
relationship with Quebec and, for that matter, reconfigure 
Confederation; what do you think? 
Some people may reject it, some people may accept it, but until 
we are in a position to do that, I think it might be a serious 
mistake to do what the hon. member has suggested.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not quarrel with the principle.  I suppose I am asking him 
to reflect on the timing.  Maybe it is just because I have seen 
this happen before and I am worried that we may repeat the 
scenario of creating expectations which cannot be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having stated my reservations about what seems to be at the top 
of the Reform Party agenda, which is an immediate consultation 
with Quebec, I want to repeat that I doubt the wisdom of it at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say to the government that it should find a way 
to meet the concerns of the aboriginal leadership in the country 
which they expressed not so long ago and which I know have been 
expressed personally to the minister by Grand Chief Phil Fontaine 
and to the premiers as recently as last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not get into the bind we were in before where because we 
have agreed on something that we cannot agree to change it.  We 
need to be able to agree to change things or to follow up so that 
we do not get into the corner we have been in so many times 
before, unfortunately, where we have not been able to respond 
appropriately to concerns that have arisen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, from a social democratic or NDP point of view, we also 
say to the government though we do not offer a simplistic or 
economic reductionistic view of unity in this regard, we do 
however believe that part of building a strong country means 
addressing the growing social and economic inequalities that 
exist in this country and which are more pronounced now than they 
were 20 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot encourage people to think as citizens, as a community 
or to think that they are all in the same boat if on the other 
hand we are pursing policies which increasingly divide and 
separate people into winners and losers and people who regard 
themselves as part of a society that no longer cares for them. 
They cannot bring themselves to care for a society that does not 
care for them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
the last speaker.  This is a man who is asking himself some hard 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Calgary declaration, which I have only examined 
briefly, but which talks about the unique character of Quebec 
society, be accompanied by new inputs or amendments to the existing 
Constitution?  If this notion of unique society were adopted in 
Quebec or elsewhere in Canada, has it been proposed to Quebeckers 
that this notion of Quebec's unique character be enshrined in 
legislation, which would be our new Constitution, and which would 
be accompanied by a change in the Senate, by a change in the 
division of legislative responsibilities, or whatever?  I have 
heard nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that Quebec is unique.  It is unique in 
speaking French.  It is unique in having its own poetry.  It is 
unique in many of its structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like the hon. member to tell me whether, in 
Calgary or in the consultations now under way, proposals to 
Quebeckers were formulated. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I thought the minister 
had addressed this in his remarks, but it seems to me at this 
time that what we are talking about is language.  My experience 
of this constitutional dilemma is that it is often not the 
technical legalities and not even the distribution of power that 
is at the root of the problem. 
It is people's level of comfort or discomfort with certain ways 
of describing the country and describing Quebec's place within 
the country or describing the place of the aboriginal people in 
Canada and so on.  We are trying to find a way of talking to each 
other about ourselves that does not cause us to divide, that does 
not cause us to be in conflict with each other.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Calgary declaration as one more attempt, because there 
have been so many unsuccessful ones, to find a way of talking 
about Canada in a way that meets the need in Quebec for both a 
symbolic and practical recognition of their distinctiveness but 
to do that in a way that does not offend against other images of 
the country and understandings of the country with respect to 
equality of the provinces and so on— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Colleagues, with 
permission, when there is obviously a good deal of interest in 
joining the debate, if we could keep our comments and questions 
to about one minute and responses to a minute we would be able to 
get a lot more in.  Let us give that a shot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions and comments, the hon. Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the hon. member that I share most 
of his point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask him if he is in agreement with the following 
statement.  I want to say that it is normal that there is a lot 
of suspicion throughout the country.  Our country has been in 
this debate for 30 years now.   Though some people have some 
concerns it does not mean that they do not agree with the goal, 
with the objective which is to say which values we all share.  I 
want to quote, and it will not be long. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This gradual approach, which is based on consultation and 
which includes the opposition parties, this desire not to set 
overly ambitious goals, shows that Canada has learned from its 
mistakes and wishes to put all the chances on its side so as to 
avoid another failure.  This is wise.  The Quebec minister 
responsible for Canadian intergovernmental affairs, Jacques 
Brassard, simply laughed off the suggestions of other provinces, 
showing clearly that his government is cutting itself off from the 
people of Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted Alain Dubuc, whose remarks the member distorted 
earlier. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what happened here to me 
points out what I have seen so many times and what I think is 
wrong.  I do not know whether the member was asking me a question 
or was debating with the Bloc Quebecois.  Sometimes it is hard to 
tell.  One becomes the presumption or the platform for another 
family fight between Quebeckers.   They are all in the same 
family whether they like it or not.  These family fights are 
sometimes more vicious than the debate which goes on between the 
rest of Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply ask Quebec members of Parliament, and Quebeckers 
whoever they might be, on whatever side they might be, to try to 
rise above this tendency to always be at each other's throats and 
try to take the rest of us into the debate because this is our 
country too. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, before beginning and with your 
leave, I would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to 
share my time with the hon. member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is 
surprising today, is that we have a motion from the Reform Party, at a 
time when there is a process under way that seems to be going well, but 
it is not making headlines, and Reform is once again stirring up trouble 
on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a process starts to work well, the Reform Party has to stir up 
trouble. Now, we have learned that the government side will join them, 
and also the New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We of the Conservative Party will be voting against this motion for 
several reasons. It harbours negative sentiments. It comes from the 
Reform Party, and in the House they make themselves look good, and so 
on, but when we discuss with them outside the House, we realize that 
they want nothing to do with Quebec and francophones. My colleague from 
Brandon—Souris will be speaking shortly on the real stance of the 
Reform Party on constitutional matters. 
They are skillful in  political and parliamentary manoeuvring in the 
House, but outside of the House, over a coffee or other refreshments, we 
get to see the other side of the Reform Party, and now people will know 
what the Reform really stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot agree with this. The leader of a party cannot take on a 
new image within six months. During the election campaign, we saw what 
the Reform Party stood for. That same outlook is still here today, and 
the party structure is the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are against this motion. It is not the time for such a motion. 
The process got under way in Calgary. For us, in any case, there are 
other ways to make this country work rather than with constitutional 
changes, with plans B, C, D, E or F. We proposed something different in 
our platform, 
a Canadian pact. In fact, the government will most likely borrow from 
this position during coming meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree with this either and we are very surprised that the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the minister who creates havoc 
each time the Constitution is mentioned, supports this proposal. He and 
his counterpart in Quebec are firing off letters to each other. They are 
writing an essay on federal-provincial non-relations, on how to ensure 
that these relations will not work. Now we are getting ready to go to 
the supreme court for a real bout of legal and constitutional 
squabbling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we not come back to the basic principle of dialogue and 
action? We want a federalism that is efficient and sensitive. Other 
solutions can be found. We are ready to share these and to discuss them. 
Let us not attempt however to go to Quebec to talk about the Calgary 
process. 
Quebeckers are capable of reading and understanding what it is 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Bloc Quebecois member who spoke earlier about 
the national commissions on Quebec's future to know that I was a 
commissioner.  On constitutional matters, such as the Calgary 
declaration or the Meech Lake accord, ask Quebeckers to name the 
five conditions of the Meech Lake accord and few could do so.  What 
they understand is that an attempt was made to keep the country 
together.  So, we can let the Calgary process take its course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, let us try to give this country some real 
solutions.  We are prepared to share our ideas, as I said 
earlier, including the Canadian pact.  What is it?  It involves—and 
the people in the Bloc Quebecois will be happy and we 
agree with them—respect for individual jurisdictions and an 
end to overlap and duplication. 
Our government is a centralizing government forever shoving its 
nose in others' business.  The Reform Party now wants 
municipalities to come under the federal government.  This is a 
real mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that, without a constitutional amendment—as 
our leader often points out—we can talk, meet others' 
standards and respect their jurisdictions, come to mutual 
agreements and, under the British parliamentary system, establish 
traditions that go on to become law.  So let us try to get back to 
the real priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party tabled a motion this morning because they 
want to screw the whole thing up.  They want to stop it from 
working. 
That is where the problem lies.  Talk to Reformers, talk to certain 
MPs and their staff outside the House, and they will tell you that, 
for them, Canada means no Quebec, no francophones, no 
multiculturalism, no official languages.  That is what the Reform 
Party is all about. Just look at their web site.  The Reform web 
site is not even bilingual.  Close to 50% of them are bilingual, 
and they want to be a national party.  Forget it, it just will not 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are proposing is to sit down together, respect 
jurisdictions, and make the country work on an administrative 
basis.  Let us get back to bread and butter issues.  People will 
not be able to explain what the Calgary declaration is, or what 
Meech Lake is, if they have no bread on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will give the floor over to my colleague from Brandon—Souris. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all I would like to remind my Conservative Party colleague that the 
Meech Lake accord is not something I was promoting.  That was an 
agreement between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party of 
Quebec.  If people did not learn about the conditions of that 
agreement, it is more or less their fault, not mine.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When people voted in the 1995 referendum, they knew what they 
were deciding on.  He himself says that he was a member of the 
commission on the future, which discussed the matter thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him a question concerning a letter written 
by his leader on the eve of the Calgary meeting.  The letter states 
“As I have pointed out, a successful meeting would include—and 
here he names things—a draft definition of an action plan for 
Canada.  The statement could set out the following points: the need 
to rebalance the roles and responsibilities of the federal and 
provincial governments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also speaks of spending power. He says “The measures 
limiting this power should focus on the long term common good”.  He 
speaks of a reform of institutions that ought to include an 
indispensable reform of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat the first phrase: “A successful meeting would include 
the following”.  Is the hon. member in agreement with his leader, 
then, and can he conclude, as he must, that the Calgary meeting was 
a failure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I am in agreement with my 
leader.  I campaigned with my leader because that is what I 
believed in.  This letter basically repeats what was in our 
election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary process is one that will hopefully evolve.  As for 
the statements the Bloc Quebecois member attributed to my leader, 
yes, I am in agreement.  If we could implement the points the 
member has quoted from the letter by the member for Sherbrooke, I 
think the country would perhaps be in better shape.  The Bloc 
member knows very well that the position of my leader, the position 
of the Conservative Party in Quebec, is one of the most popular 
positions and one which has the potential to rally all Quebeckers. 
This is something the Bloc member knows, and that is why they do 
not want us to gain too much power in Quebec because they know that 
the next time they will be out the door.

would like to thank my colleague from Quebec for sharing his 
speaking time for a member and a colleague from western Canada to 
speak to an issue I consider to be of utmost national 
significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be in this House to see the transformation from 
a cocoon to a butterfly of the Reform Party. It is now putting 
forward its position on national unity.  A short six months ago 
the positions taken with respect to national unity by hon. 
colleagues from the Reform Party were not quite as positive as 
the position now being put forward in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the Progressive Conservative Party believes 
very strongly in the federation of Canada.  It believes very 
strongly in ten provinces and two territories. It believes this 
country has everywhere to go in the future to ensure we embrace 
the national unity of the federation and to make sure we have ten 
solid provinces and two solid territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak to the experience and the confidence of the leader 
of our party. It was the leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party who brought this country back from the abyss.  In the last 
referendum he was called upon because there was no leadership 
from the Liberal government.  He was called upon to make sure 
this country did stay together.  There is a majority in Quebec 
that wants to remain Canadian and it will do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy of the Progressive Conservative Party has always been 
one of consultation, conciliation and understanding unlike the 
policies of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is embraced and accepted by the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  It is nice to see there is 
leadership in this country beyond that of the federal Liberal 
government which has not given any indication of leadership. The 
premiers of the provinces had to sit down to put forward a plan, 
the Calgary declaration.  They had to come forward to say that 
this question is of such importance we have to deal with it 
ourselves without the leadership of the federal Liberal 
government.  I am thankful for the Calgary declaration which we 
embrace and I thank the premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss the Jekyll and Hyde transformation of the Reform 
Party.  A short six months ago during the election campaign the 
Reformers stated quite emphatically that Quebeckers do not know 
how to solve the unity crisis. 
The motion which is before us specifies that the Reform Party 
wants to consult with the people of Quebec.  There is the Jekyll 
and Hyde.  I would like to know the motivation behind this

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to discuss distinct society and unique 
society.  All of a sudden it seems that Reform members have this 
wonderful transformation and unique society is something they can 
accept.  I fought in the trenches during the last election 
campaign and I can say that distinct society was a major issue. 
It was an issue which the Reformers used as a cheap political 
trick to push hot buttons in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of the motives— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Did you support it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Yes, I supported distinct society and 
I do now.  In fact, Quebec is distinct.  It is very distinct and 
unique, as are all provinces of this country very distinct and 
unique.  There are no special powers but they are distinctive 
nonetheless.  We accept bilingualism.  We accept the fact that 
they speak a different language.  We accept the fact that there 
is distinctiveness in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring to the attention of the House an ad 
campaign during the last election.  The ad campaign said quite 
emphatically, “Do you want any more leaders from Quebec?  We do 
not want any more leaders from Quebec”.  This is the same party 
which now wants to consult with Quebeckers about the types of 
leadership we should have in this country?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the motives of the Reform Party.  I have some 
serious concerns about them.  As a matter of fact, a high level 
staffer in the Reform Party issued in the Calgary <I>Sun</I> of 
October 30 ten different resolutions, one which suggested 
“Eliminate bilingualism and multiculturalism.  With Quebec gone 
the rationale for bilingualism and multiculturalism would go 
too”.  To me this does not speak of a resolution put forward for 
consultation— 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  The hon. member has cited an article 
dated October 30.  I wonder if he could cite the year and table 
the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member is going to table 
the document, it will require unanimous consent but he is free to 
answer the question, which is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be more than 
happy to have this document passed on to the hon. member.  It is 
an article from the Calgary <I>Sun</I> dated October 30, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Oh, all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  I see.  Things have changed quite 
dramatically since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motives I am afraid are not acceptable to the Progressive 
Conservative Party and our members will not be supporting the 
resolution put forward by the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it unfortunate that the Tory caucus will not be 
co-operating with this kind of initiative, as will the Liberal 
Party and the New Democratic Party.  It seems that once again the 
Tories are joining their old separatist allies, the people who 
kept them in power for nine years, people like Lucien Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that party is so strongly in favour of national unity, then 
why did it have card carrying members of the Parti Quebecois 
running for it in the last federal election?  Is that its degree 
of commitment? If the leader of the Tory party is the great hero 
of the last referendum, why did he lose his own riding to the oui 
side in the last referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that the hon. member objects to?  The advertisement 
to which he referred said that it is time for all Canadians to 
have a voice in the national unity debate.  That is exactly what 
we are calling for today.  By opposing this motion are they 
opposed to giving all Canadians a voice on that debate?  Are they 
satisfied with the failure of the former Tory, Premier Bouchard's 
government's failure to let Quebeckers have a say on this issue? 
Why not let Quebeckers speak to the Calgary declaration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not understand that the unique characteristics 
clause in the Calgary declaration is a non-justiciable, 
non-interpretive clause which is qualified by the equality 
provisions riddled throughout that declaration which were 
entirely absent from the failed Charlottetown and Meech accords 
imposed by the top down Mulroney government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again the rhetoric 
coming from the hon. member for Calgary Southeast is rather 
enjoyable.  I am sure the hon. member realizes that from a unity 
perspective the Progressive Conservative government had a much 
better understanding of the Quebec issues than does the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for consultation, we have always said that the consultative 
process is a keystone of bringing Quebeckers into the federation 
of Canada.

province is more equal than another province.  We recognize in 
our own policy that all provinces have to work together to make 
the federation stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we wish to do with the province of Quebec.  That is 
what we wish to do with the consultative process in Quebec.  We 
believe very strongly in that.  We do not believe in 
divisiveness.  We do not believe in intimidation.  We do not 
believe in the 20 point plan put forward in the last election 
which said that it was their way or the highway.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time today with my colleague for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to stand in support of the Calgary declaration 
which frameworks a national dialogue on Canadian unity.  We have 
come a long way in the two years since the referendum.  Two years 
ago in the referendum we were told not to talk, not to discuss, 
and to stay out of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of this 
important motion for two reasons.  First, I indicate my support 
and that of my constituents for a strong and united Canada that 
is a welcoming home for the people of Quebec as well as all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I hope to teach the government a bit of humility.  Why 
humility?  It is for one simple reason.  If our country is to be 
saved it will not be by the government.  It will not be by the 
plans of the Prime Minister or the letters of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs or the strategies of public servants 
who only a few short years ago were the architects of the 
Charlottetown accord.  The sooner the government accepts a bit of 
humility, the sooner the real work can begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada will save Canada, the men and women who 
love the country and make it work every day through their work 
and their faith; the 150,000 people who flooded into Montreal 
during the referendum campaign to demonstrate their love of 
country; and the many millions at home who held their breath 
during the voting.  Canadian unity hit absolute bottom that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in the past, if Canadians have the will and 
determination we can resolve federal and provincial concerns.  We 
can resolve aboriginal concerns.  We can resolve language 
concerns.  It will be an expression of popular will and not a 
master plan of political manipulation that will make the 
difference.  The grassroots will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a lesson that the nine premiers and two territorial 
leaders took to heart three months ago when they framed the 
Calgary declaration.  To their credit they realized that making a 
grand statement was not the object of the exercise.  Rather it 
was setting up the process for consultation that was so 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every province and territory, with the exception of Quebec, has 
put in place a consultative mechanism so its citizens can have 
their say on the principles of the Calgary declaration and the 
future of their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important step.  Through the motion we can urge 
the House to endorse efforts to encourage consultation.  As 
parliamentarians we must use our good offices to encourage our 
constituents to participate in the provincial consultation 
processes.  As Canadians we must make sure that all Canadians, 
especially those living in Quebec, receive the very important 
messages contained in the Calgary declaration.  Canadians wish to 
have dialogue to encourage unity discussions with all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration has some advantages over previous 
efforts to renew the federation.  We should be working to ensure 
its success.  It has the advantage of having come from the 
premiers and not from Ottawa, which will give it some added 
credibility in the eyes of many Canadians who remember the top 
down executive federalism that produced the Meech and 
Charlottetown accords.  Discussions involve the people of Canada 
and will have their direct input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the advantage of not being a fait accompli.  Instead it 
signals the flexibility of the federal system in which provinces 
have the freedom to exercise their powers in the way it best 
suits their traditions and character.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure to appear at a town hall discussion hosted 
jointly by my provincial elected colleagues.  Our open forum 
discussions touched on many topics but encouraged all to send 
their ideas and concepts to the Alberta legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The declaration is suggesting for consideration a way of 
breaking the deadlock that the phrase distinct society has 
created, rightly or wrongly, by polarizing opinion on whether 
Quebec should have a special status in Confederation.  Distinct 
society was undefined.  Unique has equality qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration recognizes the unique character of 
Quebec's society, including its French speaking majority, its 
culture and tradition, the civil law and the role that the Quebec 
government and legislature have in protecting and developing this 
unique character within Canada.  It also recognizes the 
legitimate aspirations of all provinces, the equality of their 
status in Confederation and the fairness of ensuring that any 
powers offered in a future constitutional amendment to one 
province be available to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canada is blessed by the uniqueness of many areas.  In 
short, the Calgary declaration recognizes reality.  That is what 
makes it so regrettable that the Bloc Quebecois and provincial 
government have not consulted Quebeckers on this important 
dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration emphasizes equality of people, equality 
of provinces and equality of powers.  If one province is 
conferred powers, they ought to be available to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important we take the steps necessary to extend the 
dialogue to include the people of Quebec.  We call on the 
government to do so in a formal manner.  We ask all hon. members 
to recognize their responsibilities as parliamentarians and to 
speak out in favour of a strong and united Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me reiterate my support for the motion as a 
member of Parliament, as an Albertan and as a Canadian.  It is my 
sincere hope that members of the government party will see the 
wisdom of putting their energy and enthusiasm behind the success 
of a Calgary initiative that does so much to encourage dialogue 
with all and of voting for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope members of the Bloc Quebecois will act in the best 
interest of all Quebeckers and will urge their masters in Quebec 
City to let their constituents have their say.  All Canadians 
must have the opportunity to speak out on the unity of our great 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the last 
election campaign, Reformers said that Quebeckers were not worthy 
to run the country.  When I hear that and read motions such as this 
one saying that the Reform Party has made a 180 degree turn, I 
cannot accept this, or the fact that they are undermining national 
unity.  They seem to come up with arguments valid only for the day 
they are used.  They are not speaking for the good of Canada as a 
whole.  I find this frustrating, and it worries me to see what is 
developing within the Reform Party.  It is something I cannot 
accept.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure to what 
the hon. member was alluding.  I can only speak most assuredly 
for myself.  I am standing in the Chamber as a result of the last 
referendum.  I was in Quebec City visiting and I saw the voting 
going on.  It was on a plane coming back to Edmonton that I 
resolved to seek out political parties on the work they were 
doing for national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had discussions with several parties and the one plan I 
wholeheartedly agreed with that supported national unity was that 
of the Reform Party.  That is when I first started working for 
the Reform.  I am standing here today because of the convictions 
of the Reform Party and its definite interest in national unity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to step into this disagreement between Conservative and Reform 
Party colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> It's all one family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> So it is.  We were criticized for the same 
thing earlier, but we can see that there is a family quarrel of 
much greater magnitude in that corner of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before putting a question to the Reform Party member, I would 
first like to explain to him that, when Quebeckers see his leader, 
whose campaign advertising blamed Quebec's leaders, with everything 
we know about his leader, when we see him, Jean Chrétien, and 
Stéphane Dion hand in hand, this creates a lot of mistrust in 
Quebec. 
Furthermore, I can understand why Quebeckers feel this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to explain to me how they can teach us 
anything about democratic spirit, when we know that there have been 
three referendums in Quebec in 15 years, that various forms of 
consultation were held on the constitutional issue, that we engaged 
in the highly democratic exercise of referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he not share the view of his NDP colleague that the 
ball is clearly in the federalists' court and that they should 
first of all agree among themselves on what they can offer 
Quebeckers?  The first step before any consultation of Quebeckers 
is to agree among themselves on what they can offer.  Why does he 
not share the opinion of his NDP colleague on this issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe in the Reform 
Party position on consultation.  It is a grassroots position. 
There is more truth and intelligence coming through from the 
people of Canada than we have seen.  I also stand to repeat that 
the referendum of two years ago was the result of 35 years of 
mismanagement by a revolving door of political parties in Ottawa 
which brought us to that abyss, which brought us and national 
unity to rock bottom.  That was management by federal parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally believe in the Reform Party's support for the process 
which involves consultation with the people of Canada across this 
great land.  That is where we will have real initiative and real 
movement on Canadian unity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate on the resolution. We 
in the Chamber are talking about something that is a priority or 
should be a priority to the House of Commons, the unity of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to members of the Bloc, the separatists.  I have 
listed to Liberal members.  I have listened to members of the 
Tory party.  One thing became very clear to me.  There is a 
tremendous difference in the approach and the definition the 
Reform Party gives to the word unity and the approach and the 
definition the Tories, the Liberals and the separatists give to 
the word unity.  For the three parties, the Tories, the Liberals 
and the separatists, the word unity is all about politics and 
political power.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference between them and us is that the word unity means 
bringing our country together, a united Canada, where the people 
of Canada have a say in the future of this country.  It is not 
about politics.  It is not about the Tory politics where under 
the regime of Brian Mulroney he brought separatists into his 
party simply for political power.  It is not about the politics 
of the Bloc members who have, through their snake oil salesmen, 
convinced so many people in Quebec that there is some sort of a 
nirvana out there if they can form their own nation.  It is not 
about the politics of the Liberal Party seeking to re-establish 
its political roots it lost in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To us it is about unity and uniting this country, uniting the 
grassroots of this country into a belief that this country can be 
better strengthened by the unity of all peoples under one flag, 
one nation, one people.  That is the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I laugh at the suggestions of the Tory party.  I laugh at the 
suggestions of the Bloc and the Liberal Party. Their arguments 
are just beyond belief because we know the agenda behind their 
arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unity should be the number one priority of this Parliament.  We 
in the Reform Party do endorse the initiatives that have come out 
of the Calgary declaration.  In particular, we endorse the 
philosophy and belief in that Calgary declaration process that 
the most important people and the most important factor in this 
whole unity debate is the input that comes from the ordinary 
Canadian citizens who love this country.  That is one of the 
things that has been left out of this discussion for over 30 
years.  The Liberals have left it out and the Tories have left it 
out.  They prefer to make their master plan for this country in 
the backrooms with their political strategists.  That is what is 
wrong and why the Meech Lake accord failed and the Charlottetown 
accord failed.  They never went to the people and consulted them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the difference between what the Calgary declaration is 
attempting to do and the failed attempts of the Mulroney 
Tories and the failed attempts of the Liberals who joined 
together under the Charlottetown accord saying this was a great 
plan for our country.  That is why it has failed.  The NDP also 
supported that.  It failed because they did not go to the people 
first and find out what the people thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an idea that this idea by the Reform Party of bringing 
the people of Canada into this debate is nonsense, this idea from 
the Tories, the Liberals and the Bloc. I shudder to think that if 
we left it up to the old line parties to come up with a master 
plan the people once more would not be invited to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeking to develop a plan that has some credibility and 
that can only be accomplished when we go to the people. The 
political parties that sat in this House in the past have no 
credibility when it comes to designing a unity plan.  We have 
seen this over the last 30 years.  They have failed.  They prefer 
to carry on the family fight between Quebec Liberals and 
separatists and the Tories and the separatists for political 
power within the province of Quebec, seeing who can outdo each 
other, not caring one whit for the unity of this country but more 
for the political power they could get out of the appeasement 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing about the Calgary declaration that we want 
to establish in this debate is that it was initiated outside of 
Ottawa.  It was initiated by the premiers and the territorial 
leaders.  It was a plan that would involve the people of Canada 
and bring them into this consensus gathering as to how we are 
going to get this country together.  It is time for Canadians to 
show the politicians how Canada should work, not the politicians 
to tell the Canadian people how this unity thing should work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all Canadians in this debate, as we will today, to 
make their opinions known, to attend the unity meetings across 
the country.  This is something the Tories did not allow under 
Brian Mulroney, something they did not allow under the 
Charlottetown accord and something the separatists would never 
even consider.

this dream of a wonderful nation that can survive and exist 
without the rest of Canada, which they know is a lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is not a done deal.  It is merely a 
start of a process that can possibly lead to a solution to our 
unity crisis.  Therefore there are important interests that we 
want to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we want to consider the fundamental policy, the 
fundamental belief that all Canadians are equal.  No one should 
have special status in this country.  Why?  This just creates 
problems.  It has created problems for 30 years and we see it in 
the House today, as the Quebec Liberals and the separatists 
banter back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it as the Tories join in the conversation.  They do not 
recognize equality in this country.  While all province may be 
diverse in their characteristics, they should have equal status 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have one province holding a position that is higher 
than the other provinces.  I do not care which province they are 
talking about, whether it is my home province of British 
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan or Quebec.  No status that is not 
equal, it cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality is the cornerstone of getting to this position of unity 
in this country.  No one wants to live in a second class 
province.  No Canadian should have rights that are not enjoyed by 
other Canadians and no equality simply increases regional 
resentment and national division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without equality we cannot have a collective, united feeling 
about our country.  While the Tories, the Liberals and the 
separatists would prefer to talk about what is best on a regional 
type basis, the Reform Party wants to talk about equality where 
all regions in the country, all provinces and all people live 
together on an equal basis under that wonderful Canadian flag 
that adorns this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality also means an end to domineering federalism.  We in the 
Reform Party have talked about devolution of powers, getting rid 
of this big central government which dictates to the provinces in 
areas where it should not even be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we talk about passing powers down to the province of Quebec 
that it should handle itself.  At the same time, we talk about 
passing those same powers down to the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the separatists here, when we are talking 
about the transfer of powers into areas the federal government 
should not be in, on to their province, would not be in favour of 
that.  Yet they are not because it does not fit with the big lie 
that they have been telling the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that all parliamentarians in this House forget about 
the politics they have been playing for the last 30 years. Forget 
about that and start thinking about what is best for this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal members opposite laugh when we talk about unity. It 
does not fit into their philosophy.  They are more interested in 
politics, as I stated earlier.  I ask the members to support this 
resolution and let us begin another step toward the unity of this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it extremely offensive that we get told by the Reform 
Party that all of us here do not care one whit for Canadian 
unity, as if they have the golden message, the true faith, they 
are the people who have the answers for everything else and 
everybody else is wrong.  The hon. member accuses the Liberal 
Party of not having carried out consultations during 
Charlottetown.  I do not think he knows his dossier very well. We 
were not the government party so we could not have carried out 
consultations. He had better check his files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really think the Reform Party in trying to push its motion, 
which has a lot of good in it, should really try to involve all 
of us if it really cares for unity, rather than just saying “we 
have the perfect message and all of you, a curse on your 
houses”.  I think that is a very sad message coming from the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had been 
listening I pointed out that given the dismal failure of the 
Liberals and the Tories and the NDP who joined with them over the 
last 30 years in trying to bring this country together, and they 
have failed, they have lost the trust of Canadians and they have 
to start to earn that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That first step starts with involving the people of Canada in 
this process which they have never done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that during the failed Charlottetown accord 
the Liberal joined with the Tories and the NDP to try to sell 
that Charlottetown accord to the Canadian people, a process 
getting to that accord that did not involve the Canadian people. 
Sure, there was a dog and pony show going across the country with 
hand selected witnesses to give their input, but the average 
Canadian was left out and that is why they voted against the 
Charlottetown accord.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find that 
the debate between the Reform member for Surrey, if I am not mistaken, 
and the member from the La Salle Blues Band across the way exemplifies 
the kind of situation we are facing in Canada because we have two 
opposite views. On the one hand, the hon. member from the Reform Party, 
who does not speak French and may not even have bothered to come to 
Quebec to enquire about the real demands Quebec has been making for 30 
years, but is nevertheless trying to preach the virtues of unity based 
on some kind of Anglo-Canadian supremacy that would basically drown out 
Quebec's demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there is the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis, 
who is presenting the other side of the national unity issue, one that 
seems to reflect a clear understanding of Quebec's demands, because we 
are well aware that he once was a minister in the Quebec National 
Assembly. Yet, the end result is exactly the same. In fact, it would not 
make any difference if they were members of the Conservative Party or 
the NDP; the bottom line is that they argue, but they all agree on one 
thing: to put forward proposal like the Calgary declaration, in which 
there is nothing but empty words, that has no political weight 
whatsoever and ignores the legitimate and justifiable demands Quebec has 
been making for 30 years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I make no apologies to 
stand in this House and say that I am unable to speak French.  I 
make no apology for that.  I am a Canadian and I love this 
country.  If anyone should apologize it should be this separatist 
member who sits there and refuses to acknowledge that Canadian 
flag, refuses to sing the national anthem of this country in this 
House and day after day preaches the breaking up of this country. 
If anyone should apologize it should be that separatist member 
there.

am pleased to take part in this debate today, but before I begin, I wish 
to inform you of something. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really quite tempting to raise a number of the issues that 
were addressed by the last speaker from the Reform Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely surprised and disappointed at the comments that 
were made.  There was a comment that Quebec could not make it 
alone.  What a wonderful way to start a dialogue.  There were 
comments such as “a dog and pony show” that ridiculed the 
efforts of Canadians and their elected representatives to try to 
understand and to find solutions.  There were other comments too 
numerous to mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tempted to talk about issues such as what was mentioned in 
the last campaign, that no Quebecker should ever again be prime 
minister.  I am tempted—I am looking for some divine help—to 
talk about double talk, the comment about Stornoway and what 
happened, but I shall resist temptation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the Reform member's proposal, which I find pretty 
reasonable, perfectly reasonable in fact. Perhaps this is due to the 
fact that he is new and others around him have not had the chance to 
socialize with him so far. He came up with a perfectly reasonable 
proposal, as far as I am concerned, and he wants to promote consultation 
with Canadians across the country. I applaud this approach. He wants to 
get Canadians involved. He seems to want to go beyond partisanship and 
I support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I think he should speak to his colleagues. One of them has just 
stated that there was nothing accomplished over the last 30 years. 
Another claims that his party is the only one that can make a 
contribution. Still another has made comments that are unworthy of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the proposal we are discussing today should be 
supported. It should be supported because it refers to consultations 
with Canadians across the country. What I would like very much to know 
is the position of this political party and also of each political party 
on the Calgary declaration. Is it to early to decide on this issue? It 
is not too early however to tell others what they should be doing. I 
would like to say a few words on this today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So obviously, our political parties differ, even if we agree more 
or less on the proposal that we are discussing today. There are a great 
number of differences on immigration, the role of aboriginal peoples in 
Canada, bilingualism and many other things. I could talk a lot longer on 
this, but the point to remember is that there are great differences, in 
all areas, and these will never disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meeting of Canada's premiers called for public consultations. 
This declaration is a good starting point for creating understanding 
about our country, about the needs of each region, and, of course, about 
the needs of Quebeckers. 
The Calgary declaration has the support of a great number of people 
throughout the country. It is true that there are people who are 
completely against it, and that is understandable. But many responsible 
people endorse this declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the public discuss this proposal and talk 
about Canada, and that people gain a greater understanding of each 
province and territory, and, of course, of Quebec, which is often not 
well understood. Consultations are necessary because they might go 
beyond that in terms of creating a greater of understanding of who we 
are as a community. I am speaking about all the communities within the 
country. I believe they can promote pride.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We may come to realize that we must work more closely together to 
be stronger and more receptive to our various needs as citizens of a 
specific province, or as members of a specific linguistic, religious or 
cultural group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about certain principles. I will begin with 
equality. Let me share with you what a Canadian citizen told me. He said 
“This is a principle with which we cannot disagree, a principle 
recognized in section 15 of the 1982 Constitution Act. 
It is clearly stated that all Canadians are equal, regardless of sex, 
race, religion, social status or wealth. To state such a principle is in 
itself sufficient to demonstrate its validity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some political parties—and, as I said earlier, I will try to 
restrain myself—will use something like the principle of equality to 
make other claims. The fact is that it has been in Canadian law for a 
very long time. The question is whether the principle is always applied 
fairly. We could probably find examples where it was not the case, but 
let us look at the big picture. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the equality of provinces.  There is but one 
legal status for the provinces.  There are not six.  A province 
is a province.  None can pull rank on the others.  We know that. 
Though equal they are nonetheless different, with their own 
economic, social, cultural and historical characteristics. Though 
equal the provinces are nevertheless differentiated from one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what some people misunderstand.  They misunderstand it 
profoundly and they exploit it.  They exploit it to their 
political advantage.  As they do so they tear up the country. 
They are guilty of tearing up this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country, which has supposedly done nothing for the last 30, 
40, 50 years, is the envy of the world.  It is number one on 
virtually everyone's list.  Millions of people have come to it as 
quickly as they could. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about other principles. Let us talk about diversity, 
tolerance, compassion and equal opportunities. Let us talk about how we 
could meet the needs of Aboriginal people, about how we could get them 
more involved. Let us not forget multiculturalism, which is an 
undeniable reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in the declaration, respect for diversity and equality 
underlies unity. However, equality does not mean uniformity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> This is what is not understood by a number 
of political parties, including the members who are yelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the declaration states that respect for diversity and 
equality underlies unity, but equality does not mean uniformity. To 
reconcile the principle of equality with the great value of diversity, 
Canada can count on a political system which, thanks to its flexibility, 
promotes the enrichment of our collective heritage. No other example 
better illustrates this reality than the recognition of Quebec's unique 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is this unique character? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> These are just words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> I heard someone say that these are just 
words. It is unfortunate that the member cannot read and understand the 
declaration. This is the problem. He did not take time to read the 
declaration or to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand:</B> Explain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Mike Harris? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> Yes, one person only. Let us take one 
person in one province only and let us pretend he knows the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> The Premier of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> Oh, what an effort you are making to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Give us details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> What an effort you are making to show how 
openminded you are, dear colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> The premier in Toronto understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> But allow me to continue. “In Canada's 
federal system”—and I will end on that point—“where respect for 
diversity and equality underlies unity, the unique character of Quebec 
society, including its French-speaking majority, its culture and its 
tradition of civil law, is fundamental to the well-being of 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on, but unfortunately I am being interrupted. How 
undemocratic, don't you think?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. Before going to questions and 
comments, I wish to inform the House that I have considered the 
amendment moved by the hon. member for Edmonton East,  and I declare 
that it is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate is on the amendment, therefore. The hon. member for 
Chicoutimi, for a comment or a question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
I think this debate clearly shows that as politicians we all have a 
professional interest in constitutional matters. We have not always made 
a very positive contribution. On the contrary, past failures can rarely 
be blamed on the citizens we represent, while, in many instances, 
politicians displayed a lack of responsibility for which we are still 
paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very surprised. I hope that the Liberal Party of Canada is in 
caucus, because its position is rather hard to understand: to accept and 
support a motion moved by a party with a not so glorious past, asking 
that we communicate with Quebeckers and consult them on something that 
is really incomplete. 
That is perfectly normal. We are in a phase where a process was put in 
motion and it is perfectly normal to take some precautions before 
getting everyone involved, before consulting a people, namely the people 
of Quebec, who were sorely disappointed in the Canadian federal system 
in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While realizing that it is not good to dwell on the past, 
opportunities must always be sought to give people a chance to change 
their minds. But when we read what Preston Manning has written—the 
man who once said in passing, at the time of the Meech Lake failure: 
“I 
wish one of the western premiers would deliver the deathblow to the 
accord”—it is hard to conceive that he could change his position so 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all the recent negative publicity about politicians in 
Quebec, it is asking a lot to support today's motion, which urges the 
government to consult Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party endorses a motion which is pure provocation for 
all our fellow citizens in Quebec and for all French-Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party would support 
the withdrawal of the Reform Party motion out of respect for all 
Quebeckers and all French-Canadians, until such time as, hopefully, a 
proposal can be put forward that is substantial, takes into account 
Quebec's historical demands and stands a chance of gaining wide support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleague could kindly tell us what he thinks of this 
idea, because the course we are on today is a collision course, which, 
far from helping the debate, is making it worse. 
Once again, it would be irresponsible for us as politicians to fast 
track something without being properly informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think everyone, 
including my colleagues from Quebec, know that I have enormous 
respect for Quebec.  I always have.  I speak French.  I wear my 
culture with pride.  I always have.  I did not convert after I 
entered political life.  It is not a matter of respect.  Both I and 
my colleagues have respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening today?  It is true that the party that moved 
this motion does not have a glorious past on this issue.  But there 
are members of this party who are trying.  Trying to do what?  To 
consult.  To have Canadians understand what this is about.  So, 
obviously I will support such a process.  Why not?  Why not give a 
chance to this new member, who could perhaps enlighten some of his 
colleagues who are not so enlightened, if we are to judge by the 
speeches today. 
We are talking about consultations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also asked this party about its position on the Calgary 
declaration.  Ours is very clear.  We support the consultation and 
we support Quebec's unique character.  This is the party that 
introduced the motion we voted on in support of Quebec's distinct 
nature.  Have people forgotten that?  This is the party that did 
so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to rise today before this House to give my views on 
this very important motion introduced by my colleague from 
Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no more important issue than the unity of Canada. We on 
this side of the House confirmed this view in the Speech from the 
Throne earlier this fall by identifying national unity as our 
highest priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the premiers of nine provinces as well as two 
territorial leaders met on September 14 to discuss a framework 
for consulting the population about strengthening the Canadian 
federation.  What resulted was the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary principles and consultations are a gesture of 
goodwill toward all Canadians including Quebeckers, aboriginal 
peoples and our linguistic minorities.  While the declaration is 
not a legal draft nor a proposal for a constitutional amendment, 
we believe it is an important step in the right direction.  It is 
an invitation extended by 11 provincial and territorial 
governments to all Canadians and all regions to reflect on and 
engage in a new discussion about the values we share as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also hope that the Calgary principles will lead us to a 
consensus on the core values of our country including respect for 
the unique character of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side endorse the principles of the 
premiers, the territorial leaders and all Canadians to foster 
national unity.  Further we fully support the consultation 
process begun by those premiers and territorial leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary principles are the work of the premiers and the 
territorial leaders.  The federal government was not a 
participant at the Calgary meeting and is not a major participant 
in the current provincial and territorial consultation 
procedures. That being said however, I do intend to do what I can 
to promote positive public debate on this very important issue, 
the Calgary principles, both in my own province and across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the Calgary initiative was undertaken in part 
because of the interest of the nine premiers and the territorial 
leaders in consulting their own populations to create a better 
working environment.  While they are at various stages, 
consultations on the Calgary principles are well under way in 
those nine provinces and the territories.  This demonstrates a 
commitment of those premiers and leaders to the Calgary 
principles and by all accounts to date support for these 
principles has been widespread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House urge Canadians to become involved 
in this very important consultation process.  We urge them to 
express their opinion or to suggest possible improvements to the 
principles as outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the separatist government in Quebec will not 
consult Quebeckers on these principles?  Is it because the 
principles make sense and define Canadian values and ideals?  Is 
it because it knows that the majority of Quebeckers in fact 
support these principles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be specific on each of the seven principles as outlined 
by the premiers and the territorial leaders in the Calgary 
declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the equality of citizens.  All Canadians are equal and 
have rights protected by law.  This principle is entrenched in 
section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  This 
means that all Canadians irrespective of sex, race, religion, 
social or economic status are equal before the law.  But equality 
is not the same as uniformity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a democracy like ours, equality and freedom go hand in hand. 
Nothing forces us to have the same beliefs or preferences as 
anybody else.  We all have the right to be different.  In other 
words all the children in the family are equal but that does not 
mean we are all the same.  That is why the Constitution itself in 
section 36 of the Constitution Act, 1982 commits all governments 
in Canada to the promotion of equal opportunities for the 
well-being of all Canadians.  It is why various sections of the 
Constitution recognize aboriginal and treaty rights of our 
aboriginal peoples as well as the rights enjoyed by our 
linguistic minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the equality of the provinces.  We believe that the 
principle of equality that applies to individuals also applies to 
the provinces. 
It is our view that all provinces have equality of status.  None 
is set above the others and all have the same fundamental legal 
relationship with the people who live there.  Having said that, 
their equality of status does not mean that they cannot be 
different one from the other. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case for all individual Canadians, provincial equality 
does not mean provincial uniformity. Each and every province 
deserves equal consideration but each province has its own needs 
which vary depending on circumstances. This is how our federal 
system makes room for differences and avoids locking the 
provinces into a rigid structure that would make it impossible 
for them to respond to their own special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, diversity, tolerance, compassion and equality of 
opportunity. The history of Canada has been marked by genuine 
openness to differences and by a generous spirit of tolerance. 
While every country has its weaknesses, circumstances have led us 
in Canada to develop greater respect for the diverse backgrounds 
of all our citizens.  Our spirit of partnership and compassion 
has inspired our federal and provincial governments to create 
social programs that are the envy of the world and which attest 
to our desire to work in partnership to give equal chances to 
everyone and our compassion for the neediest among us.  That is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, our national identity is enriched by the contributions 
of our aboriginal peoples, the vitality of the English and French 
languages and the multicultural character of Canada.  Like the 
Calgary declaration and the more recent statements released by 
the premiers and leaders, the Speech from the Throne recognizes 
the invaluable contribution of the aboriginal peoples to the 
building of Canada and the richness of our identity. We and the 
aboriginal peoples must work together to respond to the 
challenges they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's two official languages are another of our country's 
riches.  Linguistic duality and the viability of both official 
language communities in all parts of the country are part and 
parcel of our great identity.  One of the strengths of Canada, 
our official languages are two of the languages in greatest use 
worldwide.  They contribute substantially to Canada's success 
economically, socially, culturally and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multicultural character of Canada is a source of national 
pride and enrichment as well as being a universal ideal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the unique character of Quebec society.  Our recognition 
of the linguistic and cultural differences of Quebec addresses 
its unique needs and circumstances and is in keeping with the 
equality of the provinces and of individual Canadians. That is 
why Parliament has adopted a resolution recognizing these 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recognition of Quebec is a positive message to Quebeckers 
who want to be part of the great Canadian family.  It 
demonstrates to Quebeckers that the rest of Canada does accept 
them and respects their right to be different.  It is also linked 
with the core Canadian values which Calgary underscored, that 
Canadians share with their fellow citizens in Quebec: the values 
of respect, partnership, fairness, justice and openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, if any future constitutional amendment confers powers on 
one province, these powers must be available to all provinces. 
While the Calgary declaration does not call for any amendments in 
or additions to the division of powers among the governments, in 
the event that such an amendment were contemplated, then the 
equality of provinces would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that all provinces must have the same tools available 
to them to promote their own development.  Any tool available to 
one province must meet its specific needs and must be available 
to all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, greater partnership among the two levels of government 
while respecting each other's jurisdiction.  This is what the 
seventh principle states.  We can all agree that the vast 
majority of Canadians want their provincial and federal 
governments to act in the common interest of all and build a true 
Canadian partnership based on solidarity and respect for our 
diversity and for areas of federal and provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has been working very hard to ensure the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the federation by emphasizing 
consultation and collaboration.  The list of all the areas on 
which the federal and provincial governments are collaborating is 
long. To name a couple, they include labour market training and

change if we are going to survive as a society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I greatly 
appreciated my colleague's speech.  It was polite and eloquent but it 
meant nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, if he has the time, that he read a book by a 
journalist at <I>The Globe and Mail</I>, Ray Conlogue, entitled <I>The Impossible 
Nation</I>. He would learn a lot from that book on the reality of Canada, a 
reality symbolized by the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, there was a referendum, the first referendum ever held in 
Quebec, and on that occasion, Quebec told Canada how much its situation 
in Canada was frustrating.  That referendum led to the Meech Lake 
agreement, the Meech Lake formula proposed by a federalist Quebec 
government, Robert Bourassa's government.  That agreement represented 
the minimum Quebec could ask from Canada at the time.  Naturally, Canada 
refused that minimum and there was a second referendum in which Quebec 
voted even more strongly to express its discomfort at being part of 
Canada. 
That process led to the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is absolutely nothing in this declaration. It is a 
formula offering even less than the Meech Lake formula, where the 
uniqueness of Quebec within Canada is mixed in with so many other 
elements that we no longer recognize Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could tell me how the Calgary declaration 
can solve the problem of unity and equality in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am heartened by the Calgary 
declaration and what it stands for and especially by the 
consultation process that is part and parcel of that very 
important statement not only by the premiers but also by the 
territorial leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we know that Canada is now able to proceed 
along these lines and take a look, and a hard look, by all 
Canadians in a consultation process to ensure that all Canadians 
are heard and that we try to unify the country in a manner 
consistent with our history and consistent with our aims and 
objectives as we move into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is a very important first step. I am 
heartened by the leadership role that has been taken not only 
here today but also by the premiers especially and the 
territorial leaders in this very important area of nationhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Hon. members, as we

one person wanting to respond, if I see some activity on the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank our colleague from the Liberal 
Party for his very non-partisan speech.  It was very welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would however like to ask him a question.  We have seen over 
the last 15 years successive provincial separatist governments in 
the province of Quebec wanting to carve the province out of 
Canada.  Given what he has seen over the last 10 to 15 years in 
this country, does he himself believe that the current Bloc 
Quebecois, Mr. Bouchard and the Parti Quebecois have any interest 
whatsoever in keeping Quebec within Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would never presume to 
speak for the Parti Quebecois or the Bloc Quebecois but I would 
say on my own behalf that I would hope Canadians, men and women 
of goodwill across this great nation, would work very hard to 
ensure the viability and the unity of this great country of ours. 
I would expect that would be the position taken by people who 
genuinely want to unify Canada and maintain the strength of this 
great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope as we move into the 21st century that is the 
position taken by Canadians. 
I see that being the case.  I am heartened more and more by the 
fact that we are moving in this direction and I am confident that 
that is the direction that precisely we will take.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to give my speech in French in order to send a clear message 
to the people of Quebec.  Unfortunately, my fluency in French is 
limited. Therefore, I will speak in English. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my hon. colleague from 
Edmonton—Strathcona for bringing this motion to the House today 
at this very important time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, in effect, as part of the Reform Party trying to 
articulate, trying to break the glass ceiling on the national 
unity issue.  This issue has been with us for over 200 years but 
in particular over the last 15 years we have seen our nation 
fractured into two solitudes or into a number of solitudes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ties that should bind us as the greatest nation of the earth 
are not being encouraged.  In fact, because of repeated inaction 
by federal governments and a lack of courage and a will to really 
deal with this issue in a substantive way through consulting and 
dealing with the people, we have seen our nation be but a shadow 
of what it could be and the ties that should bind us as people 
break apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a separatist movement in British Columbia.  We have 
a separatist movement in Quebec.  We have seen rumblings in the 
maritimes.  What a shame for a nation, for all the wealth that we 
have as a country, to have this happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to continue on this course, we will indeed fracture. 
Would it not be a profound tragedy for that to happen?  Would it 
not be a profound tragedy for us to fracture into little 
solitudes in our own little worlds when indeed we could be far 
greater as a group than what we could be as individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no point in time was this more evident than in 1995 during 
the referendum.  This did not merely appear on our television 
sets overnight or in a few months.  Rather, it was the 
culmination of at least 15 years of profound dissatisfaction from 
the people of Quebec and people across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dissatisfaction of the people in Quebec is expressed perhaps 
in different ways but equally passionately by Canadians across 
this country.  We do not feel that the current constitutional 
envelope in which our country currently exists is working. 
Indeed, the proof is in the pudding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec, people in British Columbia, people across 
our nation have been clamouring for a new vision for Canada, a 
new Canada where the provinces can have the powers to do what 
they do best and the feds have the powers to do what they do 
best, where Canadians have a direct input into the policy making 
that happens in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens in this House is not a democracy, as we all know. 
The people out there are disarticulated from the policy that is 
made in the House of Commons.  In part that explains the 
dissatisfaction from the people of Quebec.  That has to be dealt 
with and it has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for argument's sake, we continue going the way we are going 
and separation starts to fall by the wayside as it has been, if 
in the next referendum the people vote 60% no against separation, 
would that be success? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that it is not success.  I would argue that the 
way we are going, the people who would vote 60% no would merely 
be voting for the bastard that they dislike the least, not voting 
for a vision of Canada for the simple reason that no one, except 
I would argue the Reform Party over the last few years, has been 
trying to articulate a new message, a new vision, a new division 
of powers for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the failures of Liberal and Conservative 
governments before.  I am not going to dwell on this but merely 
state a historical fact.  We need to look at a new way and we 
want to work with all members in this House, all parties in this 
House to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact my colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona in his motion has 
said very clearly that we want, we demand and we encourage the 
government and particularly all Canadians, to be involved in this 
important process.  We want the people of Quebec to be involved 
in this process. 
For too long the people of Quebec and indeed the people of Canada 
have been left out of this debate.  This debate has taken place 
in the rarefied atmosphere among political elites and 
intellectual elites.  While our country hangs in the balance this 
debate has gone on in quarters that are less important by far 
than the public.  The public must be involved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process is only valuable if the government is going to 
listen to what the people are saying.  It is not going to be 
useful if their wishes and their desires are going to be ignored 
again.  Merely going through the motions is not going to do 
justice to articulating that vision that holds our nation 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the member before a very important question.  I asked 
him whether or not he felt that the Parti Quebecois, the Bloc 
Quebecois, Mr. Bouchard, Mr. Parizeau and their ilk are 
interested in keeping our country together.  If we ask the Bloc 
Quebecois members here today, they are not interested in keeping 
Quebec in Canada.  We asked them that in the last Parliament and 
they said “Vrai”.  It is true that they do not want to keep 
Quebec in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we negotiating with people who have no interest in 
keeping Quebec in Canada?  We have repeatedly gone around in a 
circle because we repeatedly try to debate and discuss and put 
forth solutions to people who have no interest whatsoever in 
keeping Quebec in Canada.  Therefore, we cannot win.  It is 
impossible to win in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we have to negotiate with the people of Quebec.  We 
have to get in the trenches.  We have to parler français avec la 
francophonie, parler anglais with the English speaking people, 
work with the allophones, work with the anglophones, work with 
the francophones, get our message across directly to the people 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will fail miserably if we continue to negotiate with 
separatist politicians who are only interested in keeping Quebec 
out of Canada.  It is a loser's game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot implore more strongly, I beg as a Canadian, not as a 
member of Parliament, for this House to bring the message 
repeatedly and consistently to the people of Quebec.  It is 
exceedingly important, essential in fact in keeping our country 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also extremely important that in the process of doing this 
we dispel the myths that have occurred.  In the last referendum 
the people of Quebec thought they could send members of 
Parliament to this House if they separated.  The people of Quebec 
felt they could use the Canadian dollar, which they might do. 
They felt also that they would have more power over their 
economy.  They used the European Union as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec was to engage in a relationship as an independent 
country along the lines of the Maastricht treaty, along the lines 
of the European Union, their control over monetary and fiscal 
policy would be less than what they have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec did not understand that.  There were many 
myths flying around and no one was doing anything about them 
because the government said “Don't worry, be happy, everything 
is going to be fine”.  We came within a razor's edge of 
fracturing Canada.  That will never happen again as long as the 
Reform Party is here to defend Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message that we send across goes directly through a 
separatist leaning francophone media in Quebec, not all but the 
vast majority of them.  That is part of the reason why the 
majority of Quebeckers are more familiar with plan B than plan A. 
They can be manipulated in that way to think that the rest of 
Canada does not want them in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Quebec East said in the last Parliament, the 
problem is that English Canadians hate French Canadians, en 
français. That message gets across to the people of Quebec and we 
do nothing to dispel those horrendous and poisonous myths. 
What about the francophone population in the rest of Canada? What 
about the Acadian population in New Brunswick?  No one speaks 
about that, least of all the separatist members in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Quebec East was on a television program with me. 
I asked him the following question:  If you separate what will 
happen to the French-speaking people in New Brunswick, the 
Acadians in New Brunswick, and the French-speaking people in 
northern Ontario?  He answered “Who cares?”  Who cares?  We 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French-speaking population, the French culture and the 
French language are integral and essential to Canada.  We are 
proud of that fact, we love it and we want francophones to be a 
part of Canada forever as equals.  The people of Quebec also want 
to be equals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the people of Quebec want?  It is understandable that 
they do not want their language and culture diluted in a sea of 
anglophones.  That is why the Reform Party said we should give 
the powers over culture and language directly to the provinces to 
manage.  Then the province of Quebec, as every province, would be 
the master of its own cultural and linguistic destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec want better jobs and a better future for 
their children.  They want strong social programs.  That is what 
the Reform Party stands for and I am sure that members across 
this House stand for the same thing.  We have effective 
solutions.  We have put those solutions forward repeatedly. 
Before the last referendum we gave the government a plan on how 
to give the provinces power over what they do best and how to 
give the feds power over what they do best.  That is essential to 
keeping our country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to heal the wounds and to articulate this vision 
of a stronger future for all Canadians.  It is important to note 
what the people of Quebec actually receive from the federal 
government.  It is amazing to listen to the myths believed by 
many in Quebec, that Quebec gives money to the federal government 
and gets nothing in return.  Twenty-seven per cent of Quebec's 
provincial budget comes from the federal government.  When I say 
that, an extraordinary number of people in Quebec feel they have 
just dropped off the edge of the planet.  That kind of thing must 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A division of power is important.  The Reform Party also put 
forward the notion of the triple E senate.  During the 
Charlottetown agreement discussions there was an agreement on a 
2.5 E senate with regional rather than provincial representation. 
At least this way the senate would balance out the population 
powers in this House by regional interests and regional power. 
That way all people in our country could be more empowered, 
including the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot argue strongly enough that today more than ever we need 
to have a vision for our nation.  We are not a country without an 
identity.  We are a country with a very strong identity which we 
get from our international experiences, through peacekeeping and 
the agreements and work in the House of Commons yesterday in the 
pursuit of a ban on land mines which will save thousands of 
people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are respected throughout the world as peacemakers, as 
organizers, as individuals and as a nation of people that can be 
respected abroad.  Canadians are respected because we show 
respect abroad.  We can lead the world as a nation that has 
managed to bring in people from all over the world from disparate 
religions and languages into an environment that is relatively 
safe.  No other country in the world has been able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to deal with the national unity issue now.  That is why 
my colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona and the other members of 
the Reform Party are trying to push this issue.  We no longer 
want to go to the edge of the precipice as we did in 1995 to find 
our country almost lost.  We must articulate a message that 
involves the devolution of sensible powers to the provinces under 
the umbrella of equality.  We must enable the feds to do what the 
feds do best and the provinces to do what the provinces do best.

one interest only, the separation of the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must send our message not through the separatist media in 
Quebec but directly to the people, eyeball to eyeball, heart to 
heart, soul to soul.  We must dispel these myths.  We must reach 
out our hands in an environment of equality.  We must build 
bridges of tolerance and understanding so that we together can be 
brothers and sisters in this great nation of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must respect our differences.  Indeed we must use our 
differences to build a stronger nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades we have used our differences to pull ourselves 
apart.  We have isolated ourselves.  We have developed as a 
nation of solitudes.  These differences are not chasms which keep 
us apart; they are ties which bind us together.

at us, we would be proud.  Perhaps we would have a new insight on 
what it means to be Canadian.

Canadians will understand this motion, work on its principles and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we heard a lot of wonderful words from the member opposite about 
brothers and sisters and working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally I would congratulate the Reform Party for this motion, 
except that I smell a hidden agenda.  I wonder about the 
suggestion of going to the people of Quebec.  If Reform members 
are going to communicate with the people of Quebec, I would like 
the member to tell me if they intend to use the same advertising 
agency they used during the federal election campaign, which sent 
a very poisonous message that was not helpful to Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree with the member that the separatists have no 
interest whatsoever in keeping this country unified.  However, we 
must develop a reasonable option where if we are saying that the 
separatists do not want to keep Canada together, we are prepared 
to talk to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask if the member could tell us exactly how Reform 
members would calmly talk to Quebeckers to ensure them that they 
are indeed a unique people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we would speak to the 
people of Quebec as we have spoken to the people of Quebec in the 
House today.  The message that we have given today will go to 
people all across the country, including the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's agenda is not hidden. The Reform Party's 
agenda is very transparent: keep our country together, build a 
stronger country, work together toward unity.  We would do it by 
the division of powers. Let the provinces do what the provinces 
do best, and let the feds do what the feds do best.  We would 
ensure that the people of Quebec would have the power to control 
their culture and language, as would all the provinces.  We would 
do it under the umbrella of equality for all.

I appreciate what he had to say. I want to come back to his suggestion. 
He seems to have something to say to the people of Quebec; I would 
suggest, if he is really interested in solving the problem, that he 
listen to Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in Canada is that people do not listen to Quebec. To 
begin with, he should wonder why is Canada falling apart. It is not 
Quebeckers' fault. It is not because they did not say what was on their 
mind and what was troubling them, it is because nobody wants to listen. 
People have been disregarding the message not of something that is 
uniquely Canadian, but from a third or a quarter of the Canadian 
population, one of the founding nations of Canada, which today has been 
reduced to something with a unique character.

for many years and it is one I enjoy tremendously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to talk about listening to the people of 
Quebec, he would have listened to what was said in the last two 
Quebec referendums.  He would have gone home and tried to build a 
stronger Canada. The people of Quebec have clearly stated that 
they want to stay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> For a few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  That is the problem.  The members of

put that aside because I want to build on something more 
positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is partly correct.  All people of Quebec have been 
dissatisfied with the provincial and federal relationship for 
many years.  He will be interested to know that the 
dissatisfaction is felt by Canadians across the country, by 
British Columbians, Albertans, maritimers and Ontarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised the subject of unique and distinct.  The 
people of Quebec do not give a care about unique and distinct. 
They want good jobs, strong social programs and a better future.

have a brief comment. I hope our Liberal friends across the way have 
understood, following what Reform members said this morning, that they 
had better vote against the motion from the Reform Party if they want to 
keep some credibility in the constitutional debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Reform member. He gave a poignant, perhaps 
interesting speech. About francophones, he said “Who cares?” I would 
like to answer that question. Reform certainly does not care, judging by 
its anti-francophone campaign during the last federal election. But I 
would like to ask him how he reconciles the fact he wants to abolish the 
Official Languages Act with the defence of francophones in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>   Mr. Speaker, before the last 
referendum the prime minister said “don't worry, be happy, 
everything is going to be fine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party said that everything was not fine.  Months 
before the referendum we put together a plan A and a plan B.  It 
is interesting that now the government is articulating a message 
which is very similar to our plans A and B, one it denigrated 
before the last referendum.  Who cares?  The Reform Party cares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a member in the House outside of the 
Bloc Quebecois who does not care about keeping Canada together. 
All members of the House and the vast majority of Canadians, 
including the people of Quebec, want to stay in Canada.  We just 
need a vision.  We need to change the federal-provincial 
responsibilities. The people of Quebec need to understand that 
they are welcome and loved within the family of Canada.  They are 
an integral part of our history and our future. We need to get 
that message across.  However, it will do no good for this debate 
to occur just within the House and with the people who are 
watching today. The message has to get into the living rooms and 
kitchens of people across the country, in particular to the 
people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to have the francophones of northern Ontario, 
Manitoba, New Brunswick and other parts of the maritimes as 
allies to keep our country together.  Francophones in Quebec must 
understand that their language is stronger within a united Canada 
than it would be in a divided one.

of the Reform messages I have been hearing over the last half 
hours or so I feel like I am sucking on a very sour candy or a 
lemon. I am left with a very bitter taste in my mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the words unity and grassroots being spit out like 
invectives.  They are not nice sounding words.  I wonder why I am 
not feeling the warm fuzzy stuff that I am supposed to be feeling 
from you people.  In fact, it does not feel good to me.  It feels 
very suspect.  I question your desires to actually keep this 
country together.

that talking about consulting the people through grassroots and 
talking about national unity is invective and somehow poisonous, 
I suggest she look at a dictionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have repeatedly tried to put forth plans to keep our country 
together.  In fact, I introduced last year a letter writing 
campaign between students in Quebec and students in British of 
Columbia. What I hope to do is get the young people of British 
Columbia and Quebec writing to each other to try to dispel the 
myths between them, for them to understand each other.  If we can 
get to the youth, when they are confronted by myths put out by 
separatist politicians, they will say “I have a friend in 
British Columbia.  My friend is a good person who talks sense, 
who likes me, who has very similar concerns”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how we are going to build ties.  We are going to build 
them by building bridges of understanding, tolerance and 
communication.  I have not heard anything from the New Democratic 
Party, any message whatsoever on how to keep the country 
together.  I strongly urge the member to look at our plans, plans 
based on keeping the country together on the basis of equality 
for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I said earlier today, I congratulate the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona for his initiative in presenting to the 
House of Commons an opportunity to speak on national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of debate which should throw the clock away. 
As long as members want to speak on it we should be allowed to 
keep going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the motion I totally support.  It may not seem 
as a surprise to him but I come from a totally different 
direction on how we resolve the issue of national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to this city in 1979-80.  I had the privilege and the 
pleasure of working for the prime minister of Canada at that 
time, the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  One of the 
central themes of the prime minister was the Constitution.  One 
of the areas within the Constitution the prime minister was 
passionately committed to was the whole are of national programs. 
He believed, and nearly all of us supported him in this House, 
even many members in the opposition, that national programs 
create national will.  From national will you have a spirit that 
can promote and bind the country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember from 1980-1984 the taxpayers of Canada spent 
millions of dollars promoting the Government of Canada's presence 
in every region of the country.  In early 1980 there was this 
great feeling of western alienation, that the Government of 
Canada did not do anything for the west.  We were all surprised 
because there was billions of dollars, whether in direct grants 
or programs or services, which went to western Canada, as to 
other regions.  We discovered when we looked closer that the 
Government of Canada's presence was hidden.  It really was not 
well known. We had to educate and show people what the Government 
of Canada did in providing service, presence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture Canada had 55 research offices across western 
Canada.  Very few people even knew they were there providing a 
service to farmers and the agricultural community of western 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried vigorously to have a Government of Canada presence in 
anything and everything we were doing, not just in western Canada 
but right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the election of Prime Minister Mulroney I have noticed 
something that has not stopped.  There has been an almost 
complete dismantling of the Government of Canada presence in the 
country.  In name of being fiscally responsible or fiscal 
discipline, we have offloaded, sold off airports, given away 
properties, have walked away from responsibilities and have given 
them to the municipalities or the provinces.  We have done all 
this in the name of being fiscally efficient or in the name of it 
being important in terms of promoting partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect and admiration for my friend from 
Edmonton—Strathcona, I think the pendulum has swung too far. The 
Government of Canada presence has dwindled to a point where many 
people are wondering whether we even have the capacity to deliver 
on some of the programs and services we should be delivering on 
if we are to properly manage the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I will be sharing my time with the parliamentary 
secretary for international affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier and I will say again that I support the member's 
objective of talking about national unity.  However I do not 
think we can be in a community or a marketplace if our product is 
not on the shelf.  In the last 10 to 15 years we have removed the 
the Government of Canada presence from all shelves not just in 
Quebec but in other regions of the country.  I make no apology; I 
am a passionate believer in the Government of Canada having a 
major presence in every community and region of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I abhor the fact that the postal service of Canada has 
practically written off the Government of Canada presence. For 
many years in many villages and communities across Canada that 
was the only shelf presence of the Government of Canada.  It was 
the community's only link to this place.  When we move from post 
office to airports to ports, the litany goes on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just take a business example.  If someone is selling 
Pepsi-Cola and I am selling Coca-Cola and the only thing in the 
market is Coca-Cola, what will happen?  Will we go to the store 
and ask for Pepsi even though we never see it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my judgment what we have in Quebec is a total lack of 
Government of Canada presence.  We have given the separatists a 
free ride.  Those of us who were in the House in the last 
parliament, those of us who were here when Lucien Bouchard was 
here, notice the distinct difference.  When Lucien Bouchard was 
here as the leader of the official opposition they had lots of 
presence.  They owned the market.  They controlled the market. 
Thank God the Reform Party has moved into official opposition, 
because not only have we lost Lucien Bouchard, who was a 
charismatic leader, but we now have the Bloc Quebecois slipping 
off the radar screen. 
The Bloc is starting to slip.  Its presence in the marketplace is 
starting to slip.  Its own people are asking what it is here for.

have success in pulling the country together it is time for the 
Reform Party to shift gears a little.  It should change its 
direction of dismantling, offloading and decentralizing national 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of members are founded on good will, but perhaps 
the Reform caucus will say it should be looking at amplifying the 
Government of Canada presence in the province of Quebec rather 
than what it says every day.  They ask  “What are going to sell 
off?  What are we going to offload?  What are we going to give to 
the provinces?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 10 different chunks across Canada and the Government of 
Canada is rendered meaningless.  It is off the shelf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years we have all been obsessed with putting the 
fiscal framework of the House back together. Obviously all 
members have worked hard to achieve that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to hold the country together, Government of Canada 
presence through proper services for young people, proper 
services for small business, proper activism and knowing that 
creativity and activism come from the House, we will have to 
shift gears and get back into an activism in all markets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing specifically pertains to the motion put forward today 
by the Reform Party and I would like to ask the member what he 
thinks specifically about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about a greater government presence and a 
strengthening of government presence in Canada.  We have an 
opportunity, especially from his point of view, to do that now in 
Quebec with the Calgary declaration.  He talked about a product. 
Here is a chance for the Government of Canada to take a product 
to the people of Quebec, who will hopefully have a say like the 
rest of Canadians, and to bring the country together. Surely that 
is goal of all my colleagues and most members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member have in mind on behalf of the government, 
as we suggested in the motion, in terms of taking the Calgary 
declaration to the people of Quebec?  When should we do that or 
how should we do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I support many items in

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems clear to me that there have been consultations in Quebec 
about several things within Canada.  I would like to ask my friend, 
whose speech I really enjoyed, whether he thinks it is necessary to have 
a consultation in Quebec, when the population has already expressed, on 
several occasions, it dissatisfaction about staying in Canada?  Does he 
really think that it would add something new? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to be perfectly honest, 
I would support the Government of Canada being very active in the 
province of Quebec, but I would go at it differently from the 
current course we are on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go over the heads of the Bloc Quebecois, over the heads 
of the premier and the legislature of the province of Quebec, and 
right to the people.  The bottom line is that their vision of 
Quebec is a purely separatist system.  If the country is to have 
a chance, we really should not waste a lot more time with the 
Bloc Quebecois or Lucien Bouchard.  We should go right to the 
people.  The proof is in the pudding.  When Pierre Trudeau went 
right to the people he got 74 of 75 seats.  That is the way the 
prime minister should do it.

negotiating in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show the mythology that has taken place, before Mr. Bouchard 
asked one of his members to do an economic analysis of the 
consequences of separation, the separatist individual put forth a 
document that demonstrated very conclusively that separation 
would cost Quebeckers dearly.  That document was put underneath 
the carpet and forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member request in caucus that the prime minister 
and his fellow members go directly to the people of Quebec 
repeatedly and continuously over the next few years to spread a 
message of unity in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer to that is 
no.  I think we forget the Prime Minister of Canada has been 
elected six times in the province of Quebec.  No one knows how to 
handle the province of Quebec better than the prime minister.

they do not spend their time wanting to separate from the so-called best

that the federal petrochemistry, fisheries or transportation policies 
have hurt industrial development in Quebec and in the maritimes?

uncritically celebrate the ecstasies of the market, many at APEC 
lament the agonies of a global economy in which entire regions

Instead of down playing these concerns, the Prime Minister should 
join the call for a global regime to regulate and tax currency 
speculations. How many more bail outs will there have to be 
before we go after the major cause of why these various economies 
sink in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Asian miracle was largely built on 
exploitation of cheap labour. As workers in these countries 
demand a fair share, international investors and multinational 
corporations lose their fascination and look elsewhere for people 
to exploit.  Such is the nature of unregulated global capitalism.

<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba government has brought to the minister's attention 
on a number of occasions the effects of the reduction of the 
federal Young Offenders Act cost sharing program to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current federal contributions will only amount to 33.8% of the 
total cost in Manitoba, 22% in British Columbia and 30% in 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this.  Is the federal government going to put its 
money where its mouth is and start getting tough on young 
offenders or is it going to continue to download those costs to 
the provinces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very aware of the issues 
the hon. member has alluded to.  That is why we will be 
discussing that issue among others as it relates to young 
offenders on December 4 and 5 in Montreal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am perfectly aware of the meeting on December 4 with the 
provincial ministers and the self-congratulatory fashion in which 
the minister deals with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would to like to ask, however, if those provinces decide not 
to administer that program on the Young Offenders Act, what 
contingency plans does the minister have to carry on with those 
particular programs without the provinces? 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member is probably 
very much aware, the provinces and the federal government have 
worked constructively for many years in relation to the creation 
of a youth justice system.  Despite what some may say, it is the 
envy of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Bank of Montreal wanted to buy the Harris Bank of 
Chicago.  Under the American Community Reinvestment Act, U.S. 
regulators prevented the Bank of Montreal from closing the deal 
and getting a charter until the bank committed nearly $500 
million for small business loans and community development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the record Canadian bank profits we are seeing on a 
daily basis, when will the minister introduce a community 
reinvestment act in Canada to make sure small business can access 
at fair rates capital they need desperately for their business? 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the idea behind 
a community reinvestment act is that deposits taken out of a 
particular area will be equalled by investments or loans made 
back into that particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the figures of the Bank of Canada from last year, 
seven provinces in Canada would be major losers under that type 
of proposal, including the four Atlantic provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

on the fiscal decisions that are being made there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is watching the results of that intervention very

where fishermen in Grand Manan have been left out and financial

</I></B></P><P align=left>They went down because inflationary expectations went down. 
That is what really important.  People invest on the basis of

Speaker, in accordance with Standing Order 48, I raise a question 
of privilege regarding the premature disclosure of a committee 
report.  I base this question on new information obtained through 
access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1, 1997 I raised a question of privilege on a related 
matter, namely that a breach of privilege occurred when the 
industry committee's in camera draft report was released to the 
public.  I indicated then that according to access to information 
documents the industry minister and industry department 
bureaucrats were in possession on April 18, 1997 of draft copies 
of the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final report of the committee entitled “Review of section 
14 of the Patent Act amendment, 1992” was reported to the House 
of Commons on April 23, 1997, five days later. 
On October 9, 1997 the Speaker ruled that while the matter raised 
was important, it was not appropriate for the Speaker to 
intervene at that time and I stress at that time.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information files show that House of Commons legal 
counsel argued on August 25, 1997 that the release of the draft 
committee report “could give rise to a question of parliamentary 
privilege”. At the time legal counsel advised that the draft 
report not be released.  The letter and subsequent release of the 
draft report would indicate there are no formal rules governing 
the handling of committee documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would contend that if the House of Commons precedent is the 
guide, the new information obtained through access to information 
provides the Speaker with the authority to intervene at this time 
since on August 25, 1997 it now appears House of Commons legal 
counsel was made aware the draft report would be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility for House of Commons legal counsel lies with the 
Speaker.  This new information indicates the matter should 
therefore be dealt with by the House of Commons as a whole and 
not left in the hands of committees themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the same token a new element to the body of precedent in 
these matters has been introduced since persons under your 
responsibility were consulted and their advice on a matter of 
parliamentary privilege was not followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the October 9, 1997 ruling, the Speaker referenced Speaker 
Fraser's December 7, 1991 decision indicating the Chair does not 
intervene in the proceedings of a committee unless a problem has 
been reported by the committee to the House, or in extremely 
unusual circumstances. The new information indicates there are 
indeed unusual circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For clarity I again refer to Beauchesne citation 877 on page 241 
which states that no act done at any committee should be divulged 
before it has been presented to the House.  Beauchesne citation 
877 also states that the publication of proceedings of committees 
conducted with closed doors or of reports of committees before 
they are available to members will constitute a breach of 
privilege. Also Beauchesne citation 57, page 18 states “the 
House has in the past regarded the publication of the proceedings 
or reports of committees sitting in camera to be a breach of 
privilege”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I move that this House refer the matter regarding 
rules for the handling of committee documents to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  First, to the hon. member who has just

ruled on this point in the past. The new information being raised 
today does not change the essence of what has been ruled on 
before.  I think there are a number of points for the Chair to 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is that this issue happened in committee and should be 
raised in committee. The Chair is usually reluctant to interfere 
with this, save and except for one item, that a report from the 
committee should of course be made available to this House before 
being made public. However that is an issue about which the 
committee itself should lodge a complaint before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee in question was in a previous Parliament and 
because it was in a previous Parliament.  That committee and the 
Parliament in question has ceased to exist with the calling of 
the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new privileges claimed by this Parliament were claimed by 
yourself, Mr. Speaker, on the first day that we sat.  Therefore 
any action being raised now has to relate to something that 
occurred after the date at which you claimed the privileges for 
this Parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Mr. Speaker, it should be pointed out that if the hon. 
member is claiming that her own privileges have in some way been 
offended, she was not at the time a member of Parliament when the 
incident in question was alleged to have occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair might consider those points before adjudicating. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague's question of 
privilege with respect to the report being provided outside the 
committee before it was released to the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was an associate member of that committee, Mr. Speaker, when 
the House was in session.  As you will recall it was leading up 
to the election campaign.  There was a great deal of problem with 
respect to maintaining a full complement of members in the House 
the day before they called the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the point of privilege, I want to add two 
points. The government House leader indicated that the member who 
just raised the question of privilege was not here and her 
personal privilege was not in question. She has raised this on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus.  We believe that the 
privileges of all members of the House who were members at that 
time and continue to be members have been breached.  We feel this 
has to be reviewed by you, Sir, and that you should report back 
to the House at your leisure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to whether this happened in committee, obviously 
there was a request for this information.  It really falls 
outside the realm of the committee because it was external to the 
committee.  The people who requested it were not members of the 
committee.  Therefore the committee is partially responsible but 
we do not know for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you might recall that the minutes of the industry 
committee which reviewed this particular document that was leaked 
in advance of being provided to members of Parliament were in 
camera and were destroyed when the election was called and 
dissolution of Parliament took place. We really do not know for 
sure what happened but that, in my view, is a breach of the 
privileges of all members of Parliament as it pertains to this 
issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I well recall the 
decision I made earlier in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has referred to new information.  I take it she 
has documents.  I would ask her to table those documents with me. 
I want to have a look at them and take into consideration what 
the government House leader has said as well as the comments of 
the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre. I will look at 
everything and if it is necessary, I will return to the House.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today in question period in frustration I used a word 
that was inappropriate.  I do apologize for that.  I hope the 
Speaker would realize that is not in character with the way I 
speak in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would ask the Speaker if he could enlighten me as to 
why, when other people use words which are inappropriate, the 
Speaker rises and tells them that he finds that word 
inappropriate and asks them to withdraw it and then the question 
is answered.  Why did he not do that in my case but simply passed 
me over and I did not get a response to my question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Far be it for me to ever pass you over my 
hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few words, if any, that are of and by themselves 
unparliamentary.  For the most part it has to do with the tone of 
the delivery.  It has to do with the reaction and whether it 
causes disorder in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw that the hon. member was frustrated.  I saw that the hon. 
member used words that he would not, as he has said, ordinarily 
use in this House.  I thought that the words used today and the 
fashion in which they were used were a bit provocative.  I 
thought they were provocative enough that I would rule the 
statement out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another day in my fallibility I may say we will let it go and 
see what happens.  I did not want to put you under the duress of 
withdrawing words.  Sometimes when a member is frustrated like 
that, I like to give the member a little bit of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member has stated, I know he has a very wide choice 
of words he can use. 
If he would consider not using those words again, it would 
probably help the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I thank him for his willingness to apologize to the 
House.  Of course, on behalf of the House, I accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Usually when there is a question of 
privilege, if it arises out of the question period itself, I will 
hear it because it is here, this day.  However, the rules are 
that I should have at least one hour's notice if it is a question 
of privilege which occurred prior to the question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the hon. member to put her question of privilege 
to me tomorrow, as soon after the question period as we can get 
to it.  If she would give me an inkling of what it is about, I 
would appreciate that, just so I have an idea of what it is 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will hear it tomorrow, now that she has given me 
notice.

</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK229">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion; and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to support this 
proposal and I am happy to be able to describe the vision of our 
government for a strong and united Canada. I wish emphasize in this 
House that our greatest priority is to strengthen Canadian unity. I 
would also like to say that we are convinced that we will succeed in 
creating again the sense of purpose that allowed us to build this great 
country and that has carried it through to what it is today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trustees of a tolerant society, one that welcomes people 
of all nations and all races.  Canada has earned an international 
reputation as a champion of human rights.  We recognize that 
“one size fits all policies and approaches” will not work in a 
country composed of such a rich cultural mosaic and have found 
ways to accommodate our differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is a democracy where we can agree to disagree, but still 
get along.  There is ample room for the provinces to manoeuvre 
within the framework of federalism while at the same time 
enjoying all the benefits of this larger, more powerful alliance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exactly because we are Canadians that we have the freedom to 
maintain different languages and different legal traditions, to 
celebrate what makes us different in cultural terms and what prevents us 
from disappearing in a melting pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has proven to the rest of the world that it is possible to 
live together in harmony, mutual respect and mutual trust. It is 
possible, because we share the same values of peace, generosity and 
justice, while maintaining our history and our traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the social union, over the years, we have created a network of 
policies and social programs that reflect our common values and that 
form the basis of our common identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that it is this common experience, this mutual 
trust that has allowed us, more than legal definitions or constitutional 
considerations, to stay together and to develop in a country that is the 
envy of the world. According to the United Nations human development 
index, need I remind you, our country is listed at the very top among 
the world's nations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight several social initiatives which demonstrate 
that our core values remain the key to national unity and which 
clearly illustrate that there is more that unites us than divides 
us. On the national child benefit, the collaborative approach the 
Government of Canada and the provinces and territories have taken 
with the national child benefit system is a perfect example.  In 
the summer of 1996 the first ministers made child poverty a 
priority and agreed to work together with the Government of 
Canada on an integrated child benefit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When representatives of the two levels of government focused on 
the real issue on the table, giving children the start they need 
to become healthy, happy, educated and productive adults, there 
was no room for partisan politics.  Everyone recognized that 
investing in children is vital to our collective future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whichever government they were representing, all the negotiators 
realized that what mattered most was not which level of government 
should be providing the funding or delivering the services. The aim was 
simply to provide an opportunity for a better future for children living 
in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They all recognized that reducing child poverty requires a co-operative 
strategy, a national effort bringing together federal, 
provincial and territorial jurisdictions to work towards the creation of 
constructive partnerships. The fact that we have succeeded in 
implementing the national child benefit demonstrates how Canada can work 
better when we work hand in hand. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the national child benefit, the new national children's 
agenda will also include the well-being of Canadian children and 
in the process strengthen this country's social union.  Launching 
a national children's agenda is an opportunity to work together 
across provinces and sectors toward a common goal of building a 
better future for Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have enjoyed similar success in securing federal-provincial 
agreements on changes to the Canada Pension Plan.  We will 
jointly shepherd reforms to the CPP to secure a viable and a 
sustainable public pension system for today's retirees and 
tomorrow's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to duplicate this co-operation in the coming months as 
we work with our provincial and territorial colleagues on other 
social priorities.  Persons with disabilities are a priority of 
federal-provincial-territorial social services ministers.  We 
will collaborate closely with our partners to develop a shared 
agenda to better meet their needs.  We are currently working with 
other governments to put in place a replacement program for the 
vocational rehabilitation for disabled persons program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same spirit we are working with the provinces and 
territories to create employment and learning opportunities for 
Canadian young people.  For example, we are committed to 
developing a mentorship program in partnership with provincial 
and territorial governments and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, working with our provincial partners we will continue to 
improve the Canada student loans program to increase access to 
learning opportunities for Canadian youth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. member that federalism can also 
adjust to the economic climate. For example, Quebec has long been 
seeking jurisdiction over manpower training, arguing that local 
authorities are in a better position to respond to needs for skills 
development, and are often capable of responding more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our offer is without precedent and involves the transfer to the 
provinces of responsibilities in the area of labour market development. 
This will allow Quebec to design and manage its own manpower training 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through agreements to develop the labour market, employment 
programs and services worth $2 billion annually—funded through 
the reform of the employment insurance program—will be handed 
over to the provinces choosing to assume these responsibilities. 
Up to now, Quebec and seven other provinces have signed agreements 
on new provisions for the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are fed up with federal-provincial squabbling.  They 
want us to work together to create worthwhile and sustainable 
social programs for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the many innovative measures I have mentioned, the 
Government of Canada has clearly shown its willingness to make the 
necessary changes to modernize Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are finding new ways to increase Canada's effectiveness for 
us all, and the result is not independent governments, but rather 
interdependent governments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This partnership approach offers tangible proof that by working 
together, governments can strengthen the social union.  We can 
advance a common social agenda and in the process, create more 
targeted government programs, improve service delivery and 
achieve significant cost savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am suggesting that if we are willing to give each other a 
chance and really work at it, Canada can become whatever we 
collectively make it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada did not already exist, no doubt we would be doing 
our best to invent it.  So let us celebrate Canada as a model 
nation, one that inspires the international community and that will 
continue to make a remarkable contribution to the world in the next 
millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened carefully to my 
colleague's speech.  She gives manpower training as an example of 
successful federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, it can be seen that there is a big problem in 
that area.  When someone says that manpower training is being 
handed back to the provinces, while at the same time a duplicate 
youth strategy is being created, that the Federal Regional 
Development Office is taking steps to encourage young entrepreneurs 
alongside the economic development corporations already in 
existence, that millennium scholarships are created, another 
example of federal meddling in education and a measure designed 
with the next election in mind, this of course gives government 
members something to boast about. But all of this is in an area 
which is not in any way part of its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such examples of federal interference coming on top of 
all the previous failures to change the Canadian federal system, is 
it any wonder that Quebeckers are highly sceptical about the 
Calgary declaration? I find, moreover, that it contains nothing at 
all that Quebeckers have long been calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would there not be a way in this House for the federal 
government to show a real desire to respond to Quebec's demands, 
which have been expressed for many years, with a position that 
could at least meet the traditional needs of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the Calgary declaration does not even 
contain anything for the Quebec federalists who want to see Canada 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member not pass these desires and wishes on to 
her government in order to convince it to modify its position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Claudette Bradshaw:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has said repeatedly, reform in under way and the 
provinces will be able to make their own decisions. That is what we are 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said he wanted to make youth a priority and 
that, in the next millennium, the federal government, on this side, will 
be the one making decisions about grants. That is all right, that is 
what we wanted it to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this does not make a bit of difference: it seems that, whatever 
we do, the Bloc always wants more, but not everyone in Quebec agrees. 
Many people in Quebec tell us they want a federal presence there, they 
want us there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that we give them responsibilities and take 
major decisions, people in Quebec tell us: “We want you too, we want the 
federal government as well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While listening to my friend opposite, I was reminded of Pierre 
Roy. Every morning for the past 21 months, he has been raising the 
Canadian flag with some veteran comrades of his. The message Pierre Roy 
is sending is that he knows what a divided country is like, because he 
fought for such countries on behalf of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend must understand that the provinces are requesting 
that we share. They are asking that we have discussions with them and 
make decisions together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are going will very well with the provinces. Many programs 
were developed in co-operation with other provinces. But as you all 
know, it is difficult to get the Bloc Quebecois or Lucien Bouchard to 
sit down with us so we can work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for Laval East 
may ask a question, but it must be short. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat 
surprised by the answer the hon. member just gave to my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask her a question along the same lines. When the hon. 
member says that Quebeckers absolutely want the federal government to 
get involved in areas of provincial jurisdiction, in areas that come 
under Quebec's jurisdiction, is she implying that every Quebec 
government in the past 30 years was wrong in making traditional claims 
regarding Quebec's areas of jurisdiction, including education? Is the 
hon. member telling us that all Quebec governments of the past 30 years 
were wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Claudette Bradshaw:</B> Not at all, Mr. Speaker. I was trying to 
tell the hon. member that Quebeckers want the Quebec government to sit 
at the table, with the federal government and with the other provincial 
governments, to take part in the decisions being made. Major decisions 
will be made over the next five years at the federal and provincial 
levels. My message was that Quebeckers surely want their provincial 
government to sit at the table with the other provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the official opposition motion regarding the need 
for consultation on national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the good fortune to live in one of the best countries 
in the world.  Canada, with its prosperous economy, is a stable 
democracy that respects the values and aspirations of all 
Canadians.  No other country can point to such a free and tolerant 
society, where diversity and difference are accepted, as witnessed 
by the languages and cultures of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all reasons to be proud and to view Canada's future 
with optimism.  Cooperation between the federal government and the 
provinces can only assure us of a better future by revitalizing our 
Constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effort is required to strengthen the Canadian federation.  This 
effort has been made by the premiers of nine provinces who 
met in Calgary last September.  These premiers drafted a 
declaration which embodies some of the basic principles that all 
Canadians share to guide future efforts in uniting this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is monumental about the process surrounding the Calgary 
declaration is its emphasis on consultation.  Unlike the Meech 
Lake and Charlottetown accords, the Canadian public is being 
consulted at the front end of the process about its vision of 
Canada in the 21st century.  We hope that the public, the 
premiers and this government are listening. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration provides a way to renew the debate on 
ways of improving our country.  It includes principles universally 
applicable in Canada and not limited just to eastern or western 
provinces, principles applicable in Quebec, even though the premier 
of Quebec was not at the Calgary conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard said he would not take part in any public 
consultation process.  He is not unaware, however, that if the 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords failed, it was because 
Canadians were not consulted.  He adds that he has no interest in 
consulting Quebeckers as to whether they truly want to participate 
in Canadian society. 
By taking this approach, Mr. Bouchard is standing in the way of 
democratic debate in Quebec and in the way of Quebeckers' right to 
participate in free and open consultations with their elected 
officials on ways of becoming their own masters in the Canadian 
Confederation.  The Quebec government alone is preventing 
Quebeckers from having a say in the definition of their future.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These consultations are essential to achieve a proper balance in 
the Constitution. The Calgary declaration proposes ways to rebalance the 
sharing of powers and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the seven principles found in the declaration, three—Nos. 1, 2 
and 6—underline the equality of all citizens and of the provinces. The 
Reform Party is especially committed to this principle of equality. The 
first principle ensures that the equal rights and the freedoms enjoyed 
by all Canadians under the charter of rights and freedoms are recognized 
as the basis for any constitutional negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle puts forth an idea that is not new, but that 
has been neglected in constitutional negotiations over the last 15 
years, and that is that all provinces are equal. 
Canadians have reiterated in all consultations that the provinces are 
equal and that none is entitled to special constitutional status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is stated again clearly in the sixth principle, where it is 
said that “if any future constitutional amendment confers powers on one 
province, these powers must be available to all provinces”. Any 
constitutional amendment that provides more powers to the provinces must 
do so in a way that benefits equally all the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This equality is one of the things that unites us as Canadians. The 
provinces may be equal, but that does not mean that they are all the 
same or identical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the declaration contains principles that recognize 
the diversity of Canada, the differences that make it a great 
country. Principles Nos. 3, 4 and 5 state the unique character of 
Canadian society, including its “diversity, tolerance, 
compassion and equality of opportunity” that allow it to be 
without rival in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respect for diversity and equality forms the basis of Canadian 
unity. The unique character of Quebec society, including its French 
speaking majority, its culture and its tradition of civil law is a 
fundamental element of the fabric of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The declaration avoids the basic errors of the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown accords, which included special treatment for a province 
or a people. Canadians are opposed to the idea of incorporating in the 
Constitution a justiciable “distinct society” clause or any other phrase 
that would contribute mostly to divide instead of uniting the country by 
giving a province special status or greater powers. 
The declaration emphasizes the importance of diversity within the 
framework of equality of status between the provinces, and, in doing so, 
it offers a clear departure from constitutional phraseologies that have 
failed in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle defines a framework within which the federal 
government and the provinces can co-operate to find a new balance for 
the Confederation by excluding the federal government from exclusively 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been calling for a long time for a better 
balance within the Canadian federation between the federal government, 
the provinces and the population itself. Our party has developed 20 
proposals to strengthen the Canadian union. Most of them can be 
implemented without going through lengthy federal-provincial 
negotiations or without having to amend the Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are calling upon the federal government to withdraw from 
areas of jurisdiction which are more suited to the provinces and 
they are calling for the reform of federal institutions like the 
Senate, the supreme court and the Bank of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a critical role for the federal government in 
jurisdictions of national and international importance, including 
defence, foreign affairs, monetary policy, regulation of 
financial institutions, the development of national standards 
through interprovincial co-operation and in the areas of criminal 
law and reform of the criminal justice system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the federal government ought no longer to have the option 
of meddling in areas which are the exclusive purview of the 
provinces.  The services and powers of this government must be 
decentralized so that the government in the best position to serve 
the population will be the one responsible.  The costs and the 
inefficiencies caused by jurisdictional overlap between the federal 
government and the provinces is what lies behind most of the 
frictions threatening national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party recommends that the federal government 
refrain from intervening in areas such as natural resources, 
manpower training, social services, language, culture, municipal 
affairs, housing, tourism, sports and recreation.  The provinces 
are in a better position to meet Canadians' needs in these areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should be prevented from using its 
spending power to intervene in provincial jurisdiction.  The 
federal cash block grants to the provinces should be replaced 
with tax points at a fixed percentage of federal tax revenue 
whose value would increase as the province's economy grows to 
allow each province to enhance social security of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament should also pass an amendment unilaterally to the 
Constitution forbidding future deficit spending and massive 
increases in spending without approval through a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, a constitutional amendment should be passed to abolish 
the federal government's ability to disallow and reserve 
provincial legislation and to legislate under the declaratory 
power in areas of such jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe very strongly there is need for further reform 
of federal institutions, particularly in western Canada with a 
growing economy and population.  We find institutions like the 
Senate and the supreme court, the Bank of Canada and the 
appointment of lieutenant governors increasingly anachronisms 
that do not represent the growing parts of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must reform those institutions, among other things, through 
an elected, equal and effective Senate.  Supreme court appointees 
should be nominated by the provinces, as should directors of the 
Bank of Canada and lieutenant governors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we also believe that any future changes to the 
Constitution ought to be approved by the people in a referendum 
first. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal of the Canadian federation of necessity involves 
the reform of federal institutions.  We have good reason to believe 
that Quebeckers do not share their leaders' obsession with symbolic 
gestures.  They are demanding significant changes.  The citizens of 
Quebec agree with westerners that the federation must be rebalanced 
and that real changes must be made.  Quebeckers and westerners have 
a great deal in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers and westerners acknowledge that the federal 
government is interfering in areas exclusively under provincial 
jurisdiction by imposing national standards and by using its 
spending power not as an encouragement but more often as a way of 
ensuring that the provinces comply with its wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers and westerners agree that the provinces are in a 
better position to govern in areas such as culture, language, 
manpower, social services, housing, tourism and a good many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers and westerners agree that the federal government 
must give up certain powers and give more power to the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one point which Quebeckers and westerners do not 
have in common.  Quebeckers have been excluded by their government 
from the process of drafting the Calgary declaration.

Canadians to build a better Canada.  Quebeckers must have a voice. 
They must be part of this popular initiative, working equally with 
Canadians in a positive, creative and constructive effort to build 
a new Canada that they will be an integral part of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers know all too well the outcome of the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown accords.  Both failed miserably because of a secret 
process.  Quebeckers and other Canadians were not really consulted. 
The two accords were produced by the great decision makers, without 
real consultation or prior agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have therefore called on the federal government to take 
responsibility for what the separatist government has refused to 
do, namely to involve Quebeckers in the Calgary process.  But 
nine weeks have passed since the Calgary declaration and still 
the federal government has done nothing to seek input from 
Quebeckers on the process.  How much longer must we wait?  Most 
other provinces have begun to complete their consultations, yet 
Quebeckers have been locked out and not told honestly what the 
declaration says to them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us in the Reform Party, we cannot be satisfied with the 
Liberal government's inertia.  We will therefore take the 
initiative in Quebec to show Quebeckers that, despite the 
stereotypes of the Reform Party perpetuated by the Quebec elite, we 
believe passionately in a Canada that includes Quebec.  We believe 
in a strong and flexible Confederation comprising ten provinces and 
in which all Canadians can achieve their goals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was very interested to hear the member's comments.  There are 
many items that we could discuss, but I want to raise with him 
the specific issue about the proposal to convert cash transfers 
to tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will well know that under the former system of CAP, 
cash transfers were made for health, post-secondary education and 
welfare.  He will also know that the cash was running out in a 
couple of these areas which would mean that the government would 
have absolutely no recourse in terms of enforcing any national 
standards that may be in place.  As a result the government 
converted the former CAP program to the CHST, the Canada health 
and social transfer, so that there is sufficient cash in the 
umbrella of the full transfer so that our standards for instance 
under the five principles of the National Health Act can be 
enforced as well as other standards with regard to welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the cash element of the transfers between cash 
and tax points is critical to the national governance, to the 
federal government's ability to enforce national standards.  I 
wonder if the member would care to explain to the House what 
mechanism the federal government has available to it to enforce 
national standards when provinces like Alberta decide to 
privatize health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the whole point of a large 
part of my speech and the platform of the Reform Party with 
respect to reforming the federation is that we are talking about 
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.  In their wisdom the 
Fathers of Confederation assigned certain areas, such as health 
care, education and welfare as areas best managed by those 
governments closest to the people.  It is called the principle of 
subsidiarity and it makes a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely why we propose providing the provinces the 
flexibility they need to deliver those programs in a way that 
suits their citizens and not the bureaucrats and politicians here 
in far distant Ottawa.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The conversion of cash transfers to tax points qualified by 
national standards agreed upon co-operatively by the provinces 
would ensure a national network of social programs administered 
by the provinces but for all Canadians.  Let us trust people 
locally.  It does not take bureaucrats and politicians in this 
town to deliver programs.  The provinces can do it for their own 
citizens very well thank you very much.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, on behalf of my colleagues who are present, I would like to 
congratulate the member for Calgary Southeast on the quality of his 
French.  We are always grateful in hearing our Reform colleagues 
speaking French for their open-mindedness in doing so, and we will 
say this as often as need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this does not preclude our disagreeing fundamentally 
with the Reform Party's view of the future of Canada and the future 
of Quebec within it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the member for Calgary Southeast. 
The first is fairly simple.  Does the Reform Party agree with the 
content of the Calgary declaration? 
Second, does the party the member represents in the House wish the 
declaration changed to include reference to the Senate and Senate 
reform? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for those two very thoughtful questions.  I know my French is far 
from perfect but I promise to continue working on it.  I think we 
all have an obligation to do that as a symbol of our mutual 
affection for this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the first question, the Reform Party does not formally have a 
position on the content of the Calgary declaration because we 
only take positions formally as a party in our assemblies.  Our 
next one will not be held until next June.  In the meantime, our 
leader and our unity critics have commented positively on aspects 
of the Calgary declaration emphasizing their support for the 
process of consultation launched therein.  In my speech I 
personally spoke in favour of all of the elements outlined in the 
Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want to see it amended to include institutional reform?  I 
would like to see some inclusion in the Calgary declaration at 
least a recognition of the need to reform federal institutions to 
make them more reflective of the new reality of democracy in 
Canada, the emerging west and the shift in population.  However, 
it is a very tricky balance because as we know the Calgary 
declaration is not a constitutional vehicle and some would argue 
that measures like Senate reform do require multilateral 
agreement on an amendment to the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least there ought to be a parallel track of Senate 
reform, reform with respect to other federal institutions 
parallel to the Calgary declaration.  However, if we can find a 
way to include it in the declaration so that all Canadians feel 
that their legitimate aspirations are being represented, I would 
find that very satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have two more 
questions.  We have a very short time so I would ask that you 
keep the comments very brief. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member for 
Calgary Southeast for delivering most of his speech in French. He did 
it, I believe, because our friends in the Bloc Quebecois do not know 
there are francophones outside Quebec. I have a short question for the 
member for Calgary Southeast. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that he had an interest in certainly 
upholding the notion of the principle of equality. 
I am interested in hearing his definition of equality. Does he 
refer to equality as equal treatment, equal powers, equal 
opportunities for each of the provinces? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have very little time, perhaps I could throw into 
that other question the question of consultation.  If the tables 
were reversed and Alberta for instance had this kind of 
difficulty, would the member support the federal government 
getting involved directly with the people of Alberta on an issue 
that may not necessarily meet with the accord of its provincial 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>   Mr. Speaker, on the first question, I 
dwelt at some length in my remarks on what we would consider 
the equality of provinces.  It would be a constitutional 
framework wherein any powers available to one province would be 
available to all provinces.  We recognize that in the founding of 
the country this was not necessarily the case.  However we 
believe that in a modern confederation it is appropriate that any 
new powers made available to one province be made available to 
them all and that no province be given any special status or 
rights, or for that matter obligations in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second question, it is a hypothetical 
question which is really not relevant. Albertans are federalists. 
They believe strongly in Canada.  Even though they have sometimes 
been slapped around by Ottawa, and at times have been treated in 
a not very pleasant way, Albertans have remained loyal to this 
country, fortunately.  I believe they will continue to remain 
loyal. The provincial government in Alberta has been committed to 
the consultation process.  I cannot imagine the circumstance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want 
to congratulate my colleague for speaking French so well, but I would 
like to remind him that words do not matter any longer, we want action 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 30, 40 years I have heard fine words: equality, 
independence, fraternity. That is not what we want. That is just fine 
for Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, Ontario, Vancouver, etc. But 
that is not what we in Quebec want. We want to be recognized as a 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want unique society status. We do not want distinct 
society status. That is not what we want. I am asking my colleague, who 
is very open-minded, if he is able to recognize us simply as a people, 
as a founding nation and as a modern people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>   Mr. Speaker, we believe that a modern 
constitution of a modern, liberal, pluralistic democracy does not 
have a place for ethnic divisions or divisions predicated on 
nationality, bloodlines or creed. We believe that our 
Constitution ought to be colour blind, it ought to be blind with 
respect to race and ethnicity and it ought to incorporate all 
Canadians within the framework of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My response to the member, and I will close with this, is we are 
suggesting that provinces should have jurisdiction over matters 
of culture and language so that the francophone majority in 
Quebec can protect those institutions which are so important to 
it.  We are allies of reasonable Quebec nationalists on that 
point.  I wish the member would open his ears to that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to split my time with the member for Simcoe North, 
the parliamentary secretary to the minister. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the member for Edmonton—Strathcona's motion, I would 
like to make three points. First, the failure of Meech Lake has 
left bad scars in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that all surveys show that, if asked a clear 
question, a vast majority of Quebeckers will answer they want to stay in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that in spite of all the tricks and mirages used 
in conjuring up an imaginary partnership as a viable option for Quebec, 
in spite of all these tricks and the vague questions in two referendums, 
the majority of Quebeckers chose to stay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this we must add another reality. The majority of Canadians 
outside Quebec definitely want Quebec to remain a vibrant, active and 
very significant part of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside this majority of people across Canada, and certainly in 
Quebec, who, provided the option and the question are clear, hope that 
Canada's destiny will include Quebec, and that Quebec's destiny and that 
of the rest of the country will complement and strengthen each other, 
there are two small dissenting groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the Quebec independentists who want their province to 
separate at all costs. Regardless of what we could offer, say or do, 
these people will never accept the idea of a Canadian federation. With 
them, it is like talking to the deaf. Whatever we say or do, they will 
never accept it, because they want Quebec to separate from Canada. 
We have to face this reality and accept it, because it is the option 
proposed by the Parti Quebecois in Quebec and by the Bloc Quebecois 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, there is another small minority in Canada that will 
never accept any concession to Quebec and oppose any reasonable and fair 
arrangement making it possible to include Quebec in the Canadian 
Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is also a vast majority of Canadians, including 
Quebeckers, who would like to find a fair, reasonable and deliberately 
made arrangement that would get Quebec to join the Constitution of 1982. 
In light of this, I think the Reform Party's motion—given its wording 
and its sober and conciliatory tone—represents a step in the right 
direction. It is positive and proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we would have to be very careful in asking Quebec to 
urgently hold consultations on the Calgary declaration. It is too soon 
yet to hold such consultations in Quebec. Let us not forget past 
failures. We must avoid making the mistakes that were made during Meech 
and Charlottetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process has only just begun. We must first create a synergy in 
the rest of Canada and have the provinces, other than Quebec, fully 
endorse the Calgary declaration, after consulting with their citizens. 
Then they will be able to tell Quebec “We are now unanimously prepared 
to accept your fair and clear claims”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should use the utmost caution and whatever time is 
necessary before we consult with Quebeckers.  We must prepare 
ourselves properly to make sure that we do not repeat Meech Lake 
and Charlottetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to agree fundamentally with the member for Winnipeg 
Transcona regarding the essential inclusion of our First Nations 
so that early in the negotiations they should feel they are a 
real part of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed and ironically, there is a striking correlation between 
the feeling of First Nations and the feeling of many Quebeckers 
which I share.  Just as we tend to ignore our First Nations, in 
the processes that have taken place before, maybe not enough time 
and patience was given to listen to the fair demands of Quebec to 
join the constitution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the written documents, the spoken words and the 
constitutional provisions, there is above all the attitude, the 
friendliness and the openness to what the other person is saying.  There 
is also the deliberate and genuine desire to show that the other party is 
not only accepted but welcome as a wanted and needed partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Meech and its aftermath left some scars in Quebec, and it is 
undeniable, it was not because of the texts and not because of 
constitutional provisions, which were quite reasonable in my opinion; it 
was because many Quebeckers were left with the feeling that the rest of 
Canada had closed the door in their faces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the resolution before us must be construed as the will 
to go forward.  It is a positive, proactive measure which goes beyond 
partisanship.  I see it as a positive gesture on the part of a Reform 
member who, through his attitude, his behaviour and his determination, 
stepped away from the traditional, rigid position of the Reform Party on 
these issues.  That party is the same one that generated some negative 
publicity for Quebec's political leaders during the federal election 
campaign, that voted collectively against distinct society in this House 
and that would very much like to abolish the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I think that the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Edmonton—Strathcona must be seen as a step in the right 
direction; it is a positive and proactive resolution that I will 
support.  Therefore, I thank the member for putting it forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I praise the 
openmindedness of my colleague who was elected to the Quebec National 
Assembly and who saw the Meech Lake accord die. We were not able to have 
the Meech Lake accord agreed to, with five very acceptable conditions 
that were even more reasonable than what could have been expected from 
Quebec. Quebeckers wanted much more because they want a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even then there was, I would say, a small window of 
opportunity, and you know how it was rejected. It truly hurts. I do not 
know what to call this when we see the people who came to tell 
Quebeckers they love them just before the referendum and when we know 
that these are the same people who rejected the Meech Lake accord. It is 
nothing but a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My very experienced colleague says everything would be all right if 
only we could be recognized. But even the Meech Lake accord, as I said 
earlier, was not acceptable to Quebeckers. So how can they accept this 
unique society concept today, in 1997? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to explain to me how Quebeckers could 
accept this unique society concept when nobody can say what it means. We 
first had the distinct society concept, and it means more to me than the 
word unique because we know everybody is unique. In my opinion, this 
unique society concept does not mean a thing. I would like my colleague 
to explain to me how he could convince my colleagues and my constituents 
in Matapédia—Matane to accept this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think one has a choice between 
two positions. One can think that things are set in stone, that they can 
never change. I personally voted in favour of the Meech Lake accord. 
Ironically, the Parti Quebecois voted against it. And today they 
complain about the failure of the Meech Lake accord, but it is those 
same people from the Parti Quebecois, the independentists, who were 
opposed to the Meech Lake accord, every bit as much as Mr. Wells and all 
those who voted against it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is a fact that we need to acknowledge, and one cannot say 
that Meech was rejected by all Canadians. The premier and the people of 
Ontario vigorously supported Meech, as well as the people of British 
Columbia and Alberta. At the end of the day, only one province was 
responsible for Meech going under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians considered Meech a positive initiative, but we 
failed. There are two ways to react to this failure: since we failed, 
should we close the book? Should we say that Canada cannot go on, 
because the Meech Lake and the Charlottetown agreements failed? 
Of course not. We have to work harder and realize that shifts in 
position are possible, even in the Reform Party, since one of its 
members has brought forward today a resolution that might not have been 
accepted before by his party, which is now taking a new position. Like 
some of his colleagues have come to realize, we need to take new 
positions. We have to try to find out what brings us together instead of 
always looking for what drives us apart and could divide us forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, today, we have a new openness. We hope that the Calgary 
declaration can bring us together so that we can explain what the unique 
character of Quebec means and accept it for what it really means so that 
Quebec can feel welcome within our Constitution. Maybe we can find the 
kind of openness that has eluded us up until now. 
This is why we need to work as hard as we can to encourage such 
positions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure today that I join in this debate on the motion proposed 
by the Reform Party. I appreciate the non-partisan spirit in 
which this motion has been put forward.  Certainly I encourage 
all federalist members of the House to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Calgary declaration goes in the right direction. 
It is a provincial initiative which nine premiers and two 
territorial leaders have set out.  It is a declaration of 
principles which I think all Canadians who are interested in the 
country thriving, growing and remaining united should be prepared 
to support. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major principles in the Calgary declaration that I 
would like to mention: the first one is the recognition of Quebec's 
specificity, and the second is the equality of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1995 referendum campaign, the Prime Minister made 
several commitments. Following these commitments, the House of Commons 
passed a resolution on the recognition of Quebec's specificity, distinct 
society. Unfortunately, the federal government cannot adopt alone 
amendments to the Constitution; this requires the participation of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide for this, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
travelled to all provinces to discuss this issue with the premiers and 
his counterparts in all the provinces to determine whether amendments 
could be made to the Constitution so that it would include recognition 
of Quebec's specificity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to see in the Calgary declaration that the nine 
premiers and the two territorial leaders are in the process of taking a 
step forward by determining whether there can be such a recognition. 
The wording is not the same. The declaration talks about the unique 
character of Quebec society instead of distinct society, but it is 
nevertheless the specificity of Quebec that is being described.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the equality of the provinces, we have always argued that it 
is possible to recognize the specificity of Quebec while respecting the 
equality of the provinces. Equality does not mean sameness. I have three 
children and I always try to treat them equally, but not always in the 
same way. They all have their own needs and at times I treat them 
differently. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations with Canadians are not an invention of the Reform 
Party.  I heard during the debate this morning, when the debate 
was slipping a bit from its non-partisan nature or intention on 
behalf of some of the parties, that the grassroots movement was 
something the Reform Party was promoting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the request of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs I 
have been travelling through practically every province in Canada 
since my appointment as his parliamentary secretary.  I have been 
meeting with Canadians in all regions of the country at the 
grassroots level.  These Canadians organized themselves into 
unity groups to try to become engaged in the debate on the future 
of Canada.  A lot of them reached that point by being frustrated 
with the constitutional wrangling that had been going on up until 
the Charlottetown accord failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups of Canadians, grassroots organizations, were very 
supportive of the fact that their Canada contains a province that 
is different by reason of its majority language, its institutions 
and its culture.  They are very willing to support and recognize 
that, so long as it is very clear the recognition does not result 
in any special rights, powers or privileges granted to any 
province.  In other words, the equality of provinces is 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is essentially what the Calgary accord is speaking about. I 
am confident from my travels and reports that I have made to the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs that there is broad support 
in all regions of the country for recognition of Quebec's 
differences so long as the equality of provinces is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not very different from what exists already.  I make 
reference to a retired chief justice of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, Mr. Chief Justice Brian Dickson, who said at the present 
time, prior to any constitutional amendments for the recognition 
of Quebec, that Quebec's difference is already taken into account 
by the Supreme Court of Canada when it is interpreting grey areas 
of the constitution.  A whole list of things are taken into 
account, but the difference of Quebec by reason of its language, 
culture and institutions is taken into account at the present 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is now a constitutional convention, if there is willingness 
among the provinces and the federal government, could be made a 
constitutional provision which we hope would give assurances to 
people in Quebec concerned about their language and culture that 
within the Canadian federation there is a place for that 
recognition and that the other provinces in the Canadian 
federation are prepared to support them in the maintenance of 
that position.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>OPPOSITION DAY—THE CALGARY DECLARATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK252">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion; and of the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b> Resuming the question and 
comment period with the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the parliamentary secretary defend two of the 
principles in the Calgary declaration. 
I cannot help thinking that many Quebeckers have already noticed 
that the notion of distinct society has lost its value after being 
ruled out through the rejection of the Meech Lake accord by 
Canadian public opinion, contrary to the claim of the member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis, who wanted to assign blame for the rejection of 
the accord to a number of individuals and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion was also rejected by Quebeckers and Canadians in 
their refusal to permit the government to amend the Constitution 
according to the provisions of the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of distinct society is therefore of little interest 
now, and it is to be replaced with a notion even less interesting 
in terms of its content and scope, because it will not be included 
in the Constitution and given interpretive effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really doubt therefore that Quebeckers will accept this 
notion of unique character, especially since it is not accompanied 
by a reform in the distribution of powers as Quebeckers wanted. 
Recognizing Quebec only symbolically as a distinct society or a 
society with a unique character will never satisfy the longstanding 
claim.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask the parliamentary secretary whether, in 
his opinion, it is not necessary now to propose a major reform of 
the distribution of powers for constitutional reform to satisfy 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</b> Mr. Speaker, it must be emphasized that as soon 
as the Liberal government took office in 1993, it started working to 
renew the federation. There are many examples in the area of manpower 
and a number of other social programs where we have worked to renew the 
federation to meet the needs not only of the Province of Quebec but also 
of the other provinces that felt that federal and provincial areas of 
responsibility had to be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's debate, there were some members, even on this side, who 
criticized the government because it has gone too far. They feel that 
there has already been enough decentralization in this federation, but 
I am sure we will be continuing our efforts, because it is always 
possible to reach an understanding. 
There will be another premiers conference in December which will deal 
with the issue of youth employment and other important issues for the 
provinces and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that efforts have to be made to ensure that 
the Constitution and the sharing of responsibilities will meet the needs 
of all the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert, International trade; the hon. member for Fundy—Royal,

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for Yellowhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of today's motion on national unity is like no 
other.  As this country approaches the beginning of a new 
millennium, we are increasingly being faced with growing concerns 
of global proportions, and now more than ever Canada is being 
asked to play a leadership role in many international 
organizations and treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our peacekeeping missions to banning land mines, Canadians 
have often been hailed for showing leadership.  Just yesterday in 
the House we showed how this country can work together when we 
dealt with the land mines issue. There was unity within this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these great accomplishments will lose their significance if 
we are unable to keep this country united. The world has often 
looked to Canadians for help in restoring peace to troubled 
nations.  But we will be risking this international profile if we 
cannot manage to put an end to divisive thinking and begin 
reshaping our federation with one goal in mind, national unity 
from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the signing of Confederation the dynamics of our 
federation have been tried and tested many times.  Our system of 
federalism has served us well over the last 100 years.  However, 
dynamics change over time and, like the old family car that has 
safely carried us on many long cross-Canada trips, an overhaul is 
needed.  Keep in mind that the body of this old car is classic 
and irreplaceable. We have been emotionally attached to it but it 
is unable in its present condition to get us where we need to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long overdue is the time for tune-ups.  In fact, we know we were 
wrong to not fine tune the old jalopy on a regular basis and now 
we are faced with two choices. We can put it out to pasture and 
watch it rust or we can rebuild the framework, overhaul the 
system to get it running smoother and better than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September nine provincial premiers and two territorial 
leaders started rebuilding the framework of that irreplaceable 
classic. The work of the provincial premiers is a good first step 
toward real progress on national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meech Lake and Charlottetown rejected equality of citizens and 
provinces and did not solicit the genuine input of grassroots 
Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration, on the other hand, puts the equality of 
citizens and provinces and the need to engage Canadians in 
national dialogue front and centre.  The Calgary declaration is 
not carved in stone but rather is open to changes that may emerge 
from extensive consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the differences between the provinces and the people 
have been magnified and we have forgotten some very crucial 
similarities.  For example, regardless of culture and language we 
all want the best for our children.  We all want them to grow up 
in a country free of political division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that the separatists in Quebec are trying to keep 
Quebeckers from participating in this meaningful consultation 
process.  This is a great disservice to our fellow Canadians in 
Quebec.  Their input is vital to the process and we want to hear 
what Quebeckers have to say as we begin this renewal of 
federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obvious is the reason the separatist Government of Quebec has 
chosen not to participate.  Any constructive means to solve our 
unity disputes would douse the fire of separatism, leaving the 
separatists without a mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time for Canadians to reach out to one another and 
embrace our diversity.  Unique, yes.  Distinct, yes.  Equal, yes. 
We have always accepted that Quebec is unique. However, we 
believe that all provinces are unique in their own right.  We 
favour a rebalancing of federal-provincial powers to ensure that 
each province is allowed to nourish its distinctiveness while the 
federal government's powers are strengthened in the areas of 
national concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past politicians have shortchanged Quebeckers with one 
word phrases in an attempt to appease their dissatisfaction with 
the federation.  Why not give them the tools they require to 
strengthen their culture?  The only stipulation we request is 
that those same tools be made available to all provinces to use 
in areas that matter most to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize that granting provinces more control over the 
development of their distinctiveness and the concept of equality 
are not on opposite ends of the spectrum.  In the process of 
rebuilding the federation, just as the old classic family car 
needs an overhaul, a realignment of powers of the federal and 
provincial governments is needed.  Instead of focusing on purely 
symbolic one word phrases which politicians time and again refuse 
to accurately define, we should focus on presenting provinces 
with the tools needed to develop that which makes them unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of equality does not mean that everyone is the same. 
At the risk of oversimplifying the situation let me use another 
analogy.  In a classroom if a teacher hands out identical boxes 
of supplies to each student and tells them they are to make a 
project using those supplies, it stands to reason that no two 
projects will be identical.  The creative processes vary from 
student to student as each places different importance on how to 
use the supplies based on each student's vision of what their 
project will encompass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the federation equal does not necessitate identical.  It 
would be unrealistic to expect the provinces to exercise their 
powers uniformly.  Rather, the provinces will have equal powers 
to try what is best suited for their traditions, their character, 
their education, social services, and the list goes on, all the 
while keeping in mind adherence to national standards guidelines. 
Canadians need to feel free to come forward and offer solutions 
and ideas on how to improve the federation and how their province 
should diversify and nurture its distinctiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be wise for all levels of government to view the 
separatist movement in Quebec as a wake-up call to improve our 
federal system.  In the spirit of co-operation that was 
demonstrated in the Calgary declaration, respecting differences 
and allowing provinces more power to develop their unique 
societies will foster unity in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today a member of the Bloc stated that western Canada 
could not handle Quebec's distinctiveness.  I encourage the 
member of the Bloc to listen to what we are saying.  We are well 
aware that the Bloc and the Parti Quebecois are determined to 
undermine any national unity plan because that would put an end 
to their singularly divisive political agenda.  I encourage that 
member of the Bloc to visit our province.  He will be pleasantly 
surprised to find out that we embrace our differences.  Perhaps 
he might like to visit some of our francophone communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency of Lethbridge our school system has a very strong 
French immersion program.  It began in 1975 and continues to teach 
children the beauty of distinctiveness, distinctive culture and 
the value of learning new languages, including French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently received a letter from the mayor of Lethbridge 
regarding a set of resolutions formed by the city council of 
Lethbridge on the issue of the possibility of Quebec's seceding 
from the federation.  The Lethbridge municipal council has taken 
an interest in this issue because its sister city is 
Saint-Laurent, Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive relationship between Lethbridge and Saint Laurent has 
steadily grown over the years, highlighted by youth, cultural and 
linguistic exchange programs.  As we face the possibility of yet 
another referendum it is now more significant than ever to reach 
out to our respective sister cities and remind our fellow 
Canadians how much we cherish their friendships and the 
friendships that have developed from these exchanges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With most of this discussion of separatism focusing on our 
differences it is imperative that we regain perspective and 
remember how much we share in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility of conveying this commonality must also be 
shared by federal, provincial and municipal representatives as 
well as with individual Canadians who wish to help keep this 
great country united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the city council of Lethbridge for presenting such 
positive resolutions and for acting to help its fellow Canadians 
in Quebec who wish only for improvements to the federation and 
not for separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent poll in my constituency over 80% of respondents 
believe that making federal institutions more accountable is the 
best route to solving Canadian national unity problems.  Nearly 
two-thirds who responded agreed that realigning more powers to 
the provinces, precisely what Quebec has long asked for, is the 
key to keeping this country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel strongly that if we persevere to keep Canada united we 
will indeed enter the 21st century with new found confidence and 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all Canadians to contact their municipal, provincial and 
federal representatives and to continue communicating with our 
sisters and brothers in Quebec.  Let us keep our Canadian family

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
our colleague speak about the Calgary declaration. I would simply like 
to remind him of several points. First of all, the sovereignty of 
Quebec, once again, is not a problem, it is a solution. I would just 
like to inform him that Quebec as such is not a province like the other 
provinces and that it will never be like the other provinces. The 
Province of Quebec is the cradle of this great Canada. The development 
of this great Canada did not begin in the west and move east, but began 
in the east and moved west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that we are all people who are identical and 
the same, but there are differences. 
I would like to point out to him that the difference is greater between 
Quebeckers and anglophones in other provinces than between anglophones 
in Canada and Americans. Therefore if, according to him, we are all the 
same and we should all be in the same boat and be identical, I would 
like him to tell us whether he would prefer that Canada simply join the 
United States. Why would he not agree that Canada should simply join the 
United States? Because Canadians are different from Americans, because 
Canadians want to keep their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he considers it is good that Canada does not join the United 
States, why not allow what would be a good thing for us, Quebeckers, 
that is to be who we are and what we want to become? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Casson:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is what we are trying to get across here.  It is 
that we are not all the same.  Every province has its own 
uniqueness.  We are saying that we would like to give the 
provinces the powers to develop those differences and that 
uniqueness while staying in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member said, I certainly would not support any move 
for Canada to join the United States.  That is a poor analogy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that we are different.  Let us give the provinces

listened with intent to the member's speech.  I thought he gave a 
very good speech.  Sometimes we do not have the opportunity to

national standards in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that sometimes we get involved in the issue of 
devolution and do not look at what is behind it.  Presumably the 
theory is that the closer the government is to the people, the 
better the administrative services.  Does the hon. member for 
Lethbridge feel that programs administered out of Edmonton would 
be superior to a local CEC office in Lethbridge which would deal 
directly with the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could think of things which are 
under provincial jurisdiction which would be better handled on a 
national basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited a softwood lumber forestry operation in British 
Columbia which was very close to the Alberta border.  I was 
surprised how every province in this country competed against 
each other.  The net result was that the Americans were able to 
plot province against province to create a quota system.  In 
fact, what we should have been doing was talking with one voice 
in international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on some of those 
items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Casson:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member that 
my background is in municipal politics.  I came through that 
route to this House.  That level of government is closest to the 
people.  We are with them every day.  We are not removed from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always had the feeling that the government which is 
closest to the people should be the government to deal with them. 
The government that is most able to deliver whatever service it 
is, whether it be a social service or a matter having to do with 
interprovincial trade, should be the government to handle it.  I 
agree with the member that barriers to interprovincial trade is 
another debate entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a strong central government in Canada to handle 
national issues, such as defence.  However, services should be 
moved down the line into the provincial realm and even into the 
municipal realm.

can handle a lot of the services which are required.  They know

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly perplexed and disappointed that after 30 years of 
all kinds of wrangling, this whole business has not yet been 
resolved.  Actually, I am not surprised that an agreement to our 
national dilemma has evaded us.  Hopefully this will become 
evident in my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all this time, energy, money spent and lost opportunities, 
where are we in our national debate?  Where are we in our 
national discourse on the Quebec separation issue?  After all 
these talks, where are the results?  After three decades have our 
discussions led to new goals and a new vision for our country? 
Have we as Canadians developed a sense of patriotism toward our 
homeland?  The questions beg the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, our country certainly seems to be in a quandary.  For 
almost two generations our country has been adrift like a 
rudderless vessel on a stormy sea, tossed hither and yon by the 
forces of deceit, dishonesty, deception and destruction and all 
the time undergirded by the contradictions of apathy and 
appeasement and all the time bringing our nation closer to the 
brink of disaster where the very fibre of our country is being 
stretched to the breaking point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through all these years what really has the fuss been all about? 
What has been that elusive thing that seems to be beyond our 
reach and our grasp?  Has the 30-plus years of a one-sided debate 
centred around the issue of equality, the equality of provinces 
or the equality of citizens?  Has the debate been centred on the 
devolution of federal powers?  Has the ongoing debate been about 
the building of a new Canada?  Or, has this long, drawn out 
debate, unbalanced I may add, centred around the rebuilding of 
Canada based on the two founding nations concept and its 
ill-conceived child, a distinct society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the debate has been about?  It certainly seems to 
me that that is precisely what the debate has been about for 
about 30 years.  Debate has been about the notion of two founding 
nations, two societies based on language and culture, on French 
and English, on making one language and culture in Quebec, on 
making Quebec a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be no surprise, based on these concepts, the concepts 
of two societies and a distinct society for one of them, that the 
whole notion was doomed to a dismal failure.  The focus has been 
misguided and the mark was missed completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of the two nations concept was predicted 35 years 
ago by a former Alberta premier when he stated “You talk about 
this two nations idea long enough and that is probably what you 
will end up with”.  Just look around.  Some would say that is 
pretty much where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two nations concept and its manifestation, distinct society, 
produced the idea that confederation was to serve the ends of two 
language groups, French and English.  If we follow that kind of 
reasoning to its logical conclusion, what do we come up with?  It 
would mean that Canada would not really be a federation of 10 
equal provinces at all but consist instead of two societies, one 
being a distinct society, Quebec, and the other nine provinces 
combined to be the other society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spokespeople for the old line federal parties argue that to 
put such a clause in the constitution would be to merely 
recognize the sociological fact that Quebec is the homeland of 
the French language and culture and that Quebec has its civil 
code which is of course distinct from the English common law.  No 
one can dispute these sociological facts. 
They are there for everyone to see, but that is largely 
irrelevant.  It is irrelevant to the debate on whether this kind 
of clause ought to be in the constitution.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem arises when describing these sociological facts, 
civil code, French language and culture, denominational schools, 
with a broad brush definition like distinct society and to put 
these words in the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the nub of it.  If we put Quebec as a distinct society 
in the constitution, we are then asking the courts to give those 
words meaning.  There is no constitutional basis or 
constitutional history to give support and credibility to the 
concepts of two founding nations and distinct society.  No 
Fathers of Confederation, not even the French speaking Fathers of 
Confederation, said anything of two nations and distinct society. 
They talked very little of language as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no ringing declaration in the BNA Act that Canada wants 
to be a bilingual and bicultural country.  Nothing in the 
Constitution of 1867 suggests bilingualism or biculturalism. 
There is one important section in that act on language.  It is 
section 133 which states that English and French may be spoken in 
the House of Commons and in the courts established by the 
Government of Canada, in other words the Supreme Court and the 
federal courts, and that the two languages may be used in the 
National Assembly in Quebec.  Subsequent language and cultural 
laws came much later under the hand of Mr. Trudeau, with little 
constitutional basis for it until provided for in the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrenching distinct society in the constitution for Quebec 
would encourage provincial governments and that province to carve 
out more jurisdictional areas unavailable to other provinces. For 
example, Quebec could establish its own radio and television 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great constitutional expert Eugene Forsey wrote that Quebec 
could assume powers in banking, copyright, patents, railways, 
citizenship, criminal law, foreign affairs, plus others possibly, 
if the distinct society clause would be entrenched in the 
constitution.  Legislation will be passed and when challenged by 
the courts, Quebec will argue “This is a necessary ingredient 
for us.  We must have that because we are a distinct society”. 
Quebec marches onwards toward separation a phenomena dubbed as 
incremental separatism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a much better resolution to this issue of unity.  It 
will ensure that legitimate constitutional aspirations of Quebec 
are met.

listening to what the Reformers are saying today can rest assured that 
this gives us further arguments in favour of sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member's colleague indicated earlier, distinct 
society does not mean anything to them. I am pleased to hear 
that. It does not mean anything, it is meaningless. I agree. They 
have stated in this House—and they took the entire day to say 
so—that it is meaningless. I must thank my colleagues from the

more reason to be in favour of sovereignty.

there were 64% who voted in favour of sovereignty.  He also made

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I must 
comment on what the hon. member said about distinct society because the 
concept of distinct society was diluted to such an extent in both the 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords that it was clear, very clear in 
fact—and that is what ministers and anyone who supported the Meech 
Lake accord at the time said—that this would not give Quebec any more 
power. This is one of the many reasons that led Quebeckers to vote 
against the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If today we use a different terminology to describe a notion like 
the unique character of Quebec, the result will be the same, that is to 
say that Quebeckers will not accept any such proposals because they do 
not mean anything, they are just empty words that do not give Quebec any 
real power, when that is what Quebeckers want. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate 
the notion the member has put forward.  I would agree that the 
leaders of the day at the Charlottetown and the Meech Lake 
accords had a tendency to say one thing in one part of the 
country and another thing in another part of the country. Of 
course, that is dishonest and deceptive and it is not the way to 
bring about a unified country.

Ridge.  I was taken aback by the ceremony and going through some 
of the trenches and seeing some of the carvings on the walls that 
had been done by people who had been shot or killed at Vimy.  I 
realized that both French and English had fought together in that 
war.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody asked them when they showed up to free France from the 
invaders whether they were French or English, whether they were 
Quebeckers or Ontarians, whether they came from the west.  They 
fought together as a nation of Canadians, and very successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 3,900 Canadians, if I recall correctly, of all backgrounds 
lost their lives there.  These are some of the histories that we 
have shared together as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with that view in mind that I rise today to speak in 
favour of not only the Calgary declaration but the motion that 
has been moved by my hon. colleagues opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have discussed a variety of issues today and there is this 
constant issue of decentralization versus centralization.  I 
sometimes do not think that we have given proper address to how 
our world is significantly changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often the debate is very sterilized because it talks about 
taking power away from some kind of central authority.  I would 
like to indicate that over the last 10 years Canada has entered 
into a number of international treaties such as NAFTA, GATT and 
some of the other treaties that we are now discussing and will be 
discussing in this House such as the multilateral agreement on 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these treaties, if you will, have resulted in the delegation 
to a certain degree of authority from the so-called central 
government to international bodies, often dispute settlement 
mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to get at is that we have actually already 
given up a certain degree of power at the federal level to 
international institutions to effect more global trade.  This is 
the reality of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we sit at the other end and constantly try to take power away 
from this institution that has already given up power 
internationally, we can understand how we are slowly but surely 
weakening our system of government and weakening the ties that 
bind us together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was heartened today by the Reform Party's talking about 
national standards because I very rarely hear it talk about 
those.  I hear it defending provincial rights.  Once again, I 
sometimes do not think we have given enough thought to how our 
country has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder if we should be debating provincial 
versus federal rights or talking more about urban versus rural 
rights.  When we talk about the delivery of services on a local 
basis, of course large municipalities have the ability to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just seen in my own province the amalgamation of the 
city of Toronto. Whether people like it or not it seems that is a 
very huge governmental authority that could probably deal 
effectively with a lot of local issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there are communities within our country that 
have a great deal of difficulty making even the basic services 
available to their people just because they are few in number or 
they are spread out over a wide geographical area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often wondered if we should not restructure some of this 
debate about dealing with how to deliver services directly to the 
people who require them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the initiative of the Calgary declaration.  I think we 
very much have to continue the dialogue, but I think also we have 
to start talking about how to build this country.  We have to 
stop talking about how to tear it apart.  We have to start 
talking about how to build a stronger nation as we move toward 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have institutions of government. I have come to believe that 
there is a role for some kind of reformed Senate.  I suspect it 
has some of the parameters that some of the members are talking 
about today, guaranteeing some kind of minimum standards and 
ensuring that our medical system, for instance, in British 
Columbia is not significantly different in a minimum kind of way 
from those in other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been appalled in some ways to find that people who have a 
cardiac or a diagnosis cardiac operation in British Columbia have 
to wait three weeks for an operation, while those in Manitoba 
only half a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore when we talk about things in the Calgary declaration 
such as equality of people, I sometimes wonder whether we are 
really addressing those issues and whether, if we are really 
concerned about the equality of people, we should find ways to 
ensure there are minimum standards across this country we can all 
agree to as a nation.

things that unite us as a nation are the ways we treat each 
other.  Most people would say one of those things is the health 
care system.  Another is education.  Heaven forbid, it says here 
that belongs to the provinces, but most people would say we 
should have some kind of minimum standard on which we can all 
agree that people can move around this country without needing an 
entry test to discover whether they are in grade two or grade 
twelve or whatever grade. We should all have some standards 
recognized which can unite us as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from Mississauga South would like a few 
words, I will conclude.  I am definitely in support of the 
Calgary declaration initiative and of the motion before us today. 
More important, we have to find ways to reinvent our country. We 
happen to think that devolution is the way to do it. There may 
well be cases where we should be giving power back to the central 
government in order to create national binding standards in our 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Speaker:</b>  Colleagues, I am now ready to rule on a 
point of order raised by the hon. member for St. Albert on 
Monday, November 24, 1997.  At that time the hon. member raised a 
point of order relating to the following items in the estimates: 
vote 1, policy and farm programs under agriculture; vote 15, 
convention refugee determination division under immigration; vote 
1, health, environment and safety from environmental hazards 
under environment; vote 5, lands and trust services under Indian 
affairs; vote 1, policy and programs and divestitures under 
transport; vote 35, international trade tribunal under trade; 
vote 15, supply and services under public works; vote 40, Canada 
Information Office under heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supported by the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford, the hon. 
member argued that the first five items seek to bypass the 
legislative process because certain bills related thereto are now 
before the House or died on the order paper in the 35th 
Parliament.  As to the remaining three, he claimed there was no 
legislative authority at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the hon. President of the Treasury Board returned 
to the House and responded with his explanation of the eight 
items complained of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the details of my review of this matter, might 
I suggest with all respect to the hon. member, as have suggested 
several Speakers before me, that points of order on estimates are 
usually very serious and almost always very complex. 
To leave these matters to the eve of the final decision by the 
House puts the Chair in a difficult position to say the least, if 
intelligent consideration is to be given to such procedural 
issues. In the absence of an appropriate procedure to challenge 
specific items in the House, hon. members should bring these 
matters forward as soon as they are aware of difficulties.

abundant reference to past rulings by Speakers Lamoureux, Jerome 
and Sauvé.  Over the last several hours I have refreshed my 
memory and reviewed these rulings and in particular Speaker 
Jerome's ruling of March 22, 1977 and Speaker Sauvé's ruling of 
June 12, 1981. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rulings make it clear that the supply procedure ought not to 
be used to bypass the normal or regular legislative process. In 
other words, items in the estimates must not attempt to amend 
existing statutes or be used to obtain authority which normally 
would be sought through proper legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to better understand what on these occasions was the 
basis on which certain provisions of the estimates were 
challenged, let me quote two examples of the exact wording used 
in the estimates as tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example relates to industry, trade and commerce, vote 
77d of the supplementary estimates (D) for the fiscal year ending 
March 31, 1977, as referred to in Speaker Jerome's ruling of 
March 22, 1977.  The description of the vote was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vote 77d—Export Development 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) To increase from $750,000,000 to $2,500,000,000 the amount 
set out in Section 26 of the Export Development Act; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) To increase from $750,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 the amount set 
out in Section 28 of the Export Development Act. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example concerns energy, mines and resources, vote 45 
of the main estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1982, 
as referred to in Speaker Sauvé's ruling of June 12, 1981.  Again 
the description of the vote was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vote 45—Canada Oil Substitution Program—Payments, in 
accordance with regulations made by the Governor in Council and 
payments pursuant to agreements with a province or a person in 
respect of— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was based on the wordings as they appeared in the estimates 
that both examples were ruled out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gone back to the basis for the rulings referred to by the 
hon. member for St. Albert, I then examined the wording used to 
describe the eight votes which he challenged in his point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first five votes grouped by the hon. member, that is, 
vote 1, agriculture; vote 15, immigration; vote 1, environment; 
vote 5, Indian affairs; and vote 1, transport, nowhere could I 
find in the wordings an attempt to bypass the legislative process 
by seeking approval for funds which have not yet received 
legislative authority. I therefore cannot agree with the hon. 
member's conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his second group the hon. member included vote 35, Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal; vote 15, supply and services 
program; and vote 40, Canada Information Office.  Again in 
examining the wording of these three votes, I cannot conclude 
that an attempt is being made to amend legislation through the 
use of an appropriation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to arguments that were made yesterday and again 
today that the House is being asked to grant supply before it 
legislates.  May I respectfully remind hon. members that when 
granting funds through the adoption of an appropriation act, the 
House is in fact legislating. Again let me repeat that what was 
objected to in the past and what different Speakers have ruled 
out of order were attempts to amend existing acts or legislate 
new programs as part of a legislative measure granting supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the hon. member for St. Albert in response to the 
hon. President of the Treasury Board further argued that the 
information provided to Parliament in the part IIIs of the 
estimates requires improvement. 
The hon. minister himself indeed agreed with such an objective. I 
should remind the House that part III expenditure plans, if 
imperfect, are a recent innovation by the government.  The 
content of most expenditure plans goes beyond the next fiscal 
year and covers several supply cycles.  That some projections 
contained therein are at variance with stated past, present or 
future government policies is in my view understandable.  Things 
change.  Events affect plans. That anticipated legislation or 
bills now on the Order Paper or bills outstanding at the 
dissolution of the 35th Parliament be referred to in these 
documents in no way impacts on the supply proceedings or the 
legislative proceedings of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important and paramount is the accuracy of the votable 
items reflected in part II of the estimates.  Once concurred in, 
the estimates in part II become the schedule to the supply bill 
which itself becomes the appropriation act granting authority to 
spend to the government. This authority must be renewed on an 
annual basis.  As was stated this morning by the hon. President 
of the Treasury Board, the statutory items are included in the 
part II for information only so that the House can get the whole 
picture on spending. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply, this morning, the President of the Treasury Board 
quoted part of a paragraph in the Preface of Part II of the 1997-98 
Estimates. I will quote more extensively from page 1-5 under the heading 
“Changes in the 1997-98 Estimates”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this section is twofold. As in previous years, 
it will describe changes in Vote, Program and other presentations 
in order to permit the reconciliation of the 1996-97 Main Estimates 
with the 1997-98 Main Estimates. 
In addition, this section will detail those Votes that contain 
specific authority that differs from that included in the previous 
year's Main Estimates as well as new expenditure authorities 
appearing for the first time. In light of the House of Commons 
Speaker's rulings in 1981, the government has made a commitment 
that the only legislation that will be amended through the 
Estimates process, other than cases specifically authorized by 
Statute, will be previous Appropriation Acts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used this statement, which is based on Speaker's rulings made in 
1981, to review the votes to which the hon. member for St. Albert 
objected. In none of them was I able to find any violation of the 
principles established by my predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the said votes are in order and the House can now 
proceed with the taking of the recorded divisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 5.23 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings 
and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the 
business of supply.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.)</b> moved that Bill C-206, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(prostitution), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, my private member's bill is deceptively 
simple.  It in itself is a minor technical point in the Criminal 
Code, but it is my belief that the clarity and improvement it 
makes can bring a significant positive result, for communities to 
take back their streets, for local merchants to have their 
sidewalks back again and for parents to renew their confidence in 
the safety of local school yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill amends section 213 of the Criminal Code to change the 
available upper penalty but more importantly the kind of process 
available against a person charged with talking in a public place 
about buying or selling sex.  It changes the street prostitution 
section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada it is a Criminal Code offence, a crime to try and sell 
or buy sex, prostitution in a public place such as a street 
corner, a taxi cab, a bar, a pub, or the lobby of a hotel.  That 
is the law.  We have had the national conversation about whether 
that kind of activity should be controlled by criminal sanction, 
and it is a crime. It is also a crime to live off the avails of 
prostitution, to be a helper or employer to benefit from the 
trade, or to keep a place of prostitution.  Of course involving 
juveniles is a very serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the private act of prostitution itself is not a crime. I 
do not know why it is not a crime as the history of abuse, 
exploitation and degradation associated with those who tend to 
become sex trade workers appears to be condoned in a double 
standard. However that is a completely different debate and is 
beyond the scope of what I am trying to do today. I have observed 
that what is helpful procedure is to more directly respond to the 
street trade in prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a social problem in our society for if there were no 
buyers there would be no sellers.  That is a societal problem. 
Nevertheless mitigating against exploitation is historically the 
Canadian way. We must provide the legal symbols which provide the 
appropriate social context for citizens to voluntarily do the 
right thing while we defend the helpless and minister to them 
rather than allow them to be exploited.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My proposed change is important for broad societal reasons. 
There is also a national problem of street prostitution across 
this country that did not exist in such a pervasive manner just a 
few years ago.  However since the advent of the charter and also 
the repeal of vagrancy laws, the legal capacity has created its 
own demand.  Whenever we create a loophole for the perverse, the 
legal vacuum will soon be filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Street prostitution goes far beyond just being a local nuisance. 
Wherever it takes a foothold, the surrounding communities soon 
learn that the drug crowd follows, as does breaking and entering, 
theft from cars and an attraction of those with criminal 
histories becomes entangled in the culture of the street.  These 
trends develop wherever prostitution is openly traded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers do not appreciate walking their children to school over 
needles and condoms along the school yard fence. Merchants should 
not have to patrol their front sidewalk and doorways cleaning up 
from the night trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the fundamental point I observed as a probation officer 
before I came to this Parliament attempting to bring social 
services to bear to individuals caught up in this sad cycle is 
that street prostitution itself is the wide open door for the 
young to become involved. Runaway children can so easily stand on 
a street corner and get involved in prostitution as a way to 
support themselves on the street.  The wide open door and the 
legal and social tolerance of street prostitution is a major 
source of the national problem, how it is fed and kept going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience in attempting to help young people in conflict 
with the law and those who are on the street made me acutely 
aware of how the summary conviction status of communication for 
prostitution was so much in conflict with all of our concern and 
expenditure to help street kids and preserve the peace and safety 
of our neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians of the Liberal government side have in the past been 
very sanctimonious about juveniles and prostitution.  NDP members 
also talk about the awful violence against sex trade workers and 
claim to be concerned about children on the street. Yet 
historically they have resisted suggestions to mitigate against 
allowing kids to be on the street and supporting themselves 
through the sex trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new problem, yet today we in Parliament after 
years of talk are still dithering about this matter.  The justice 
minister said to me just a few days ago that consultations are 
still continuing and that any legislation will be “done right”. 
That is the same put off and delaying answer I received from the 
previous justice minister back in 1994.  And the Conservatives 
were no better in that there were reports and plenty of 
consultation but during their tenure the whole prostitution file 
was not effectively dealt with.  Even worse, the NDP has appeared 
to support prostitution itself through its advocacy of what it 
affectionately calls street trade workers.  I think the NDP would 
like to unionize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a different perspective, one that is rather 
pragmatic.  We may not like prostitution in society.  We also may 
not like the overwhelming violation of rights it might take to 
eliminate most of it.  Nevertheless, as parliamentarians we also 
do not need to pave a golden street for the sex trade to 
flourish.  Therefore as an interim measure we need to pass my 
bill so we can get on with the more important comprehensive 
measures that the government claims it is considering and that 
the justice department has been studying for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prostitution is exploitive and a lot of other crime and 
degradation seems to go with it, especially all of what is 
commonly known about the drug trade and drug abuse.  All these 
tragedies are tied together, so there are practical reasons to 
have the public communications section of the code made as 
flexible as possible in its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police are also using section 503 of the code to issue what 
is called no go orders to keep repetitious, obnoxious and 
aggressive prostitutes who are leading the trade and shepherding 
others into the trade to be subject to geographic prohibitions of 
not entering into common strolls.  If the recognizance is 
breached, that becomes an offence and is easier to enforce that 
gathering new evidence under section 213 every time.  However 
these restrictions are time limited and are tied to the process 
of other charges so they are of limited value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although section 213 is gender neutral, gathering evidence 
against buyers is difficult. 
Police are unlikely to assign much of their precious police time 
resources to suppress a problem if the offence is only a summary 
one and after the expenditure of thousands of dollars in 
enforcement routines only results in a few charges and nets the 
perpetrators a $100 fine which becomes just another nuisance cost 
of doing the job.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flexibility rather than just a heavy-handed approach is what I 
am promoting.  The change would allow, if needed, to fingerprint 
and photograph if some cases were proceeded with through the 
optional indictment process.  It would be used as needed and 
would form part of a broader tool kit of resources that would 
support crime prevention objectives.  It would greatly enhance 
breaking the cycle of lifestyle for some youths and more 
effectively get them into community remedial programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have the political courage to intervene so that the 
inherent discretion that lies throughout the system can flexibly 
respond to the individual need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1995 interim report of the Federal-Provincial-Territorial 
Working Group on Prostitution, the results of national 
consultations indicated several recommendations to combat 
prostitution, one of them being to change section 213. The deputy 
minister of justice established the working group in 1992 from 
the federal, provincial and territorial governments.  With regard 
to the recommendation, the most important factor for change was 
not to punish prostitutes but rather for identification purposes. 
In many cases, prostitutes use false identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Identification of Criminals Act states that fingerprints and 
photographs cannot be taken when a person is charged summarily. 
With fingerprints and photographs, police would be able to track 
down runaways and to clear the backlog of outstanding arrest 
warrants of prostitutes who have used false identities.  It would 
also solve some serious crimes.  It would send a most necessary 
and needed message to the community, to both the customers and 
sellers, that such acts are not to be taken lightly and they are 
not in society's interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response from the working group stated that identification 
of prostitutes along with the use of false identities was 
considered a serious problem by law enforcement agencies and 
prosecutors, one which might be solved with such amendments. The 
ability to fingerprint and photograph would make it easier to 
identify and prosecute repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something most people are not aware of is the fact that many 
street prostitutes are runaways living under false names and 
identities.  They become involved and perhaps trapped in a 
dangerous subculture. Parents of these children desperately want 
to find a way of tracing their child's whereabouts but because of 
false identities little can be done.  They desperately want to 
find a way to bring their children home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research that has been done on street prostitution suggests 
that decisions to enter into the prostitution trade are decided 
in the time of youth.  In fact in 1984 the Badgley Committee on 
Sexual Offences Against Children and Youth found that of all the 
prostitutes interviewed, 93% of females and 97% of males had run 
away from home.  In another report in a 1990 journal of 
<I>Canada's Mental Health</I>, authors Earls and David found that 
the average age of female prostitutes leaving home was 13.7 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who support the sex trade say that it is really not a big 
problem and that politicians are just blowing it out of 
proportion, but here are three comments from those affected by 
street prostitution.  The first is from a Vancouver resident, the 
second by a Toronto resident and the third from the former mayor 
of Toronto and current minister of defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First: “When prostitutes operate openly in a neighbourhood, 
all women in the area become targets for cruising johns in cars 
or on foot.  Soon every female from 8 to 60, from your daughter 
to your mother, will have been on the receiving end of some sort 
of disgusting advance from a stranger while walking to the store 
or playing in the park”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second quote:  “My apartment has become a refuge from 
streets which become enemy territory every night, streets where I 
am approached by drug traffickers, accosted by cruising johns and 
insulted by hookers; streets where menacing groups of young 
people take over the corners to haggle over drug prices and yell 
out to people in passing cars”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appearing before a parliamentary committee in 1989, the current 
minister of defence stated:  “I support these changes to Bill 
C-49 as well as other recommendations our police are putting 
forward to help us once again regain control of our streets, 
namely that this offence be changed from a summary offence to a 
hybrid offence requiring that those arrested be fingerprinted and 
photographed, which is important in dealing with runaways who can 
change their identities and their names, and others who are 
trying to avoid prosecution, and that it remains, in addition to 
that, within the absolute jurisdiction of a provincial court 
judge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of defence clearly stated that such a small change 
to the Criminal Code could make a huge difference in the fight 
against street prostitution. 
I hope he will be a man of principle and lean on his cabinet 
colleagues to help me so that we can all do the right thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Minister of Justice introduced an omnibus bill that 
touched on the Criminal Code changes to prostitution. 
Unfortunately, section 213 was not changed but still today 
communication offences are mere fines and slaps on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Street prostitutes are not afraid of getting caught, nor are 
they deterred in any way to give up this dark and sad way of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I advocate the passage of my bill for several broad 
reasons.  There are symbolic sociological and national policy 
reasons why we should do this.  Also on behalf of local 
communities most effected, they are aghast at the lack of action 
to preserve the safety of their neighbourhoods.  We can do it for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important, on behalf of victims, whether it is those who get 
trapped in the lifestyle or the community as victim, we need to 
act.  Administratively we also need to provide more flexible 
tools for the police so they may exercise discretion in dealing 
with local variances and emerging problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we need to narrow the door that permits kids from 
getting involved in prostitution in the first place and have 
another legal way to get them into social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I ask other members of this House to not obfuscate 
and confuse what I am talking about, get off track and start 
talking about the generalities of prostitution in society or 
violence against women or developing legalized brothels or any 
number of related topics not appropriate to wind into the narrow 
proposal I brought forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill is a small technical amendment which could help victims 
and bring safety to our neighbourhoods.  I hope it will receive 
non-partisan support in that light.  It is time for action.  Our 
communities which have sent us here expect no less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to make hybrid offences the offences 
that are provided for in section 213 of the Criminal Code.  These 
offences relate to prostitution, as the hon. member said. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, section 213 of the Criminal Code calls for an 
offence punishable on summary conviction.  The sentence set out is 
either a maximum of $2,000 or maximum imprisonment of six months, 
or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the hon. member in Bill C-206 would 
have the effect of transforming this offence into a hybrid one. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation on section 213 was introduced in the House 
of Commons, the then minister of justice stated that the purpose 
behind the legislation was not an attempt to deal generally with 
all the legal issues connected with prostitution but a limited 
attempt to address the nuisance created by street soliciting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation sought to balance the concerns of law 
enforcement agencies, citizens groups, women's groups and civil 
libertarians.  It made criminal the public activities most 
frequently engaged in for the purpose of offering or purchasing 
sexual services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the street soliciting offence of section 213 is intended 
to assist in dealing with the social problems experienced by 
neighbourhoods affected by street prostitution, making this 
offence punishable by 10 years would seem disproportionate in 
light of the purpose of section 213, when similar offences such 
as causing disturbances in a public place are summary conviction 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another possible purpose for making this offence a hybrid 
offence is to permit the fingerprinting and photographing of any 
person charged under section 213, this because the identification 
of criminal acts allows fingerprinting and photographing only in 
the case of offenders accused of committing an indictable offence 
pursuant to the federal Interpretation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may feel fingerprinting and photographing may act as 
deterrents for prostitutes and their customers.  However, 
experience has shown that this is not necessarily so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already few repeat offenders among clients of 
prostitutes, even without fingerprinting and photos.  For example, 
the statistics show that in Vancouver, for the period between 1986 
and 1992, 2,045 men were charged with the offence covered by 
section 213 of the Criminal Code. Of that number, only 44, or 2%, 
were being charged with the same offence for a second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the mere fact of being arrested the first time 
is enough to discourage a repeat offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the prostitutes, most are photographed and 
fingerprinted, often early in their career, because they are often 
involved in more serious offences, such as drug-related crimes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that a group of federal, provincial and territorial 
officials has been working since 1992, as the hon. member 
mentioned, to review legislation, policy and practices concerning 
prostitution related activities and to bring forward 
recommendations in relation to street prostitution and the 
involvement of youth in prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the request of ministers responsible for justice issues, the 
working group consulted broadly with key stakeholders. 
Participants in the consultations included representatives of 
citizens groups, justice workers, current and former prostitutes, 
municipal and provincial officials, community service providers, 
educators, clergy, aboriginal groups, child welfare and health 
workers, and women advocacy groups.  There was a very wide 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interim report of the consultation was issued by the working 
group in October 1995.  The final report is scheduled for release 
sometime next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be interested, as I am sure all members of this House 
will be interested, in studying the report.  I am sure the 
Minister of Justice and her provincial and territorial colleagues 
will also study the recommendations with great interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that, unlike the Reform Party, we do not 
make changes to the Criminal Code based on the sensational news 
story of the day or the exceptions to the rule, but with a 
balanced, collaborative and consultative process.  Then we act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the hon. member that we will be acting on the 
recommendations of the working group. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, while 
I do not agree with the hon. member's bill, I first want to congratulate 
him for trying to find a solution to a problem in his riding and in his 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I do not think the amendment proposed in Bill 
C-206 will achieve its purpose. Prostitution is indeed a very serious 
problem, but amending the section to provide for a longer prison term 
will not achieve the goal sought by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that prostitution brings along various negative things 
on a street, in a municipality and in a province. Associated with this 
type of illicit trade are all sorts of illegal activities, such as drug 
trafficking, various types of offences, theft, violence, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that providing for stiffer penalties will not solve 
the problem. This was tried before by our predecessors. The hon. member 
is right when he says he is proposing a technical amendment. He is not 
proposing anything innovative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 213, which deals with prostitution reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who in a public place or in any place open to 
public view 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) stops or attempts to stop any motor vehicle,

ingress to or egress from premises adjacent to that place, or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>c</I>) stops or attempts to stop any person or in any manner 
communicates or attempts to communicate with any person 
for the purpose of engaging in prostitution or of obtaining the 
sexual services of a prostitute is guilty of an offence punishable 
on summary conviction. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 213 has evolved over the years. At the very beginning, it 
primarily dealt with communicating. Following recent changes, it now 
also deals with soliciting.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the section was amended appropriately and that, in its 
present form, it addresses the problem.  The member's amendment 
merely adds to what I read.  He would add the words “an indictable 
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten 
years or is guilty” to the first sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the rest, I understand that the member is happy with 
the wording of the section.  He finds the sentence inadequate and 
he would like to see it increased to ten years.  But, as I was 
saying earlier, it must be understood that in Canada, and this may 
seem strange, prostitution itself is not illegal. It is brothels 
and the prostitution trade that are illegal. 
To go from there to wanting to criminalize these individuals at all 
costs and sentencing them to ten years in jail is quite a leap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard the parliamentary secretary say that it was a 
disproportionately harsh sentence, I am forced to agree with her. 
If the sentence for prostitution is ten years, what will it be for 
rape?  What will it be for the violence we see on a regular basis? 
I think the sentence has to increase in proportion to the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that prostitution is wrong and immoral.  I know all 
that.  We must, however, compare this offence with other offences 
in the Criminal Code.  I sincerely believe that this is not the way 
to resolve the problem of prostitution and, as the member who 
introduced the bill said, clean up our streets. 
This is not the way to go about it.  Nor will we clean up our 
streets by gathering up syringes and other assorted objects from 
the sidewalks the next morning.  Increasing the sentence is not the 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem, however.  There is obviously a problem 
because, although prostitution is said to be one of the oldest 
professions in the world and to have been around forever, we can 
see that it is not on the decrease.  Should there be more policing? 
Maybe.  Should preventive efforts be stepped up?  Of course. 
Education also comes into it, as does the tolerance of certain 
communities for this sort of activity.  I think there has to be a 
global approach, with adequate enforcement of the legislation, zero 
tolerance, and youth education and prevention activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said earlier that young women, and even young men, 
were leaving home, assuming a new identity, and so on, to go into 
prostitution. 
I think that if young people do, they do so because of a much more 
important underlying reason, which is not prostitution. Prostitution is 
the result, not the source of the problem, which we have to look for in 
our society. If any energy is to be invested in this issue, I think it 
should be concentrated mainly on the source. It should be concentrated 
on young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same party has been arguing against the Young Offenders Act 
for the past few days. There are all kinds of things we can do to ensure 
that timely action is be taken to help young people, to educate, reform 
and rehabilitate them so that they do not end up on the street, using an 
assumed name to live off prostitution.

think that Reformers are trying to address problems that do not really 
come under section 213. This section deals with sexual solicitation or 
communication: stopping or attempting to stop any motor vehicle; 
impeding the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic; stopping or 
attempting to stop any person or in any manner communicating or 
attempting to communicate with any person.

there is prostitution but drugs are also involved, as he seemed to 
indicate, I think that, then again, the Criminal Code contains 
provisions to deal with drug related offences, be it trafficking, use or 
what not. 
If violence was used, then again, I think that there are sections in the 
Criminal Code that deal with assault and violence. That too is provided 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like all parties to do more than anything else is for 
members each in their riding to bring pressure to bear so that the 
authorities, the community, the people in the area where there is a 
problem show zero tolerance and strongly support the police in properly 
enforcing the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</b>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on Bill 
C-206, an act to amend the Criminal Code with respect to a 
situation in our society, prostitution.  I believe my comments 
will generally reflect the sentiments of members of the New 
Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of prostitution is certainly one that many in this 
Chamber face on a day to day basis.  My constituency of Winnipeg 
North Centre is very much an inner city, north end community in 
Winnipeg.  This issue has been before us for years. There has 
been much community work, much active participation by citizens 
to address this issue.  Community members have come together. 
Members of the aboriginal community, members of other ethnic 
groups, members involved in trying to seek some sense of quality 
of life in our community have come together to try to address a 
very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this debate we all acknowledge this is a 
serious issue.  But if I went back to those groups that have been 
working on this problem for so many years and presented this 
option, this solution from the Reform Party, I think I would be 
greeted with “oh no, not again, here we go, another attempt to 
try to solve this problem through legal provisions, another 
attempt to spend more money, more time, more effort on Criminal 
Code sanctions, another attempt to scratch the surface of this 
issue and never go beyond”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members in my community want to see this Parliament for 
once take this issue seriously by getting at the root causes of 
the problem.  Reform Party members can make all the disparaging 
comments they want about the New Democratic Party and our 
policies on this issue, but I suggest that if we do not start to 
address the root causes of prostitution then we will never get a 
handle on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been dealing with legal matters and Criminal Code 
sanctions in this Chamber for over two decades.  It goes back to 
1970.  I have read through some of the efforts.  There have been 
committees and studies on this matter.  The list is endless.  The 
time, the effort, the money that has gone into the study of legal 
provisions or Criminal Code sanctions to deal with prostitution 
is endless and there is hardly any time devoted to getting at the 
root causes of this issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had just spent a fraction of the time and money that has 
gone into this issue in terms of legal sanctions and put the 
effort into matters of poverty, despair, loneliness and 
deprivation that force people into prostitution, maybe today we 
would be able to say we made a difference and that we have begun 
to crack down on the problem. That is something we all want to 
see.  But no, we have spent all this time looking for an easy 
fix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's proposal from the Reform Party is just that, a simple 
solution, a quick answer to something that is far more complex 
than is acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of studies dating back to 1970, justice 
committee reports, independent commissions and legislative 
proposals, changes to the Criminal Code. I do not think that 
we can conclude from all of this that we have made much of a 
difference. I do not think we have really done anything to reduce 
the incidence of prostitution in our communities today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the studies suggest that the problem is actually getting 
worse.  If we go through some of the literature, and I refer 
specifically to the good work done by our own parliamentary 
research branch, a February 1997 study of street prostitution by 
the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics shows a sharp increase 
in the number of prostitution related incidents recorded by 
police since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not studied all the reasons for that sharp increase, but 
I dare say that it is not because of all the time we have spent 
studying the legal and Criminal Code provisions that surround the 
issue. It is because we as a society have not really addressed 
the cause at the root of it all.  How are we going to stop people 
from being forced into prostitution or taking advantage of 
vulnerable people if we do not look at the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that Reform presents this quick fix, this 
simplistic solution. When we have tried to convince members of 
the Reform Party to get serious about the root causes of 
prostitution, they refuse to get involved.  When we on this side 
of the House presented a motion for the government to set targets 
to reduce unemployment and poverty, where were Reform members on 
the issue?  What did they do?  They voted no. They would have 
nothing to do with that kind of proactive approach which does 
address the very root causes of prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other studies show how serious the situation is and the 
problem is not going away.  Much as the Reform Party would like 
to get it out of sight so it is out of mind, it is not going away 
because we have not dealt with it in a systematic way by looking 
at the systemic roots of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Vancouver East has reported to me that very 
recently the Positive Women's Network in Vancouver reported a 
160% increase in the last two years in its membership, most of 
whom are women living in poverty, many involved in the sex trade 
and many facing addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of statistics showing an increase in street 
solicitation, the sex trade, prostitution, are related directly 
to the economic situation, growing poverty, despair, loneliness, 
isolation and deprivation, a sense of no hope in terms of future 
economic opportunities.  They are tied directly to the economic 
situation in this country. We have seen for the 85th month in a 
row unemployment above 9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all those factors, growing unemployment, growing poverty 
and a growing gap between rich and poor, more and more people 
turning to undesirable ways to stay alive out of desperation, it 
does not take a lot to figure out that unless we deal with those 
root causes we are not going to make prostitution go away.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the communities that I work with in Winnipeg North 
Centre would like us to look at the root causes, to address 
poverty, to address the hopelessness among children and young 
people who are lured by the unscrupulous behaviour of pimps in 
our society, taking advantage of everyone who is desperate to 
survive in this world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the sense of desperation that single parent women feel 
just trying to make sure they can put food on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how people are trying to stay alive in society today and 
what desperate means they will turn to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the Reform Party and to all members of the 
House that if we could turn our attention to the very issues that 
give rise to prostitution in our society today, maybe we could 
make a difference.  Maybe we could change things for the better 
so that people are not forced to resort to something as horrible 
as prostitution, selling their bodies to make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in our society today would do that willingly, unless out of 
desperation and absolute despair about how they will survive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put our energies into the roots of the problem and not 
deal with the superficial symptoms of something as serious as 
prostitution in our communities today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-206, which 
requests that amendments be made to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with much of the commentary I have heard from all hon. 
members of the House about the seriousness of this offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me to look around this Chamber and see the youth of 
some of the pages here, knowing that there are prostitutes out on 
the street younger than they who are engaging in this trade out 
of necessity.  I agree with the comment of the hon. member from 
the New Democratic Party that it is poverty and unemployment 
which are, no doubt, at the very root of this problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I must disagree with her premise that this motion is a 
simple approach to the problem.  Perhaps simple is a good word, 
but in a positive sense, in the amendment which has been put 
forward.  The reason I say that is this.  There is no question 
that an amendment to the Criminal Code can be cumbersome. 
However, I suggest that the reason it has been put forward 
is very positive.  That is why I support it. The reasons I will 
put forward for supporting it are equally simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Reform member has suggested that this would broaden the 
ability of the police, and I would suggest the judges as well, in 
their approach to this most serious matter.  It does so for a 
number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making this a hybrid offence which would include an 
indictable offence it does a number of things, to which my friend 
has referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it gives the police the ability, under the Identification 
of Criminals Act, to fingerprint and take photographs, which 
could be used for a broader purpose in terms of children who have 
been abducted or children who are runaways. It could also be used 
for the purpose of deterrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deterrence is a whole philosophy and we could speak at length on 
the issue of deterrence, but let me say this.  A person who is 
charged with an indictable offence must appear in court.  I have 
seen it at the provincial court level.  With prostitution being a 
summary offence, it becomes essentially the price of doing 
business.  Young prostitutes, or prostitutes of any age, will 
come into court or have a lawyer appear on their behalf, pay the 
fine and waltz out the door.  They can amass a lengthy criminal 
record which, in essence, will result in perhaps a higher fine 
the next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making this an indictable offence would allow judges, in their 
discretion, to impose a more lengthy term of incarceration, if 
necessary, or at least to apply conditions in a probation order 
that would include treatment type programs.  It would treat this 
matter in the serious fashion in which it should be treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the main reason for which I, on behalf of the 
Conservative Party, am in support of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily I can say that prostitution is not a major problem in my 
constituency in Nova Scotia.  However, there is always the 
difficulty and the problem that arises when youth, for whatever 
reason, take to the streets in the bigger metropolitan areas or, 
in more serious cases, when young people are abducted and forced 
into this particular trade.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saying that it is the oldest profession in the world is not to 
trivialize the problem at all.  I do not want to draw too fine a 
point on it but slavery was around for a long time too and it was 
the laws that essentially brought about the necessary change, 
along with the efforts and work of people against that particular 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prostitution is not going to be solved by simple amendments to 
the Criminal Code.  I think we can all say that quite simply. 
However there is no question that this is a step in the right 
direction. It saddens me to think that this can become a partisan 
issue. Like a lot of justice issues, this is something the House 
should be unanimous in its efforts to work toward solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary for the justice minister has 
stated that there is a report pending.  I would hope and 
encourage her to keep this particular motion in mind and not to 
simply dismiss it. What if the report comes back and there are 
suggestions which move the Criminal Code in the very direction 
the hon. member from the Reform is suggesting? I reiterate it is 
very unfortunate that we see this forum being used again as a 
means to get up and simply dismiss the idea outright because it 
happens to come from one party or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a good suggestion.  It is something that at least 
moves us in the direction of addressing the issue in a positive 
way. It improves discretion on the part of the police and judges 
to act in a definitive way by imposing more innovative sentences 
that might include treatment.  It also allows the police to treat 
the matter in a more serious way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I would reiterate the comments made by the hon. member 
from the Reform.  I would suggest that the perception of justice 
in Canada is extremely important as to how the community views 
how those actors who are imposing our criminal laws are viewing 
the problem.  It gives the perception that we in this Chamber and 
in the justice departments around the country are looking at this 
problem and looking for solutions.  Not simple solutions, but 
solutions that are aimed at moving in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that raising fines and putting people in 
jail in itself is going to solve this problem.  But it certainly 
is a move in the right direction in increasing the ability of 
those people charged with the enforcement of the law and giving 
them a greater ability to do something about this crime.  It is 
not going to, as my friends from the New Democratic Party and the 
Bloc suggested, get needles off the streets.  It is not going to 
eradicate this problem in its entirety, not by a long shot, but 
it will increase the ability to act in a proactive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how I view this particular piece of legislation.  It is 
proactive.  It is preventive.  It is doing something early in the 
process.  This again is something which is tied in with the 
changes that need to come about under the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is doing something early at the front end.  It is loading the 
resources at the beginning where the problem starts and doing 
something before we get further and further down the road where 
someone has been engaged in prostitution for whatever reason, 
poverty, drug addiction, all sorts of reasons, a forced situation 
where pimps are forcing young people into this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that we should embrace within this House.  It 
is something I am supporting and I would encourage all members to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  The hon. member from 
Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remind the hon. member for Calgary Centre, if as is the usual 
practice, the mover of the motion would like to sum up, it would 
mean the member for Calgary Centre would have seven minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for that clarification.  I very much appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also very much appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-206. I had prepared a few more comments than the time will 
allow, so I may have to pause at a few opportunities and correct 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly interested to speak to this bill.  It is 
important.  Sometimes in this House we get so distant from the 
people we represent that we need to bring forward some real live 
people who have to live in the environment which we are trying to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of an elderly lady with whom I was recently in 
contact in my riding.  This elderly lady lived in the inner city 
community that is plagued with prostitution.  She has been there 
for over 10 years. 
She is now afraid to go out of her house at night because of the 
violence outside her door that is  related to street 
prostitution.  She pleaded with me to find a way to make a change 
that would allow the police, who have become complacent with the 
issue outside her door, to find a way whereby they would have new 
tools that would allow them to impact the street prostitution 
that she has to live with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lady has seen the violence outside her own door.  She has 
watched the drug trade that has come with prostitution in her 
community.  She is aware of the health risks that have escalated 
because of the increase in street prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also met with the community association of this 
community.  Their number one issue is street prostitution trade 
in their community.  They recognize that it is a multifaceted 
problem.  There is not a single silver bullet that is going to 
solve this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, they are calling for elected officials and 
people within the community to come up with a series of 
strategies that will help to resolve this problem for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major concerns that my constituents have is the age 
at which some of the young girls are getting caught up in this 
industry or in prostitution.  It is one of the reasons I will be 
proposing a private members' bill to address this issue in the 
days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is ironic here is that the majority of the effort that 
police apply to affect street prostitution is targeted toward 
this very activity that this bill is trying to address, the 
activity of communicating for the service of prostitution, to 
obtain the sexual service of a prostitute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the majority of their effort goes.  Yet, the 
result is a summary offence, a fine and often police are 
frustrated because they continue to see a cycle of the repeat 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the act to make the possibility of an indictable 
offence the result of prosecution will allow for, as has been 
stated, the identification of the people who are involved, a 
record to be established and potentially a jail term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We focused on the 10-year maximum but that is obviously not 
going to be the norm.  That is the maximum.  That should be made 
clear here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really not a terribly new precedent.  In section 212 of 
the Criminal Code, there are already indictable offences that 
apply to prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone inciting someone else to get involved in prostitution or 
someone who is living off the avails of prostitution of someone 
else who is under the age of 18 are already indictable offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are really not breaking tremendous new ground here.  We are 
just applying a correction and providing the police with a new 
tool that they really could take advantage of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond these new tools to police, I am even more concerned about 
some of the other benefits that flow out of this proposed bill. 
The member from the Conservative Party made some reference to it. 
I certainly concur with his disappointment that we would make 
this a partisan issue and not have unanimous support around this 
kind of initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the other benefits I want to speak to, particularly in 
my riding, are some of the young girls who are caught up in this 
activity who are runaways from home.  Many of us do not realize 
that prostitutes do not stay in their same community.  They are 
moved around to many communities across Canada.  Perhaps members 
do not have this problem in their own riding but some of the 
people from their riding may be caught up in it and moved to 
other centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability to identify these people is critical to the police 
in order to track these runaways and reunite them with their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my possession a list of 14 young prostitutes who have 
been killed in the last 10 years.  They were identified and I 
will get to the identification process in a minute.  I wonder how 
many more have just disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest difficulty the police have today in these kinds of 
crimes and violence against these women who are involved in 
prostitution is the difficulty of identification.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are often time delays when a murder is committed before 
the body is found and identification is that much more complex. 
The johns of course keep a low profile.  They deal with strangers 
normally and there is no identification.  Often they use an alias 
and do not use the same name twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a charity that works with street teens and 
girls who are on the streets to try to get them off the streets. 
They get to know who the girls are on the streets.  The police 
come to that charity in order to find out who the girls are.  I 
think it is tragic that our police are forced to go to a charity 
to identify these girls who have been tragic victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I think the key point of this simple piece of 
legislation is that it provides better protection for our 
communities, like the elderly lady I made reference to, and 
allows for family reunification for those who have been caught up 
in it and have run away.  It allows for the prosecution of 
potentially violent johns who could impact on the girls who are 
caught up in this trade.  It allows for improved deterrents for 
those who may elect to get into it and generally safer 
neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot support a bill that serves to provide safer 
neighbourhoods for the people we represent then I think we really 
have to examine our effectiveness here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</b>  The hon. member for 
New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby will sum up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Forseth:</b>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly would have 
liked to have heard more positive comments than what I got to 
hear.  I think the parliamentary secretary for the government is 
sadly misled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was talking about deterrents, it was not the main issue. 
Identification and prevention are.  The resistance to what I am 
proposing flies in the face, I think, of what average Canadians 
want from Parliament.  The Liberals are out of touch on this 
issue and of course the NDP are not even in the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments advanced against this are completely fallacious. 
What we get with it is a condescending attitude that frustrates 
the public will.  That is absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP then come along and talk about root causes and insult 
the poor and associate poverty with root causes of prostitution. 
We have to think about that combination of where it keeps coming 
from.  Round and round we have heard the arguments now and enough 
of the basis of the general arguments of why we are in Canada 
today where we are.  The representative arguments that we have 
heard in the last hour are reflective of years and years of 
hand-wringing and doing absolutely nothing.  The public has heard 
enough.  I do not think we need to hear any more that we cannot 
do anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to summarize clearly that there are broad societal 
reasons why we should do this.  We need to do it on behalf of 
local communities and on behalf of victims.  Whether it is those 
who get trapped into the lifestyle or the community that is the 
victim, we need to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Administratively, we also need to provide more flexible tools 
for the police so that they may exercise discretion in dealing 
with local variances and emerging problems.  Moreover, we need to 
narrow the door that permits kids from getting involved in 
prostitution in the first place and have another legal way to get 
them into social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill is a small technical amendment which could help victims 
and bring safety to our neighbourhoods and bring a change which 
has been both recommended by national consultation and by local 
police forces.  I wanted to see more common sense and support for 
this idea.  The people of the country are watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to a committee and this bill was deemed non-votable, 
which is really an offence.  In any case, we have covered the 
arguments and the people listening will be able to hear. However, 
I want the members of this House to pay attention to what I am 
about to move and not make a mistake.  It is important that this
