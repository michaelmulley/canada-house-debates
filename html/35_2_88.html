	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-337, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this is the second anti-scab bill I have 
introduced in the House. This one takes a somewhat different 
approach, although the objectives are still the same, the only 
objectives debated and defended by the Bloc Quebecois here in the 
House of Commons. And we will go on doing so. Only the 
approach is different.
<P>
	The House will recall that the previous bill was voted down with 
a majority of only ten votes. I have reason to believe that the 
approach I have taken in this particular bill will get us the majority 
we need to initiate legislation that will eliminate the use of scabs by 
firms regulated by the Canada Labour Code.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-338, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code and 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act (scabs and essential 
services).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to 
introduce a bill whose purpose is to add anti-scab provisions to the 
Canada Labour Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act. It 
also contains provisions for maintaining essential services in the 
case of a strike or a lockout.
<P>
	I would like to point out that more than 700,000 workers work in 
the federally regulated sector. Quebec passed similar legislation in 
1977. I hope that when the time comes, the Liberals will support 
this initiative as they did when they were the official opposition.
<P>
	Before becoming a member of Parliament, I worked in the 
Quebec labour movement for 19 years. By introducing this bill, I 
am keeping a promise I made to the workers of this country, and it 
also shows that the Bloc Quebecois is listening to the unions.

LAND RECLAMATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-339, an act to permit descendants of 
the United Empire Loyalists who fled the land that later became the 
United States of America after the 1776 American Revolution to 
establish a claim to the property they or their ancestors owned in 
the United States that was confiscated without compensation, and 
claim compensation for it in the Canadian courts, and to exclude 
from Canada any foreign person trafficking in such property.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to introduce a 
bill that will be known once adopted as the Godfrey-Milliken act.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to permit the descendants of the 
United Empire Loyalists whose lands were confiscated or occupied 
by others when they fled the United States in the years following 
the American Revolution to assert their claims in the Federal Court 
of Canada.
<P>
	The court is then required to make a determination as to who the 
owner of the property was and order it returned to the claimant or 
the person otherwise entitled; to order that the claimant be 
compen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5522"> 5522 </A></B>
<P>
sated by the payment of damages; and to list the names of the 
persons who are trafficking or who have trafficked in the property.
<P>
	Those persons then will not be permitted to enter Canada, nor 
will their families be permitted to enter Canada, and they will be 
forced to leave Canada if they are in Canada until they return the 
confiscated property to the rightful owners.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The bill is quite a short one. I think it is one that will find 
widespread support in the House. I have had indications of support 
from members opposite. I am looking forward to an opportunity to 
present the bill.
<P>
	I hope all hon. members will agree to make it votable so that we 
can get this bill passed with dispatch and give to Canadians the 
same rights that Americans enjoy under the Helms-Burton law 
passed in that country.
<P>
	I am also aware that, on adoption of this bill, many of the 
difficulties of finance in the federal government will be satisfied 
because of the substantial awards of damages that will be available 
to Canadians.
<P>
	I suspect that the Minister of Finance will be looking at those for 
taxation revenue and will be able to solve our deficit problems with 
the additional tax.
<P>
	(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Perhaps 
you would like to seek unanimous consent of the House to refer the 
bill just proposed to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
before second reading under section 73(1) of the standing orders, 
recognizing the sincerity with which it has been proposed and, as 
the mover mentioned, proceeding with dispatch.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, when you seek leave of the House to 
refer the bill immediately, I am going to say no and I will explain 
why.
<P>
	Members of this House agreed that a committee of their peers, 
other members, would make the decision of whether a bill would 
be votable or not. It is unfair to the other members of the House 
who have accepted this procedure, as most have, if there is a 
short-circuiting of the procedure even though for the best of 
motives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order, I am 
surprised you listened to that intervention. Normally when there is 
denying of unanimous consent is it not just a yea or a nay? Are 
there explanations offered?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. House leader speaks so quickly that he 
got most of it in before I had a chance to intervene.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to make this into a debate 
but a point of clarification. The House leader for the government 
side said that it was necessary because it is not proper to refer this 
without a committee of peers. Is it not proper to refer it with 
unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is the situation, if I may. We had first reading 
of a bill. We had another member standing on a point of order. I 
heard the hon. member's point of order. We had someone from the 
government side wanting to intervene on the same point of order. I 
had to listen to what he had to say before making a decision.
<P>
	Having heard all the members who want to intervene on this 
point of order, we will do what we usually do when unanimous 
consent is asked. Does the hon. member have the unanimous 
consent to present the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is no unanimous consent.

Canadian residents and the implementation of this tax convention 
has had the effect of unduly penalizing those with low incomes. As

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order regarding what I consider a violation of a 
standing order through activities that occurred yesterday. I am 
referring to Standing Order 114(2)(c) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At any time when no list has been filed with the clerk of the committee pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section or when no notice has been received by the clerk of the 
committee pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Chief Whip of any 
recognized party may effect substitutions by filing notice thereof with the clerk of 
the committee, having selected the substitutes from among the Members of his or her 
party and/or the independent members listed as associate members of the committee 
pursuant to Standing Order 104(4); and such substitutions shall be effective 
immediately they are received by the clerk of the committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yesterday as an associate member of the committee, I was asked 
to attend the justice committee, at which time I filed the proper 
forms, the paper that said I would be substituting for the rest of that 
day which would entitle me to present a motion at the committee.
<P>
	The motion I had intended to give was with regard to asking the 
justice minister to immediately bring forth legislation that would 
toughen penalties against convicted pedophiles, therefore 
protecting young Canadians from this most heinous crime. It was 
based on the movement in Belgium and the actions that are being 
taken by some people in Canada in that regard.
<P>
	When the meeting had come to an end of the regular business 
and when it was my turn to present this motion, the chairman of the 
committee said that she could not receive the motion from me 
because I was out of order, I was not a regular member of the 
committee.
<P>
	I would like to lay that protest at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, as a general rule when these points 
of orders deal with the committees, I much prefer to have them 
settled in the committee.
<P>
	I would take it that the hon. member has raised this complaint 
with the chairman of the committee himself or herself, depending 
who the chairman is. If that has not been done, I would encourage 
the hon. member to do so.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Has this been done? Could the hon. member answer that 
question? Has the hon. member raised his complaint with the 
chairman of the committee?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. Prior to the vote last night I 
had a word with the chairman of the committee,  who stated to me 
that she was following the direction from the clerk of the standing 
committee at the time. If that is the case, it makes it very difficult 
to function in the manner I had intended. Knowing that the clerk 
obviously was not familiar with the standing order, I do not know 
what-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for that information. Of 
course, the chairmen of our committees as well as myself very 
often refer to the advice of our clerks here in the House of 
Commons. It is a practice which has stood us in good stead.
<P>
	Having said that, I will look into the matter for the member and 
if it is necessary, I will come back to the House with information.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have some 
additional information for you to consider when considering the 
point of order raised by my colleague from Wild Rose. The 
member for Yukon was illegally sworn in to the committee. I raise 
that for you to consider when making your ruling.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course, we would hope that this information 
would always be dealt with in committee.
<P>
	Just in passing, I would note that all hon. members should be in 
their proper seats when they rise to be recognized in the House. I 
am sure that is followed for the most part.
<P>
	If it is necessary on the point of order, I will return to the House.

	On the Order: Government Orders:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>October 21, 1996-Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and 
Solicitor General of Canada-Second reading and reference to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs of Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act and the Referendum Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum 
Act, be forthwith referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to begin by speaking briefly about the objectives of the 
bill. This bill would create a permanent register of electors and 
would set 36 days as the minimum period for a federal election 
campaign. The bill achieves this by a vast series of amendments to 
the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	Following passage of the legislation, one last door to door 
enumeration would take place outside of a federal electoral event. 
This last enumeration would likely be conducted in the spring of 
1997. The enumeration would serve as the basis for the preliminary 
list of electors to be distributed within five days following the 
issuing of the writs for the next federal general election. The 
enumeration would also serve as the basis for a permanent register 
of electors which would be fully operational for other subsequent 
electoral events. The campaign for the next general election and 
subsequent elections therefore would last a minimum of 36 days 
rather than the present 47 days, of course, if the bill becomes law in 
a timely fashion.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The permanent register of electors, once created, would be 
updated with information from existing federal and provincial 
databases; names, addresses and birth dates from income tax 
returns filed with Revenue Canada; lists of new Canadian citizens 
compiled by Citizenship and Immigration Canada; and data from 
provincial registrars of vital statistics and provincial registrars of 
drivers and vehicle licences. The permanent register would also be 
augmented by proven provincial electoral lists.
<P>
	I want to stress that personal information taken from federal data 
sources to update the register would be used only with the active 
informed consent of the individuals involved. I understand that the 
federal privacy commissioner had been fully consulted before the 
preparation of this legislation. I understand he has expressed 
himself as being satisfied with the steps that have been taken to 
meet concerns he had earlier expressed on issues of privacy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill stems from the report of the Royal Commission on 
Electoral Reform and Party Financing, the Lortie Commission, and 
from the recommendations made by the Chief Electoral Officer of 
Canada.
<P>
	I am very happy with the extensive consultations held with the 
three recognized political parties and the other parties in the House 
of Commons before this bill was drafted. I want to thank all the 
members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs as well as Mr. Kingsley, the Chief Electoral Officer, and his 
staff for their contribution and efforts in carrying out this project.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The permanent register, which would eliminate door to door 
enumeration, together with a shortened election period would save 
the federal government about $30 million for each federal general 
election. Actually, the saving is not for the government but 
ultimately for each and every Canadian as taxpayers. Sharing the 
register with provinces, municipalities and some school boards for 
their elections would generate additional savings for Canadians as 
provincial and municipal taxpayers. I should add that the shortened 
election period would generate about $8 million of the $30 million 
savings to the federal government and federal taxpayers for each 
federal general election.
<P>
	To conclude, a few words about why I believe this bill should go 
to committee before second reading. While the objectives of the 
bill are simple, achieving them requires a large number of complex 
amendments to our existing election law. This is the kind of 
measure for which the new approach of studying a bill in 
committee before second reading is, in my view, ideal.
<P>
	If the amendments that Bill C-63 proposes require adjustment or 
fine tuning, if there are further amendments to help achieve the 
purposes of the bill and its objectives more effectively, then it is 
easier for the government to consider positively and in fact accept 
amendments before the principle of the bill is voted on at second 
reading in the House. I want to say that I am certainly open to 
positive consideration of further amendments that would help the 
system proposed by the bill to work better in the interests of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	It is also proposed that the bill go to the procedure committee of 
the House of Commons where there are a number of members of 
various parties who are already familiar with the issues and 
concepts involved with this bill. Therefore, I commend to the 
House not only the bill itself, but this motion that it be referred to 
the procedure committee for detailed study before second reading.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. FranÃ§ois Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
customary in this House not to make reference to the absence of 
other hon. members, but we can talk about our own. I was not in the 
House yesterday, but I saw on television that the government 
House leader and member for Windsor West was back in the 
House. I wish to join my hon. colleagues and yourself, Mr. Speaker, 
to say, as you did yesterday, how much he was missed in this House 
and how happy I am to see him back in good health.
<P>
	Regarding Bill C-63, on the basic principle of having a 
permanent electoral list, the official opposition cannot have too 
many reservations. It can therefore be said that we support the bill 
in principle.
<P>
	That said, let us now look at the timing of this legislation. As it 
enters the last year of its mandate, the government is now 
proposing to change the rules of the game.
<P>
	The hon. government House leader referred earlier to 
discussions among the parties. A very broad consensus will be 
required, on the government side as well as on the side of the 
official opposition and the Reform Party, for any changes to be 
made before the next election, given how close we are to an 
election. That is why I salute and greatly welcome the government 
House leader's decision to refer immediately to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs the matter of 
establishing a permanent electoral list.
<P>
	But I do have some concerns already, at this stage. Mr. Kingsley, 
no doubt and other people who have been involved in establishing 
permanent electoral lists provincially in conjunction with other 
witnesses and experts will have to shed light on certain problems.
<P>
	The government House leader mentioned earlier that a list could 
be established from information collected before an election, 
therefore making lists available within five days after an election 
writ has been issued. I would just like to put on record what the 
chief electoral officer himself, Mr. Kingsley, told the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs at our April 30 
meeting.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer said the following in reference to the 
first scenario, namely the one mentioned by the solicitor general, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The legislative changes to bring about the first scenario are elimination of 
enumeration within the election calendar and provisions to allow us to build the 
register outside the electoral period; reduction of the calendar to a minimum of 36 
days from the current 47; authority to the chief electoral officer to use lists of electors 
provided by the provinces and territories; collection of additional information-as I 
mentioned earlier, date of birth and phone number-from electors; and 
implementation of a streamlined revision process. Those changes would be required 
by the end of June 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This was several months ago and the provisions have yet to be 
passed. It seems somewhat illusory at this point to consider 
establishing a permanent electoral list for the next election.
<P>
	Look at what happened in Quebec. The office of Quebec's chief 
electoral officer, Pierre-F. CÃ´tÃ©, has been working for at least 18 
months to establish a permanent electoral list, which is still not in 
effect.
<P>
	First, statutory authority was granted by Quebec's National 
Assembly to provide legislative authority to establish a permanent 
electoral list for Quebec.
<P>
	And then what happened in Quebec? Last year, when the 
referendum was held, and even before that, in September if I am 
not mistaken, Quebec's chief electoral officer held a census. When 
the referendum writ was made out, some time was spent updating 
this electoral list, which was used for the referendum.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Of course an important data bank could be set up at the federal 
level, which would probably help us to act faster. However, the real 
permanent list would be the one that would help us follow the 
voters and keep all the needed information thanks to computers, 
without invading the voters' privacy. We could follow the voters 
throughout Canada, but that is still not an option in Quebec, even 
after 18 months of work. People are still working on that project. 
The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs will have 
to consider these issues.
<P>
	I also wonder about something else. On October 3, in the French 
CBC news program <I>Le TÃ©lÃ©journal</I>, at 11 p.m., I happened to hear 
the government House leader tell GeneviÃ¨ve Rossier, a CBC 
reporter, that a permanent list will not be ready for the next election 
and then Mr. Kingsley, the Chief Electoral Officer, gave a 
somewhat different version of the facts, to say the least. This will 
have to be clarified before the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. Mr. Kingsley was quoted as saying that he had 
convinced the government to reduce the campaign from 47 to 36 
days.
<P>
	Who convinced whom? These questions will be asked at the 
appropriate time. But the October 3 news report implied that the 
government was far from being convinced that a permanent 
electoral list could be implemented in time for the next election. 
The government should have acted before now, and we could have 
supported the initiative, which does not mean that we will not 
support the study the government wants to embark upon. Let us 
carry out this study, and if we cannot implement the 
recommendations in time for the next election, we will be able to 
do so for the following one.
<P>
	Given the political situation in Canada, I do not think that the 
government is heading for a five-year mandate and will remain in 
office until autumn 1998. Logically, normally, according to our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5526"> 5526 </A></B>
<P>
tradition, this should be an election year. The list is expected to be 
made in spring. Of course, no definite dates are given. An 
enumeration could very well be initiated by the returning officer 
outside of a campaign period and then writs could be made out at 
some point. What would happen then? Would we go back to the old 
legislation? Would we go back to a 47 day electoral period? Would 
we proceed with a new enumeration, a new revision, new training 
for the enumeration and revision officers?
<P>
	If that were to be cast in stone, with a 36 day period, the danger 
is that, under the existing law, we would have the preliminary list 
of electors not five days after the writs are issued, but ten days 
before election day. That is the first danger. It would be rather 
strange to have the preliminary list of electors ten days before 
election day.
<P>
	What would be the adverse effects of that? The amount each 
political party is authorized to spend for the election is based on the 
preliminary list of electors. Therefore, we would know only ten 
days before election day what budget is allocated to each of our 
ridings. It is difficult to plan our election expenses if we do not 
know what our budget is until the end of the campaign.
<P>
	Even though everybody agrees that the 47 day period is too long, 
if it is not compatible with a computerized list available at the 
beginning of the electoral period, we will have to make sure, at the 
hearings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, that it is not reduced to 36 days because we would then be 
forced to run an election campaign and a door-to-door revision 
campaign at the same time. For rural Mps like me, this would mean 
a revision of our 60 or so municipalities, street by street, 
concession by concession, to see if electors have been forgotten.
<P>
	These are some of the points I wanted to raise with regard to the 
dangers. Of course, on the substance of the bill, it is not appropriate 
to take a stand at this stage since, according to the new Standing 
Orders of this House, what we are having now is a preliminary 
debate to clarify the issue and to see where we are headed.
<P>
	There is another question that could be raised in committee and 
that the minister forgot to mention when he introduced the bill. I do 
not know if it is because of a difference in opinion between the 
government House leader and the Minister of Justice, but about ten 
days ago, the Minister of Justice told us that he would not contest 
an Alberta Court of Appeal decision authorizing third parties, 
including interest groups, corporations and unions, to spend as 
much money as they want to support one particular political option.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	When the Minister of Justice said that he would not appeal to the 
Supreme Court, we might have thought that he would introduce a 
bill to control expenses by  third parties. Since this is not the case, 
how can we not feel that the measure is directed at us somewhat?
<P>
	Since the issue will not be submitted to the Supreme Court or to 
this House, it will have to be studied in committee. The question 
must be dealt with. We must know what control measures and 
limits the political parties may exercise during an election 
campaign and also the limits of third parties' participation. I can 
still recall the convincing arguments put forth by the Minister of 
Finances in support of the limitation of expenses of third parties.
<P>
	These and other questions will have to be asked during the 
debate and they are the main themes I wanted to touch upon this 
morning after the speech made by the government House leader.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak to Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and 
the Referendum Act. On a personal note I would like to convey my 
own best wishes to the solicitor general. We are all glad to see him 
back in the saddle.
<P>
	The bill provides for the establishment and updating of a 
computerized register of electors. It also reduces the electoral 
period to a minimum of 36 days from 47 days. I will discuss the 
two main sections of the bill beginning with the permanent registry 
of electors.
<P>
	To establish this list it would still be necessary to do one final 
enumeration after which a permanent list would be created. The list 
would be updated by consultation with other governmental bodies 
and by using other records including provincial drivers' licences 
and records from Revenue Canada.
<P>
	The second main part of this bill would reduce the electoral 
period from 47 days to 36 days. In general, reducing the electoral 
period will mean cost savings. The Reform Party is open to 
measures to ease the burden on Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In general, the Reform Party is certainly not opposed to the 
philosophical direction of either change proposed in Bill C-63. In 
terms of the shorter period, personally I have favoured such a move 
for a long time. The first time I participated in a federal election the 
campaign was 56 days. It has been shortened over the years, yet it 
has still seemed lengthy to me as a participant.
<P>
	This is something we want to examine in terms of the specifics. I 
gather that officials of my party including the House leader have 
indicated that we favour this change, but we would want to look 
more carefully at the mechanics to make sure 36 days is the correct 
period of time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5527"> 5527 </A></B>
<P>
	Concerning the permanent register, this is an area where we for 
some time favoured improvements that would see cost savings, 
although I will raise a number of possible concerns that the 
committee should look at.
<P>
	The Reform Party has also called for other changes to the 
electoral system including measures that are not found in this bill. 
My colleagues will address some of these measures.
<P>
	Reform also supports measures that represent real cost savings 
to Canadian taxpayers. Although we support measures to reduce 
the cost of elections for Canadian taxpayers and to streamline the 
process, we have concerns, some of which I will briefly outline. In 
outlining these concerns we are happy that the solicitor general and 
government House leader has said that he is open to amendments. 
This bill may require some technical amendments in a number of 
areas.
<P>
	The first and main concern is the privacy issue. The existence of 
a permanent voter's list leads to these concerns since the 
information is to be shared by different levels of government and 
different governmental bodies. There is a risk that privacy can be 
compromised. The more information is transferred and shared, the 
greater the risk of security of the information.
<P>
	The government assures us that it will ensure the privacy rights 
of Canadians are respected. However, we all know that no system is 
foolproof, especially a brand new one.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The existence of a permanent voter's list raises concerns about 
exactly who could get the list through more advanced technology. 
The government assures us that it is impossible for the list to 
circulate but we know mistakes can happen.
<P>
	The government also assures us the consent of all voters will be 
sought in terms of the use of information and its release to different 
agencies. We sincerely hope this is the case but we are concerned 
first and foremost with ensuring that this bill does not compromise 
the privacy rights of Canadians.
<P>
	Let me mention one specific issue in this regard. It appears in 
this legislation that a voter's list will continue to identify the 
gender of voters. It has always been a mystery to me why this is 
necessary. Concerns have been raised with us and we will raise 
them in the committee about why it is necessary, for example, to 
identify on a voter's list a single female living alone. This raises 
concerns in the minds of certain individuals and I think it is one 
that the government should address.
<P>
	The second concern is proof of citizenship. It has been often 
raised in the past about the process for verification of the 
genuineness of citizenship and the reliability of electors' lists as 
they apply to new voters and new Canadians. This is a problem we 
have had in the past. Hopefully this new process will address that. 
However, we will want to study more carefully what the proposals 
are in Bill C-63.
<P>
	The third concern is getting on and off the list. To me this is 
another fascinating area, in particular as it applies once again to 
new Canadians. One oddity of this legislation is that while old 
Canadians are automatically on the list unless they request to be 
taken off, new citizens or new Canadians must specifically request 
to be put on the list in the first place. Should this not be a right and 
a responsibility that applies to all Canadian citizens equally? Why 
should the regulations for voting depend whether or not you are a 
new citizen or have previously been a citizen?
<P>
	The third concern is technology. Will we be ready to begin this 
after the next election? Will all the systems and technology support 
be up and running? How reliable are the systems being set up? We 
all welcome the use of technology to save money and streamline 
the process but we must admit the possibility for mistakes. The last 
thing we would ever want to see are mistakes in a federal election 
or one that would involve having to start from scratch with another 
enumeration.
<P>
	Let me echo in that particular concern the comments by my hon. 
friend from the Bloc Quebecois. It is a bit of a mystery to us why 
we waited until this late stage to introduce some of these changes 
so that they cannot be possibly be implemented for the next 
election. We have waited so long and now are faced with a situation 
where we are going to possibly have to rush the study of this 
legislation.
<P>
	There are other technical concerns that I could raise, for 
instance, people who do not have drivers' licences, in particular 
young people, students who also do not file tax returns. There may 
be technical issues we will have to look at there.
<P>
	Let me mention briefly the issue of cost. As I said, we welcome 
the fact that we will be able to save in the future roughly $30 
million per election with a permanent voter's list. Furthermore we 
are prepared to share this technology with provincial and municipal 
governments and school boards. In theory they all could benefit 
from this list.
<P>
	That raises additional questions about the sharing of 
information. I point out that only three provinces, Alberta, Ontario 
and New Brunswick, have said categorically that they are 
interested in this. From a federal cost standpoint we should also 
consider whether we should not share some cost benefit here at the 
federal level by sharing this list with provincial governments. If all 
of the costs have been incurred at the federal level it seems to us 
that there should be some provision for the federal government to 
gain something from the savings that will be achieved at the 
provincial level if there is co-operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5528"> 5528 </A></B>
<P>
	These are the various concerns that I would like to raise. I am 
sure there will be others. They are mainly technical in detail and 
nature. I suspect they are all resolvable and all can be addressed. 
We look forward to studying this bill in committee.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few comments to make about Bill C-63, an act to amend the 
Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act.
<P>
	As has been mentioned by my colleague, we are anxious to study 
the bill in committee, to hear witnesses and the explanations that 
the government and experts have on how this can help the electoral 
system. Obviously Canadians are receptive to some of the changes 
that are being proposed, at least in theory, if some of the obstacles 
can be overcome.
<P>
	I suspect there will be much interest in the idea of a permanent 
voter's list. The government believes it will perhaps save $30 or 
$40 million a year. Canadians would like us to look at that seriously 
for the cost savings alone.
<P>
	Another aspect is the shorter period of time. The argument goes 
that 47 days were necessary in the days of train travel and when it 
was difficult to get around to communicate in the country. 
Certainly the shorter electoral period is worthy of consideration. I 
am sure that is why the chief electoral officer has brought this 
forward.
<P>
	As members know, a permanent voter's list will eliminate 
100,000 jobs in a sense. During the enumeration process 100,000 
enumerators travel the country. Enumerating is not a permanent 
job, but there is an understanding that those positions, while they 
may be eliminated in a sense, I will not be sorry to see them go.
<P>
	While it is always nice to have somebody knocking on your door 
for the enumeration, it has been used by MPs who submit lists of 
people for that position. I will not be sorry to see that go. I would 
just as soon have it outside the political arm of all parties. To get rid 
of it would not be a bad thing.
<P>
	There is the question of the length of time someone can advertise 
during the election period. Will there be enough time to arrange for 
advertising when it comes down to taking the blackout period from 
there and so on, in a 36-day campaign? It will have to happen very 
quickly. Again, it is not an insurmountable matter. I would think 
that all political parties will be willing to look at the concept of a 
shorter period of time, meaning fewer expenses and less 
advertising.
<P>
	I do not think the Canadian people would get their knickers in a 
knot if advertising was cut back substantially. That is worthy of 
consideration.
<P>
	There is the concern about privacy. I have spoken to the electoral 
officer about this. He has assured me that this idea of getting access 
to Revenue Canada for the names for the voter's list, access to 
those who have drivers' licences and so on will be safe and secure 
and will not lead to any loss of privacy.
<P>
	Nowadays the privacy aspect is becoming more and more 
important. As the privacy commissioner said, right now Canadians 
find themselves almost inundated or overwhelmed by 
technological change and the fact that an address, a phone number 
or even a tax return given to one department is not as sacrosanct as 
it once was.
<P>
	That is obviously something we need to make sure is kept private 
for the sake of those voters who might otherwise not give their 
names willingly to Elections Canada people. The Privacy Act is 
another issue, certainly something that Canadians have a lot of 
concerns about.
<P>
	I would like to spend my last few minutes mentioning that, 
although this bill is entitled an act to amend the Canada Elections 
Act and the Referendum Act, it is almost a misnomer. Referendums 
are so seldom held in Canada that it is almost not part of the 
Canadian political scene. It is something that the Reform Party has 
proposed as one of the ways to democratize this institution and 
involve Canadians in the political process.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Reform has proposed electoral changes over the years that could 
be discussed at some time and I hope taken seriously by the House 
and actually adopted as policy. Some changes involve 
parliamentary reform. Members have heard me speak about 
changing the MPs oath of office so that members swear allegiance 
not only to the Queen but also to constituents. In other words, it 
would be a shift in allegiance to the people that actually elect us.
<P>
	Reform proposes parliamentary reform to support the restricting 
and limiting of the number of order in council appointments that a 
party can make. We spoke on a bill yesterday that reduced the 
number by 200 positions. However, over 2,200 positions still are 
filled by order in council appointments. It is a huge opportunity for 
a governing party to launder its political friends through the system 
and get a pay back.
<P>
	One of the fundamental changes that Reform has proposed and 
continues to propose would be good for democracy is the whole 
idea of referendum initiative and recall. No doubt members have 
seen on the news our Fresh Start campaign literature. It is not really 
a fresh start for Reform. This has been a longstanding demand of 
many people who are looking for changes in the system. The 
Referendum Act we are discussing today should become a 
legitimate tool of the Canadian people to democratize the Canadian 
system.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the mechanism of binding 
referendums on the Government of Canada by a simple  majority 
vote of the electorate, including a simple majority and at least 
two-thirds 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5529"> 5529 </A></B>
<P>
of the provinces. Canadians could actually pass laws themselves at 
election time where they have an opportunity to cast their ballot 
first for the person they are going to elect and second on the big 
issues of the day.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the idea of citizen's initiatives by 
way of referendums. If 3 per cent of the electorate were to present a 
petition to the chief electoral officer and it was duly recognized, 
authorized and went through due process, that proposal would then 
be put before the people in a referendum. The citizens could seize 
the day, seize the issue and force it through, not necessarily to win, 
of course, but to force it on to a ballot so they too could have a 
direct say in issues they consider very important.
<P>
	One of the issues that comes up periodically is the idea of a 
referendum on capital punishment. Others involve the expansion of 
the free trade agreement and moral issues. People say they would 
like to have a say in these policies. They do not want any political 
party to have the final say. They have to live under the law and they 
would like the final say.
<P>
	The Reform Party, as part of their guarantee of good government 
with changes under the system, is the right to have recall for 
members of Parliament. When MPs have violated their oath of 
office and have contravened the very things they swore they would 
uphold, citizens in that constituency should have the right, if they 
go to a certain amount of work, to have that member come back and 
stand for re-election. The way it stands now, short of murder or a 
serious criminal offence, there is no way a member of Parliament 
can lose his or her job.
<P>
	We have seen all kinds of boondoggles over the years. We have 
seen ex-MPs being charged with accepting graft or some other 
odious crime.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	A lot of that was known when they were office holders but there 
was no way for the constituents to get at that person and say: ``You 
are not doing your job. Worst yet, you have broken your oath of 
office. I demand that you come back and answer to the people''. If 
they had that opportunity, which they would have under a Reform 
government, they could ride herd on the members of Parliament. 
Members of Parliament would not have four to five years to run 
their own show, do their own thing and answer to no one. That 
would obviously be a big advantage.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I am almost out of time, other proposals that we 
have brought forward which are not part of this bill but are Reform 
Party policy include support for holding elections every four years 
at a predetermined time of the year. Another advantage of planning 
for reducing expenses and making Canadians buy into the electoral 
process is a specific length of time,  not exceeding six months, by 
which time byelections should be held for any vacant Commons 
seat. The whole issue of the funding of political parties and how 
they are funded by corporations, special interest groups and so on 
needs to be addressed as well and it is not in this bill.
<P>
	While the bill is worthy of study, and we are happy to do that in 
committee, there is much more that could be done, should be done, 
must be done and will be done under a Reform government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to make a few comments on Bill C-63 which is intended to develop 
a central electronic registry for voting purposes.
<P>
	In reviewing this legislation and in being in a briefing yesterday, 
there are a lot of things about this bill that I would like to point out, 
touch on and leave a few comments with the government on this 
issue.
<P>
	The purpose of a central registry, the overall outline and concept 
of it make a lot of sense. It can be used by federal, provincial and 
municipal governments for election purposes and also school 
boards. It would be a sharing or pooling of information. This does 
have some economic benefits and some convenience to it as well.
<P>
	It requires the consent of electors. In other words, it is voluntary. 
If an individual voter does not wish to have his or her name in the 
registry they do not have to. It does not deny the individual the 
right to vote. The current system stays in place where if they wish 
to show up on voting day with the proper identification at the 
polling booth they will be allowed to register their vote.
<P>
	Another benefit I see in this bill is the savings, which has been 
pointed out by a lot of people. In current dollars this is estimated to 
be $138 million over the next 20 years with an election every four 
years. However, even if we discount the present value it is still over 
a $100 million savings. It is definitely a plus in that category. It 
will, however, cost $41 million in the spring of 1997 to conduct one 
more door to door enumeration.
<P>
	It is also a convenience because the candidates will get their 
voters list sooner and will be able establish their budgets and 
spending limits based on the size of their constituency. They will 
also be able to get rolling 31 days before polling day versus the 
current 25 days before polling day. This would give them six days 
more to decide how and where to spend the money in order to get 
themselves elected. It also allows four extra days for the revision of 
the electoral list for errors, mistakes and moves, which will also 
help with getting out the vote.
<P>
	Another feature, which has been mentioned by other members, is 
that the voting period gets reduced from 47 days to 36 days. This is 
an interesting concept because it may cause concern for a lot of 
people. A lot of people who are interested in the political process 
believe that time is needed to explain issues. Let us look at what 
former Prime Minister Kim Campbell said during the last  election 
campaign when she claimed that there was not enough time to 
discuss social policy during the election campaign and she had 47 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5530"> 5530 </A></B>
<P>
days to do it. Therefore if 47 days is not enough time to discuss the 
major issue of social policy will 36 days be enough? We are 
reducing it by 11 days. That is an interesting concept and one that I 
think the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs will 
have to review.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It would seem to me, however, as an individual who has 
participated in one federal campaign that as we go along in the 
House issues are always percolating and being brought to the 
forefront. The basic platforms of parties become obvious and the 
party issues become relatively well known. I think most Canadian 
voters are aware of the issues.
<P>
	When it comes time when they are ready to send representatives 
to Ottawa and they elect a prime minister who becomes a dictator 
once he is in office under the current system, they at least know 
what the hot issues are. I would think that five weeks would be 
enough time for discussion and to know whether one party favours 
a tax cut or whether another party wants to increase spending, or a 
bigger government.
<P>
	I think the debate on the period we have to campaign will be 
sufficient and the issue will not be that complicated if arguments 
are positioned in a proper fashion.
<P>
	Another feature of the bill is invasion of privacy. To protect the 
privacy factor, the privacy commissioner has been consulted. This 
is a very serious matter. When information is given to Revenue 
Canada, to federal and provincial governments about the personal 
lives and personal status of voters, that should remain between the 
people and that agency or government. Cross sharing should 
require permission. When permission is given, that is fine, but 
consent must be given.
<P>
	The right to opt out of the central registry is included in the bill 
and the right to obtain that information for the registry is also in the 
bill. These are important, comfort factors that should be there.
<P>
	The legislation which will be passed on this issue will clearly 
state that the central electronic registry is simply for the purpose of 
elections, nothing else, and should not appear anywhere else. If an 
advertising groups gets hold of it or if people are harassed based on 
the information, then they can simply opt out. It would be their 
right to take their names off that central registry and it does not 
affect their right to vote. I think that is a good balance.
<P>
	Also the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Kingsley, once the bill is 
passed, may enter into extensive information lectures to educate 
and inform the Canadian public about what this really means.
<P>
	This has the somewhat conditional but more or less major 
support of all members of all parties in the standing committee. 
The Chief Electoral Officer has been communicating with 
authorities at the provincial and territorial levels and they show 
interest as well.
<P>
	This will save a lot of money and it makes a lot of sense. I 
thought the voters may be interested in hearing some of the 
dynamics of change in this country: 20 per cent of the electoral 
information changes every year; 3.2 million people move every 
year. That means they live in a different electoral boundary. 
Through this central registry, provincial governments, Revenue 
Canada, municipal governments, drivers licences, and updating the 
information will help to keep track of those moves and the 
information will be at their fingertips at election time.
<P>
	There are about 200,000 new 18-year olds who are qualified to 
vote every four or five years. Once gain, through Revenue Canada 
and drivers licences, this central registry can be updated and 
maintained.
<P>
	There are roughly about 180,000 to 200,000 new citizens which 
of course would be tracked through citizenship and immigration. 
Unfortunately deaths occur; 195,000 people pass away yearly. 
These can be obtained through provincial vital statistics and, once 
again, the central registry stays somewhat current.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	The central registry also would eliminate the cumbersome, 
expensive, door to door enumeration prior to elections. 
Enumerators come to our door for federal elections and they come 
to our door for provincial elections. I am not sure if they come to 
our door for municipal elections.
<P>
	There will be one last enumeration prior to the next election 
because we have increased the size of the House of Commons from 
295 to 301, so there will be 301 electoral boundaries. That is a 
shame in a sense. The Liberal government is once again preaching 
restraint. It is giving us lectures on how to reduce the deficit, but it 
is not attacking the real problem, which is the debt. Yet it wants to 
have bigger government. It is adding six more members of 
Parliament to the House. There will be six more backbenchers who 
will sit over there, or there will be six more opposition members 
who will sit over here, while the freely elected dictator will do what 
he wants. He runs the country the way he wants to with his small 
cabinet.
<P>
	Bigger government means a higher cost. A higher cost means 
higher taxes. That is why the government does not favour a tax cut. 
That is why the government cannot afford to give a tax cut. 
Reformers say that if we reduced the House of Commons to 250 
members and did the door to door enumeration based on 250 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5531"> 5531 </A></B>
<P>
electoral boundaries we would be better off. There would be a 
lower cost. With a lower cost we could reduce taxes. The cost of  
running government would be lower and we could lower taxes.
<P>
	Our role in opposition is to question the wisdom of government 
expansion and other pieces of legislation which it brings in which 
recommend changes in order to improve efficiency and 
effectiveness to save money. Yes, it will save $100 million over 20 
years, at a discounted value. However, each additional member of 
Parliament will cost Canadians $600,000 to $800,000. The 
government will be adding millions and millions of dollars to the 
cost. It is unfortunate that the government cannot be consistent in 
everything it does.

	Hon. members will recall that the bill amends an act which was 
last changed in 1992. Before that, however, it had taken 40 years 
before legislators were able to bring bankruptcy laws in Canada up 
to date. That is because the laws are complex and there are many 
competing interests that must be taken into account.
<P>
	When we debated this legislation on second reading we outlined 
some of the various interests that had to be considered: lenders and 
borrowers, businesses and consumers, insolvency practitioners and 
Canadian workers whose jobs may depend on effective 
reorganization provisions. These are just a few of the groups 
affected by bankruptcy law.
<P>
	I remind the House that we were able to produce a piece of 
legislation acknowledging the needs of these competing interests 
because of the input we received from the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Advisory Committee.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	This legislation was introduced last November during the last 
session as Bill C-109. In the months that have passed since then, 
insolvency practitioners and stakeholders have had a good 
opportunity to study the bill carefully and recommend ways to 
improve it.
<P>
	One indication of the quality of their advice is that the legislation 
has now come back from the Standing Committee on Industry 
ready for third reading essentially intact. There have been many 
amendments designed to tighten up the legislation and clarify its 
intent, but in its fundamentals the bill is essentially unchanged.
<P>
	The committee heard many witnesses who represented many 
different points of view. They provided advice on how to improve 
the bill, but they also agreed on the broad principles that Bill C-5 
represents. The witnesses agreed that the intent of the clauses 
contained in the legislation was excellent, but they were able to 
suggest slight changes to the wording to clarify the purpose of the 
bill. That being said, I would be the first to acknowledge that the 
bill before us is a much improved version of the bill sent to 
committee for study.
<P>
	I commend the work of the committee, chaired by the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North. Bankruptcy legislation is never easy. 
Members of the committee had to work hard to formulate the 
agreements and the compromises represented in the amendments 
before us. However, it is a tribute to the ability of all members, 
especially the chairman, to build consensus that the legislation has 
come before us in this improved form.
<P>
	In that regard I would especially like to single out the 
contributions of the member for New Westminster-Burnaby. I 
think his colleagues on the committee would join me in 
acknowledging the role he has played in ensuring this legislation 
fairly addresses the issue of sexual assault judgments.
<P>
	As a result, clause 105 has been changed. Awards of damages for 
assault are non-dischargeable in this legislation. Under the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member, this provision is 
expanded to clarify that it covers awards for intentionally inflicted 
bodily harm or sexual assault or wrongful death resulting from 
either of them.
<P>
	Another important amendment concerns clause 15 respecting 
trustee personal liability for environmental damage. The super 
priority given to claims for costs of cleaning up environmental 
damages will be limited to crown claims. The intent of the 
legislation is clearer now. It will ensure that only ministries of the 
environment and not, for example, third parties will claim super 
priority for environmental clean-up costs.
<P>
	Clause 42, affecting lease disclaimers, has been amended. The 
bill before us gives a disclaiming tenant more options in framing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5532"> 5532 </A></B>
<P>
his organizational proposal. He can now offer compensation based 
on the landlord's  actual losses in all instances. This simplifies the 
laws considerably.
<P>
	Clause 60, which involves the procedures for determining the 
surplus income of an undischarged bankrupt payable to his 
creditors, has been clarified.
<P>
	Clause 87 deals with spousal support claims. It has been 
amended so that spousal claims provable in bankruptcy are as 
specified in section 178, and that they must be pursuant to orders or 
agreements made while the spouses were living separate and apart.
<P>
	Clause 103 has been amended to clarify the responsibility on 
consumers to opt for reorganization rather than bankruptcy. By 
simply choosing bankruptcy instead of making a consumer 
proposal, the consumer should not be penalized when it comes time 
to decide whether to grant a conditional discharge. This legislation 
makes it clear that the option must be between bankruptcy and a 
viable consumer proposal.
<P>
	Several provisions of clause 118 have been clarified, including 
the definitions of ``securities firm'' and ``security''. The provision 
that specifies the type of suspension of a firm authorizing a 
securities commission, securities exchange or customer 
compensation body to petition the firm into bankruptcy has also 
been clarified. As well, the provisions have been made more clear 
on which assets are to be included in the customer pool fund and on 
how these assets are to be distributed.
<P>
	I emphasize that the amendments made by the committee do not 
undermine the fundamental principles of this legislation. For 
example, the provisions involving directors' liability remain 
fundamentally intact. It provides a due diligence defence for 
directors against civil liability. It also gives a provision whereby 
actions against directors may be stayed during reorganizations. 
Further, it provides that directors would be allowed to propose 
liability relief as an integral part of the reorganization plan 
submitted to creditors, and creditors, not governments, not the law, 
will accept or refuse to provide relief to directors.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Why are these provisions important? Because the thrust of the 
government's objectives in this framework law is to move away 
from liquidation in favour of preserving businesses and jobs. These 
provisions offer protection to board members so that they are 
encouraged not to leave the sinking ship. We want them to stay on 
to make the bold decisions to help reorganize the business.
<P>
	Other elements of the legislation relate to the insolvency of 
farmers and fishermen. At present section 48 of the BIA provides 
that an individual who is solely engaged in farming or fishing 
cannot be petitioned into bankruptcy. Recent case law has 
interpreted ``solely engaged in farming'' quite strictly. Any 
revenue which is not generated by the farm will expose a farmer to 
petitioning.
<P>
	As members of this House are well aware, to avoid insolvency 
most farmers and fishermen will turn to other means of 
employment in the off season. This is a responsible action on their 
part. The amendment in Bill C-5 restores the situation intended in 
the original legislation to protect farmers and fishermen from being 
petitioned into bankruptcy during the off season. Both the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans supported this proposed amendment.
<P>
	Bill C-5 also addresses consumer bankruptcy. It provides an 
opportunity for debtor consumers to be rehabilitated quickly and to 
act responsibly. I believe the vast majority of consumers who run 
into major financial difficulties want to fulfil their obligations. I 
am sure we all know of stories where someone has run up their 
debts and regard bankruptcy as an easy way to discharge their 
responsibility, easier that is than taking the rough measures 
necessary to pay back creditors over time.
<P>
	The legislation before us puts more pressure on debtors to 
rehabilitate. It encourages consumer debtors to act more 
responsibly by repaying at least a portion of their debts where they 
can.
<P>
	The fundamental objectives of Bill C-5 remain. We have 
reformed both corporate and consumer bankruptcy law in Canada. 
Thanks to the work of the industry committee, the bill has been 
strengthened by several technical amendments. This is good 
legislation and it deserves the support of this House. I urge all 
members to vote for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak, and, through you of course, to tell my colleagues across 
the way, particularly the member from Saskatoon, for whom I have 
great respect and with whom I had the honour to sit on the industry 
sub-committee examining Bill C-5, the bill before us today, that I 
do not entirely share his optimism.
<P>
	I must admit that while Bill C-5 meets certain requirements and 
restores certain situations, it is far from satisfying everyone. It is 
from this sort of bill that the party in power has the habit of hauling 
out vague and imprecise notions, not clearly spelled out in the text, 
when and where it suits them. The result is that we foist our 
problems off on the courts and tribunals and expect them to 
establish the jurisprudence.
<P>
	But the primary role of a legislator is to try, in good faith of 
course, to produce legislation that can be interpreted in and of 
itself. Furthermore, it is stated early on in the Interpretation Act 
passed by this Parliament a number of years ago that every 
enactment shall be given such interpretation as best ensures the 
attainment of its objects.
<P>
	This is described as being <I>sui generis</I>. Legislation must be 
interpreted with reference to its own contents. When a text is 
unintentionally ambiguous, and no one here, particularly no one in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5533"> 5533 </A></B>
<P>
this House, is above error or oversight, then the courts have a role 
to play.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	When general principles are invoked, when we ask the party in 
power what happens in a particular case, and we are told that the 
courts will decide, the courts will rule, that is just adding to the 
backlog in the courts.
<P>
	I would point out one, or a few, examples the member has just 
mentioned when, in reference to farmers and fishermen whose 
earnings come primarily from their agricultural or fishing activity, 
he said that they could not be declared bankrupt. That is what the 
bill says. However, if in the winter, for example, farmers, and I 
know some in my riding who do this, have large equipment and 
take contracts to remove snow from shopping centres, they 
therefore have an activity allowing them to keep operating, so to 
speak, and to get through the winter without doing too badly 
economically. Since they are then earning income from an activity 
other than farming, could they be declared bankrupt?
<P>
	The member from Saskatoon tells us they cannot, or maybe, if 
the courts hold that the activity is not strictly related to farming. Or 
at least that is what I understood. But the fact remains that it is still 
the court that will decide. When new legislation is drafted, there is 
an attempt to include prior trends in jurisprudence, not to produce a 
legislative text that is often unclear and makes a further ruling 
necessary.
<P>
	That is what I object to generally in this bill, some of whose 
principles, however, I find acceptable. An effort could have been 
made, in committee, if members of the party in power on the 
committee had had the latitude to accept the obvious. Not at all. To 
change even a comma, committee members know they have to 
refer to the minister who tabled the bill. Even in the case of a 
particularly obvious mistake, if they happen to be members of the 
party in power and sit on a committee where that party has the 
majority, they first have to refer to the minister and tell him: ``Now, 
the members of the opposition want to change this comma. They 
may be right. We think they are right''. They do not say yes. They 
cannot do that on their own. That is what is so frustrating in 
committee. We saw this many times during consideration of Bill 
C-5 by the industry subcommittee.
<P>
	A number of stakeholders appeared before the committee at that 
time. We could name the whole range of socio-economic and social 
stakeholders, on the right as well as on the left. Everyone came to 
defend their particular points of law. And most people were struck 
by the ambiguous treatment in Bill C-5 of the nature of duties of a 
bankruptcy trustee.
<P>
	Many people told us that more often than not, the trustee had a 
conflict of interest. I may add that these were people with a certain 
reputation, university professors from the University of Toronto, 
for instance, and people from across Canada. Even bankruptcy and 
insolvency experts came and told us the bill was in many cases 
sending contradictory signals, thus putting a trustee appointed to 
oversee a bankruptcy in a very awkward position. Quite often, his 
duties were not clear-cut.
<P>
	The first Bankruptcy Act-as it was called at the time-which 
was passed in 1949, started by providing that the trustee 
represented the creditors. His role was clear. His role was defined. 
There was no problem: he represented all creditors.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In 1992, with the tabling of this new bill on bankruptcy and 
insolvency, which became the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the 
trustee's role became a little more ambiguous. The trustee 
represented in certain cases the mass of creditors and acted on the 
advice of the inspectors, but he also had to consider certain 
dispositions that might benefit the trustee himself or his family. It 
is not immoral, and it is not unthinkable, that the trustee could, and 
I think it was good legislation, represent both the creditors and the 
bankrupt.
<P>
	However, it would have been even better if the legislation had 
contained a provision saying that the trustee was a public officer, 
like a notary in Quebec or like a surveyor-they have those in other 
provinces too. When a surveyor surveys a property, he does not 
work for the benefit of the person who is paying him but to 
establish the truth, the real state of affairs. He draws lines where 
they should be drawn, even if he would rather not, even if he would 
rather help his client. Under the legislation that regulates his 
profession, in Quebec and elsewhere, he is obliged to be neutral. 
Therefore, he assumes impartiality.
<P>
	In Quebec, notaries conclude transactions. They represent 
neither party and I know something about this, since it happens to 
be my profession. He does not represent either of the parties 
involved. His duty to be neutral is part of his code of ethics. The 
trustee is careful about that, and if a notary-this does not happen 
often, thank goodness-fails to be impartial, the order would 
intervene and make him realize he should not benefit either 
contracting party, but maintain a strictly neutral position.
<P>
	That is what I would have liked to see in Bill C-5. Of course, that 
required the minister's permission. I am not even sure if committee 
members went to see the minister, but I will not question their good 
faith. Let us assume they went to see him, but nothing happened 
and clause 13 or 14, I think, was left unchanged.
<P>
	Other provisions in this bill could have been amended. A case in 
point in clause 13.4. The CNTU opened our eyes in this regard 
when it presented its brief. Clause 13.4 in this bill reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5534"> 5534 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) No trustee shall, while acting as the trustee of an estate, act for or assist a secured 
creditor of the estate to assert any claim against the estate or to realize or otherwise deal 
with the security that the secured creditor holds-</BLOCKQUOTE>
And here is the hitch:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-unless the trustee has obtained a written opinion of a solicitor who does not act 
for the secured creditor that the security is valid and enforceable as against the 
estate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The CNTU told us, either one is neutral or one is not. You can 
see the kind of message that is being conveyed to the trustee. We 
made representations when we asked questions, when we discussed 
among ourselves. We said: ``Why not accept reality?'' If a secured 
creditor in a bankruptcy case feels wronged, he can appeal to 
regular law courts, to the civil courts in his province or, in case of 
fraud, file a complaint under criminal law.
<P>
	But why should the trustee be given the message that, yes he is 
neutral, but not exactly, if he has obtained a legal opinion? We saw 
what happened in the case of Mr. Sirois, who prepared the 1992 act. 
He went totally bankrupt, and we then realized that the very father 
of the bill that became law was not beyond reproach. It was easy at 
the time to take him to task, at least for his vested interests.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	This should be avoided, we told the party in power. They then do 
everything that follows from this. As the hon. member for 
Saskatoon clearly explained, the bankruptcy act makes it possible 
for someone to get a fresh start after a financial misadventure or 
misfortune, the kind of thing that can happen in life. But in doing 
this, we sometimes fail to realize that we are penalizing ourselves 
in another respect.
<P>
	Let us take for example clause 14.7, I think, which provides that 
the money needed to remedy any environmental damage to the land 
must come from the bankrupt individual's general assets. I asked 
that specific question of experts and professors from a Toronto 
university who testified before the committee, and nowhere in this 
clause is it said that the trustee acting in a bankruptcy case who 
faces decontamination expenses must recover the money from the 
proceeds of the sale or resale of the contaminated building. 
Nowhere in this bill is it specified that the money must come from 
there. It can come from other sources. The trustee may liquidate 
assets, sell the car, the house, anything, and use this money to 
decontaminate the land.
<P>
	A priority may be applied to the real property in question, and 
this is a fact, as provided for in section 14.7, which takes 
precedence over any existing rank of hypothec under civil or 
provincial law and the trustee may assert his decontamination 
claim that way. This is allowed, there is a statutory warranty on 
that. But the money does not have to come from there; it can come 
from elsewhere.
<P>
	So, it would not be unthinkable, especially on the basis of clause 
13.4 regarding the secured creditor, which I referred to earlier, 
since the trustee's decontamination claim will take precedence over 
that of the secured creditor, that, if they are on good terms and do 
not hate each other too much, the trustee may be tempted to say: 
``Very well, I will have the land and surrounding property 
decontaminated, but the funds required will be taken from the body 
of realized claims. I will pay for decontamination out of there''. 
The secured creditor is happy. Because of his rank of hypothec, he 
gets his decontaminated property back, free from everything, and 
realizes the security. He can resell it, recouping his equity, his 
mortgage. Of course, good faith must always be presumed, and you 
can vouch, Mr. Speaker, for that fact that everyone here is acting in 
good faith.
<P>
	But this can nevertheless invite criticism, raise suspicion, lead to 
questions. One wonders why the wording is not clearer, and why 
the trustee is not required to recoup his decontamination costs on 
the property in question first. I am trying to understand why. 
Sometimes, what appears to be a good turn can have unforeseen 
negative effects.
<P>
	Take section 14.7 for example and this creditor that has a 
mortgage on a property, or is not yet a creditor. Let us say I want to 
start up a business, or young people want to start a business on the 
premises of which chemicals, not necessarily highly toxic 
chemicals, will be processed. There will be a potential 
environmental impact involved.
<P>
	We would go to our bank manager and ask him to lend us money 
so that we can buy the property on which we want to build our pork 
manure treatment plant or whatever. The creditors will say they do 
not want to have anything to do with that because dangerous 
substances are involved. They will argue that, should our business 
fail and the property have to be resold for them to realize their 
mortgage security, they will first have to have it decontaminated 
and that could cost a pretty penny. Hence their unwillingness to 
lend money.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The idea was to recover for decontamination, but-and this is 
not from me but from various financial interests who came and told 
the committee-lenders will be much more cautious when lending 
money to businesses that could handle toxic materials. It is 
believed that it will now be almost impossible to finance a gas 
station. No one will want to lend money to a gas station, unless the 
major companies-and this is surely what will happen, since they 
provide the raw materials such as gas, oil, etc.-are prepared to 
finance their franchisees.
<P>
	The mechanic interested in opening up an independent service 
station will have a hard time getting financing. A good intention 
may end up having perverse effects. We have to seriously think 
about this. A number of stakeholders came before the committee 
and said:  ``This clause 14.7 scares us''. Several asked that it be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5535"> 5535 </A></B>
<P>
removed or at least that some guidelines be provided, because it 
does not affect only the contaminated land, but also the adjacent 
lots and those connected to the operation.
<P>
	The lots connected to the operation are not necessarily the ones 
immediately adjacent to it. It could be a lot located further away. It 
could even be a lot located in another community. It could be the 
site of the head office. This becomes dangerous. It is dangerous for 
the person who lent money for the head office lot, and for the one 
who lent money for the lot where the economic and business 
operations of the company take place.
<P>
	There is another thing which really bothers me as a Quebecer 
and which I find very hard to accept. I tried to stress it in 
committee. I was told this is not an amendment to the bill that was 
introduced. I did not agree, but I did not argue more than necessary, 
because they formed the majority. However, I want to raise the 
issue here.
<P>
	In committee, we realized that, to a large extent, the assets that 
can be seized and those that cannot depend on provincial 
legislatures, because they determine what assets can be seized or 
not. For example, we know that in Ontario homesteads are 
unseizable. From what I understand, because I am not very familiar 
with the Ontario land register, a homestead is a farm that has been 
owned by a family for generations. It is unseizable and its value can 
be very high. In Ontario, someone who becomes bankrupt can have 
his or her homestead worth half a million or a million dollars 
exempt from seizure.
<P>
	In other provinces, the value of the property liable to seizure is 
pretty high. In some provinces, it is much lower. For example, in 
the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure, in the former section 553 I 
think, the value of the property not liable to seizure was set at 
around $2,000. In order to respect the provincial areas of 
jurisdiction, the bankruptcy act had always gone by these classes of 
property exempt from seizure.
<P>
	This is why section 49 of the former act and sections 93(1) and 
(2) of the new act, provided and still provide that any settlement in 
consideration of a marriage-and when we talk about marriage, we 
are talking about a provincial area of jurisdiction-published and 
made before the marriage, because it often takes the form of a 
donation between spouses at the time of the marriage, is not void 
and cannot be revised. This is still the case.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Except that paragraph 177(<I>a</I>) of the current act that is being 
amended by clause 104 of the bill stipulates that, in the case of a 
bankrupt who has abided by section 93, an order of discharge will 
be refused. Pursuant to paragraph 177(<I>a</I>), an order of discharge can 
be refused and conditions can be set.
<P>
	I do not understand. How can someone act legally pursuant to 
section 93 and be treated as if he or she broke the law under section 
177(<I>a</I>)? We are directly infringing upon provincial areas of 
jurisdiction: civil law, marriage, marriage contracts. People are 
told: ``You have abided by the provincial legislation, we know it, so 
there was no fraud. However, as far as we are concerned, if you 
want to be discharged, we will set more expensive conditions than 
if you had not respected the provincial legislation and if you had 
not benefitted from the legislation in force in your province''.
<P>
	This is sheer nonsense. This is just one example. The hon. 
member for Saskatoon-Dundurn, to whom I have mentioned this 
problem in committee, did not answer me directly-he was sitting 
with me on the committee-but the chairman told me than 
repealing section 177(<I>a</I>) made no sense and did not come under the 
purview of our committee, but I still have my doubts about that.
<P>
	I would also have liked to put forward other amendments in 
committee. When I think about Bill C-5, I would have liked to see, 
after subsection 90(1), a new subsection 90(2) that would have 
amended paragraph 136(1)(<I>d</I>) of the existing act to raise the value 
of non-seizable assets from $2,000 to $3,653. And I will explain 
why, because this figure has not just come out of the blue.
<P>
	In 1949, 47 years ago, when the first Bankruptcy Act was 
introduced, the value of non-seizable assets was $500. With 
inflation, what was worth $500 in 1949 is now worth $3,653. I am 
not talking about improving the fate of the bankrupt, but if we want 
to give the bankrupt the same level of protection, the value of 
non-seizable assets in section 136 should be raised from $2,000 to 
$3,653, an amendment that was moved in committee but was 
defeated. Do not ask me why, I have no idea. But this refusal was 
certainly not dictated by common sense. That much I know.
<P>
	We saw that all amendments to the bill that made sense were 
systematically refused when they came from an opposition 
member sitting on the committee. It is unfortunate because, right 
now, the Bankruptcy Act is a source of problems, questions and 
bitterness for creditors as well as for bankrupts.
<P>
	Often, following their generally recognized principles, the 
Liberals put forward ideas that are sometimes eccentric, include 
them in a bill and say: ``We have fulfilled our red book promise and 
now we will let the courts decide''. I think the Liberals are blatantly 
misusing their parliamentary majority, as they have always done. 
When, as legal practitioners or as experts in this field, we proposed 
amendments to correct certain contradictions such as those in 
sections 93 and 177, we were told that it is not within the 
committee's mandate. My colleagues who sit on other committees 
tell me that it is almost always the same.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5536"> 5536 </A></B>
<P>
	The government wants to hold the opposition in check no matter 
if it is right or wrong. It will stick to its bill and will not budge, 
except for obvious punctuation mistakes, or should I say without 
being disrespectful to the House, for trifling matters.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	In my view, they have missed a great opportunity to do 
something productive about bankruptcy and insolvency. They 
could have tried to make people a bit happier.
<P>
	There is poverty in Montreal. It is said that Montreal is the 
poorest region in Canada, that it has the highest rate of poverty 
right now. It is also the city with the greatest numbers of homeless 
people, a happy bunch according to the Prime Minister, who would 
prefer to be on the move and sleeping outdoors, often in a puddle, 
that in an institution being treated for schizophrenia or other 
similar ailments. The Prime Minister told us that he has spoken to 
them and that they are perfectly happy. But there are also people 
who are not homeless, who honour their obligations, in so far as 
their incomes permit, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to do 
so because they are unemployed, not something the government 
has knocked itself out finding a solution to so far.
<P>
	As well, some people are casualties of the economy. I have had 
visits from people in their fifties, in charge of human resources in a 
very large company that merged. From $100,000 a year, they have 
found themselves on welfare, after selling their homes and 
spending the proceeds. This is happening now to a great many 
people, people who used to live with dignity and earned a good 
living.
<P>
	You have all undoubtedly seen the American movie about the 
electrician with a wife and two children who loses his job. Finding 
himself unemployed, he puts off paying his fire insurance. And 
since misery always plagues the poor, his home burns down. He 
moves to another city in search of work, and finds a part time job, a 
few hours a week, which does not even cover his move. To make a 
long story short, we see him at the end of the movie reduced to 
living with his wife and two children in the basement of an 
uninhabited and condemned building, in with rats and mouldering 
boxes, stuck with no hope for the future. The movie ends with the 
reminder that in the United States there are three million 
Americans living in similar situations, situations we are now 
beginning to see in Canada.
<P>
	I know people who were once proud, who used to have good 
jobs. Times got tough and they found themselves on welfare, which 
is shrinking with decreasing transfer payments, which means they 
will be even more destitute. The homeless will not just be happy 
schizophrenics, as the Prime Minister was saying, but people who 
have gone from a life of dignity to one of extreme poverty. We will 
see more and more of this in Canada.
<P>
	This government has no compassion for the dignity of these 
people. Right now, $2,000 will buy, for a family with four children, 
not much more than sheets, beds, pillowcases, and certainly not a 
large refrigerator and a small, two-burner, 110 amp hotplate. That 
is about as far as it will stretch.
<P>
	I find it hard to believe that people are using bankruptcy to their 
benefit. There is a tendency to blame them, to view them in a 
critical light, but in reality do they have a choice? They have only 
one life to live, as do we all, and they realize that, unless they take a 
risk, unless they go out on a limb, they will have spent their lives in 
poverty and misery.
<P>
	This is what the bill could have tried to address, but once again, 
they have failed. It is for this reason that my party and I will be 
voting against this bill.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to comment on Bill C-5, an act to amend the Bankruptcy 
and Insolvency Act, the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act 
and the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Many provisions in Bill C-5 are commendable but this 
legislation could have been greatly improved if more Reform 
amendments had been accepted by the Standing Committee on 
Industry. Before I discuss the positive provisions of Bill C-5, 
however, and how Reform is willing to help to improve the bill, I 
will comment on the general state of bankruptcy in Canada.
<P>
	Bankruptcy is a very serious problem in our country. Consumer 
bankruptcies have soared in the past 10 years from approximately 
20,000 in 1986 to a new record of over 60,000 in 1995. Sadly, 
analysts estimate that Canada is heading for another record level of 
bankruptcies in 1996 as there have been 46,827 consumer and 
business failures so far this year across the country. That is up from 
37,937 in the same period in 1995. I repeat that bankruptcy is a 
very serious problem across Canada.
<P>
	Why are consumers and businesses failing financially? The 
answer can be found in a recent report by Industry Canada. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bankruptcies are a critical indicator of the country's economic health and at the 
same time the key indicator of the economic difficulty facing individuals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government study goes on to point out that high 
unemployment is the main reason for bankruptcy rates. When 
people have jobs they can pay their debts. When they do not have 
jobs they cannot pay their debts. It is that simple. Therefore, the 
way to help people stay solvent is to give them jobs. I know that 
members opposite understand this very simple equation. I also 
know that members opposite probably do not want to see 
Canadians go bankrupt. Why are members opposite not doing 
something to help create jobs in the country?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5537"> 5537 </A></B>
<P>
	On October 15 the Prime Minister said: ``Canadians don't need 
to read my lips, they can read our record''. Let us read that record 
today. There are 1.4 million people presently unemployed; two 
million to three million people are underemployed; four million 
workers are worried about losing their jobs and it is the longest 
stretch of unemployment above 9 per cent since the great 
depression. It has been like that for a long, long time and it has 
not been addressed by the government.
<P>
	The Liberals would have us believe they have a plan to create 
jobs but we have not seen one. The finance minister's message to 
Canadians is that low interest rates are the best medicine for the 
economy. Despite the lowest interest rates in years, unemployment 
increased last month from 9.4 per cent to 9.9 per cent. It is quite 
clear you cannot push the economy up a hill with interest rates. 
There must be income growth and job growth.
<P>
	On top of giving Canadians high unemployment, the Liberals 
have dished out more pain through social program cuts. They have 
cut transfer payments by 40 per cent. They have cut health care 
payments by $3 billion. They have cut benefits to seniors. They are 
dismantling social programs to pay the interest on the $600 billion 
federal debt. All Canadians receive from the Liberals is pain and 
pain and more pain, not jobs, jobs and more jobs.
<P>
	To create jobs and reduce bankruptcy rates the government must 
reduce taxes. A reduction in taxes means more money in the 
pockets of consumers, small business people and investors. 
Consumers that spend more money will create the permanent well 
paying jobs that Canadians needs. What consumers need is a tax 
cut, not another interest rate cut.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	As far as I know there are no provisions in Bill C-5 that would 
directly create jobs in this country. There are, however, some 
commendable aspects of this legislation which I will discuss next.
<P>
	First, in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act spouses are not 
considered creditors for the purpose of proving claims for spousal 
and child support in bankruptcy proceedings. Bill C-5 would 
amend the act so that claims for spousal and child support accrued 
in the year before the bankruptcy took place would be claims 
provable in bankruptcy proceedings.
<P>
	This means that a person who is receiving support payments 
from a bankrupt individual who is in arrears in his or her payments 
will be treated as a preferred creditor in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Ranking spousal and child support claims as preferred claims is a 
positive amendment to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
<P>
	Second, clause 93 of Bill C-5 amends paragraph 157.1(1)(b) to 
extend the range of persons for whom the trustee may arrange 
counselling. Counselling may now be arranged for those persons 
who are financially associated with the bankrupt person. This 
means that not only can the bankrupt person be given professional 
help so that he or she does not become bankrupt again, but others 
such as common law spouses can also receive counselling.
<P>
	Third, paragraph 105.2 of Bill C-5 makes student loan debts 
non-dischargeable where the bankrupt has ceased being a full time 
or part time student or within two years of ending their studies. 
This clause means that people can no longer graduate, declare 
bankruptcy and then walk away from their student loans. Bill C-5 
would close a major loophole in the BIA which costs the federal 
government $60 million a year.
<P>
	Some people argue this amendment is unfair because most 
students declare bankruptcy out of need rather than for 
convenience. They also assert that students must have the right to 
be discharged from all of their debts when they declare bankruptcy. 
Both of these arguments may have some substance but we all have 
an obligation to pay our debts.
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-5 recognizes that students may experience 
genuine economic hardship and it allows a student loan debt to be 
discharged after two years where the bankrupt has acted in good 
faith and is experiencing financial difficulty. This is a fair and 
equitable position.
<P>
	I have just discussed three positive provisions of Bill C-5. There 
are more but the most laudable sections of Bill C-5 are those that 
were amended by my hon. colleague from New 
Westminster-Burnaby, clauses 1 and 105.
<P>
	The amendments made to these clauses by my hon. colleague 
provide greater protection to the victims of crime. Under the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, criminal offenders could be 
released from having to pay damages arising from assault which 
have been awarded in a civil suit when they declare bankruptcy.
<P>
	With my colleague's amendments to Bill C-5 an order of 
discharge does not release the bankrupt from any award of damages 
by a court in civil proceedings in respect of bodily harm 
intentionally inflicted or sexual assault or wrongful death resulting 
therefrom. With these amendments victims of crime now have 
greater protection.
<P>
	I have outlined many of the commendable provisions of Bill C-5. 
Overall it is a good piece of legislation but, as I have mentioned, it 
could have been even better if the Standing Committee on Industry 
would have accepted all of the Reform amendments.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	For example, Reform proposed that Bill C-5, in clause 6, be 
amended by replacing the word ``may'' on line 12 with the word 
``shall''. In this instance the Superintendent of Bankruptcy has too 
much discretionary power. It is only fair that when applicants for 
trustee licences meet the superintendent's criteria  they should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5538"> 5538 </A></B>
<P>
issued the licence. It should not be up to the superintendent's 
discretion.
<P>
	An argument against our amendment came from the hon. 
parliamentary secretary. He said that the inclusion of such words as 
``shall'' creates nothing but an increase in the size of the 
bureaucracy necessary to administer the act. I do not know how this 
can be possible. It seems to me that our amendment would decrease 
bureaucratic activity.
<P>
	Exchanging words such as ``may'' with ``shall'' reduces the 
amount of consideration the superintendent must give a trustee 
application. For example, if an applicant meets the criteria set out 
by the superintendent a licence is issued. The superintendent does 
not have to think about whether the licence should be issued after 
an applicant meets the criteria. Bureaucracy is reduced, not 
increased.
<P>
	The Superintendent of Bankruptcy also opposed our amendment. 
He said: ``Mr. Chairman, the issuance of a licence requires an 
individual assessment or evaluation of the character, the 
competence and qualifications of the individual. The other thing 
that may not always set out criteria are grounds of public interest, 
which may not all be spelled out specifically. All the criteria 
require a level of appreciation, a level of discretion in the decision 
of issuing the licence. Some of the criteria may, by itself, require 
the use of some discretion''.
<P>
	By the superintendent's response we can see that the word 
``may'' actually allows a certain element of capriciousness to enter 
into the issuing of trustee licences. This should not be the case. 
There should be no avenues for acts of favouritism in any 
legislation.
<P>
	The superintendent should follow a specific and objective set of 
criteria in issuing licences. If an applicant meets the criteria the 
licence must be issued. There should be no discretionary power 
given to the superintendent.
<P>
	I have been hearing lately that the granting of discretionary 
power is becoming a favourite activity of the government. For 
example, a few weeks ago a lawyer who works closely with federal 
government legislation told me that he has seen the government use 
the word ``may'' to replace the word ``shall'', which we just talked 
about, and the phrase ``in the opinion of the minister'' more often 
than ever before. Why is this the case? Why is the government 
placing more discretionary power than ever before in the hands of 
the minister and government appointees?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Partisan politics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Partisan politics, my friend says. I certainly 
agree.
<P>
	As I pointed out earlier, too much discretionary power in the 
hands of one person leads to abuse. When the phrase ``in the 
opinion of the minister'' is used in  legislation, ministers can make 
any kind of decision they want. There are no guidelines. There are 
no written rules to follow.
<P>
	Using these kinds of words in legislation takes away the 
certainty that all Canadians will be treated fairly and equally. 
Therefore I urge the government to stop using language in 
legislation which increases the amount of discretionary power 
which is placed in the hands of cabinet ministers and government 
officials. That much power in the hands of one individual is not 
necessary; in fact, it can be very harmful.
<P>
	A second proposed Reform amendment rejected by the 
government was changing lines 31 to 41 on page 8 of the bill. Our 
amendment would have greatly improved Bill C-5. It would have 
allowed creditors to be treated more fairly during the trustee 
investigation process.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	For example, the way Bill C-5 is presently worded, requirement 
to pay restitution is only an option that the superintendent may 
chose to apply when the trustee has defrauded an estate. In our 
opinion, it is only fair that a trustee be required to pay restitution in 
all cases where necessary. If a trustee has defrauded an estate in any 
way the superintendent must order the trustee to pay restitution to 
the creditor. Our amendment would have given the superintendent 
no discretionary power in this situation. Reform would have 
secured greater fairness for the creditor.
<P>
	In closing, I want to reiterate that bankruptcy is a major problem 
in Canada. The way to help those who are bankrupt and in fact all 
Canadians is to balance the budget and then reduce taxes. Giving 
people back the money that they earned will increase spending 
which in turn will create jobs. Canadians with jobs can pay their 
bills and pay off their loans.
<P>
	Bill C-5 has many positive provisions, the most important 
sections being the ones amended by my hon. colleague from New 
Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	Also, Bill C-5 could have been a greatly improved piece of 
legislation. Reform offered several amendments that would have 
made the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act a fairer and more just 
piece of legislation, but our suggestions were rejected.
<P>
	Nevertheless, Reform will still support the passing of Bill C-5 
through the House. We will also continue to make further 
recommendations to improve the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
When it comes up for review at a later time we will be there.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move to the 
next stage of debate where members' interventions will be limited 
to a maximum of 20 minutes subject to 10 minutes questions or 
comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5539"> 5539 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to enter the debate on Bill C-5, an amendment to 
the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Companies' Creditors 
Arrangement Act.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that changing both these acts is an 
ongoing process. The minister, along with his officials, consulted 
very extensively on the insolvency business in Canada over a long 
period of time. All those consultations with stakeholders have 
come together and basically formulated this act. I believe it was an 
amendment by the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
which was accepted by the committee.
<P>
	I sit on that committee and there were almost 100 amendments 
made to this piece of legislation. It is something that the 
government initiated, industry has been involved in and something 
that all parties have participated in.
<P>
	I would like to discuss some specific aspects of the bill but also a 
general concept of bankruptcies. The previous speaker mentioned 
rising consumer bankruptcies and he could not be more correct. I 
have a statement here showing that in January total business and 
personal bankruptcies were 7,320 compared to only 5,000 for the 
previous year. In February the total bankruptcies were 7,947 
compared to only 5,900 for the previous year. In March the total 
was 7,775 compared to 7,100. We can see that there is no question 
that there is a trend line and it is upwards. A huge portion of this is 
consumer bankruptcies.
<P>
	I also listen to the Reform Party from time to time talking about 
tax cuts and how it would stimulate demand. I would like to point 
out why I do not believe tax cuts would do that. The bottom line is 
that consumers are living in a sea of debt. As governments back in 
the 1980s and earlier did not match their spending with their 
income, neither have individuals.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	It causes me great pain when I talk to some of the people in my 
riding who have mortgages on their houses and consumer debts 
well in excess of their ability to pay for them. Often those 
mortgages are well in excess of the value of the properties. There 
are many people who are caught up in a debt spiral. They are two 
income families and hardly ever see their kids. Some people work 
shifts and hardly ever see each other. They are caught in that debt 
spiral and are not breaking out of it.
<P>
	As a government we should be concerned about how that 
happened and what it means to the future. It will have a big impact 
on our policy directions here in Ottawa.
<P>
	Another indication of this problem is the rise in the percentage of 
disposable income which is allocated to fixed debt payments. By 
disposable income I mean the amount of the take home cheque 
after taxes have been deducted. The percentage of that income 
which is now allocated to fixed debts in Canada has risen 
dramatically.
<P>
	In 1980 the figure was 71 per cent, in 1981, 65 per cent. By 1989 
it was up to 74 per cent; in 1990, 80 per cent; in 1992, 85 per cent; 
1993, 88 per cent; 1995, 93 per cent; and in the second quarter of 
1996, 94.3 per cent. This is a clear indication that there is a 
problem. There is rising personal debt and people are caught on a 
treadmill trying to get out of this.
<P>
	It shows up in many other areas of our economy. I saw an article 
in the newspaper today about consumer retail sales for this 
Christmas. A survey done by Arthur Andersen basically shows a 
lack of optimism. Retailers do not believe they are going to have a 
very good Christmas this year. That is part and parcel of the same 
problem.
<P>
	For registered retirement savings plans, while last year was a 
good one in quantum, in fact the percentage of people who had 
available funds relative to their income to contribute to RRSPs 
went down. In other words people are saying that they do not have 
any money.
<P>
	Bad debt losses in Canada relative to consumer debt are rising. 
Some people do not think that is alarming, but in Canada that 
represents 1 per cent. In other words 1 per cent of total consumer 
credit card debts outstanding every year are delinquent.
<P>
	Some people like to look at the United States to see certain 
future trends. In the United States consumer debt delinquencies are 
now up to 5.7 per cent. It has become a whole business on how to 
deal with debt in that country. It should also be noted that the banks 
are getting out of the debt business directly. They have actually 
been able to factor out their consumer card business. In other 
words, they create the debt and then they factor it out to other 
companies to collect it.
<P>
	Industries are popping up in the United States finding different 
and intrinsic ways of getting people into debt. There are credit card 
companies that deal almost exclusively with the poor, people who 
are high credit risks. Do we do that in Canada?
<P>
	I am amazed when our young people show up at university or 
community colleges and one of the first things put into their hands 
is a consumer kit. This so-called consumer kit is a composite of 5 
or 10 credit cards, one from a bank and others usually from a 
number of retail stores and gasoline companies. These people have 
very low earning power.
<P>
	I am not saying that university students are incompetent or 
unable to deal with their debt and deficit problems. However, it is 
clear when we talk to credit counsellors that it is a rising problem in 
this town. They tell us that the percentage of university students 
coming through their doors for their counselling services is rising.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5540"> 5540 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	What are our institutions doing to be responsible for creating this 
problem? General Motors is a big feature in my riding. I am hoping 
very much that they will get back to work pretty soon. It has a 
tremendous impact on business in Durham.
<P>
	Be that as it may, another interesting observation from General 
Motors in its marketing procedures is that its market in Canada is 
shrinking, as car markets generally in Canada are shrinking. Not 
only are they shrinking but the type of cars Canadian consumers are 
buying is significantly different from what they were buying even 
10 years ago. They are smaller dollar purchase items, even 
compared to their American cousins to the south.
<P>
	We are seeing a tendency where people have less liquidity, less 
ability to consume. I suspect if there are tax cuts, and the province 
of Ontario has already done that, I do not see any change in 
consumer demand. The bottom line is those people will take the 
money, and justifiably so, and pay it against the debts they already 
have.
<P>
	I should bring to the fore the recent report of the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions. This gentleman's job is to 
supervise financial institutions. His report is very interesting. In it 
he states that levels of household debt reached an all time high in 
1995-96 but they have not appeared to have plateaued. Both 
consumer and business bankruptcies increased in 1995. Mortgage 
and credit cards at real levels, though low in his estimation, began 
to climb. Despite improving profitability and capital levels, and he 
is talking about financial institutions, the risk profiles of some 
financial institutions increased as they expanded beyond their core 
activities into new lines of business.
<P>
	I suggest that those new lines of business are consumer credit 
and also paper currency transactions, derivative markets and so 
forth. I will get to that later in my dissertation.
<P>
	Some of the macroeconomics belie the real problem that lies 
beneath these statistics. We have an intergenerational problem. 
Almost 33 per cent of our population is now considered to be baby 
boomers. I suggest that the baby boomers in some small way are 
consumed out. They may well have had their two cars in their 
driveway. They already have a television, a VCR and all the good 
stuff that goes with the good life. The bottom line is they do not 
really need a lot more. They may even have their houses paid off.
<P>
	There is another group whom I would consider above middle 
income, maybe around 35 years old who are basically on the debt 
treadmill. Also the younger generation coming behind that group 
seems to be copying the same basic tendency.
<P>
	This bill talks about Canada student loans. The Government of 
Canada has over $1 billion in defaulted  student loans. 
Undoubtedly some abuse is taking place where people declare 
bankruptcy so they can wipe off their loans before they start to 
work. This bill deals with that problem. It requires a two year stay 
prior to those people declaring bankruptcy. If within that two year 
period they have a job and so forth, they are able to pay off the debt 
and well they should.
<P>
	The issue is somewhat larger than the bill actually deals with. 
That is, why is it that these young people are being persuaded into 
debt which they basically cannot sustain? It is not just student 
loans. It is also the consumer credit card. What is wrong with 
consumer credit cards? Absolutely nothing. If you want to give 
your daughter a credit card so she can come home on the weekends 
from university and she just uses it for that, you pay it off, fine, it is 
a convenience.
<P>
	Most people see us moving toward a cashless society with more 
convenience in business transactions. I applaud that. I do not think 
I have actually stood in front of a teller in about a year and a half. 
Some people still like standing in line and talking to people in their 
communities and I understand that issue as well. For a lot of people 
it is a convenience and financial institutions are addressing some of 
that demand, but along with that, we are developing a second 
scenario.
<P>
	People are being constantly pushed more and more into living 
beyond their means, quite frankly. They are told that they can do 
this, that all they have to do is have a credit card. The question is, 
do lending institutions check for total credit exposure? What do I 
mean by that?
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	That credit card chit I talked about probably gave the individual 
up to $800 worth of credit. It does not take a lot of intuitiveness to 
see that if you pay your $20 a month, you can probably jump that 
up and keep on jumping it up. Worse than that, within the credit 
industry there does not seem to be a system of cross-checks in this 
country. In other words, it is possible for that student to get 
$10,000, $15,000 or $20,000, way beyond their ability to pay 
without a lot of checks going on within the financial institution 
structure itself.
<P>
	What do the banks do in a situation like that? They say: ``Well 
that is too bad. I guess that is one we lost on. We will just charge 
that to the good customers''. It is incredible to watch the deviation 
in interest rates between the prime bank lending rate and credit 
cards.
<P>
	Industry Canada put out a statement for the month of September. 
The spread between the Bank of Canada credit card rate, currently 
4.25 per cent, and the sample VISA card tracked by Industry 
Canada has continued to increase on average since 1994. We all 
know that interest rates have been declining. It is currently 13.25 
percentage points compared to its average of 8.9 per cent, the 
difference between the prime bank lending rate and what people are 
being charged on their credit cards. The spreads between the bank 
rate and standard rates presently range between 11.65 and 14.65 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5541"> 5541 </A></B>
<P>
points while the spread between the bank rate and the retail card 
rate is 24.55 per cent.
<P>
	What am I saying? Basically, interest rates are going down and 
the actual credit card costs are going up. How do banks explain that 
to the public? They explain it by saying they have rising consumer 
bankruptcies. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy. They advanced more 
money. They did not really spend a lot of time on how they 
advanced it because they wanted to get that interest rate up there to 
pump the bottom line showing an increased profitability. At the 
same time, when they take a hit on it, they apply it to everybody 
and charge them more interest.
<P>
	It is a great system, but it is not in the best interests of the 
consuming public. I do not think it is in the best interests of public 
policy.
<P>
	Some of the European countries deal with this. In some of the 
European countries, if there is a credit card default and it can be 
proved that they did not check with other institutions to see the 
total quantum of debt, they cannot collect it. In other words, we 
should be taking those debts off the bottom line of those banks, not 
allowing them to charge them within the interest rate structure 
where everybody pays for them. That would do a lot to reduce the 
number of bankruptcies in Canada.
<P>
	We want financial institutions to take responsibility for the 
lending that they make. It is not good enough just to take a shotgun 
approach to the industry and say: ``Who cares about any of those 
who fall by the wayside? We are going to get the other guys to pay 
for them and we will still make lots of money''. This is what is 
wrong with the banking industry in Canada.
<P>
	One of my major interests here is small and medium size 
businesses. We all know that small and medium size businesses 
have complained constantly about their ability to access credit. 
Someone who has a good idea goes to the bank. The bank says it is 
not interested because that person is a small business operator. This 
has improved marginally but not very significantly.
<P>
	I note that the banks are coming before us again with their 
quarterly statistical report. There has not been in quantum much 
change in the total amounts of money advanced to small and 
medium size business.
<P>
	More remarkable, a study which the banks themselves had done 
trying to show how effectively they were dealing with small and 
medium size businesses identified that 44 per cent of all small 
business operators look on consumer credit card debt as a source of 
financing for their businesses. That is profound. In other words, 
people who cannot get normal bank loans to run their business are 
having to run it up on consumer card debt.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	This happened in my office recently. A gentleman came in with a 
good idea for fixing computers. He had no debts, his house was 
paid for and he had assets. He had gone to the bank to borrow 
$20,000 and the bank manager told him he was not interested. I told 
him to go back to that bank and tell the manager he wanted $20,000 
on his credit card. He got the $20,000.
<P>
	The banks are changing their whole attitude toward small 
business lending. They are going to make them all on credit cards. 
They are saying that anybody with $50,000 or under will have a 
credit card system. The bank will not check the financial 
statements every year because they really cannot be bothered. 
What the banks are not telling the borrower is he or she will pay a 
minimum of prime plus 3 per cent on loans.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that banks are a major part of 
the bankruptcy problem and they are a major part of the problem of 
creating jobs. The banks, banking institutions and other financial 
institutions have gone into the business of paper transactions. The 
major growth in the financial sector is in derivatives. These are all 
paper transactions that occur on Bay Street or somewhere in Paris 
or New York. This does not mean much to the average person who 
has a good idea, who wants to develop a product that consumers 
can use and will employ more people.
<P>
	We need a different attitude toward how we lend. We have to 
lend responsibly but also have to lend on the brainpower of 
Canadians.
<P>
	A number of major changes have been made to the bankruptcy 
act which are important. We have underpinned the concept of 
remediation rather than forcing people into bankruptcy. I am 
apologetic to some of my colleagues in the bankruptcy industry 
that promotes bankruptcy. It is a big business now. You can hear the 
jingles on the radio: ``Come down here, we will solve all your 
credit problems''. We have to stop that. We have to move toward 
greater accountability, financial responsibility by our financial 
institutions toward small and medium sized businesses and the 
young people who are in debt way beyond their means.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-5.
<P>
	I want to highlight one section of the bill that the victims of 
crime should note. It should be noted by victims of incest or 
abusive relationships in a marriage, by someone who has been 
involved in an unpleasant employment situation or a victim in a 
residential school. Anyone who is a victim of an assault is 
specifically included from a Criminal Code offence. All of these 
can be included in the changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5542"> 5542 </A></B>
<P>
	Sometimes the Liberals can be reasonable and amenable to 
opposition proposals to improve government initiatives. The 
government accepted my changes to this bill and everyone will 
be better off.
<P>
	Prior to the last election I served as a probation officer and a 
family court counsellor in the provincial attorney general's 
ministry in British Columbia. I spent each day working with the 
Criminal Code. I have learned firsthand the code's weaknesses and 
its strengths. I discovered loopholes that aided many to walk free 
when they should have been put behind bars. Far too often I saw 
justice not being served. The criminals were benefiting, the victims 
were suffering and there was nothing that they could do.
<P>
	When constituents in New Westminister-Burnaby elected me 
as their representative in 1993 I made a commitment to take a firm 
stand on behalf of victim. Whether it be changes to the Canadian 
Criminal Code or to some other statute I promised that something 
would be done to protect the public from further harm and 
suffering.
<P>
	In May 1995 I had the distinct pleasure to introduce private 
member's Bill C-323, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act (order of discharge). Subsequently the government 
incorporated my private member's bill into this legislation.
<P>
	When a person commits an assault or battery, a victim can claim 
damages through a civil law suit. However, under the old 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act if the offender claimed bankruptcy, 
the damages owed were cleared causing the victim to once again 
suffer inconvenience and hardship.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Subsection 178(1) of the bankruptcy act lists various things from 
which an order of discharge does not release a bankrupt person. It 
takes into account alimony, maintenance and support of a spouse or 
child, debt arising from a fraud, embezzlement or any fine, penalty 
or restitution order imposed by a court in respect of an offence.
<P>
	Therefore, according to the way the old act read, a bankrupt 
person could not be relieved of paying a traffic fine yet that person 
could be relieved of paying damages for something like sexual 
assault.
<P>
	I read an article in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> about a woman who 
was awarded about $200,000 in damages for sexual abuse by her 
stepfather. After a civil trial her stepfather was ordered to make 
payments of $500 a month. According to the article he made one 
full payment of $500, four payments of $100, then he filed for 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	Tammy Carr of White Rock, B.C. sued her stepfather for 
sexually assaulting her for six years and was awarded about 
$42,000 in damages. Her stepfather, David Graham filed for 
bankruptcy six months after the judgment.
<P>
	Cynthia Shefford of Alexis Creek, B.C. was awarded some 
$357,000 by a Supreme Court jury for the sexual abuse committed 
by her father Leonard Klassen. The father was ordered to pay his 
daughter $500 a month for 12 years. Three months after the trial, 
Klassen filed for bankruptcy.
<P>
	The amount of Shefford's award at that time was the largest 
award in the country. What good is it to have such a record amount 
if not a penny is received by the one who needs it most, the victim?
<P>
	My amendment is a fundamental change to the act. It is not just a 
small change. Not only does it strengthen the statute in legal terms, 
but it fundamentally strengthens the public's view of the operation 
of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Family violence is mitigated against by this bill. The weak and 
the dependent have made a further gain in recognition in law by the 
improved bankruptcy provisions. Victims of violence, whoever 
they may be, have a measure of increased protection from my 
refinements to the bill.
<P>
	It especially relates to women's issues about which I am 
particularly concerned. In the past as a community service 
professional in helping these victims I have been in the sad position 
of having few resources for healing or overcoming traumas. Often 
medical plan resources were limited, especially for psychological 
services or fees for support groups in peer counselling. I 
desperately made many phone calls in an effort to find resources 
for the people with whom I was dealing.
<P>
	Now at least the door is being opened to the possibility that the 
perpetrator will have to give the resources to assist in the healing of 
the victim. It more appropriately places the financial responsibility 
where it belongs. If a civil court after a trial makes an award for 
assault, the perpetrator cannot now escape through bankruptcy 
because of the new clause in Bill C-5.
<P>
	The section in question, 105.(1), begins on page 62 and states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 178(1) of the Act is amended by adding the following after paragraph 
(a):</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.1) any award of damages by a court in civil proceedings in respect of</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) bodily harm intentionally inflicted, or sexual assault, or
<P>
(ii) wrongful death resulting therefrom;
<P>
	It is a short phrase but I anticipate it will mean an awful lot to the 
residents of my constituency and the victims of crime across the 
country.
<P>
	I extend my compliments specifically to the minister's staff for 
their professionalism. This technical bill has 99 pages and we will 
eventually see how it will operate in the real world. I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5543"> 5543 </A></B>
<P>
especially be watching how a number of civil trials, which are now 
on hold, will move forward as a result of the passage of this bill.
<P>
	I thank the minister and lawyer David O. Marley of Burnaby, 
British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise 
in debate on this bill. I listened to the comments of the member 
opposite, who has done a significant amount of work trying to 
ensure that the bill is amended in a way that meets the needs of 
those who find themselves in financial difficulty, be they 
individuals or corporations, as well as outlining the clear 
responsibilities which those individuals or corporations that are 
debtors must assume in a system that is fair and reasonable.
<P>
	It is a bit of dÃ©ja vu for me because back in 1992 I was the 
consumer and corporate affairs critic when Bill C-22 was before 
the House. At that time the then minister of consumer and 
corporate affairs, Mr. Blais, did something very innovative. He 
knew that this was very complex legislation and that many attempts 
had been made since the late 1940s to amend it. Each and every 
time, because of the various interest groups, every valiant effort to 
amend the act was met with failure and had to be withdrawn.
<P>
	There were instances in the past when this legislation was 
introduced in the Senate to try to take it away from the public's 
attention. Even over in that place some of the special interest 
groups rose up and each and every attempt hit the shoals and the act 
was not amended.
<P>
	One of the few good things the Conservative government did in 
the last Parliament was to allow very open and vigorous debate in 
committee to try to get a bill that addressed all of the various 
concerns. It did that in a wholesome way which allowed the full 
input of members of Parliament. Since I gave that government 
credit back in 1992 I will do it again today in the House and, by 
extension, to the former minister, Mr. Blais, who is now practising 
law in Quebec City. He did the right thing. It showed that 
Parliament can work when committees are allowed to have real 
input on technical bills which can have a very real effect on the 
lives of Canadians.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear from my Reform colleague that a private 
member's bill which he put forward in this place has been 
incorporated into this bill. It is very healthy for democracy when 
we allow members, no matter what their political stripe, to input to 
the fullness of their capability as legislation goes through this 
place.
<P>
	I will make another pitch for more bills of this kind, hopefully 
from the government side, to be referred to committee after first 
reading, before they are approved in principle, or if they go after 
second reading to ensure that we allow the huge wealth of 
knowledge and ability  that we have in this place, regardless of the 
political stripe, to be used to come up with better legislation for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that there have been a number of 
amendments. When we worked on this legislation back in 1992 it 
took us well over a year to get it done. It was a very complex piece 
of work. We paid attention to detail. There were various opinions as 
to what we should be doing. The Speaker knows well because at 
that time he was the associate critic for consumer and corporate 
affairs. He knows the hours of debate and the work that went into 
that bill.
<P>
	However, a number of pieces were left unfinished. Sometimes 
we have to go with a cake that is three-quarters baked rather than 
leaving the cake in the oven. That is what we did the last time.
<P>
	We set a process in place whereby the bill had to be reviewed by 
a parliamentary committee, which is what is happening here. We 
also made sure that there would be an advisory committee put in 
place to go over the technical aspects of the bill, as well as some of 
the practical applications of what we had done when we amended 
the act with Bill C-22.
<P>
	Back then I had a number of concerns. Some of them have been 
addressed. The fine tuning absolutely had to be done. I am pleased 
to see that the work has proceeded. We were worried about the last 
bill about having two competing pieces of legislation as a remedy 
for companies that got into financial difficulty. The CCAA, which 
has been in place for years, was used many times almost as a 
chapter 11 in Canada. Because of what we did in Bill C-22, with the 
reorganization provisions that we put in place, we had sort of a 
Canadian version of a chapter 11 which encouraged reorganization 
instead of liquidation.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	It encouraged companies and individuals who got into difficulty 
financially, instead of having the banks which always had the 
priority to pull the rug out from underneath, to put some structures 
in place. It took the gun away from the head of the business or the 
individual and facilitated some discussion and dialogue to try to get 
over the debt problem.
<P>
	Rather than laying waste to Canadian companies and individuals 
because of debt problems, we wanted to see if there was some way 
the debts could be rehabilitated and put over a longer period of 
time. In this way, Canadians could maintain their dignity. It is not a 
dignified thing for many Canadians to be forced into personal 
bankruptcy. Indeed, we need to assist companies that find 
themselves in some financial difficulty so they do not go belly up, 
as we say back home, and that the employees are found without a 
job and on the government dole.
<P>
	A number of those changes that were put in the last bill have 
been built upon. I understand the CCAA is in  this bill. We sort of 
anticipated that perhaps during the review there may not be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5544"> 5544 </A></B>
<P>
necessity to keep the CCAA. I am pleased to see that it is there after 
careful review by the committee of industry. However, it is only to 
be used with firms whose sales are in excess of $10 million. I think 
that is a good starting point.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that there are some amendments in this 
piece of legislation dealing with environmental costs, remediation 
and rehabilitation of environmental sites. We spent a considerable 
amount of time on this in 1992 and there was generally no 
consensus at the end of the day on how we proceeded with it. We 
were concerned because we did not want companies to be able to 
walk away because of environmental liabilities and leave 
effectively the crown or the trustee or the municipality with the 
burden.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that basically there is a type of super 
priority given to environmental clean-up of these orphaned sites.
<P>
	I am also pleased to see that there have been some changes in 
this legislation dealing with potential actions against directors and 
officers of companies during periods of reorganization. Clearly we 
have to understand that when companies get into financial 
difficulty we are perpetrating an even greater challenge to the 
company if the directors feel that they are going to be challenged 
during a period of reorganization because then they will leave. 
Therefore the very people needed to hang in to make sure that the 
reorganization proposal is implemented are the people who are 
forced out because they are concerned about potential liabilities 
through the legal system. I commend the committee for the work it 
has done in bringing these challenges in.
<P>
	I can remember when this happened a few years ago. Canadian 
airlines was in financial difficulty and because of potential 
directors liability we saw some of the directors jumping ship from 
that airline. That clearly is not in the best interest of the 
rehabilitation of companies such as that. Therefore I was very 
pleased to see that those amendments came forward.
<P>
	On farmers and fishermen we argued heavily back in 1992 that 
there had to be some changes in the old bankruptcy legislation to 
recognize that agricultural and fishery products were different than 
other commodities. What we did in the last bill was pretty 
innovative and kind of risky. The banks did not like it at the time 
but accepted it after we did it. We put in provisions for 
revindication which was key to stopping the destruction that 
happens many times and splashes all over the place from 
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.
<P>
	At that point in time we made it very clear that if the supplier of 
goods, which supplied goods to a company, went bankrupt within a 
30 day period of receipt of the goods and the goods were not paid 
for, we wanted to make very sure the banks or whoever was 
financing did not then run in and cause a secondary problem by 
seizing  and liquidating the goods to put against the loans that the 
company had to do its operations.
<P>
	What was happening in many cases is that the small business 
would be under the financial hammer and the crunch would be on. 
The banker would call and say: ``You are $20,000 over your credit 
line. What we really have to do is apply for a higher credit line for 
you but you are overdue and you will have to pay down your credit 
line''. The small businessman or woman may then be compelled to 
take additional stock on their own credit line back from their 
suppliers, sell it at a discount to try to get that liquid, to get the 
cash, give it to the bank. The bank would get it paid down and then 
say: ``Sorry, our head office has looked at this and we are going to 
have to foreclose''. That did not happen just once or twice. That 
was a pattern we heard from businesses, trustees in bankruptcies 
and accountants in our hearings.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We said that from now on the banks are not going to be able to 
seize. If the goods are sold within 30 days then they have the right 
to take them back before anybody realizes the liquidity of the 
assets.
<P>
	However, there was a problem with farmers and fishermen 
because the act as it was proposed in 1992 said that they had to be 
able to identify their goods. What happens to a fisherman who just 
picked up some halibut and dropped it off to the fish dealer, along 
with the halibut of 30 other fishermen? Unless he can identify his 
particular fish, barley, oats or wheat, if one happened to be a 
farmer, he could not get them back.
<P>
	At the 11th hour in 1992 there was agreement that this had to be 
done differently and changes were made. I am very pleased to see 
that the committee has gone further and made other changes. As the 
act stood after 1992, it still did not recognize the changes with 
respect to encouraging rehabilitation. But this bill does. It 
recognizes that if farmers and fishermen opt for seasonal work, 
which is what we are trying to encourage them to do so they can 
increase their income, that in and of itself would not be a reason for 
somebody to petition them into bankruptcy during a 
reorganization. In other words, the fact that they worked and made 
additional income to apply against their debt through reoganization 
is very positive.
<P>
	I would like to reference a couple more things. There have been 
some very positive amendments to the bill. There are 
responsibilities that the debtor must assume and they have been 
outlined and highlighted in some of the amendments.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that individuals will not be able to avail 
themselves of provisions of the legislation in order to skirt their 
court ordered responsibilities with respect to support payments or 
restitution to victims of crime. I applaud the member for putting 
those proposals forward. Constantly in this place we have to review  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5545"> 5545 </A></B>
<P>
legislation because many times it is used in a way for which it was 
not intended when it was debated here or examined by committee.
<P>
	Clearly the amendments from 1992 never anticipated that 
somebody who had a court ordered restitution to a victim of crime 
or was ordered to pay support payments would be able to make 
application to effectively have them wiped out even though 
because of their earning potential they still had the ability to pay.
<P>
	I applaud the member opposite for keeping up the fight on that. 
He has truly made this a better piece of legislation because of his 
actions. I am encouraged that every one of the amendments 
continues to work toward the goal of reorganization versus 
liquidation of assets.
<P>
	However, I am slightly discouraged about the role of the crown. 
In 1992 we argued at length about the role of the crown when 
dealing with a crown debt. A crown debt is effectively treated as a 
super priority. In 1992, I remember specifically grilling officials 
from the Department of National Revenue and the Department of 
Industry and the members of the Superintendent of Bankruptcies' 
office about the role of, let us say, Revenue Canada. If a company 
or an individual decides to apply under the reorganization 
provisions to try to order their debt in such a way to have it reduced 
and then pay off when they can to keep from going bankrupt, I was 
worried that the crown because it had super priority would sit back, 
twiddle its thumbs and after the exhaustive and difficult process 
say ``that is all well and good, but I want 100 per cent of my debt 
paid back''. I wanted the crown to be treated the same way as 
others in the same class of secured creditor.
<P>
	At the time we were told not to worry, that the minister had 
indicated to department of revenue officials that they were to work 
in these cases of reorganization and that they should be silent 
unless the proposals under reorganization treated them in a harsher 
fashion than other secured creditors.
<P>
	I am dismayed that over the last four years I have had to deal 
with at least three cases where the crown through Revenue Canada 
has simply not done that.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	We have a case that I am currently pursuing through the regional 
director of an individual who went under a reorganization three 
years ago under the provisions of this act. He had a debt owed to 
Revenue Canada but he had a lot of other debts as well. All the 
creditors got together and said it is better if we reduce this 
individual's debt and we have an orderly payment of the agreed 
upon debt afterwards to allow the individual to go on plying a 
living, making some money and rehabilitate his debtor situation.
<P>
	They did that. Everybody agreed. Three years later after he sold 
his house, he sold all of his properties, he liquidated all of his 
retirement annuities and all that type of thing, he felt good about 
himself. He was able to pay off 60 per cent of his debt. After he has 
gone through three years literally of hell to pay off these debts 
because of the reorganization provision, he could claim that he had 
never had to go bankrupt, that he did what he thought he should do 
and that he had the financial capability of doing it. Three years later 
a notice comes from Revenue Canada which says: ``Please be 
informed that you owe Revenue Canada X number of dollars plus 
interest over the last three years''.
<P>
	Somebody might ask did he pay Revenue Canada. Yes, he did. 
Under the terms of the reorganization provision he paid it the same 
as other secured creditors. I think it was 60 per cent of the debt. 
Revenue Canada lay in the bushes, as it were, for three years until 
his reorganization was completed and was discharged and then sent 
him a bill for the balance with interest accrued, effectively forcing 
this individual who had gone through the very good provisions of 
Bill C-22, had gone through the very positive provisions of 
rehabilitating his debt of now having to face a bankruptcy 
proceeding.
<P>
	It is not the first case. It is the fourth case. Over the last number 
of years each time I heard of one of these cases I would call the 
Superintendent of Bankruptcies who agreed there was potentially a 
problem. It was kind of regional in nature because a lot of it was to 
do with the head of collections in each of the regions with Revenue 
Canada.
<P>
	I am dismayed that this aspect of crown priority has not been 
fully addressed. However, I encourage members with constituents 
having similar problems to raise those at the appropriate level and 
at the political level with the Minister of Industry, who is 
responsible for the administration of this act, as well as with the 
Minister of National Revenue, where it seems in my experience at 
least the problem still lies in various regions of the country.
<P>
	The last thing I want to say on this bill is that there is still a piece 
of unfinished business. Back in 1992 in order to get this bill 
completed I and Mr. Rodriguez, the former member for Nickel Belt 
who was the NDP critic, knew this file well. He had a couple of 
private member's bills dealing with wage earner protection: what 
happens when a company goes belly up which has a lot of 
employees, and what happens to the wages owed and the benefits 
owed to those employees? Under the old act there was a major 
problem. There was a very low limit that had not been updated in 
about 20 years. The new bill, Bill C-22 in 1992, made some 
movement in the right direction.
<P>
	However, there was still a major problem that in many cases the 
wage earners, the people who by the sweat of their brow or the grey 
matter in the brain, through their inputs to the business were a key 
component of the business, were not treated in as fair a fashion as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5546"> 5546 </A></B>
<P>
the banks or the suppliers of goods or other services. The labour 
component was never treated fairly.
<P>
	We came up with a number of proposals, none of which was 
acceptable to the government of the day, but at the end of the day 
we had made an agreement with Mr. Blais, the minister at the time, 
that we would look at various options for wage earner protection. 
Indeed, part of the agreement was to set up some type of all-party 
committee to look at the best ways to deal with in many cases a 
very major loss of wages to individuals who work in corporations 
that go bankrupt. They are always left at the bottom of the heap and 
that is unfair. That has not happened today. The agreement was not 
something that officially was done on the floor of the House.
<P>
	However, I will jog all of my colleagues' memories who were on 
the committee in the last Parliament that indeed that was the 
commitment. As a result of that commitment we amended the 
entire section dealing with wage earner protection out of Bill C-22. 
That was a key operative component of that bill and we amended 
the whole thing at report stage because we were going to put a 
process in place to examine it.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I encourage members who have an interest in the industry 
committee to look at a few of those shortfalls, to take credit for the 
good work that has been done and further modernizing this very 
important piece of legislation.
<P>
	Continue to ask the questions that must be asked over the next 
few years as to whether the wage earner protection clause are 
sufficient, whether further work has to be done and whether 
somebody has to keep a closer eye on the role of the crown and 
crown agents in discussions leading up to reorganization, whether 
they are living up to the spirit of the debate and the legislation of 
1992 and 1996.
<P>
	In conclusion, I appreciate having had the time to relive some 
history. Members are very familiar with most of what I said. I also 
commend the current members of the industry committee for doing 
a bang up job.

	The House resumed from October 21, 1996, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak to this bill. I would like to start by saying 
that I fully support the amendments presented previously by the 
hon. member for Laurentides. The Bloc Quebecois had many good 
reasons for wanting to postpone third reading of the bill.
<P>
	Since the government has decided otherwise, we will continue 
the debate. Manganese is an additive that we get mainly from our 
neighbours to the South, the United States. Now if it were produced 
in Canada, in Ontario, for instance, would the government have 
spent so much energy on trying to ban it? I wonder.
<P>
	The government says that this bill represents a serious threat to 
public health. It also says that it may cause serious damage to 
antipollution devices on cars, and third, it has confirmed that it 
must harmonize its policies with those of the United States.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I may remind the government that we now have an agreement on 
the free circulation of goods. I also realize that the Minister of the 
Environment is under enormous pressure. There is a very strong 
lobby, I agree. But who are these people who are putting pressure 
on the minister? Who are they? Auto manufacturers? Friends of the 
government? Other people, other companies, including car 
manufacturers who think that this product damages antipollution 
devices?
<P>
	However, many studies have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that manganese can even be beneficial to the environment. It has 
been scientifically proven that it helps reduce emission levels of 
nitrogen dioxide, which causes urban smog, by up to 20 per cent.
<P>
	And we all know that nitrogen dioxide is itself harmful to the 
environment and to the health of Quebecers and Canadians. In

other words, by passing this bill, we are helping to destroy our 
environment and consequently endangering the health of our 
constituents.
<P>
	In fact, this bill also increases emissions of nitrogen oxide. The 
effect would be the same if all of a sudden we increased the number 
of cars on our highways by several hundred thousand. We can 
imagine the harm that would do.
<P>
	If the government thinks it is deleterious to our health, then why 
is the health department not drafting a bill to ban it outright? 
Asking the question is answering it, as this government is unable to 
prove, scientifically or otherwise, that this product is harmful.
<P>
	In my opinion, there is only one real reason why the government 
has introduced this bill: protectionism. As several of us in this 
House have pointed out, we must keep in mind that manganese can 
be replaced with ethanol. Through this bill, the government is 
protecting ethanol producers, most of whom are based in Ontario 
and western Canada. Protectionism is one of the reasons why the 
government has introduced this bill.
<P>
	Let us not forget either that, in 1994, the then Minister of the 
Environment and the Minister of Health had taken position on this 
issue. They were very well positioned. Did they not put forward a 
development program favouring ethanol production? This program 
was financed to the tune of $70 million. Can these previous 
commitments suddenly be set aside? No, we are stuck with them.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Having taught mathematics for several years, I think of this as a 
very simple equation: Ontario ministers plus proposed ethanol 
plants in Ontario equals the bill before us today. It is that simple.
<P>
	What about the $275 million lawsuit filed by Ethyl Corporation, 
an American company that produces manganese? Ethyl claims that 
this is a violation of NAFTA. Do we as Canadians have so much 
money that we can afford not to take this lawsuit seriously? Did the 
Minister of the Environment take the time to consult with his legal 
advisors on this lawsuit matter before going any further with his 
project? At a time when this government is making cuts in social 
programs and the health sector, in the Canada social transfer, I 
think this is serious enough a matter to consider before passing this 
bill.
<P>
	I have another concern relating directly to the bill. The 
government must take the opinions of the provinces into account. If 
it asks the provinces for their opinions, it is only natural that it take 
these opinions into account at some point. But it is a well known 
fact-this is nothing new, not just since we came here-that the 
federal government does not respect the provinces. In fact, it is an 
old habit of theirs, in almost every area.
<P>
	They are not acting any differently in this matter as in others. It 
is no secret, the point was made over and over that six of the ten 
provinces strongly oppose this bill and demand that it be 
withdrawn.
<P>
	Once again, interprovincial trade is threatened. The provinces 
had their say, but this government, the federal government, is a 
centralizing government. That is nothing new either. We must not 
pass blindly legislation dealing with the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians and their environment. We must have all the facts we 
need to ensure that this government bill truly protects those it is 
intended to protect, that is to say the public as a whole.
<P>
	The government must not listen only to powerful lobbyists. It 
must be more open than that. As I said earlier, the minister's 
decision to go ahead is not based on any scientific facts. It is 
imperative that the government redo its homework because the 
homework handed in by the Minister of the Environment is full of 
mistakes.
<P>
	While the government redoes its homework on this bill, we 
could take a look at all the consequences this bill may have.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to bring to 
your attention that this bill has already been totally reviewed by the 
committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I believe the matter raised 
by the hon. member is a matter of debate and not a point of order. 
The Chair is apprised of the status of this bill. Upon review of the 
submitted amendment-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
I declare the amendment of the hon. member for Chicoutimi in 
order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has 
been so much misinformation delivered to this Chamber on the 
subject of MMT that it is very hard to know where to start to 
answer it. I will make some comments in response to the member 
for Chicoutimi by starting at the bottom and working up to the 
earlier comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5548"> 5548 </A></B>
<P>
	The member said that the government should be soliciting the 
opinion of the provinces before it proceeds with a bill of this kind. 
I remind the hon. member that the opinion and the co-operation 
of the provinces are absolutely essential for any kind of ethanol 
production in any province of this country.
<P>
	In Ontario when the government brought in the ethanol biomass 
bill, it was essential that the province of Ontario participate in that 
project, which it did. When ethanol comes to Quebec, which it will 
do-and I wonder what position my friends from the Bloc will take 
when a huge industrial complex is built in Quebec-it will require 
the co-operation and the opinion of the province of Quebec, just 
like any other part of the country. The opinion of the provinces is 
not only desirable, it is absolutely essential.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Chicoutimi talked about Ontario factories 
producing ethanol. We should set the record straight on that one 
too. There is one factory producing ethanol in Ontario and it 
produces about half of the ethanol that is produced across Canada 
at the present time. Much of that ethanol is used for cosmetic, 
medical and industrial purposes. Only a very small percentage of it 
goes into motor fuel, even though the demand for ethanol blended 
gasoline is growing quite quickly. As a result, there is a deficit. We 
are actually importing the ethanol blend in order to satisfy the 
demand.
<P>
	The two new plants that are going up in Ontario, a 66 million 
litres a year plant in Cornwall and a 150 million litres a year plant 
in Chatham, will multiply the amount of ethanol produced many, 
many times. It will only begin to satisfy the demand. The hon. 
member suggested that somehow Ontario was gaining some undue 
advantage here and that is not so.
<P>
	With regard to the health aspect of manganese, the health 
ministry has declined to approve or to call manganese a noxious 
material of one sort or another. It does not matter whether the 
health ministry does or does not, what matters is that the use of the 
alternative, that is, oxygenates of one sort or another in gasoline, 
will dramatically lower the emissions of carbon monoxide. It is not 
a matter of whether or not manganese is noxious; what matters is if 
it can be replaced with something that will reduce the greenhouse 
gas emissions from the internal combustion engine, then it is a 
radical step forward.
<P>
	This government set out with a goal and a commitment of 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2004 by 20 per cent from 
1988 levels. The inclusion of 10 per cent ethanol in gasoline 
reduces carbon monoxide by 30 per cent. It exceeds the target for 
that particular emission. I do not have the figures on what 
percentage of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the internal 
combustion engine but it is significant.
<P>
	Some misinformation has been put forward to this House on 
what has happened in the United States and what the American 
experience has been. To set the record straight, nearly 20 years ago 
the Environmental Protection Agency outlawed the use of MMT in 
unleaded gasoline in the United States. A year or so ago the 
supreme court in the United States ruled that the Environmental 
Protection Agency had exceeded its mandate. The word came back 
to us that the United States was ready to embrace MMT generally 
across the board. It has not happened.
<P>
	If we talk to the refiners in the United States they will tell us they 
are no longer interested in using MMT even though they have the 
authority now to go ahead and put it to environmental tests. A 
number of states have outlawed the use of MMT. If we are talking 
about harmonizing motor fuel between Canada and the United 
States, the harmony will only come when MMT is no longer in 
Canadian gasolines.
<P>
	A statement was made about nitrous oxide emissions, NOx as it 
is called, that taking MMT out could cause an increase of up to 20 
per cent of nitrous oxide emissions. The question one has to ask is, 
how much is in there to begin with? The fact is motor fuel produces 
very little nitrous oxide. Even a 20 per cent increase, which has 
been debatable depending on whose statistics are used, but let us 
say it is 20 per cent, if it is 20 per cent of nearly nothing, it is still 
nearly nothing.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	My hon. friend from Chicoutimi also talked about who it is who 
supports the removal of MMT. There are about 2.3 million 
members of the Canadian Automobile Association across Canada 
and the CAA has declared its support for the elimination of MMT 
in gasoline. Yes, the auto manufacturers certainly support the 
elimination of MMT. They came to the committee that I have the 
honour to sit on and delivered the evidence right there as to what an 
oxide of manganese does to the emission control systems in 
internal combustion engines.
<P>
	There are new emission control systems now. We have to 
contend with the effects on these new control systems. If we do not 
get rid of MMT, then there is no point going ahead with these very 
sophisticated, very much improved emission control systems.
<P>
	In conclusion, what we are dealing with here, the lobby to keep 
MMT, is simply addressing the last vestiges of kicks from a 
dinosaur whose day came and now has gone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we would expect Canada's environment minister to do 
what is right for the environment. We would expect the minister to 
consider our health to be a major priority when drafting legislation. 
Ultimately, we would expect that any legislation coming out of 
Environment Canada would have first been scientifically tested, 
making sure that there are no glitches in the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5549"> 5549 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians expect the best. Yet what we have received over the 
last three years from this government are two of Canada's most 
irresponsible environment ministers. Allow me to share a couple 
of examples.
<P>
	When the Deputy Prime Minister held the environment post, she 
had no clue what axe fell under her jurisdiction. When meeting 
with an environmental group, she was asked how her department 
would deal with endangered species. She thought that Canada 
already had an endangered species act. When she found out that 
Canada did not, she rushed to produce a weak proposal that would 
only cover roughly 4 per cent of all the land area of Canada. It 
upsets me to look across the floor and see a minister like this trying 
to run our country.
<P>
	When the Deputy Prime Minister was first approached by the 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association in 1994 or 1995, it 
wanted her to find some way to get rid of MMT from Canadian 
gasoline. One would think that if a lobby group such as the MVMA 
were to approach a minister and ask for something, the minister 
would have the department do a thorough investigation and perhaps 
even conduct interim tests of its own. However, this is where the 
Deputy Prime Minister is different from other ministers.
<P>
	Under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act there is a 
schedule of substances that are declared harmful to the health of 
Canadians and to the environment. The minister quickly 
discovered that she would not be able to ban MMT under CEPA. 
Therefore she had to find another route.
<P>
	Her only way was to ban the importation and interprovincial 
trade of MMT. One can only wonder if she first checked with the 
Department of International Trade to see how this complied under 
NAFTA. However, seeing how the department is now scrambling 
to find a way out as a result of a NAFTA challenge by Ethyl 
Corporation, I would wager to say she did not check with the 
department first.
<P>
	Getting back to CEPA and its schedule to ban substances, to get a 
substance on that list, Health Canada first has to declare that it is 
harmful. I know the statement has been heard in this House on 
many occasions but it needs to be heard again. It is like talking to a 
toddler. In order for the toddler to understand what is going on, 
something must be explained over and over again in simple terms. 
There certainly is a strong parallel between the learning curve of 
this Liberal government and that of a toddler: slow and tedious, and 
they sometimes lose their temper.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	On December 6, 1994 Health Canada issued a report entitled 
``Risk Assessment for the Combustion Products of MMT''. It 
stated: ``All analysis indicate that the combustion products of 
MMT in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the 
Canadian population''.
<P>
	On October 18, 1995 a Health Canada official appeared before 
the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development and concurred that the 1995 report remained the 
position of the department. I really do not know how many more 
times government members need to hear that MMT is not harmful 
to our health. It is not a toxic substance.
<P>
	From the very beginning Reform has unequivocally stated that it 
would support the banning of MMT if the government could show 
through an independent scientific test that MMT was harmful to the 
automakers onboard diagnostic systems, OBD-IIs, as they are 
called in the industry.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister believed the argument of the 
MVMA and proceeded to draft legislation that would ban MMT 
from unleaded fuel. The minister's explanation of this was that she 
believed the results of the MVMA, and who is going to argue with 
Ford, General Motors and Chrysler? So what has happened is that 
the minister has exposed herself as a pushover. Any lobby group 
interested in changing policy should go right to the Deputy Prime 
Minister because she will grant your every wish.
<P>
	I would like to say that the current environment minister is 
maybe better than the first. I would like to say that but I cannot, not 
in respect of this bill. The minister had the opportunity to scrap the 
whole bill when the House prorogued but he did not. He too 
suddenly felt the enormous weight of the MVMA and caved in. 
Canada has a minister who can neither think nor talk for himself. 
The minister is in the same category as his predecessor.
<P>
	It looks to me like Environment Canada is being dictated to by 
General Motors. If Bill C-29 passes, Canadians can be sure that 
more substances are going to be banned using the same process of 
push and shove.
<P>
	Bill C-29 has essentially become a war between two very 
powerful groups. On one side we have the automobile 
manufacturers and on the other side is the manufacturer of MMT as 
well as the petroleum companies. Both have made cases of why 
MMT should be banned or why it should not.
<P>
	The MVMA claimed that MMT gums up onboard diagnostic 
systems in all late model automobiles and claims that the only 
reason that onboard lights come on prematurely is the MMT in the 
gasoline.
<P>
	However, when I have confronted experts in the auto industry on 
why onboard lights are also coming on prematurely in the U.S. 
where MMT is not regularly used in its fuels, they either refuse to 
answer or simply claim that there are still some minor problems 
with the systems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5550"> 5550 </A></B>
<P>
	Is it not funny that a malfunction in Canada is related to a 
gasoline additive while the same malfunction in the U.S. is related 
to a minor bug in the system?
<P>
	This is why the bill should never have been introduced in the 
first place. There is no conclusive proof that MMT is harmful to 
our health, to our environment or to the cars we drive each day.
<P>
	It is always the intention of the members of the Reform Party to 
work with the government on legislation. Like the government, we 
want what is best for all in Canada. As the member of Parliament 
for New Westminster-Burnaby, I want to do what I can to 
represent my constituents in the best way I can. I want to be able to 
consider every side of an argument and bring forward the best 
solution.
<P>
	Bill C-29 did not take all sides into account, nor did it bring 
forward the best solutions. There was no independent testing, but 
rather high powered lobbying.
<P>
	Both the Minister of the Environment and Deputy Prime 
Minister claim that the results from the MVMA tests prove that 
MMT should be banned. Unfortunately not only were the tests not 
made for all to see, they were done in conditions not similar to 
those in Canada. How can we believe tests that were conducted in a 
southern U.S. state when Canada never sees climate such as that?
<P>
	In my opinion both ministers were blindfolded and gagged when 
they agreed to table the bill. No minister who had any 
understanding at all would agree to such a bill. It is no wonder why 
today the Minister for International Trade, the natural resources 
minister and the Minister of Industry are all furious about the 
possible passage of this bill.
<P>
	Reform does not want to see any substance being used that is 
harmful. This is the spin the Liberals may have taken. But it is just 
plain wrong. What we are looking for is an independent test 
conducted by a third party to find out exactly what effect MMT is 
having on our health, if any, our environment or the onboard 
diagnostic systems of automobiles.
<P>
	Recently the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute conducted 
its own tests with respect to MMT. In its test 144 vehicles were 
tested for emissions and the interim results indicate that both the 
emission levels as well as the performance of the OBD systems 
were excellent.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	I simply want to make the House aware that there are tests that 
prove that MMT poses no harm. Reform is not endorsing the CPPI 
test. However, the case that we are trying to make is that if both 
groups are coming up with their own conclusions and if both 
conclusions have completely opposite results then there is only one 
viable solution: the government needs to conduct its own test. By 
not doing so, the minister is going to show Canadians that he does 
not want to do what is right. He is going to show that the legislation 
is not constructed using the very best of scientific evidence. I say 
demonstrate and then legislate.
<P>
	If this bill passes through the House it will be a sad day for all of 
Canada. It will prove that the government has put special interests 
ahead of the interests of Canadians. I only hope that the other place 
will indeed use its power of sober second thought to shelve this bill 
indefinitely.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
attempt to answer some of the questions raised by the opposition 
members, the distinguished members for Chicoutimi and New 
Westminster-Burnaby. In answer to the question has the Minister 
of the Environment consulted his legal advisors, the answer is a 
definite yes, otherwise this bill would not have come forward and 
would not have gone through the drafting process that is due and 
given to every bill by the Department of Justice.
<P>
	The member for Chicoutimi was also strong in his intervention 
on the fact that there was not sufficient consultation with the 
provinces. Actually the results are in a divided field of opinion and 
therefore it is incumbent upon the government, at a certain point, to 
make a decision as to what it thinks is in the best interest of the 
public and the concerned industries.
<P>
	The member for Chicoutimi also raised the question of increased 
NOx emissions but he failed to deal with the question of increased 
carbon dioxide, NCO emissions, which would result if the 
diagnostic system were not to function.
<P>
	Both the members for Chicoutimi and New 
Westminister-Burnaby dealt with the question of health. 
Evidently here we see the matter from different perspectives I 
regret to say. As far as I know manganese is a heavy metal. It 
contains neurotoxin. In certain respects it is similar to lead. As we 
did in the 1960s, despite strenuous opposition when we removed 
the lead from gasoline as an additive, we are now moving into the 
next phase which is partially technologically driven in now 
removing another heavy metal, MMT, which is an abbreviation for 
a complex and long chemical term which includes the heavy metal 
manganese.
<P>
	To make it perhaps as concise as I can in the limited time, I 
would submit that the bill is driven by four major reasons. 
Basically it boils down to the reason of health. I regret to see that 
here we have a difference of opinion. However, in order to protect 
the health of Canadians it is a good step to remove manganese as an 
additive from gasoline. Here we are taking a measure as a 
precautionary principle because, as many have already said, quite 
rightly, the final conclusive proof has not yet come in. However, 
there is enough evidence to conclude that because it is a heavy 
metal it is desirable to remove it from the emissions that come into 
the air which we all breathe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5551"> 5551 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, there is the question of technological progress. We 
cannot at this stage ignore the fact that the automotive industry 
is installing certain onboard signalling check systems that would 
not function with the presence of manganese. Therefore, it 
becomes imperative to keep pace with technological progress, but 
that is not all.
<P>
	This leads me to the third reason which is that we have to protect 
the consumer. If the car manufacturer indicates that the presence of 
manganese in gasoline will force the manufacturer to disconnect 
the diagnostic system, the consumer will no longer be informed as 
to the malfunctioning of certain parts of the engine and therefore 
the warranty will be affected. Therefore the consumer will be 
negatively impacted by this sequence of events.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	In order to protect the consumer and in order to give the 
consumer the benefits and the advantage of the new type of 
warranty that is emerging as a result of technological progress, 
something must be done in order to remove the MMT from 
gasoline. It is an inevitable sequence of events. In other words, we 
cannot in this Parliament stop technological progress.
<P>
	The fourth reason, in addition to the consumer protection, in 
particular of the car owner, and in addition to the protection of the 
quality of the air we breath, is the one that the distinguished 
member who spoke so eloquently about ethanol indicated already 
in his intervention. I am sure that there are members opposite who 
are very keen on opening opportunities for their rural constituents 
in industries that are related to corn production and ethanol 
production. Definitely this bill also will open up opportunities for 
the industrial use of ethanol, which would enter the stream of 
additives used by way of removing the MMT additive.
<P>
	What we are really trying to do is keep up with the times, taking 
into account health, technological progress, consumer protection 
because of the warranties in the cars that will be produced in the 
very near future and also the potential for ethanol producers.
<P>
	We know, despite the denial on the part of my distinguished 
colleagues, that MMT causes the malfunctioning of the newest 
emission control technologies on cars. If that is going to happen, 
then the result will be more pollutants entering the air. I fail to 
understand therefore the rationale of some of my colleagues who 
talk in the same vein as I do, namely in support of public health.
<P>
	Carbon dioxide emissions would increase as a result of the 
decreased fuel efficiency if the diagnostic systems on board were 
not to function because of the presence of this MMT additive. The 
automakers when we were working in committee indicated to us 
that if MMT remains in gasoline they will have to disconnect the  
onboard diagnostic system and provide decreased warranty 
provisions, the ones I was referring to a moment ago, for 
consumers. Among them are General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and 
so on. These are the people who are progressing with their 
technology. We have to take into account that fact.
<P>
	I am sure there are automotive manufacturers in Quebec and 
workers at Saint-ThÃ©rÃ¨se who would want to see a positive attitude 
developed with respect to this bill. I am referring in particular to 
my distinguished colleague in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Much has been said of the ban on the uses of MMT in the United 
States. This has been often raised in debate by the opposition. If I 
were in the opposition obviously I would do the same. The fact is 
that even after the ban in the U.S. MMT is still prohibited from use 
in 37 of the U.S. states.
<P>
	More important, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency the court overturned the ban on MMT because it rejected a 
certain specific argument. It was only a technical procedural 
argument, namely that the public health impacts of fuel additives 
should be fully evaluated prior to broad use. In other words, it was 
the procedure by which MMT was banned that led to the court 
decision to overturn the ban. The lifting of that ban says nothing 
about the potential health effects of MMT. There has been a 
substantial misinterpretation here.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This is not a war between automobile manufacturers on one side 
and the U.S. based Ethyl Corporation on the other, as some 
participants in the debate have said. This is a question of 
understanding the technological process that is taking place, as I 
mentioned, and taking health into consideration and, subsequent to 
that, taking into consideration the car owner and the warranty, 
which are the driving forces behind this bill.
<P>
	Who is opposed? As we learned in committee, the opposition 
comes from one large corporation, Ethyl Corporation of the United 
States, which exports into Canada the MMT additive. That is the 
only major, massive opposition that has been mounted. We heard 
from that corporation, of course, in committee. That is the same 
corporation which 12 years ago opposed tooth and nail the removal 
of lead from gasoline. The lobby that it mounted was considerable. 
Nevertheless, gasoline with lead no longer exists. Ten years from 
now MMT in gasoline will no longer exist as well. Subsequent 
generations of legislators will see a connection and a progression 
from health damaging additives in gasoline being gradually 
replaced and removed as we learn through technology how to find 
alternatives which are not health damaging.
<P>
	Manganese is a heavy metal. It contains neurotoxins, as does 
lead. There is not a chemist or an engineer who will dispute that 
point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5552"> 5552 </A></B>
<P>
	As my colleague indicated, we have to move toward cleaner 
burning fuels. We have to improve fleet performance, increase the 
performance for every 100 kilometres, both in Canada and the 
U.S., because the number of motor vehicles on the road is 
increasing. Therefore, every time the quality of emission controls 
is improved, the increase in volume does not allow us to make 
progress as fast as we would like in terms of protecting the public.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. GÃ©rard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade 
in and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-29 is to prohibit manganese-based 
substances, including MMT, which the government and the 
automotive industry suspect of damaging the anti-pollution 
systems of cars, even though this product has been used since 1977 
to produce the vast majority of unleaded gasolines in Canada.
<P>
	By the same token, MMT would also be harmful to the 
environment and to the health of Quebecers and Canadians. 
However, this is not the case. It has been demonstrated that MMT 
is not dangerous when used in minimal amounts, such as in 
gasoline, whether for the environment or for one's health.
<P>
	Since Health Canada's findings were not the ones expected by 
the government, it had no choice but to resort to a special act to 
prohibit interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances, 
including MMT. After reprimanding the auditor general, will the 
Liberals now scold Health Canada's researchers, one wonders.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Environmental concerns or Canadians' health are not the reasons 
why the federal government wants to legislate in this area. Rather, 
it is because of the pressures exerted by lobbyists. If it had been 
proven that MMT is harmful to the environment, to one's health, or 
to automobiles, the use of this additive would have been banned a 
long time ago.
<P>
	In order to better understand the controversy surrounding the use 
of MMT, we should take a look again at the stakeholders concerned 
by this issue. First there is Ethyl Corporation, a U.S.-based 
company. Ethyl produces additives for lubricants and fuels to 
improve engine performance. It is also the sole exporter of MMT to 
Canada. MMT is added to fuel in Sarnia, in Ontario.
<P>
	Second, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, 
has been fighting Ethyl in court for years now to maintain the ban 
on MMT. On November 30, the EPA regulations banning MMT 
were revoked by the U.S. Court of Appeal, District of Columbia. 
The EPA has announced that it does not intend to appeal that 
decision.
<P>
	Third, the automotive manufacturers are against any kind of fuel 
additive and against MMT. They are threatening to increase the 
price of Canadian cars and to reduce the scope of their guarantees if 
MMT is not banned. There is no conclusive evidence showing that 
MMT is detrimental to cars' anti-pollution system.
<P>
	Fourth, the oil companies are in favour of MMT for technical 
reasons. MMT requires less intensive treatment, which means less 
pollutants from the stacks of plants producing gasoline.
<P>
	Fifth, the ethanol producers are probably against MMT, since 
they argue that ethanol would be an excellent alternative to MMT. 
It is important to note that the Deputy Prime Minister, formerly the 
Minister of the Environment, is from a region where ethanol is 
produced in huge volumes.
<P>
	The ban on MMT is costing a lot of money to the oil industry. 
These costs amount to $7 million in Quebec alone. Also, the oil 
companies could start rumours about massive lay-offs and 
increases in gas prices if the use of MMT is not allowed.
<P>
	We must not forget also that Canada is facing a $275 million 
lawsuit by Ethyl Corporation on the principle of free movement of 
goods included in NAFTA. Personally, I think the Minister of the 
Environment is taking a big risk that could have repercussions way 
beyond what he expects, on top of the problems this would cause 
for Ethyl's Canadian subsidiary.
<P>
	Last February, the Minister of International Trade wrote to the 
Minister of the Environment to remind him of that, but it seems 
that the Minister of the Environment has decided to take the risk of 
seeing the federal government being sued by Ethyl Corporation or 
by the American government for having violated the free trade 
agreement.
<P>
	Moreover, as I was saying a while ago, banning MMT favours 
the ethanol industry, which is highly developed in Ontario and in 
western Canada but which is just starting to develop in Quebec.
<P>
	I am happy to state the Bloc Quebecois' position. I should 
remind members that, when the bill was introduced, the Bloc was 
open to the idea of adopting a law banning the use and the 
importation of MMT provided it could obtain proof that this 
substance is indeed harmful to the environment and to our health. 
The Bloc Quebecois even voted in favour of Bill C-29 so a more 
detailed study could be done to shed some light in this issue.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	However, I must say that it is not the harmful effects of MMT 
that emerged from these debates and discussions, but rather the 
stubbornness and the partisan attitude of the Minister of the 
Environment and his predecessor, the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Through this action, the Liberal government is showing no respect 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5553"> 5553 </A></B>
<P>
for the international trade agreements it has signed and is ignoring 
the Canadian Constitution with regard to the provinces' 
responsibilities.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-29. It has 
been demonstrated on several occasions that the threat of MMT to 
the health of Canadians and Quebecers and its potential harmful 
effect on our cars' emission control systems are totally unfounded.
<P>
	Moreover, the Liberal government is showing no respect for 
provincial governments, for the international agreements it has 
signed and for Canadians and Quebecers. It would be in the 
Liberals' best interest to find solutions to the real problems instead 
of looking for solutions to problems that do not exist.

International Poetry Festival was recently held in Trois-RiviÃ¨res, 
which has gained international renown as the site of a major

democratizes poetry, as is eloquently demonstrated by the hundreds 
of poems posted throughout the city and the monument to the 
unknown poet, the only monument of its kind in the world.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
here are the top 10 reasons why taxpayers hate paying taxes to a 
Liberal government.
<P>
	Reason No. 10: Grants, grants and more grants, including a grant 
from Telefilm Canada for a film about the joys of necrophilia.
<P>
	Reason No. 9: $150,000 spent on propaganda to help Liberal 
MPs explain why 10 per cent unemployment is a good thing.
<P>
	Reason No. 8: The gold-plated MP pension plan when other 
pensioners are being asked to cut back.
<P>
	Reason No. 7: A $600 billion debt.
<P>
	Reason No. 6: An unbelievable Liberal standing ovation for a 
$28 billion deficit.
<P>
	Reason No. 5: Because of the tax the Liberals promised to kill, 
scrap and abolish, the GST.
<P>
	Reason No. 4: The 15 per cent BST on reading material. A little 
on the BS there.
<P>
	Reason No. 3: An employment insurance system that 
overcharges by $5 billion.
<P>
	Reason No. 2: The office of propaganda Canada and the heritage 
minister's provocative ``plan of the week'' unity strategy. The 
number one reason why taxpayers hate paying taxes to the Liberal 
government-the heritage minister herself.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday I joined students from the University of Regina at the

Liberal cutbacks to post-secondary education.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5554"> 5554 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals' cutting of $2 billion to post-secondary education 
represents a $2,000 per student cut, a straight offload of federal 
debt to those who can least afford it: young Canadians.
<P>
	The Liberals have chosen to declare war on students with major 
cuts rather than reform the tax system to make the wealthy and big 
corporations pay their fair share. This is another broken promise in 
a litany of Liberal broken promises. Once again the Liberals have 
sided with corporate interests over the interests of middle class 
families. A tax system based on fairness and ability to pay is what 
Canada needs now.
<P>
	Today the crisis facing students in Canada because of the Liberal 
cutbacks is every bit as destructive as any war. Unfair Liberal tax 
policies support the wealthy and big corporations and threaten the 
future of Canada.
<P>

economy.
<P>
	There are nearly 2.4 million small businesses in Canada. Small 
businesses account for 43 per cent of all private sector business in 
this country. Sixty per cent of Canada's economic output is 
produced by small business. Eighty-eight per cent of new job 
creation comes from companies that employ 50 people or less. 
These numbers are impressive.
<P>
	Because we are aware of the crucial role these businesses play in 
Canada's economic health, we have taken measures to alleviate the 
burdens placed on them.
<P>
	Since 1993, 20,000 new businesses have been created. We have 
worked toward reducing restrictive regulations, paperwork, 
taxation and duplication. We have improved access to capital, 
streamlined business registration and efficiency and provided more 
support services.

games about the number of jobs his government has created, the 
true number of Canadians without jobs is startling. The jobless rate 
in Canada is presently at an unacceptable 10 per cent level. This 
means that more than 1.5 million Canadians do not have jobs. It 
does not include the thousands and thousands of Canadians who 
have given up looking for work.
<P>
	Many of these individuals are well educated but face a bleak 
future with no employment opportunities on the horizon. When we 
include over 300,000 young people who have given up looking for 
work, the statistics are even more astonishing.
<P>
	These Canadians will not forget the many promises made by this 
Prime Minister three short years ago. They were promised jobs.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the idea 
of emissions trading is old hat which, if adopted, would allow a 
company to pollute by purchasing a tradable permit. In other 
words, emissions trading is a licence to pollute, allowing dirty 
industries to buy pollution permits from cleaner industries and 
continue to pollute unabated.
<P>
	Emissions trading runs counter to the government's commitment 
to pollution prevention announced in ``A Guide to Green 
Government'' signed by each and every cabinet minister in 1995.
<P>
	Pollution prevention means energy efficiency and minimal waste 
in the use of materials rather than costly clean-ups after the fact. 
This is the goal we should be striving for instead of surrendering to 
the old idea of emissions trading which accepts pollution as an 
inevitable cost of doing business.

growth. Industry Canada will contribute two-thirds of the cost, up 
to a maximum of $600,000 per community over five years. The 
remaining third will come from the community.

	The project will add economic vitality to Canada's technology

for a reason. It goes without saying that if conditions change, we 
are prepared to review the situation and change our way of doing 
things. We are prepared to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we learn more bit by bit. First, the minister tells us the 
government follows the rules and then she points out that these 
rules exist for a reason. We are making progress.
<P>
	From these two highly intellectual statements, will the minister 
admit that, even though BCP has been bought out by the French 
agency Publicis and is no longer a 100 per cent Canadian-owned 
company, as the rule supposedly requires, it still gets $35 million in 
advertising contracts from the federal government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a competitive 
process and contracts for publicity are given out following this very 
open process. There are certain rules. The rules are established and 
we follow them. That being said, nothing prevents us from looking 
at the way the rules are set up to ensure that there continues to be as 
much competition as possible for Canadian companies.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also to the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services.
<P>
	As we all know, advertising contracts are not awarded to the 
lowest bidder, but to the firm that is the most creative, which is a 
good idea. After being sold to foreign interests, BCP Canada is a 
mere shadow of what it was when it obtained the government 
contracts. The company that received the contracts had more than 
200 employees, whereas this company has barely 20.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	How can the public works minister justify maintaining the 
contracts awarded to BCP Canada before this company was sold to 
Publicis since, today, BCP Canada is just a small foreign subsidiary 
disguised as a Canadian company?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, so long as companies 
qualify as Canadian companies, they can continue to work for the 
government until the end of their contract. We see no reason to 
change what has been done before.
<P>
	As you know, when new contracts have to be awarded, there will 
certainly be an open process, and we will study that process to 
make sure it is equitable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-TÃ©miscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister said she was ready to change the process if 
necessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5558"> 5558 </A></B>
<P>
	What is she waiting for to put an end to the 100 per cent 
Canadian ownership rule and to go back to a public tender process 
involving all companies that have majority Canadian ownership, 
the real ones this time, as the other advertising firms in Quebec 
are asking her to do? What is she waiting for to put an end to 
patronage?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I explained earlier, it 
is obvious that we want to encourage competition in the advertising 
industry and we will certainly continue to study the rules to achieve 
that goal.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister never tires of telling the House that 
the government has deficit targets, but the finance minister fails to 
provide targets when it comes to the government's number one 
promise of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	Under the Liberals we have 1.4 million unemployed, we have 
one-half million to one million people who have dropped through 
the cracks, we have youth unemployment in excess of 18 per cent, 
two million to three million underemployed and one out of four 
Canadians fearful for their jobs.
<P>
	The government says it believes in measurable targets. What are 
the government's targets for reducing the numbers of unemployed 
and underemployed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of Finance have said time and time again, job 
creation is the government's number one priority.
<P>
	We do not have a set target for jobs. Does the Reform Party have 
a target for jobs? No it does not. It has just found out that there is a 
need for jobs in this country. It is the first time we have heard about 
jobs from the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the secretary says that the government has no targets for 
jobs. The reason that it does not have targets is because it cannot 
meet them in the first place. Big government, big spending and 
high taxes kill jobs. The best way to create jobs is to lower taxes by 
making government smaller.
<P>
	When will the government give the House some firm targets for 
reducing the numbers of unemployed and underemployed in this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to quote a statement 
of the Reform Party, it is the private sector that creates jobs.
<P>
	Do Reform Party members not believe that? Why are they asking 
us for targets when it is the private sector that should be targeting 
job creation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the debate on jobs in this House and in the country is 
going to come down to this. Reformers are going to offer 
Canadians a $94 billion a year federal government. The finance 
minister is going to offer Canadians a $109 billion a year federal 
government.
<P>
	We will take the $15 billion difference and give it to taxpayers 
and entrepreneurs to create jobs. The finance minister will put $15 
billion in the hands of the tax man.
<P>
	Why does the government believe that $15 billion in the hands of 
the tax man will create more jobs than that $15 billion in the hands 
of Canadian investors and consumers?

	The new Minister of National Defence promised to clean things 
up in the armed forces, but his first move after his appointment was 
to hide from the public the amount of the compensation granted to 
General Boyle to get him to resign.
<P>
	Since taxpayers' money was used, could the minister of defence 
tell us the terms of the settlement reached with General Boyle when 
he handed in his resignation? In other words, how much money was 
General Boyle given to resign?

<P>
	General Boyle did resign. People who reach an agreement at the 
end of their careers, just like General Boyle did, are entitled to have 
their settlements respected and kept confidential. If the hon.

he should tell the House that this is the policy of his party.

the minister uses the taxpayers' money, the taxpayers have the 
right to know. This type of information is available elsewhere, in 
Quebec for instance.
<P>
	When General Boyle resigned, the Prime Minister stated that the 
general's departure was handled according to the rules that 
normally apply in such situations. In other words, when the Prime 
Minister and the minister talk about normal rules, could it mean a 
golden handshake of over half a million dollars?
<P>

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

<P>
	If he is suggesting that in every case where taxpayers' money is 
used to arrive at settlements with people who are leaving the public 
service or leaving the military, that it should be made public, then 
let us not zero in just on General Boyle, let us make sure that it is a 
rule across the board. In that case I would be prepared to entertain

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reformers think it is immoral for Canadians to work seven months 
out of the year before they get to keep their own money. We think it 
is immoral to raise taxes 35 times over three years and see the after 
tax income on nurses, truck drivers, steelworkers and teachers fall 
by $3,000. We think it is immoral for the government to allow 
some wealthy families to income split when most cannot.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Finance not acknowledge that his 
taxation policies have punished all Canadian families and that all 
Canadian families deserve to see the government balance the 
budget and give all Canadians lower taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is 
giving lessons on taxes when its proposals or its so-called fresh 
start would tax the poor to pay the rich. Tens of thousands of 
Canadians, according to the press, who make over $150,000 a year 
would be paying no taxes under its scheme.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
actually the smallest percentage cut is for the wealthy and that is 
probably what is really bothering the finance minister and his 
friend, the minister for financial institutions.
<P>
	Under our plan families earning under $20,000 would see a 
minimum 32 per cent drop in their taxes. Are those the wealthy 
people the minister is referring to? For single parent families that 
figure will be a 95 per cent drop in taxes. Are those the people the 
member is referring to? I do not think so.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Why is the minister so determined to pummel ordinary 
Canadians? When will he offer tax relief to real Canadians who 
work too hard to pay taxes that are just too high?

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Today, groups of performing artists and record producers have 
said in no uncertain terms that the government's proposal on 
neighbouring rights is unacceptable. According to this proposal, 72 
per cent of advertising revenues of broadcasters will not be subject 
to neighbouring rights.
<P>
	Since in this case two-thirds of Canadian radio stations, the 
government's proposal means paying 13 cents per day in 
neighbouring rights for performing artists, does the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage admit that this is clearly insufficient and should 
be changed along the lines of the ADISQ proposal, for instance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when the hon. member 
opposite was a member of the Conservative Party, for years 
ministers promised to go ahead with a bill on copyright. None were 
able to come up with this kind of proposal.
<P>
	We promised to do so, and we did it. We are now before the 
committee, which, for the first time, is examining recognition of 
composers' rights. This is a step in the right direction, a step that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5560"> 5560 </A></B>
<P>
unfortunately was not  taken when the hon. member opposite was 
with the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
understood the minister correctly, 13 cents per day is enough. I 
assume she will give them a flag as a consolation prize.
<P>
	All creators agree that the exceptions this bill makes for 
museums, libraries, archives and schools change the nature of 
copyright by in fact denying them that right.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage support the cause of the 
artists or will she cave in to pressure from users?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear the hon. 
member mention the flag campaign, because one of his own 
sovereignist colleagues sent a request for a flag. Even separatists 
want to fly the Canadian flag.
<P>
	My second point, and it is an important one, is that several 
ministers, including Marcel Masse, a former Tory minister and 
now a separatist, had promised to go ahead with the copyright bill, 
but they were unable to do so.
<P>
	Finally, by working together with ADISQ and those who 
broadcast Canadian music on the radio, we have managed a 
compromise. It is not perfect. It is being examined in committee, 
but for the first time, it endorses the principle of copyright for 
composers, something the Conservatives were unable to do.

<P>
	Can the Minister for Human Resources Development explain to

<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

which money was loaned to Bombardier, is a program in which the 
Government of Canada is committed to increasing awareness in the 
high tech industries, and improving and expanding employment in 
this country. This is a program which we intend to pursue.
<P>
	There have been other announcements, of which the hon.

$9 million program loan to PetroCan in Vancouver. These are 
matters which improve employment and the high tech industry. It is 
good for those industries and for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this was not a 
loan. The government has disclosed that it made $1.7 million in 
non-repayable TAGS contributions to Bombardier in 1988 and 
1993. There was not a TAGS program in these years. In fact, this 
Liberal program only came into existence in 1994.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

stimulating the private sector with low interest rates so they can 
borrow cheaply. Yet somehow the government feels the need to 
provide Bombardier with an interest free $87 million loan 
guaranteed by the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	I had better ask the Deputy Prime Minister this question because 
of her fiscal management prowess in this country. Why does she 
feel it is right to dole out an interest free loan to a company that has 
raked in almost $1.2 billion in government handouts in the last 15 
years and which, coincidentally, donated $170,000 to the Liberal 
Party from 1993 to 1995?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities

Party refer to this particular loan that was given to Bombardier for 
$87 million for a project that is well in excess of one third of a 
billion dollars, and Bombardier is investing the balance of that 
money.
<P>
	However, they never mention the investments of the Canadian 
government in programs such as the TRIUMF program in British 
Columbia for $167 million, or the tax incentives for the oil industry 
in Alberta which will amount to 1 million construction jobs and 
40,000 permanent jobs. They never refer to those.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what this fellow here does not recognize is the question. The 
question is about $170,000 given to the Liberal government. Why 
do they not just make it easy and cut themselves a cheque and do 
away the companies that are getting these other grants?

hard and continuous work on the issues of small business.
<P>
	Yesterday at the start of small business week, the Minister of 
National Revenue announced a new simplified T4 short form that 
will significantly reduce compliance costs for small businesses. 
This will allow small business owners to spend less time filling out 
tax forms and more time growing their businesses for the benefit of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	This is the end product of the work of the small business 
advisory committee through which Revenue Canada consults small 
businesses across this country.
<P>
	The new T4 short form will be mailed out directly to those 
businesses that have six employees or less. It will also be available 
at all our tax offices.
<P>
	This is government working at its best, as it should be.

	<B>Mr. StÃ©phane Bergeron (VerchÃ¨res, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	It has been more than six years since the UN ordered an embargo 
against Iraq, following the invasion of Kuwait. For several months, 
the UN has been negotiating an agreement with Iraq that would 
allow this country to trade part of its oil for food and medicine, in 
order to relieve the suffering of the Iraqi people.
<P>
	Considering the humanitarian reasons that motivated the oil for 
food agreement, could the minister inform us of Canada's position 
on the suspension of the proposed agreement, following the Iraqi 
incursions into Kurdish territory?
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we supported the UN resolution, and right now the UN 
must examine the resolutions concerning Iraq to ensure that the 
principles of the resolution are honoured by Iraq. Subsequently, I 
would certainly be glad to continue to support the resolution on 
humanitarian aid for Iraq.
<P>
	<B>Mr. StÃ©phane Bergeron (VerchÃ¨res, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could 
the minister report on the resumption of negotiations regarding this 
agreement, especially with respect to the rules to be followed by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5563"> 5563 </A></B>
<P>
the observers responsible for monitoring implementation of the 
agreement in Iraqi territory?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the resolution was passed there were undertakings 
given by Iraq regarding the accessibility of UN monitors to the 
country to make sure that any assistance was being properly given 
to the people of Iraq.
<P>
	We want to make sure that those kinds of conditions are fully 
honoured, fully met. We are in full agreement with the basic thrust 
of the whole UN resolution which is to ensure there is humanitarian 
aid. We certainly do not want to ensure that aid goes to the Iraqi 
government which, as we have seen in the past several years, uses it 
only for mischievous or malevolent purposes.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, earlier this year Quebec businessman Tran Thieu Quan 
was sentenced to 20 years in prison in Viet Nam.
<P>
	The Canadian government, after an investigation, is well aware 
that Mr. Quan is being used as a scapegoat and is a victim of fraud, 
that his family is suffering from this injustice.
<P>
	Yet last week, as was mentioned, we find that the Canadian 
government gave the Viet Nam government $11 million in 
unconditional foreign aid. The minister's explanation of this would 
be cold comfort to the Quan family.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister for International Co-operation. 
Why would the Canadian government give unconditional foreign 
aid to the Government of Viet Nam when it continues to perpetrate 
human rights violations, especially against a Canadian citizen?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am sorry that the hon. member is under the mistaken view that the 
grants were given to the Government of Viet Nam. That is factually 
incorrect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister on two separate occasions has asked 
for the release of Mr. Quan. The finance minister has asked for the 
release of Mr. Quan. The minister says that he is carrying on 
negotiations in this direction.
<P>
	Why, if this is the object of the Government of Canada, would it 
give unconditional foreign aid to a country that is deliberately 
violating the human rights of a Canadian citizen?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I guess it bears repeating. The Government of Canada did not give 
unconditional foreign aid to the Government of Viet Nam, pure and 
simple. Funds were given to individual projects, to local groups, 
humanitarian aid, women's groups and for organizing le Sommet 
de la Francophonie. I hope the hon. member is not against that 
initiative.
<P>
	No government funding went to the Government of Viet Nam,

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the minister responsible for the post office.
<P>
	At a time of tragic increases in the number of jobless in Canada, 
will she admit that just six days after Christmas, the result of her 
decision on regular ad mail will result in up to 17,000 people losing 
their jobs, another 1,500 supervisors losing their jobs, that most of 
these 17,000 people work less than 15 hours a week and therefore 
are not eligible for EI? The majority are women living below the 
poverty line.
<P>
	Is this the minister's idea of a Christmas present to the people 
who presently work for Canada Post?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
numbers are wrong. I suggest he speak to Canada Post.
<P>
	That being said, Mr. Radwanski travelled the country. He held 
hearings across the country. They were supported in 
correspondence which I received in letters by the thousands.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians have said to us they do not believe that Canada Post 
should be delivering junk mail. We have listened and we have 
asked Canada Post to exit from the economy unaddressed ad mail 
in as compassionate a way as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pathetic 
response to the 17,000 people who are going to lose their jobs six 
days after Christmas. Is that the best she can do?
<P>
	If the small business sector is expected to pick up the slack and 
provide alternative delivery service, will the minister acknowledge 
that in many cities between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of the 
households will not receive these distributed pamphlets and so on 
because they are either dependent on postal mailboxes or 
mailboxes in apartments? The market will be excluded for perhaps 
up to 30 per cent of the small business operators?

out of the economy unaddressed ad mail is a good move for the 
private sector. Many small business people will be picking up 
these jobs. As a matter of fact, there are already ads in some areas 
in some newspapers for workers so they can be in a position to 
take over this particular work.

as it will allow them to continue to give good service to their

the Canadian government is extremely concerned about human

<P>
	That is why we have suspended all Canadian funds for local 
initiatives until further notice. The only aid that remains in 
Afghanistan is humanitarian assistance through the Red Cross and

	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	On October 11, the Minister of Transport stated in this House 
that his government's international air transportation policy is 
flexible and that the ``use it or lose it'' principle applied only if 
another airline wanted the route. Otherwise, things would remain 
unchanged.
<P>
	Are we to understand from the minister's comments that he had 
been pressured by Canadian before he took the Prague route away 
from Air Canada, which would otherwise have kept it, and 
reassigned it to Canadian last July?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the policy that we have with respect to routes to countries 
such as the Czech Republic is very straightforward. It has been 
established now for over a year and a half.
<P>
	The routes are assigned to one of our major airlines and if the 
airline does not pick up that route and use it within a period of 365 
days it is reassigned to the back-up or supplementary carrier, the 
secondary carrier. This is a well established procedure.
<P>
	The minister is concerned about pressure. There is no pressure 
whatsoever from Canadian because it is essentially an automatic 
procedure. The only area where there might be some concern is 
whether we issue a letter to the first carrier at the end of the first 
year or whether we wait some time, and the normal process is to 
within a reasonable time send out that letter.
<P>
	In the case of Prague I believe the letter was sent out some two 
months after the one year period expired.

	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training

honour the work and life of Mr. James W. Bourque who died 
suddenly in Ottawa on Saturday. It is a great loss for the north and 
many others across the country and around the world.
<P>
	Mr. Bourque was a tireless aboriginal activist whose 
commitment to his family and to his community were paramount. 
Mr. Bourque was a most respected, honest, hard working and 
committed individual.
<P>
	Appointed to the privy council in 1992, Mr. Bourque was born in 
Wandering River, Alberta, and learned at an early age the traditions 
and cultures of his Cree background to which he remained faithful 
throughout his life.
<P>
	His sense of duty and contribution to his community came at an 
early age. He was elected president of the local hunters and 
trappers association in Port Chipewyan when he was 18. He went 
on to work as a park warden in Wood Buffalo National Park 
between 1955 and 1963.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	This man deserved the attention of all Canadians, including 
those in the House of Commons who serve with us every day. He 
served as the president of the Metis Association of the Northwest 
Territories from 1980 to 1982, was deputy minister of renewable 
resources for the Government of the Northwest Territories from 
1982 to 1991 and chairman for the commission for constitutional 
development until 1992.
<P>
	Mr. Bourque was a vocal spokesman for the aboriginal people 
and the environment. In 1984 he founded the Fur Institute of 
Canada where he served as the chairman for four years. He was 
also named co-director of policy for the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal People in 1994. Most recently Mr. Bourque was 
working with the Museum of Nature in its development of the 
centre for traditional knowledge.
<P>
	In the words of Premier Don Morin who represents the 
Northwest Territories:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a great loss for myself personally and for all northerners. Jim worked hard 
on behalf of all the people in the north. He was honest, well liked and well respected. 
Everyone knew him as a fair man who believed in the rights of all people, who 
treated everyone with respect, from trappers to world leaders, and who had a deep 
love of his family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Our deepest condolences and regrets are sent to his wife 
Sharleen, his children Arthur, Valerie and Edwin as well as to his 
grandchildren. Mr. Bourque left behind a legacy of respect, 
sharing, commitment and responsibility. He will be missed by all 
who knew him.

Bloc critic on Indian affairs, I wish to express our most sincere 
condolences to the family and friends of James Bourque, who 
passed away last Saturday in Ottawa at the age of 60.
<P>
	Mr. Bourque was very active in native circles. His political 
career started very early. At the age of 18, he became president of 
the hunting and fishing club in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta. He then 
served as president of the Metis Association of the Northwest 
Territories, as Deputy Minister of Natural Resources for the 
Government of the Northwest Territories, and as chairman of the 
Northwest Territories' Commission for Constitutional 
Development.
<P>
	In 1984, he founded the Fur Institute of Canada where he served 
as chairman for four years. Mr. Bourque also performed important 
functions within the native community of the Northwest 
Territories.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of his friends said: ``Jim often expressed that his role as an 
elder was to keep cultural fires burning bright''. I think that 
statement summarizes this person well. Aboriginal peoples and 
environmentalists of Canada lose a great friend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of the Reform Party to pay tribute to James Bourque and 
to give our respects and condolences to his family.
<P>
	As was stated by our colleagues, Mr. Bourque was a well known 
aboriginal leader from the Northwest Territories. His heritage is 
truly Canadian. He was of both Cree and Ukrainian descent, but he 
devoted his life to Canada and to the betterment of all its people.
<P>
	All too often in life, public service goes unrecognized. Mr. 
Bourque gave a great deal of his life to the service of his country 
and for this effort we thank him. We encourage others, especially 
young people, to follow in his footsteps.
<P>
	We are looking forward to receiving the work that he has done 
with the commission on aboriginal affairs which we expect to be 
tabled in the House later this year.

Bourque.
<P>
	Unfortunately I did not have the privilege to know Mr. Bourque 
personally but from listening to the hon. member for Western 
Arctic that is definitely my loss.
<P>
	When I sat on the Citizen's Forum on Canada's Future 
representing Atlantic Canada I had the opportunity to travel the 
country and meet many of our aboriginal people. They are beautiful 
and we owe them a great deal.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Mr. Bourque was a well respected man. He served as president of 
the Northwest Territories Metis Nations from 1980 to 1982. His 
commitment to and leadership of the aboriginal community was a 
driving force which will be missed by all those who had the 
opportunity to work with him.
<P>
	Mr. Bourque has left behind a distinguished record of public 
service. He was named co-director of the policy for the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in 1994 and was appointed to 
the Privy Council in July 1992 by the Progressive Conservative 
government. Mr. Bourque served this country well and his record 
stands as a shining example for us all.
<P>
	I would like to extend the sincere condolences of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to Mr. Bourque's family, his wife Sharleen, his 
three children, Arthur, Valerie and Edwin, and his grandchildren. 
His loss will be deeply felt by all Canadians.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-29, 
an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances, be 
read the third time and passed; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-29 should have a subtitle ``this is the bill that time forgot''. It 
seems we have been debating this bill forever. This may be the first 
bill I ever spoke on. It has been going on and on. It is kind of like 
that bunny on television, it just keeps going and going.
<P>
	I am not sure what has happened except that there have been 
some interesting developments over the course of time. It is an 
opposition's duty to reveal the weaknesses of a bill and to see 
exactly how the ministers' arguments have unravelled when it 
comes to the reasons for bringing the MMT issue to the floor in the 
first place.
<P>
	Let me recap for a moment. Bill C-29 is a bill to ban the 
importation and interprovincial trade of MMT. MMT is a chemical 
that has become the substance of much controversy in Canada and 
to a lesser extent in the United States. It is a chemical added to 
unleaded gasoline to increase its octane.
<P>
	The makers of MMT argue that it makes engines more efficient. 
But in juxtaposition, the auto giants want Canada to stop using 
MMT because they say that it harms their onboard diagnostic 
systems in new cars.
<P>
	That is the essence of the argument. The minister has decided to 
ban the importation of MMT into Canada.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The American courts on April 14, 1995-and we warned them 
that this was coming-ordered the Environmental Protection 
Agency to grant a temporary waiver of its ban on MMT to the 
private company that wants to market it again. The U.S. Court of 
Appeals came out in favour of MMT once again. We hear that the 
Environmental Protection Agency is not going to appeal the latest 
ruling. In other words, the Environmental Protection Agency, a 
very stringent agency with standards as high as one could want, is 
not going to appeal the ruling that allows MMT. MMT is now 
allowed in the United States.
<P>
	In December 1994 Health Canada published a study which said 
that there is no health risk from MMT. That is why the minister 
cannot ban the substance. In order to ban it, it has to be proven to be 
unhealthy. Regardless of what the chairman of the environment 
committee might have said in the House just before question 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5567"> 5567 </A></B>
<P>
period, Health Canada published a study saying that there is no 
health risk from MMT.
<P>
	Even more ironic is that the new substance which will replace 
MMT is also known to cause increased pollution. Even while MMT 
is determined to be safe by Health Canada, the banning of MMT, 
Environment Canada itself says will increase nitrogen oxide 
emissions by a full 20 per cent. It is no wonder that this bill has 
been batting around the House of Commons now for a couple of 
years. The minister has not been able to supply to the House the 
reasons that this substance is being banned.
<P>
	It is the Reform Party's belief that we ought to make decisions of 
this type based on pure science, on rational logical arguments 
rather than on silly political considerations. That is why we 
continue to protest the government's trying to push this bill 
through. If the truth be known, I think it is why the government has 
been reluctant to push it too.
<P>
	The government could have pushed this through. It could have 
passed it long ago, but there is a little niggling doubt about whether 
or not the government is doing the right thing. That is why the bill 
has been around for so long.
<P>
	It is symbolic at least to me that this bill was introduced by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, one of the more political ministers 
in this House. Way back when she was Minister of the 
Environment, she brought this bill in.
<P>
	This is the same minister who seems to get up in the morning 
with a plan of the week national unity strategy, who seems to get up 
and scratch on the back of a breakfast napkin in the parliamentary 
restaurant regarding how we are going to hold Canada together. She 
comes up with flag programs, with the Canadian propaganda office 
and so on.
<P>
	This bill is opposed by people even within her own cabinet. The 
Minister for International Trade said that an import prohibition on 
MMT would be inconsistent with Canada's obligations under the 
WTO and the NAFTA. He said that Canada may also be susceptible 
to an investor state challenge under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA. That 
is from her own colleague, a minister, a warning to her.
<P>
	Nothing but the heavy hand of party discipline has kept this thing 
chugging along through the Liberal benches. They keep pushing 
this through and I can hardly believe why.
<P>
	To quickly recap, when the Minister of Canadian Heritage was 
the Minister of the Environment, three personal kerfuffles before 
her present position, she cited case after case that this study says 
that MMT is bad for the environment, and another one and another 
one. I stood at the end of the speech and asked the hon. minister to 
please table those reports in the House. This is the reason, right? It 
is bad for the environment. It is  going to cause all kinds of death, 
destruction, havoc and what have you.
<P>
	I asked her to table the studies in the House. The answer was no, 
that they were private studies. The private studies were done by 
whom? By the automotive industry, which happens to be heavily 
concentrated in her neck of the woods.
<P>
	We said to the government not to believe Ethyl Corp. if it does 
not want to, and not to believe the auto giants because they have a 
vested interest. We asked the government to commission a neutral 
study to determine the effects that MMT has on onboard diagnostic 
computers.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	Ethyl Corporation says it has done tests. It has a test to slap down 
here which says MMT does not harm the computers. The auto 
giants say it does harm the computers. Of course both sides have a 
vested interest.
<P>
	We say throw all those reports out. Let us have a neutral body, 
some research facility, either government owned or government 
commissioned, to study whether it has any negative effect on the 
environment. That would put the thing to rest for me. Let us get the 
scientific proof, not the political shenanigans, once and for all get it 
out on the table and we will know whether or not this stuff is 
harmful to the environment or to the computers.
<P>
	The government will not do that. What does it do? It continues to 
ban the substance for import and export, interprovincial trade and 
so on. Yet it has no independent scientific proof that it does any 
harm.
<P>
	Just before the break, the chairman of the environment 
committee mentioned that there is no real opposition to banning 
this in Canada, that it is strictly from one giant U.S. based 
corporation and that is the only reason there is any opposition to 
this. I have not seen those particular people here in the House of 
Commons speaking against it, but he says that is the only 
opposition. Let me read a few quotes from some of the other people 
who have raised the red flag over this.
<P>
	The premier of Alberta states: ``Banning MMT is likely to 
increase, not decrease emissions and Bill C-29 will cost refiners in 
western Canada alone approximately $100 million in capital 
investment and an ongoing annual cost of $15 million''. For 
Bombardier that is not a big deal. It can get a no interest loan, 
donate a little to the Liberal Party, get $87 million to $100 million 
in loans, $1 billion plus in loans over the last 10 years, it is no big 
deal. But for western Canadian refiners they are saying this is going 
to be a cost of $100 million and as the premier says, it will not 
decrease the emissions.
<P>
	Ty Lund, the Alberta minister of the environment, states: ``There 
is no indication and there is no scientific backing to suggest that 
there would be an improvement in the environment by banning 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5568"> 5568 </A></B>
<P>
MMT. As a matter of  fact, there is a risk''. Of course, that is just a 
guy from the west. What would he know anyway? I am sure the 
minister would say yes, but there are all these vested interests 
again.
<P>
	Let me quote Vaughn Blaney, the former New Brunswick 
minister of the environment, an easterner: ``Health Canada advises 
that there is no health related reason to restrict the use of MMT. 
Environment Canada advises that in fact they are not able to 
regulate the compound as being deleterious to the environment''. 
In other words, it is outside their purview. There is no reason to ban 
it.
<P>
	Of course, that is an easterner and a westerner. How about 
somebody from the middle of the country? How about the 
Saskatchewan minister of the environment, Bernhold Weins? As 
far as I know, Bernhold Weins being a member of the NDP 
government is not a close associate of mine. I will just quote what 
he said as someone from middle Canada: ``In our view the 
scientific data on MMT does not indicate a net environmental gain 
will result from the passage of this legislation''. But of course that 
is the NDP.
<P>
	We have had Conservatives, NDP, people in the east and people 
in the west. But this is probably a national unity issue so let us 
quote somebody from Quebec. FranÃ§ois Gendron, former Quebec 
minister of natural resources, said: ``The use of MMT even 
provides some benefits''. We are making progress. ``In fact it does 
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions which are ozone precursors''. In 
other words, the minister from Quebec says that MMT is not just 
neutral, it may even be beneficial to the environment.
<P>
	Guy Chevrette, the current Quebec minister of state for natural 
resources, states: ``It appears that the use of MMT could provide 
some benefits to the environment. The bill will have a major 
impact on the competitiveness of Quebec refineries''.
<P>
	Alberta refineries are saying it is $100 million, Quebec 
refineries as well. In other words, this is not a national unity issue 
at all. It happens to be a common sense scientific problem and the 
government for some reason, and I am perplexed as to why, has 
decided to avoid the logic, the scientific arguments and has decided 
to press ahead with this. I just do not understand it. Unless there are 
some political considerations in here I do not know why this is 
proceeding. That is all those governments and who knows what 
they know.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Health Canada is a fairly neutral body as far as I know. Health 
Canada said: ``Airborne manganese resulting from the combustion 
of MMT in gasoline powered vehicles is not entering the Canadian 
environment in quantities or under conditions that may constitute a 
health risk''. Health Canada, a neutral body, is saying this is not an 
issue.
<P>
	The chief monitoring and criteria division of Health Canada 
said: ``All analysis indicates that the combustion products of MMT 
in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the Canadian 
population''. How much more does the government need? The U.S. 
Environment Protection Agency said: ``MMT will not cause or 
contribute to the failure of any emission control device or system''.
<P>
	We could do a similar study in Canada if that is what the 
government would like. I am willing to support that but the 
government will not do it. It is going to push this through 
apparently.
<P>
	The board of trade of metropolitan Montreal said it is going to 
hurt jobs, it is going to hurt Canadians. A Toronto <I>Star</I> editorial 
said: ``Ottawa ought to watch and wait, not legislate'', a nice little 
rhyming conclusion.
<P>
	I wish the minister would reconsider his position, listen to his 
cabinet colleagues and others in the House who have said and 
proven time and again that this is a lousy piece of legislation for ill 
considered political gain.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ADMINISTRATIVETRIBUNALS(REMEDIALANDDISCIPLINARYMEASURES)ACT">ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS (REMEDIAL AND 
DISCIPLINARY MEASURES) ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 21, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies and to 
make consequential amendments to other Acts, be read the second 
time and referred to the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations; and the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5569"> 5569 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-49, an act to authorize 
remedial and disciplinary measures in relation to members of 
certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain 
federal agencies and to make consequential amendments to other 
Acts. Some title!
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	You will agree that with sentences that long, without a single 
comma, we have no idea what this bill is supposed to do. Let us try 
to wade through all this verbiage and see what it all means. We are 
told that the proposed amendments have the effect of abolishing 
271 positions to which appointments are made by the governor in 
council. This is absolutely ridiculous. The 261 positions mentioned 
are now vacant. There is no one filling those positions. There is no 
money to be saved. This is a lot of smoke and mirrors, nothing else.
<P>
	People often forget that administrative tribunals are above all a 
court of first resort for the citizen, one of the initial levels where 
citizens can be heard. We have, for instance, the Employment 
Insurance Tribunal. If a citizen is dissatisfied with a decision made 
by a public servant, he can go before an arbitration board before 
filing an appeal at any other legal level.
<P>
	There are a host of administrative tribunals that are creatures of 
the federal government. This bill confirms that many of them are 
useless, since the government proposes their outright abolition. 
Others will simply be reorganized, while the majority will not be 
affected.
<P>
	So this bill does not cover all administrative tribunals. The 
government is just giving us a sample. This is not a thorough 
reform, nor is it an in-depth study of each tribunal.
<P>
	If the government wants to preserve these administrative 
tribunals, as is the case here, it should have arranged for these 
authorities to play a real role. For instance, the Quebec government 
is also making an inventory of its arbitration boards and its 
administrative boards, but it is asking the real questions. The real 
questions are not being asked here, in other words, the 
independence and impartiality of judges and tribunals. Is the 
government asking these questions?
<P>
	Certainly not. The present government prefers to hide its head in 
the sand instead of asking the real questions. Are the people in 
these positions really independent? That is one of the questions that 
keeps coming up in connection with the appointment of the people 
who sit on these tribunals. I will get back to that later on.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The bill creates a new mechanism to remove from office people 
sitting on these tribunals. This is a good thing. It is about time the
<P>
government realizes that some people it has appointed are simply 
unfit to sit on an administrative tribunal.
<P>
	In fact, in a report on the future and mandate of the Canada Post 
Corporation recently tabled here in the House, under 
recommandation 28, the author said that the government should 
only appoint to the board of the Canada Post Corporation people 
having the necessary expertise and wherewithal to manage a 
company of that size.
<P>
	This confirms that political appointments- there are close to 
2,000 of them-are not suitable since the appointees are creatures 
of the government. They are being rewarded for services rendered.
<P>
	With this bill, the government is establishing a process allowing 
the chair of an administrative tribunal to ask the minister in charge 
whether any member of the tribunal should be subject to remedial 
or disciplinary measures. Of course, this can only be done on 
grounds such as infirmity, misconduct, failure to properly execute 
the office, and incompatibility.
<P>
	We are led to believe that an in-depth inquiry will be held. But 
we are fully aware that once again it is the minister who will 
decide. We always go back to the same issue, because it all boils 
done to this: the independence and impartiality of decision-makers 
or lack thereof. How can these tribunals be impartial when already 
the question of appointments is creating a problem? It is having 
repercussions within the board.
<P>
	A new provision of this bill also proposes a standard procedure 
for the appointment of chairpersons of administrative tribunals. It 
says that, from now on, chairpersons will be designated and not 
appointed.
<P>
	Can someone in this House tell me the difference? This is only a 
charade, smoke and mirrors, pure and simple. Once again this will 
undermine the credibility of all administrative tribunals. In other 
words, administrative tribunals are patronage heaven. As the elders 
in my region used to say, they are Â«patronage heavenÂ». We could 
have carried out a true reform of these tribunals or at least of the 
way they operate.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	It is of the utmost importance that these bodies be at arm's length 
with the government. They are not. These tribunals must absolutely 
be totally independent from the government. How can that be when 
they are appointed by the government? We have to admit that these 
appointments serve as rewards for friends of the government.
<P>
	You only have to look at the last <I>Hill times</I>; you will find a full 
half-page, in very small print, of Liberal patronage designations or 
appointments, whichever way you chose to call them, a list of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5570"> 5570 </A></B>
<P>
members of the Liberal Party who now hold positions everywhere, 
in the Senate, MP offices and administrative tribunals. The list 
goes on and on.
<P>
	Of course, when someone pays $1,000, $1,200 and up to $3,000 
to attend a political event or dinner, one expects at one point, 
whether they be lobbyists or others, to get something in return. Are 
these famous administrative tribunals not a way to get something in 
return?
<P>
	When these people must take major decisions that would 
embarrass the government-let us recall the last bill that was 
discussed earlier-might they not be tempted to go back, to step 
backwards, because they would have this sword of Damocles over 
their heads, which could bring about their removal from office?
<P>
	These people might also be reluctant to develop a case law that 
would be favourable, for instance, to a particular citizen and, in 
taking this decision, they could penalize the government. In this 
structure, in this whole hierarchy, it is not easy for the ordinary 
individual to finally be heard.
<P>
	Consequently, it is a measure that ensures the members of an 
administrative tribunal would be much more inclined to thank 
whomever appointed them. Of course, if someone embarrasses the 
government, he will be fired. Let us remember the maxim that 
says: ``Do not bite the hand that feeds you.'' I think it applies in this 
case.
<P>
	The government is going the wrong way with its Bill C-49, 
because it simply refuses to deal with the thrust of the matter, 
which is the appointment of people. The government must stop 
making appointments once for all. I am puzzled at the favouritism 
it is showing. When I was elected in 1993, some of my constituents 
came to tell me how there was favouritism in the appointment of 
some administrative tribunals. Since we were under the 
Conservative government, we saw a number of heads roll 
afterwards. They were rolling all over the place and in all the 
ridings ofof Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Changes were even made to mandates, as in proceedings before 
the Federal Court for instance. There were changes in counsel, 
changes in government, changes in the make-up of administrative 
tribunals. That is what parliamentary life is all about. Do not come 
and tell me that there is no connection between those in power and 
these individuals. As I said and as we know full well, these 
appointments are made to reward the friends of the government. 
There are several examples of this.
<P>
	New returning officers were just appointed by Elections Canada 
in the various ridings. Just by chance, a former Liberal member 
was appointed in my riding. What a coincidence. No one will have 
me believe that this person will be able to remain totally impartial 
in the performance of his duties.
<P>
	Looking at other appointments in neighbouring ridings, I 
realized that the same thing happened there. They have appointed 
all over the place Liberal candidates defeated in the last election, 
and God knows there were many Liberal candidates defeated in 
Quebec. Just take a look at <I>The Hill Times</I>. We would have to be 
blind not to see that these people will not be able to carry out their 
duties with all due impartiality.
<P>
	There is another concern, which we have experienced in this 
place as a matter of fact. The House will recall how those in charge 
of taking the census were appointed recently. That was done just 
recently. The government simply interfered with the process at 
Statistics Canada by sending its priority list. Do not come and tell 
me that the purpose of Bill C-49 is a sound reform of 
administrative tribunals. Patronage is the Liberal government's 
trademark, but we must not think that the Conservatives are any 
better. Nothing changes, except the patronage appointees, when 
one government goes out and a new one comes in.
<P>
	With this bill, the government retains control over all 
appointments. This kind of flies in the face of the basic principles 
of democracy, which are usually the impartiality and independence 
of administrative tribunals. One could naturally question the 
legitimacy of certain tribunals. I will address it later or another 
member of my party will complete my remarks.
<P>
	Since you are signalling that I have two minutes left, Mr. 
Speaker, let me just say that I believe this bill should be defeated 
without further ado. I request the unanimous consent of the House 
for tabling the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary measures in relation 
to members of certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain 
federal agencies and to make consequential amendments to other acts, having been 
passed by the Liberal majority of this House at second reading, be referred to every 
standing committee of the House of Commons dealing with an administrative 
tribunal covered by the bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the consent of the 
House to propose the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part 
in the debate on the bill dealing with government organization.
<P>
	Most of you know that this bill introduces the amendments 
announced in the second phase of the agency review, which deal 
primarily with governor in council appointments to government 
agencies and boards, and with the salaries paid to appointees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5571"> 5571 </A></B>
<P>
	These amendments will create a more effective and efficient 
system, streamline activities and increase accountability. This 
omnibus bill stems from the government's commitment to 
streamline its administration, to ensure that the existence of 
federal organizations other than the departments is still justified, 
and that their activities, structures and resources remain 
appropriate.
<P>
	In other words, as was pointed out earlier, these measures reflect 
the commitment made by the state to provide Canadians with a 
good government. In my opinion, the large support enjoyed by this 
bill shows how important it is to amend relevant legislative 
provisions.
<P>
	Let us take a look at its impact. The bill abolishes seven 
organizations which, after an in-depth review and consultation, 
were deemed no longer justified, while restructuring 13 others. In 
total, 271 positions filled by governor in council appointments will 
be eliminated which, contrary to what the hon. member who just 
spoke said, will result in savings of close to $3 billion. These 
savings are in addition to the ones that will result from Bill C-65 
and the administrative measures taken following the two phases of 
the agency review. In total, Canadian taxpayers will save at least 
$10 million, thanks to these initiatives.
<P>
	Just as important is the fact that the bill standardizes the 
appointment criteria for six organizations, as well as the level of 
accountability.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to turn now to the specific effects within the solicitor 
general's ministry. The legislation proposed by this bill will affect 
three specific areas, the National Parole Board, the external review 
committee of the RCMP, and the RCMP public complaints 
commission.
<P>
	The National Parole Board, as members know, is a significant 
component of our Canadian criminal justice system. It is 
responsible for making decisions about the timing and conditions 
of release in a manner that contributes to the long term protection 
of society.
<P>
	Experience has shown that gradual controlled re-entry of 
offenders into the community works well for the majority of 
offenders. In addition, conditional release minimizes the cost of the 
criminal justice system as the approximate costs of incarceration 
are in excess of $46,000 compared to the costs of supervision in the 
community of approximately $9,000.
<P>
	The second organization that will be affected by this proposal is 
the RCMP external review committee. This is a quasi-judicial body 
which reviews appeals of formal discipline, appeals of discharge or 
demotion and certain types of grievances involving regular and 
civilian members of the RCMP.
<P>
	The committee has over the last three years undertaken several 
initiatives which have resulted in a significant downsizing. This 
restructuring, in addition to the measures now being proposed, 
should further streamline the committee's organization.
<P>
	As for the RCMP's public complaints commission, this was 
created in 1986 to review complaints from the public concerning 
the conduct of members of the RCMP in the performance of their 
duties.
<P>
	The commission must ensure that individual members of the 
public have their complaints dealt with in a fair and impartial 
manner, and that the RCMP members against whom allegations are 
made are treated with fairness and objectivity. The legislation that 
is now before us will put into place needed reforms to make each of 
these three agencies more flexible and effective.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleagues of the important changes 
which are being proposed. In addition, in relationship to the 
National Parole Board, the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act will be amended to remove the ceiling on the number of 
National Parole Board members so the government can appoint 
more full time members instead of part time members. The result 
in this change will be an overall reduction in the number of 
individuals appointed as board members, resulting once again in 
cost and efficiency savings.
<P>
	In addition, the quality of decision making will be enhanced as 
board members will have more opportunities to use their 
experience, knowledge, skills and training.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act will be 
amended so that board members will hold office for a maximum of 
five rather than ten years, as is now the case, and may be 
re-appointed for a further five years. This amendment will bring 
the board into line with other agencies and boards and will allow it 
to renew the mandate of experienced and competent full-time 
board members.
<P>
	Given the importance of decision making and of the fundamental 
principle according to which the protection of society is the 
determining criterion in all cases, the act will drop any reference to 
an office of the board, giving the National Parole Board greater 
flexibility concerning the composition of such an office and its 
functions.
<P>
	With respect to the RCMP external review committee, the 
position of vice-chairman has been dropped and the size of the 
committee reduced from five to three members. The proposed 
amendments were considered very carefully and will allow the 
committee to continue to carry out its mandate satisfactorily.
<P>
	Similar changes were made to the RCMP public complaints 
commission. In the bill, the position of vice-chairman has been 
dropped and the number of members reduced from 29 to 15. This 
will not in any way, however, hamper the commission's effective-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5572"> 5572 </A></B>
<P>
ness. Instead, these amendments will improve management of the 
agency and resolve the issue of accountability.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the present government promised 
Canadians that it would reorganize government agencies and 
boards so that they could operate as effectively and efficiently as 
possible. These initiatives, which are part of our promise to 
manage the public's money better will mean that government 
commissions, agencies and advisory boards have the resources 
necessary to operate properly.
<P>
	This bill is another of the key elements this government is using 
to try to improve the integrity of institutions and to increase 
accountability to all Canadians.
<P>
	As you know, the department of the solicitor general is also 
prepared to do its part and is looking for more efficient and 
effective methods of operation. In order to achieve this, it is 
reducing the size of certain agencies and rationalizing activities so 
as to better respond to the challenges it must now face and to 
provide better service and be better prepared for the pressures to 
come in the years ahead.
<P>
	The solicitor general is pleased to contribute to the reform of 
legislative provisions regarding governor in council appointments 
to government agencies, commissions, and advisory boards as well 
as the remuneration of such persons.
<P>
	I am certain that all members recognize the importance of the 
changes proposed in the government organization bill. In 
conclusion, I hope that we will be able to count on the support of all 
members in the House to pass this bill as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the speech given by my brilliant colleague, 
the hon. member for Vaudreuil. I find him very optimistic. I notice 
however-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Are you making a comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Did you say: ``Resuming debate''?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is debate.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of the hon. member for 
Vaudreuil, who seems not to have heard, I reiterate that he portrays 
Bill C-49 as the greatest thing since sliced bread. This is far from 
being the case.
<P>
	As we can see, the hon. member for Vaudreuil, too, may benefit 
from bills like this one after the next election, because he will lose 
the only city in his riding where he received a majority of votes, so 
that the next member for Vaudreuil may well be a Bloc member.
<P>
	The current member for Vaudreuil, too, will have to stand in line 
in front of the Prime Minister's office, and he will probably be 
appointed to an administrative  tribunal, as suggested in Bill C-49. 
I think the hon. member for Vaudreuil has all the qualities required 
to do a good partisan job as a member of an administrative tribunal. 
I am not denying his skills and abilities.
<P>
	But let us get back to serious matters. In his 10-minute speech on 
Bill C-49, the hon. member for Vaudreuil was very careful, and 
with good reason, not to refer to clauses 1 through 13, preferring to 
focus on the reorganization of administrative tribunals, which may 
be dissolved, merged or combined. I agree with this. If some of our 
administrative tribunals are ineffective, inefficient or obsolete, the 
government's first responsibility is to abolish them.
<P>
	Except that the bill is much more vicious. This is not the real 
purpose of the bill. One just has to look at the calendar to 
understand why the bill was introduced in this House. Let me 
explain: the Conservatives were defeated on October 25, 1993. 
During that last month, in October 1993, they proceeded to make 
hundreds of partisan appointments. Just imagine the worst: they did 
it. It is true. They appointed about 500 people to various 
administrative committees.
<P>
	But if we take a look at the list of Liberal candidates who were 
defeated in the 1993 election in Quebec, and there were a lot of 
them, we see that the Liberal Party always rewards its friends. It 
always manages to find a place for them somewhere.
<P>
	That is what Bill C-49 does, because the Conservatives in many 
cases appointed their Conservative friends for five years, which 
means from October 1, 1993 until October 1, 1998, and thus 
outmanoeuvred the Liberals. In other words, the Liberals will have 
been in power for four years and a few months before the mandate 
of these people appointed by the Conservatives expires. So they 
have to find a way to get them out and appoint Liberals instead, and 
that is the role of Bill C-49. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I wish you 
would say this to the hon. member for Vaudreuil.
<P>
	Of course, I never saw a government come here and say: ``I am 
going to do some patronage, some favouritism, that is the purpose 
of my intervention''. Of course not. It is always about the 
government's effectiveness and about restoring fairness and equity. 
It is like the ministers of finance. I never saw a minister of finance, 
although I am certainly old enough, come here and say: ``My 
budget is not worth a damn. It is just garbage. Just throw it in the 
garbage, it is not worth a damn''. They always presented the budget 
as though it were the best thing in the world, but all these goodies, 
and I have been following this for the past 35 years have led to a 
deficit of more than $600 billion.
<P>
	Bill C-49 makes no difference. It does exactly what has always 
been done in this Parliament, in the name of equity and justice. But
<P>

<P>
that is not what it is all about. The Liberal philosophy is not as 
noble as all that. It is about rewarding our friends, about not 
abandoning friends who will have the courage to run in the next 
election and be defeated as we can expect to see happening in 
Quebec very shortly.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	They are actually achieving the dream of tendentious legislation. 
This is extraordinary. I must admit that in this regard you have 
something to teach me and all other Bloc members.
<P>
	Look at the first clauses, which the member for Vaudreuil 
refuses to debate, preferring to linger over cuts made here and 
there, the outdated administrative courts no longer necessary. Look 
at the essence of this bill. This bill actually contains 14 clauses, and 
not the 300 the member for Vaudreuil wants us to believe.
<P>
	Those 14 clauses have repercussions on existing administrative 
courts. Take the CRTC, for example. If only we had had Bill C-49 
when the minister of industry overturned the decisions of the CRTC 
regarding Power DirecTv, but the minister regretted he did not have 
this bill. If this bill had been in force, instead of having to bear the 
unbearable and having to overturn the decision of the CRTC, the 
minister could have simply fired the chairman of the CRTC. He 
could have asked the new chairman to review this decision. The 
minister did not do that. He could not, so he had to bear this odious 
decision and to take a decision which the public completely 
misunderstood. I can see why. Even we in this Chamber have still 
not understood it.
<P>
	Let's take for example, clause 5. It says that ``The Chairperson 
of an administrative tribunal may request the Minister-not a judge 
of a superior court-the Minister. Of course, if the Minister is 
looking for favours, he must have the upper hand. Therefore, the 
request is made to the Minister.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. The Chairperson of an administrative tribunal may request the Minister to 
decide whether any member should be subject to remedial or disciplinary measures 
for any reason set out in paragraphs 13(2)(<I>a</I>) to (<I>d</I>).</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is not difficult to understand, paragraphs 13(2)(<I>a</I>) to (<I>d</I>) read as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>)has become incapacitated from the proper execution of that office-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>)has been guilty of misconduct;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>)has failed in the proper execution of that office;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) has been placed, by conduct or otherwise, in a position that is incompatible-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is beautiful: incompatible. Remember this, Madam 
Speaker, you or the member for Vaudreuil can understand what 
incompatible means.
<P>
	Anyway, the request is made to the minister, who is told: ``There 
is on the committee a member whom we do not particularly like. 
First, he is not a true Liberal.'' This is already incompatible. He 
was probably appointed  by a previous government. Automatically, 
he is incompatible for the very reason that he is not a Liberal.
<P>
	The Minister is requested to do something about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Like Mr. Drouin, from Hydro-QuÃ©bec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I let the member for Vaudreuil speak when he had the 
floor. I did not interrupt, and I would ask him, through you, Madam 
Speaker, to return the favour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola: </B>It will be my pleasure, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel: </B>Then, a request is submitted to the minister from a 
good Liberal sitting on the same committee. You can imagine any 
committee in this case. The government has decided to beseige 
administrative tribunals. The minister will refer the case to a judge 
of the Superior Court, who will determine if the case is worth it. 
But the minister may even do something as soon as he receives the 
request. Even before he submits the case to a judge, he could 
``obtain [. . .]in an expeditious manner''.
<P>
	This is quite something. To go as far as to take advantage of its 
majority in the House to slip words like ``expeditious'' in a bill, the 
government must be bold. In fact, it must have lost all sense of 
decency.
<P>
	Nothing can stop it. ``-obtain, in an informal and expeditious 
manner, any information-'' means that the job of a guy is at stake 
and the minister may act ``in an informal and expeditious manner''. 
He may oust a guy who may carry on his duties in an able and 
honourable way, except for the fact that he does not think the same 
way as the minister.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	He may also refer the case to mediation, which would be quite 
similar to what the minister of defence-I was about to say the 
minister of war. It was not so bad as a name, ``minister of war'', 
because it is more or less what he is doing now-the minister of 
defence referred the case to mediation. How? He mediated with 
Jean Boyle and, apparently, we ended up with a bill of half a 
million dollars, which means we can as well just forget about it, the 
guy simply lost his job. In such a case the minister can negotiate 
the leave in order to appoint a friend because two cannot sit on the 
same chair.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6(<I>c</I>) request of the Governor in Council that an inquiry be held under section 7;</BLOCKQUOTE>
or, at the next paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) advise the Chairperson that the Minister considers that it is not necessary to take 
further measures under this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Paragraph (<I>d</I>) may be interpreted as saying to a member of an 
administrative tribunal criticizing a colleague before the Minister: 
``No, no, you are wrong, this is a good Liberal just like us. We will 
keep him. Do not touch him''. They are keeping that road open, 
because even between themselves they do not always recognize 
each other, they do not always know who is who and what they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5574"> 5574 </A></B>
<P>
doing. Therefore the Minister is  wise enough to reserve that way 
out. What if someone comes to report a good friend of his, he does 
not want to be stuck, he is not foolish enough to do that.
<P>
	On the other hand, if the member being denounced is a Tory or a 
Reform member, or, very improbably, a Bloc member, then of 
course it will no holds barred. They will stick it to him; his case 
will be brought before a higher court judge, probably a good friend 
of the party, like the judge recently appointed in Alberta, a Liberal, 
Justice Gerald Allbright. This is exactly the type of person whom 
such a case would be referred to because he has a Liberal 
background. I do not doubt his integrity, I would say that one would 
trust this judge, he would do the dirty work and get rid of the 
administrative tribunal member.
<P>
	Now, you are going to ask who is going to get rid of the 
chairperson of an administrative tribunal, since the chairperson is 
the one who blows the whistle on the members. Who can blow the 
whistle on the chairperson? A member does not have the power to 
do so. The minister, who is not crazy, has understood all this. He 
has made it his business to appoint a chairperson who will side with 
him, decide for him, agree with him. In other words, a chairperson 
who will not abide by the ethics rules of the administrative tribunal.
<P>
	This will be to the glory of the minister, who will be able to 
remove from office a chairperson appointed by the former Prime 
Minister, to appoint his own. Should there be an electoral defeat, he 
wants to be able to fill positions with his chums. The issue of 
contracts has been dealt with. The opposition is on the look-out. 
There are still some contracts without tender, but in fewer numbers. 
The government can no longer say: ``Here is the purse, run with 
it''. We are in the hole, we have had it up to here with the deficit. 
What it is saying is: ``I cannot give you too big a reward, but at 
least I will give you a little job. You will have it for five years and, 
with luck, we might be able to renew your mandate two or three 
times. You will not have to work too hard and you will have a nice 
pension. But never cross me''. This is what perverts administrative 
tribunals.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have looked into this problem, which is common 
place throughout Canada. I will tell you what I know from personal 
experience with the Commission de protection du territoire 
agricole, for instance. One thing leading to another, the 
Commission de protection du territoire agricole reached a point 
where it was having to defend the Quebec act to preserve 
agricultural land. It was acting as a defender of the act, as if it had 
passed it itself. The situation was rectified, sure, but the danger 
remains that an administrative tribunal could lose the neutrality it 
should have as a tribunal and devote itself entirely to enforcing the 
law as its mandate requires.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	There is an important nuance here, which I hope the hon. 
member for Vaudreuil will grasp.
<P>
	<B>An. hon. member:</B> I would be surprised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> I would be surprised too, but you never know. This is 
the problem with Bill C-49. It was given a very impressive title: an 
act to authorize remedial and disciplinary measures in relation to 
members of certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize and 
dissolve certain federal agencies and to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts. Is it not great! A better title would have 
been: an act to profit the friends of the Liberal Party of Canada. It 
would have been more to the point and more accurate, truer and 
franker. Of course they would not have the guts to do that, but this 
really is the spirit of the bill.
<P>
	When, for example, the chairperson of an administrative tribunal 
realizes that refusing an application to the CRTC from a member of 
the family of the Prime Minister would be synonymous with loss of 
job, he or she says yes. Should that chairperson have the misfortune 
to be honest and fair, after all he or she is exercising the duties he or 
she has sworn to perform and deny the application-as it happened 
with PowerTv Direct-the minister, by the powers he has provided 
for himself would-
<P>
	The hon. member for Vaudreuil will understand it is not enough 
that justice be done. I said the hon. member for Vaudreuil, Madam 
Speaker, looking at you of course. I tell you that the hon. member 
for Vaudreuil-even if you tried to psyche me out, but I 
recovered-should understand that it is not enough that justice be 
done there should also be a perception that justice has been done. 
There should be an appearance of justice, no matter what the hon. 
member for Vaudreuil might say. That is what will not come out of 
decisions now. That is what will ensure we will always be-You 
know, with the opinion the public has of politicians, this is not 
going to improve matters.
<P>
	There are some rules within an administrative tribunal. The 
administrative tribunals have been called, it is not I who say it, but 
a journalist, and it is true, because we can find the same definition 
in Dussault, RenÃ© Dussault, a former Liberal candidate in Quebec 
and a superior court judge. Recently, the president of the bar in 
Quebec was very clear on that when she said, and I quote: ``The 
lack of employment security could have unsuspected psychological 
effects on the decisions of a person who might be more concerned 
with pleasing the authorities than doing justice.'' This is 
self-explanatory.
<P>
	As hard as the Liberals may try to defend that, they are 
defending the undefensible, and the public will hold it against 
them. When justice will no longer be meted out by an 
administrative tribunal unless a Liberal Party membership card is 
displayed, the Liberals will have to give some explanation and then 
live with the consequences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, since  I have been 
singled out in this debate, I feel I have an obligation to speak up 
even if I spoke earlier. I have a point to make. True, previous 
governments have always made appointments. Just before the last 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5575"> 5575 </A></B>
<P>
election, the previous government gave us the finest example of 
patronage.
<P>
	It is wrong to say in this House that this bill is aimed only at 
rewarding and placing our Liberal friends. We have no lessons to 
receive from Bloc Quebecois members or the PQ government.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The day after the PQ government was elected, they fired a whole 
bunch of people, starting with none other than the President of 
Hydro-Quebec, who was respected by everyone and doing an 
excellent job. Coincidentally, they replaced him with a PQ 
member. They also systematically replaced all foreign delegates 
who refused to serve their cause. These officials were dismissed 
and replaced with separatists. This government has no lesson to 
receive from them.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to cut positions. I will give you a few 
examples: the number of appointments will be reduced from 29 to 
5. Appointees will serve for 5 years instead of 10. Future 
governments will thus be prevented from always replacing 
appointees or increasing their numbers.
<P>
	As for my re-election, I did lose the Island of Montreal, my 
greatest city, because I served as mayor of the City of Kirkland, 
something I am proud of. I challenge them to come and campaign 
in my riding. We will fight them and we will win. We will take 
another 20 seats in Quebec in the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member says the Bloc has 
nothing to teach him. We have indeed nothing to teach them about 
patronage. Let me just name a few names: Gerald Allbright. Do 
you know him? He is a true Liberal who has been appointed to a 
court in Saskatchewan. Lucie Blais. She has been appointed to the 
National Council of Welfare. She was defeated as a Liberal 
candidate in Abitibi.
<P>
	Claire Brouillet, defeated in Terrebonne. RÃ©mi Bujold, a loyal 
lobbyist is well rewarded. Yves Caron, appointed to the Canada 
Pension Commission, another former MP from 1972 to 1979 and 
secretary to the Minister of Agriculture for a while. Guy Chartrand, 
listen to this, defeated in Longueuil, appointed to the staff of the 
defence minister.
<P>
	Caroline ChrÃ©tien, no comment, her family name says it all. 
Denis Coderre. This guy tried on approximately five separate 
occasions to get himself elected under the banner of the Liberal 
Party of Canada in ridings in Montreal's east side. He went as far as 
to claim, after a former member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie whose 
name I forget died, that he was a buddy of his, when in fact he 
could not stand him. There is also a certain RenÃ© Cousineau, a 
former member of the Liberal Party of Canada and member for 
Gatineau.
<P>
	I must agree with the hon. member for Vaudreuil that, on the 
whole stinking subject of political patronage, they are indeed the 
winners, there is nothing we can teach them.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to know if I still have 
some time left to finish my reply.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is five 
minutes left for questions and comments. I believe you had the 
floor when we interrupted the proceedings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I simply wanted to assert my rights. 
As I was saying to the hon. member for  Vaudreuil, who is still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5576"> 5576 </A></B>
<P>
listening and who certainly, through the Chair, agrees, I ask him to 
rise and to tell me whether what I am saying is false.
<P>
	David Berger was appointed Canadian ambassador to Israel and 
he is not a Bloc member. He is a well-known Liberal. All the names 
I have here are those of well-known Liberals.
<P>
	There is a lady, who ran in Laval East but was defeated. Her 
name is Raymonde Lacour and she was just appointed on an 
immigration committee with an annual salary of $84,000. I say to 
the Liberals that they have become masters at looking after their 
friends.
<P>
	Going back to the original question, the Conservatives were not 
far behind the Liberals. By early October 1994, the Conservatives 
had filled just about every available and unavailable position with 
Conservative appointees, usually for a period of five years.
<P>
	Now, the Liberals will call an election before the five-year terms 
of these Conservative appointees is over. Consequently, they feel 
cheated because they cannot postpone it, they cannot distribute the 
patronage goodies the way they would like to. So, with Bill C-49, 
they will show the door to just about all the Conservatives who 
hold these positions, by invoking of course the provisions 
contained in clauses 5 and 6. They will thus be able to fill the 
positions left vacant by appointing long-time friends and new ones 
as well.
<P>
	I am even told that in the Quebec city area, an old Conservative 
MP was just appointed to a very lucrative position and is 
considering, as a way of thanking the government, running under 
the Liberal banner at the next election. This is quite something and 
it is even worse considering it is in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	This is why I was saying to the hon. member for Vaudreuil that, 
when it comes to patronage, we have nothing to teach the Liberals. 
They are the undisputed champions of patronage, and they have 
been since the early days of the Canadian federation. No, we will 
not try to compete with them in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy today to participate in 
the debate. The bill before the House, as we know it, Bill C-49, is 
very much in line with our government's policies.
<P>
	In 1993 one of our platform policies was getting government 
right, and this measured approach has resulted in benefits to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	One might ask how was government wrong. I think we have 
heard some things this afternoon and we all have stories of how 
government is wrong and we could talk about them all day, but I am 
not going to do that. I think the best way to answer this is by 
illustrating how we are getting government right.
<P>
	I would like to start by outlining the key objectives of such a 
policy: reducing the financial burden of the federal government, 
reviewing all government activities in light of today's realities, and 
restoring integrity in the system. Those are the three Rs of 
government: reduce, review and restore. They are the cornerstone 
of much of what this government has done, what it is doing now 
and what it will continue to do.
<P>
	When attacking the deficit we wanted to set goals and we wanted 
to meet them. The last thing Canadians needed was another 
government with broken deficit targets.
<P>
	Members will recall that the previous government promised 
reduced deficits but in fact each year of that administration the 
deficit increased.
<P>
	The financial markets wanted to see a government meet its 
targets. In fact, we did more than that. We have exceeded our 
targets. In 1994-95 we beat our target by $400 million. Last year it 
was beaten by $4 billion and we are on target again this year. By the 
end of the 1997-98 fiscal year we will have reduced the deficit by at 
least 60 per cent in just four years. I think these are very good 
results.
<P>
	As a result of these actions the market again has confidence in 
the federal government and we are seeing the benefits. Interest 
rates have just fallen again. The prime rate is at its lowest level in 
38 years. And that, my hon. colleagues, is because this government 
is meeting and exceeding its deficit targets.
<P>
	The government is creating the right economic environment for 
job creation. Businesses can invest more when the cost of 
borrowing is lower. Entrepreneurs have better access to capital to 
realize their dreams. Not only that, but they in turn hire and employ 
their fellow Canadians.
<P>
	I do not think I could make my point any stronger except if I 
would be allowed to give a few examples of expansion projects and 
the creation of new firms that have occurred this year in my 
province. I will list a few of them.
<P>
	In my city of Charlottetown, currently under construction is a $4 
million expanded Canadian Tire. In December McCains will open a 
new $3 million expansion. This summer I participated in the 
opening of Diversified Metal Engineering. DME is world 
renowned for its manufacturing equipment for the micro brewery 
industry. Cycor Communications merged with a local hook-up 
communications to establish a new call centre, creating 50 new 
jobs. I could go on but these are some of the major expansions.
<P>
	Now for the entrepreneurial achievements of Prince Edward 
Islanders. Let me remind this place that Prime  Edward Island is a 
small province and these projects make a big difference. The 
start-up of some of the new firms, although small, may have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5577"> 5577 </A></B>
<P>
same effect in Prince Edward Island as a large auto plant opening in 
Ontario. For instance, Prince Edward Island Wild Blueberry 
Company has a $5 million new processing plant in the riding of my 
colleague from Cardigan with 40 full time jobs. Simscape 
Development Corporation, an information technology firm in 
Charlottetown, has started with international sales as far away as 
Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I have saved the best for last. Prince Edward Island has a brand 
new and completely modern fibre optic telephone system. A 
second fibre optic connection with the mainland will be achieved 
next spring when the Confederation bridge is completed. In the 
light of all of this, many companies are investing in Prince Edward 
Island.
<P>
	The examples I have given of the achievements of the islanders 
illustrate just how the government is getting government right. 
Businesses are expanding and new businesses are being created. 
We have set the stage for the private sector to create jobs which 
Canadians want and need.
<P>
	However, so far this is only part of the big picture. When cutting 
the deficit we did more than just cut departmental budgets, we 
initiated the most extensive program review the federal 
government has ever seen. Everything was analysed and evaluated. 
By doing so, we reduced waste and duplication. Some departmental 
programs were redesigned and consolidated. Some government 
services that should be delivered by the private sector or by other 
levels of government were rationalized without jeopardizing the 
interests of Canadians.
<P>
	It is not enough to modernize federal departments and agencies, 
we have also modernized Parliament. We know that we have not 
gone far enough, but measures were introduced to improve 
reporting to Parliament and to give more influence to individual 
MPs and standing committees in developing policy and legislation. 
There is much more to do in this area but this is a great beginning.
<P>
	Many activities that affect our daily lives are governed by 
federal regulations. In this fast paced world these regulations must 
reflect today's realities. The Liberal government modernized the 
regulatory process in areas such as health, safety, the environment, 
international trade and interprovincial matters. In the same spirit, 
other administrative changes have been made. Prior to Bill C-49 
the government conducted a review of federal agencies and 
advisory bodies, with eliminations and reductions affecting some 
70 bodies and 600 governor in council appointed positions.
<P>
	Continuing that modernization, Bill C-49 will eliminate another 
271 governor in council appointments and result in annual savings 
<P>
of $2.5 million. That will bring the total annual savings in the 
review to about $10 million.
<P>
	I will save my hon. colleagues the torture of not going into detail 
on the whole bill. However, I will cover the implications of this bill 
on the labour branch of Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
	The obvious question is how this bill will affect the Canada 
Labour Relations Board. The CLRB is an autonomous, 
quasi-judicial tribunal responsible for the interpretation and 
application of part I, industrial relations, and parts of part II, 
dealing with occupational safety and health of the Canada Labour 
Code. The changes to the board, which are done by way of 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code, are only of an 
administrative nature.
<P>
	In keeping with current conventions of more neutral 
terminology, appropriate modifications are proposed. 
Clarifications will be made to the travel provisions to which 
appointees are entitled, thus increasing the board's cost 
effectiveness.
<P>
	Another change will be to amend the requirements for a board 
member to be a Canadian citizen, to allow a permanent resident 
eligibility for a board position. This complies with the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Also under the labour branch is the Canadian Artists and 
Producers Professional Relations Tribunal. It too will have minor 
changes, such as clarification of the travel provisions for tribunal 
members, standardization of the remedial and disciplinary 
measures process and the inclusion of part time members of the 
tribunal as a protection of the Government Employees 
Compensation Act.
<P>
	The coverage entails compensation for death or injury while 
performing duties or while on a flight taken in the course of duty. It 
is only common sense to have members covered in the case of 
unfortunate incidents.
<P>
	Another agency affected is the Canadian Centre for 
Occupational Health and Safety. It is a departmental corporation 
under schedule II of the Financial Administration Act and reports 
to the Minister of Labour. This centre was created in 1978 with a 
mandate to promote the fundamental right of Canadians to a 
healthy and safe working environment.
<P>
	There is agreement among the members of the council of 
governors that the council is too large. Costs to the organizations 
which sponsor members who sit on the council of governors will be 
reduced, as will the administration costs for meetings and the 
processing of appointments. CCOHS has been directed to become 
revenue self-sufficient and these amendments will contribute to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5578"> 5578 </A></B>
<P>
that goal. As in changes to the CLRB, some minor modifications 
will be made to the terminology of the act.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In closing, I would like to cover the effects of Bill C-49 on the 
Labour Adjustment Review Board. My hon. colleagues may 
wonder why the government is making amendments to this board. 
The fact is the board has not been required since 1987. The Labour 
Adjustment Benefits Act under which the Labour Adjustment 
Review Board was established was replaced in 1988 by the 
program for older workers adjustment.
<P>
	As of March 31, 1995 there were 1,855 Canadians still receiving 
benefits under that program. To maintain the legal authority to 
continue payments to current recipients, the government is 
amending rather than repealing the act. Consequently, these 
amendments have no effect on the remaining recipients. These 
benefits end at age 65. Therefore, the number of beneficiaries and 
the amount of total annual benefits are diminishing each year.
<P>
	As I have pointed out, the government is doing what previous 
governments have failed to do. The deficit has been reduced to its 
lowest level in over a decade. Federal institutions have undergone a 
program review that will increase their cost effectiveness while 
improving service to Canadians. In short, Bill C-49, the 
Administrative Tribunals Remedial and Disciplinary Measures Act 
is just one more example of us getting government right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
my very hon. colleague across the way talked about how well the 
government is undertaking programs, basically patronage and 
grants and so on, in P.E.I.
<P>
	When I was a young fellow about 16 years old I left Nova Scotia 
because basically there were no jobs. I joined the military. I 
thought that was the only way that a lot of us down there at the time 
could get jobs. In those days a lot of young fellows went to Toronto 
to get work. Today they seem to be going even further west to 
British Columbia.
<P>
	When I went to Nova Scotia this summer, as I do from time to 
time, it was almost 30 years to the month when I left. I was back 
talking to some young people in Nova Scotia who were very 
discouraged and who saw no real job proposals on the line. It 
reminded me of the situation I was in in my younger years.
<P>
	Government after government over the last 30 years, Liberal and 
Conservative, have consistently bragged about how well they have 
done in Atlantic Canada creating jobs, when in fact the 
unemployment situation down there is no better than it was 30 
years ago. To stand in the House today and say that our government 
is doing a great job, our government is dealing with this situation 
through a series of grants, subsidies and so on, I think the members 
across the way know that is probably really not the case.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell the House how and if he can 
relate to the situation I have described, whether or not these 
programs in the long term really have helped Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
Fraser Valley West for his questions and comments. What he said 
about the way it has been in Atlantic Canada for as long as I can 
remember certainly is true. I cannot remember probably as long as 
he can but pretty near.
<P>
	There have been many ideas put forward over the last 50 years 
on how to improve the plight of Atlantic Canadians. Some have 
worked and some have not. We all know the stories, the good ones 
and the bad ones. As I said in my speech, the government is getting 
things in line. There are many more permanent jobs in Atlantic 
Canada today than there was certainly in my time as a young 
person there. As I said, we are doing the right thing in the 
telecommunications industry and in the food processing industry. 
In my province, for instance, the food processing industry has 
stabilized the potato industry. A few years ago they were 
processing about 15 per cent of the crop. Today the average is much 
higher than that. More potatoes are grown and prices have 
stabilized.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The premier of New Brunswick over the years has done some 
things with infrastructure dealing with communications and has 
brought to that province a lot of permanent jobs.
<P>
	Many mistakes were made in the past. Nobody would ever 
dispute that. They tried to do industry the same as they did 
industries in bigger centres closer to the big markets of the United 
States. We have to look at what we are doing in Atlantic Canada. 
We have to deal with the areas we can deal with, that is, in natural 
products and in the high tech industry. We are on the right road.
<P>
	We need these regional development agencies. Members kind of 
talk about these things as great giveaways. They are not great 
giveaways. They are organizations where money is loaned to 
entrepreneurs to help get a start in the private sector to get these 
jobs going. Ninety-eight per cent of ACOA's programs are 
successful. Any entrepreneur will tell members that is the way to 
go.
<P>
	We do not have to make any apologies for this. Regional 
development programs are a great thing for every province of the 
country. Certainly they are doing a great job today in Atlantic 
Canada and I look to many more years of them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a quick question for the member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5579"> 5579 </A></B>
<P>
	I have heard quite a bit today. I have been reading in the news 
lately about the number of loans that the government is giving to 
various corporations and businesses so those businesses can 
expand and create jobs.
<P>
	I am a little curious about exactly why the government would do 
that when the country has a $600 billion debt. We are trying to fight 
a deficit and the government has been working hard to get interest 
rates down.
<P>
	Why does the government not let the banks loan the money to 
these businesses? Let them borrow the money. Is that not what 
banks are for? Are interest rates not lowered for that reason? Would 
it not make more sense to ask these people to borrow their money 
from lending institutions and stop giving away taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Wild 
Rose for his question but I disagree. The government is not giving 
away taxpayers' dollars. There is no money being given away any 
more. We are leveraging jobs by loaning money to large 
corporations. They, in turn, are borrowing money from the banks 
also. That is creating an environment where there will be jobs 
created. These people will come into an area, either set up plants or 
expand plants to do these things.
<P>
	This is a very good investment by government. In my province 
there are what would be considered big companies that have 
received loans from the federal government. For every dollar that is 
loaned to them, if they could get the return from everything else on 
that, then we will not have to worry in the years ahead about 
unemployment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great intent to the words of wisdom coming 
from my hon. colleague from Hillsborough. I congratulate him on 
his remarks.
<P>
	I have a brief question. The hon. member will recall very vividly 
when we arrived here as a government party in the late fall of 1993 
that we were faced with a $42 billion plus deficit, a $500 billion 
plus debt, $6 billion deficit in the unemployment insurance fund. 
Magazines in New York were saying that we were almost on the 
point of being a third world country.
<P>
	Does it not give the hon. member and his constituents, indeed all 
the constituents of Atlantic Canada, and I would think all of 
Canada, a lift to know that they have a government in place that has 
met its commitment, its goals and in fact exceeded its goals in the 
past three years.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	We are on the road to meet our goals this year and next year. A 
week or so ago the finance minister announced that in 1998-99 the 
deficit would be down to $9 billion. I think that is exciting news. I 
would ask my hon. colleague from Hillsborough to comment on 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
comments and questions. Yes, this is a time when people in Canada 
are feeling very good. It is noted as we look at the newspapers each 
day.
<P>
	My hon. colleague talked about the magazines in the United 
States talking about us getting to the status of a third world country. 
Now the magazines in New York City and the financial centres are 
saying that Wall Street loves Canada. This is an example of what 
has happened in three short years of what this government has 
done. It has the deficit under control. It has put a surplus in the 
unemployment insurance so that we know if it gets into a deficit 
situation again the money will be there to take care of it.
<P>
	We are on the road to a great recovery. I feel very good about it, 
as I know everybody does in this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak to Bill C-49. Before getting 
to the heart of the matter, it would be appropriate to examine the 
title of this bill.
<P>
	This bill is entitled an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies and to 
make consequential amendments to other Acts.
<P>
	My first comment is that we realize once again that this 
government, with a title-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Point of order, Madam 
Speaker. I understand that the sequence of speakers was Bloc, 
Liberal, Reform. Did you not go Bloc, Liberal, Bloc?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will ask the 
clerk if we have the right sequence.
<P>
	We have checked the sequence. I resumed debate with the hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans and then the hon. 
member will have his time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague may certainly raise a 
point of order, as for me, I will try to land on my feet.
<P>
	I was saying that, with such a mellifluous title, this government 
is proving to be a master of illusion and deception, for it is 
presenting a harmless looking bill to rectify a problem. Remedial 
and disciplinary measures must be taken in relation to members of 
administrative tribunals. Nobody could argue with that. We have 
seen that in other areas, where the government tried to make us 
believe it had plugged the loophole of family trusts by taking 
energetic and quick measures, nothing had been plugged at all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5580"> 5580 </A></B>
<P>
	So, at first sight, without the serious and in-depth study that 
the Bloc members have done, one might think this bill was a good 
one and wonder why we are opposing it.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Well, I will tell you what we have against it. In the few minutes I 
have left, I will try to demonstrate that this bill will perpetuate the 
principle of patronage appointment of political friends. I explain: 
this bill brings major changes into the working of administrative 
tribunals.
<P>
	But first, let us ask ourselves: what is an administrative tribunal? 
The <I>Dictionnaire de droit quÃ©bÃ©cois et canadien</I> defines 
administrative tribunal as a body, in principle autonomous and 
independent from the government, to which the government has 
given the power to settle disputes between itself and the citizens.
<P>
	I stress the words ``in principle autonomous and independent 
from the government''. Let us remember these words and keep 
them in a little file somewhere in our memory; I will get back to 
this point in my remarks. Let us see if this bill corresponds to the 
definition of maintaining autonomous bodies, independent from 
government.
<P>
	At the outset-I wanted to do it and I nearly forgot to do it-I 
gave the legal definition of the term administrative tribunal, but 
what does that mean in the real world? It represents a level of 
authority where ordinary citizens can be heard before judges or 
commissioners with some degree of independence and the 
confidence that his or her point of view will be heard.
<P>
	Why is the ordinary citizen asking to be heard? Because he or 
she feels himself or herself the victim of injustice from the 
machinery of government, and we know how complicated it can 
get. All hon. members certainly have had constituents come to their 
riding offices on a Friday or a Monday and tell them: ``It is just 
unbelievable. I have been had by the system. This interpretation of 
the legislation is wrong. The official was unfair to me because he 
does not like me''.
<P>
	I do not want to make any blanket statement about public 
officials, because they are human beings, after all. They may not 
feel too good certain days and dislike anybody stepping on their 
toes. They may make a restrictive interpretation of the legislation. 
That is what is so marvellous with human beings. Sometimes they 
feel fine and sometimes they feel bad.
<P>
	A private citizen who thinks he has been unfairly treated can 
appeal to the relevant administrative tribunal. This bill gives a list 
of such administrative tribunals. Let me name a few just so we can 
see what kind of issues in our daily lives federal administrative 
tribunals can deal with.
<P>
	There is the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and 
Safety Board, the RCMP External  Review Committee, the 
Canadian Grain Commission, the Immigration and Refugee Board, 
the RCMP Public Complaints Commission, and the Public Service 
Staff Relations Board. This board is for public servants who feel 
they have been treated unfairly by their immediate supervisor. 
They can take their case to the Public Service Staff Relations 
Board. They hope their case will dealt with according to the basic 
rules of natural justice.
<P>
	There are also the Copyright Board, the National Parole Board, 
and so on. This is just to give you an idea of what an administrative 
tribunal is all about in federal law.
<P>
	This debate has been going on in Quebec for more than 25 years, 
and many reports and studies have been tabled in the National 
Assembly. I would like to take this opportunity to praise the 
splendid work of Quebec justice minister Paul BÃ©gin in his reform 
of administrative tribunals. I know the justice department in 
Quebec is working very hard on this, and some good points should 
come out of this endeavour.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	But what we are discussing here is very important: the 
independence and impartiality of judges of administrative 
tribunals. The fundamental problem resulting from the political 
appointment of administrative tribunal judges could have remedied 
by Bill C-49. We have to admit that, once again, the Liberal 
majority-and a majority government is a fine democratic 
institution-decided in this case to bury its head in the sand.
<P>
	And that, at a time when people are so suspicious about 
politicians. I remind the House of a poll published last year in the 
magazine <I>L'ActualitÃ©</I>, which said that only 4 per cent of the people 
still trusted the politicians. When people follow the debates or 
come here for question period, they can see that we do not deserve 
more than 4 per cent support, given the abuse, insults and invective 
hurled about in this place, when it is not expressions of love.
<P>
	We, Quebecers, remember that people from the rest of Canada 
came to see us last year to say how much they loved us. We 
appreciate such demonstrations. This is overwhelming love. It 
hurts us, but we love to be loved.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board should have done the 
honourable thing and made a courageous stand by dealing squarely 
with the issue of the political appointment of administrative 
tribunal members. On the contrary, he is leaving even more room 
for party politics, by increasing the power politicians have over the 
administrative tribunals. How can we trust an administrative 
tribunal when we know that its members were appointed by the 
government party, whatever its political stripes?
<P>
	We, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, will be repeating in the 
1997 election what we said in the 1993 election, that is: ``Liberal or 
Conservative, it is six of  one and half a dozen of the other. They 
are are all alike. Pop them all in a hat, then pull them out one by 
one, and they are are just the same''. During the nine years of the 
Mulroney government, partisan appointments were legion. Since 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5581"> 5581 </A></B>
<P>
1993, the current government has been making partisan 
appointments.
<P>
	I am convinced that, later, if my Liberal colleagues ask me good 
questions, I will be able to refer to the list published in <I>The Hill 
Times</I> of last week, and it appears that we will have the second part 
in this week's edition, with respect to appointments. These were 
compiled by the Hon. Senator Marjory LeBreton.
<P>
	In this bill, there were two changes of particular interest to us. 
First, there is the issue of new disciplinary measures. Once again, 
we are not against what is good, we agree. All depends on the way 
the issue is approached.
<P>
	Clause 3 of the Bill provides for a new mechanism for the 
removal from office of a member of an administrative tribunal 
appointed by the Governor in Council. Following certain 
procedures, the Governor in Council will be able to remove a 
member from office with reason. The Chairperson of the tribunal 
will be able to set the process in motion by asking the minister if 
the member should be subject to remedial or disciplinary measures. 
This is the meaning of clause 5.
<P>
	The Chairperson will then invoke one of the four following 
reasons: the member has become incapacitated, has been guilty of 
misconduct-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. Could we have a quorum count, please.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is a 
quorum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, we will resume debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Madam Speaker, I must admit that this was a 
very difficult delivery. I do not know whether it will be a breech 
birth and whether forceps will be needed to finish my speech.
<P>
	Maybe I am too good and the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley-West is trying to distract me. This is the second time I have 
been interrupted. I wish the Liberals would not go. Continue 
listening to me, even though I am not as interesting as you would 
like, but at least try to see to it that we have a quorum. It is your 
responsibility to see to it that we have a quorum, since there are 177 
of you to do it anyway.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	So, the bill will standardize the appointment of the 
administrative tribunal chairpersons; this is the second point on 
which our party wants to focus. This is the core of the issue, what I 
would call the heart of it. From now on, chairpersons will be 
designated instead of being appointed for a determinate and 
renewable mandate. That is a subtle nuance. I am sure that 
everybody here understands the difference between ``designation'' 
and ``appointment''. Someone who is designated can be removed at 
pleasure, for whatever reason, while someone who is appointed is 
there for three, five or seven years, according to the duration of his 
or her mandate, which ensures some degree of stability in the 
position. And I have not even mentioned the appointment process, 
which is defective from the start.
<P>
	When partisan appointments continue to be made according to 
political stripes or favours obtained, we must conclude that the 
process is biased. The fact that the chairpersons will be designated 
instead of being appointed is cause for concern. Things are a lot 
easier when people are designated, because they can be removed at 
the first opportunity. This situation makes chairpersons extremely 
vulnerable to political pressures from the government since they 
can be replaced at will by that government.
<P>
	The new measures could very well further undermine the already 
shaken credibility of administrative tribunals and make them even 
more submissive to political power. Without a complete 
overhaul-this is what we were expecting from the President of the 
Treasury Board-of appointments to administrative tribunals, it is 
unacceptable to introduce measures that seriously undermine the 
independence and impartiality of administrative tribunals. It 
becomes a vicious cycle of perpetual patronage.
<P>
	We all know that the President of the Treasury Board, by his 
attitude in this matter, is refusing to tackle these important issues, 
because he does not want to give up the sacrosanct power of 
ministers to make appointments to administrative tribunals.
<P>
	Any change or amendment to administrative tribunals must 
focus on the arbitrary nature of the process to appoint and 
re-appoint administrative judges. Political favouritism in the 
quasi-judicial process should no longer have a place in a modern 
democracy such as ours.
<P>
	Obviously, the Liberal government does not hesitate to flout the 
principles underlying the existence of administrative tribunals. The 
sword of Damocles that the President of the Treasury Board wants 
to dangle over the heads of members of administrative tribunals 
may well taint the whole administrative tribunal process.
<P>
	Let us now take a look at what certain well known legal figures 
in Quebec have said on this topic. Jocelyne Olivier, president of the 
bar of the province of Quebec last year, was very clear when she 
said, in the Quebec City daily <I>Le Soleil</I> on July 8, 1995, while still 
holding that position: ``The absence of job security might have 
unsuspected psychological effects on decisions made by a person 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5582"> 5582 </A></B>
<P>
who might be more preoccupied with toeing the line than seeing 
that justice was done''. This is worrisome.
<P>
	Members of administrative tribunals might even hesitate to 
adopt a direction favourable to citizens for fear of penalizing the 
government.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government's bill is unacceptable because it is 
an outright attack on two fundamental principles of justice that 
cannot be ignored. These two principles are the impartiality and 
independence of members of administrative tribunals.
<P>
	In the case of superior courts, whether the Superior Court, the 
Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court is involved, even if the 
appointment is by the Minister of Justice of Canada, there is no 
doubt about the independence and impartiality of judges.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I think that citizens and clients of our courts have confidence in 
our justice system. However, as far as administrative tribunals are 
concerned, if the government keeps up the same patronage system 
that has existed since Confederation in 1867, there is something 
wrong.
<P>
	There are two principles that are fundamental to a modern 
democracy, two principles that the government seems to ignore 
without any compunction, just so it can keep the power to make 
partisan appointments to administrative tribunals. These 
appointments are often a way to reward friends of the government 
who may not necessarily have the qualifications to exercise these 
important duties. The Liberals are merely perpetuating a tradition 
of patronage that has become their trademark as a government.
<P>
	In concluding, I would ask the unanimous consent of the House 
so that, when Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and 
disciplinary measures in relation to members of certain 
administrative tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal 
agencies and to make consequential amendments to other acts, is 
adopted on second reading by the Liberal majority of this House, it 
shall be referred to all standing committees of the House that are 
responsible for the administrative tribunals affected by this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the hon. 
member have the unanimous consent of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There is no 
unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like my colleagues to talk about the enormous powers the federal 
government is giving itself. As my colleague pointed out, the 
power to appoint tribunal members seems excessive. I think the 
power to change very quickly and without any compensation, as the 
federal government sees fit, the commissioners or chairs who do 
not meet all its requirements is really excessive.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to elaborate on this, which I think is 
very important. Especially since this bill specifies that the 
provinces have no say in the appointments. As we know full well, 
the decisions taken in certain economic, social and other areas 
often affect one province more than another, and nowhere in the 
bill is it mentioned that a province could have a say in the 
appointments. I think this further centralization of powers benefits 
the federal government at the expense of the provinces, especially 
Quebec, which is a very important province.
<P>
	Energy is a case in point. As we know, a tribunal could side with 
an energy industry against Quebec, for example with western oil 
interests at the expense of Quebec, whose main source of energy is 
electricity. I think the government is granting itself excessive 
powers by failing to consult with the provinces on appointments.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to elaborate on this. Personally, I think 
there is danger of further federal centralization. The government 
claims it wants to decentralize powers, but I think that, with this 
bill, it is taking concrete action to further centralize powers. 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Longueuil for his unexpected question. I heard some 
members yawn across the way while his asked his question. What 
we get are unexpected questions. I would like the people watching 
us or following question period to realize that, when a Liberal 
member puts a question to a Liberal minister, the minister has 
received the text of the question ahead of time and is then able to 
read his answer. Conversely, when the question comes from the 
official opposition, they do not get the text ahead of time. Just 
between us, the questions we are asking one another are real 
questions. I did not know ahead of time what my colleague, the 
hon. member for Longueuil was going to ask me.
<P>
	I will answer him by expressing a difference.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I am talking about the distinction made in this bill between a 
superior court judge, be it the Quebec superior court, the Court of 
Appeal or the Supreme Court, and the judges sitting on 
administrative tribunals.
<P>
	At the superior court level, judges normally remain on the bench 
until the age of 75, unless removal is considered in extremely 
serious and rare cases. A resolution has even to be passed by 
Parliament to have a remove federal jurisdiction judge.
<P>
	It is like this case that was almost referred to us-it is common 
knowledge-the case of Judge Bienvenue, who eventually decided 
to retire. I think that was a wise  decision on his part. Perhaps he 
suspected how the House of Commons would vote. Following a 
serious investigation conducted by the judicial council, judges 
from various provinces recommended that Judge Bienvenue be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5583"> 5583 </A></B>
<P>
removed from the bench. That is the procedure to have a superior 
court judge removed.
<P>
	The offence has to be really very serious to warrant such action, 
while, with this bill, if the trust of the jurisprudence is not to the 
liking of the government, a judge may be removed, because, unlike 
the situation I described earlier, where judges were appointed for a 
fixed period, which provided a degree of job security and ensured a 
degree of independence in the decision making process during the 
three, five, or seven years of the mandate, they are now designated. 
``I designate you today and I can take your designation away the 
next day. You can get sacked whenever the minister feels like it.'' 
That is the difference.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for Fraser Valley West has three minutes for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Three minutes. 
Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. It is a far cry from the 20 
minutes I should have had.
<P>
	It is said and it is true that a government that robs Peter to pay 
Paul can always depend on the support of Paul. That ideal is what 
pervades the whole issue of patronage in this country, in particular 
Bill C-49.
<P>
	When we are talking about patronage, whether we are amending 
a bill or adjusting a bill or adding to a bill in this House we have to 
question whether the bill is even needed. Most people in my riding 
of Fraser Valley West would suggest that the issue of patronage is 
crude, embarrassing, insulting and very Liberal.
<P>
	I have dealt in Atlantic Canada with a number of issues 
involving patronage. Today in question period I asked about it. It is 
not necessarily an appointment but we will get to that maybe 
tomorrow in question period. When we see a government like this 
that gives out $87 million and in return from a company like 
Bombardier gets $170,000 put into its coffers, we have to wonder 
exactly what kind of democracy we are in today.
<P>
	I wonder how many people from where I come from are aware 
that this government in fact hands out their money to corporations 
and in return for that handout gets a share of that money back to its 
party in order to run elections.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> One of the members says 
hear, hear. He is very proud of it.
<P>
	The concept under which this government runs is a terrible 
example of what is wrong with this country. If we take situations 
like in my riding where I ran and handily beat the Liberal 
candidate, what does the Liberal government turn around and do? 
He wins. It offers him a position with the Canada Development 
Corporation. If he runs again against me and when he loses, what is 
he going to get? He will go up to the next plumb, perhaps a 
harbours board job. Maybe a Senate seat, but those usually go to 
people who flunk out here.
<P>
	I will be back tomorrow to talk about patronage. I know they do 
not like to hear what I say, but I will leave them with this. 
Economic dependence, which is the philosophy of this 
government, ensures political dependence. That is another reason 
this Liberal government must be defeated the next time around.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the consideration of 
Private Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-266, 
an act to amend the Competition Act (protection of 
whistle-blowers), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise today to present Bill C-266, an 
act to amend the Competition Act, protection of whistle blowers. 
This bill is a relatively straightforward piece of legislation which 
seeks to improve the ability of the competition bureau to gather 
evidence of anti-competitive activities. More important, it 
legislates the principle that no Canadian should lose their job 
because they report a contravention of the laws of this Parliament 
or refuse to participate in the commission of an act which 
contravenes the laws of this Parliament.
<P>
	This principle is sound and must be upheld as a test of our 
commitment to ensure the respect of the laws enacted by the duly 
elected representatives of the House. Anything less sends a signal 
to corporations and employers that they can entice or coerce 
law-abiding employees to engage in illegal activities. This is wrong 
and must not be tolerated.
<P>
	With respect to the Competition Act, Bill C-266 legislates in 
three areas. First, it allows Canadians to report violations of the 
Competition Act anonymously and guarantees that their identity or 
the source of the information will be kept confidential. Second, it 
makes it illegal for an employer to discipline or fire an employee 
who refuses to participate in, or who reports a violation of the 
Competition Act. Third, it grants to an employee disciplined for 
respecting the Competition Act the right to sue for damages or 
reinstatement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5584"> 5584 </A></B>
<P>
	Although Bill C-266 was born from the need to redress the 
problems in the marketing and sale of gasoline in Canada, it is 
important to recognize that the bill applies to all businesses in all 
sectors of the economy.
<P>
	I am sure that every member of this House has received 
complaints about the fluctuations in the price of gasoline. The 
retail price of gasoline fluctuates in unison. In any market when the 
price goes up, it goes up everywhere at the same time. 
Mysteriously, it always increases by the same amount. The gas 
industry calls these price fluctuations conscious parallelism. My 
constituents call it suspicious and they even call it price fixing.
<P>
	The gas industry says it only reflects the industry's cost structure 
and the nature of supply and demand for petroleum products. 
Independent gas retailers say that the price fluctuations are an 
attempt by the majors to force them out of the market, to control 
the market and to lessen competition.
<P>
	Here is the bottom line: Canadians do not trust how gas prices 
are set and Canadians have lost confidence in both industry and 
governments on this issue. They have both failed to adequately 
explain why gas prices fluctuate in unison and why the price of gas 
is higher in certain areas of the country.
<P>
	Every week I drive to Ottawa from my riding in northern 
Ontario. The further east I get, the lower the price of gasoline. I can 
tell the House that higher prices in northern Ontario cannot be 
explained away by transportation costs.
<P>
	This is an issue which irritates all Canadians. This is a problem 
for Canadians and they are calling on their elected officials to take 
action. Some governments have acknowledged the problem and are 
moving to address it.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia the provincial government is concerned that the 
pricing policies of refiners are squeezing out the independents. It 
believes that this would eventually lessen competition, reduce 
consumer choice and lead to even higher prices. It is considering 
the introduction of anti-trust laws to protect independents and 
guarantee competition.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	In response to the Ultramar situation of last summer, the Quebec 
government announced last week that it would legislate margins 
above wholesale prices. Prior to the announcements, even 
Quebec's FÃ©dÃ©ration canadienne de l'entreprise indÃ©pendante had 
requested that the government legislate to protect independent gas 
retailers and consumers at the pumps.
<P>
	The premier of British Columbia is on record as stating that 
government action may be required to protect consumers at the 
pumps.
<P>
	In Ontario the MPP for Ottawa West has introduced a private 
member's bill on fair gas pricing in the province.  Even the premier 
of Ontario has acknowledged the problem. When in opposition, he 
pressured the Rae government to keep its promise to take action on 
the pricing of gasoline.
<P>
	The Americans have and are facing the same problem. Their 
responses, more daring than ours, provide us with useful insights.
<P>
	In the midst of the gulf war crisis, President Bush warned U.S. 
oil companies not to use the crisis as a pretext to gouge consumers 
at the pump. In the spring of this year, President Clinton ordered 
the sale of 12 million barrels of oil from emergency reserves in an 
attempt to hedge down the price at the pumps. However, these are 
incidental actions. The real tests are the actions taken by state 
legislators.
<P>
	A large number of states, 21 I believe, have legislation that 
mandates refiners to sell gas at the same price to all retailers, 
independent and company owned stations. Maryland, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico have gone 
further by enacting gasoline divorcement laws that prohibit the 
producer or the refiner of gasoline from operating service stations.
<P>
	I find it ironic that on this issue the Americans are ahead of us in 
protecting consumers. Here in Canada the response from the 
federal government has echoed the petroleum industry's line that 
price fluctuations simply reflect supply and demand. Canadians are 
not convinced.
<P>
	The competition bureau has held industry wide investigations 
but has failed to uncover price fixing. Investigations and 
prosecutions of gas companies and retailers suspected of price 
fixing have not met with resounding success. Another such 
industry wide probe is now under way.
<P>
	Consumers and independents are travelling to Montreal and 
Ottawa to provide testimony on their experiences with 
anti-competitive pricing in the industry. However, they remain 
sceptical that the investigation will lead to any significant change 
even though they and their consumers know that they are being 
wronged.
<P>
	There is little doubt that addressing the whole issue of pricing in 
the gasoline industry will require concerted action by both the 
federal and provincial governments, each acting within their 
respective jurisdictions. Some provinces are moving in this 
direction. It is now time for the federal government to follow suit. 
Bill C-266 is an important step along this path.
<P>
	Industry Canada informs us that the sections of the Competition 
Act dealing with conspiracy, abuse of dominant position and others 
are adequate to ensure competition and protect consumers at the 
pumps. If this is the case, how do we explain the lack of successful 
prosecutions? I doubt that the majority of Canadians are wrong 
about the pricing of gas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5585"> 5585 </A></B>
<P>
	According to the former director of the competition bureau, Mr. 
George Addy, the problem lies in the collection of evidence 
needed for successful prosecutions. To prove the existence of 
illegal agreements to fix prices at the pumps, the assistance of the 
individuals who make and implement the agreements is needed.
<P>
	In June 1995 Mr. Addy testified at the natural resources 
committee hearings on gas prices. He stated: ``I need the 
co-operation of individuals and firms who have information''. He 
later added: ``A law is only as effective as the evidence one is able 
to assemble when a genuine contravention occurs''.
<P>
	I believe it is even more revealing to quote from the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, May 14, 1996 edition: ``Last year George Addy, the bureau's 
director of investigation and research, said his agency would be 
able to police the petroleum industry more effectively if it were 
easier for people to blow the whistle on illegal practices. Direct 
evidence of wrongdoing is difficult to obtain without the help of 
insiders, said Addy. As it stands, he noted, anyone who comes 
forward puts his livelihood at risk''.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	In his testimony before the committee, Mr. Addy proposed to 
improve the operations of the Competition Act by better protecting 
informants and witnesses who disclose illegal conduct, and by 
pressuring firms to adopt voluntary whistle blowing mechanisms 
within their organizations.
<P>
	Bill C-266 takes up and legislates Mr. Addy's recommendations 
because industry self-regulation of competition matters is simply 
nonsense. Delegating the responsibility for competition to 
corporations goes against public interest. Guaranteeing free and 
open competition in the marketplace is too important.
<P>
	This brings us to the two fundamental questions that must be 
addressed in this debate. The first question is: Should an individual 
lose his or her right to earn a livelihood because he or she reports a 
violation of the Competition Act or refuses to participate in a 
violation of a law passed by this House?
<P>
	The answer must be no, unless the members of this House deem 
that individuals standing up in defence of Canadian law are not 
worthy of protection. Here we are talking about individuals 
standing up for consumers, for us, for our constituents. The 
preamble of the Competition Act states as one of its purposes ``to 
provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices''. 
We must never lose sight of this.
<P>
	The principles legislated in Bill C-266 are not new. They are 
well entrenched in Canadian and even in American law. For 
illustrative purposes, members can consult the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, the Ontario Environmental Bill of 
Rights, 1993 and the Alberta Freedom of Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act.
<P>
	American law is also no stranger to whistle blower protection. 
For example, the Fair Labour Standards Act of 1938 and the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 among many other 
laws protect employees who report illegal conduct.
<P>
	I would like to draw particular attention to New Jersey's 
conscientious Employee Protection Act. This law protects 
employees who report or refuse to participate in a breach of any 
law, whether federal, state or local. This type of protection 
implements the principles of Bill C-266 in the largest possible 
sense in all fields of human activity. It fully recognizes the 
premium society places on respect for the law.
<P>
	The first principle on which Bill C-266 is founded is therefore 
sound.
<P>
	The second question is whether a Canadian in possession of 
information that a breach of an act of Parliament has or will be 
committed should have the right to file an anonymous complaint.
<P>
	An individual should have that right. That option serves as the 
operational foundation of Crime Stoppers. Few would question the 
effectiveness of that program. It is important to note that many of 
the violations of the Competition Act are also infractions under the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Therefore, we have before us in Bill C-266 a bill that is founded 
on fundamental principles that I am confident the majority of 
Canadians and members of this House support, a bill that legislates 
recommendations made by the former head of our own competition 
bureau, recommendations which he stated would improve the 
detection and investigation of violations of the Competition Act in 
relation to price fixing in the gas industry.
<P>
	In May 1996 the Minister of Industry stated that he would review 
the desirability of introducing whistle blowing protection into the 
Competition Act. That is the bill before us today. I regret to inform 
the House that the Department of Industry has advised me that it 
does not support Bill C-266 even though it follows the 
recommendations of the former head of the competition bureau.
<P>
	Although we have all come to expect the near automatic 
disapproval of private members' bills by government departments, 
I was disappointed to learn of the department's continued inertia on 
the pricing of gasoline, a real and serious concern for consumers. 
Nonetheless, I am heartened that the final judgment on Bill C-266 
lies with the elected and accountable members of this House and 
not the bureaucracy.
<P>
	On a positive note, the department does support enhancing 
confidentiality protection offered to complainants, a key element 
of Bill C-266. The department states that it disapproves of Bill 
C-266, because it favours industry self-regulation of whistle  
blower protection. It wants employees of gas companies to lobby 
their bosses to permit them to report breaches of the law. It wants 
gas companies to offer bonuses to employees who report illegal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5586"> 5586 </A></B>
<P>
acts committed by the firm. It wants gas companies to establish 
internal procedures for reporting crimes. This is nonsense. Gas 
companies are the problem and the department wants them to 
self-regulate their own breaches of the Competition Act.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In the real world the employee who reports a breach of the law 
and costs his or her firm a fine, loses his or her job. They certainly 
do not get a bonus and a promotion. ``Anyone who comes forward 
puts his or her livelihood at risk''. Those are the words of the 
former head of the competition bureau, George Addy.
<P>
	There is no doubt that we need legislation in this area to protect 
the individual who stands by the law and who stands up to protect 
our interests against anti-competitive practices.
<P>
	There is also a double standard and contradictions in the 
department's approach. In June 1995 the competition bureau 
released a discussion paper on amendments to the act. It makes 
interesting reading. Do consumers know that the department wants 
to repeal the section dealing with price discrimination? This is the 
section that ensures that gas refiners offer similar price advantages 
to all outside retailers. I am confident that independent gas retailers 
and consumers will pay the price for this initiative should it ever 
become law.
<P>
	It also wants to give the court the power to force a company to 
initiate a whistle blower program. This of course does not protect 
the employee from dismissal. Why extend any benefit to the 
employees of one firm and not to all Canadians? Why should we 
have to go to court to force the company to institute any program to 
facilitate the gathering of information?
<P>
	It also wants to give the competition tribunal the power to make 
restitution orders when an individual or firm has suffered a loss due 
to anti-competitive and misleading advertising. Good for the 
company. But by rejecting Bill C-266 it is refusing the right of 
restitution to the employee who respects the law.
<P>
	It wants to give firms the right to launch their own cases before 
the competition tribunal. But it wants to deny the right of an 
employee to keep his or her job after he or she makes a stand in 
support of the Competition Act.
<P>
	It is clear that we are witnessing in matters of competition the 
development of double standards. An expansion of remedies for 
firms, including gas companies, and a denial of remedies for 
law-abiding employees who defend the interests of consumers in 
free and open competition.
<P>
	I am sure we are going to hear representatives from the 
government raise jurisdictional issues. Often times a preference for 
the status quo and inaction is clouded in jurisdictional issues. The 
Competition Act is a valid federal statute as is any disposition 
which adds to the arsenal of tools needed to investigate and gather 
evidence of anti-competitive behaviour.
<P>
	In June 1995 the competition bureau stated before a committee 
of the House that the measures found in Bill C-266 would improve 
policing of the gasoline industry. Bill C-266 only implements what 
the bureau recommended and I know the slew of lawyers at the 
bureau would not recommend anything outside their jurisdiction.
<P>
	This bill does not regulate or mandate prices. This is the 
jurisdiction of the provinces and they must make their own choices. 
It improves the operations of the act and offers new tools to protect 
law-abiding Canadians.
<P>
	Finally, the department objects to the use of the word 
commission in Bill C-266. I have reviewed the objection and I have 
consulted with the legislative counsel's office. In the proper 
housekeeping and the interests of open and free debate, I recognize 
this technical point. The issue can be resolved by simply replacing 
the word commission by director. I will propose an amendment 
when the House forwards the bill to the committee. It must be 
noted that this technical amendment in no way affects the general 
scheme or intent of the bill.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to re-emphasize that this bill is 
straightforward. It makes sense. Canadians need it. Canadians want 
it. It brings us one step closer to solving the problems of pricing in 
the gas industry.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to say a few words on Bill C-266, introduced by the hon. 
member for Nickel Belt. This is in fact an amendment to the 
Competition Act.
<P>
	I am not saying I oppose this measure, but I do have some 
concerns. I believe that, in principle, it is a step in the right 
direction to allow employees, people who work for certain 
businesses, to enjoy an environment that is better, more fair and 
more honest. We cannot lose when we seek to promote honesty.
<P>
	Honesty is the key to the establishment of stable, balanced and 
lasting societies. In this sense, the fact that the employees or 
contractors of an employer will be allowed to report injustices and 
to speak freely on illegal tactics by the company can bring some 
stability in businesses and promote fairness in our economic 
system.
<P>
	But I do have some concerns. I fear that a business could be 
infiltrated by employees from competing companies who could 
then find all sorts of motives to blame the business. The hon. 
member referred to oil companies. We know that these are 
powerful corporations. It could happen that, from time to time, 
companies of this type might secretly delegate individuals to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5587"> 5587 </A></B>
<P>
infiltrate the competition and make accusations that could be 
harmful to their operations.
<P>
	That may occasionally happen, but probably not often enough 
for me to want to oppose the bill. I think that overall the benefits 
outweigh the disadvantages.
<P>
	Similarly, I also wondered whether certain dishonest, mistreated 
employees, if they had complete freedom to criticize their 
employer, might also abuse the privilege and blow the whistle on 
their own company, their own employer, and create an unpleasant 
atmosphere within the company.
<P>
	Once again, having examined this question, I think that it would 
be a minority of these employees who might act in this way. 
Generally, an employee works for his employer, for the company. 
He does what he can to help the company operate as well as 
possible. For these reasons, I think that it is still a good idea to 
support Bill C-266.
<P>
	There is also the fact of having employees or contractors, 
consultants within a company who act as watchdogs. As I said at 
the beginning of my speech, this also helps the company to 
continue to operate honestly, and to observe the Competition Act.
<P>
	Sometimes an employer does not realize he is doing something 
wrong, but if all his employees have the right to point this out 
nicely, to advise their employer that they are in contravention of the 
Competition Act, they might avoid serious consequences for this 
company.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The fact that the employee has the right to advise his employer 
of fraud, of a tendency to commit fraud or of the fact that he is not 
complying with the Competition Act will also give the company a 
chance to quickly adjust its behaviour. Employees will be able to 
work in an environment where honesty is appreciated. And finally, 
this would give the industry a chance to clean up its act, and in the 
long run, everyone would benefit.
<P>
	It is always important to have watchdogs, although sometimes 
people may find this unpleasant. It always leads to more fairness, a 
better balance and better continuity in the industry or the company 
in which we work.
<P>
	I do not want to take up much more of your time with my speech 
on this bill. I will simply say I support the bill. It is a free vote, so I 
suggest hon. members support this bill in order to improve 
competition, as the hon. member for Nickel Belt pointed out, 
especially in the oil industry.
<P>
	We know that in this industry, there are often cases of unfair 
competition, but perhaps when the rules are more clear-cut, when 
employees are able to advise their bosses or the shareholders that 
they are engaging in unfair  competition which basically is harmful 
to the economic stability of the industry, this will benefit everyone, 
both the consumer and the companies. I will stop here, and I repeat 
that I support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-266, an act to amend the 
Competition Act. I support this bill although I do have a concern 
about it. I will address that in a moment.
<P>
	I like the idea of there being a benefit to the consumer. I like the 
fact that it improves the policing and the consumer watch over 
product. That is something much needed.
<P>
	Unlike previous bills which have sought to find measures that 
will prevent unfair gasoline pricing at the pumps, this bill works 
within the current provisions of the Competition Act without 
overtly increasing the size and the cost of the bureaucracy, or 
imposing unnecessary regulation on the marketplace.
<P>
	The bill will enhance the commission's ability to conduct an 
investigation by allowing the commission to act on confidential 
information. Under the current legislation an investigation can only 
be carried out by the commission if supported by a six resident 
application for inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing or at the 
minister's request. We know where that goes with ministerial 
requests.
<P>
	The Reform Party policy supports vigorous measures to ensure 
the successful operation of the marketplace through such means as 
the promotion of competition, competitive pricing, the 
strengthening and vigorous enforcement of competition and 
anti-combines legislation with severe penalties for collusion of 
price-fixing. This bill fits quite well within the scope of the policy 
that Reform has. There was mention by a previous speaker of the 
impact on employer-employee relations. Having negotiated 
collective agreements for many years in my career, there is an 
aspect of this that basically provides for an employer to be libel for 
a fine of up to $100,000 or two years imprisonment if found guilty 
of retaliatory action against an employee under the circumstances 
that were laid out.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I do not know of anywhere in this country that it is legislated 
where an employer may receive a $100,000 fine and in particular 
two years imprisonment for a dispute between and employer and an 
employee. In many cases we can probably get situations where a 
disgruntled employee, an employee who has been fighting with the 
organization itself, the owners themselves, says ``I am going to rat 
on this certain circumstance'', and perhaps they are wrong or half 
right. All of a sudden we find the employee taking the employer to 
task through court and demanding that there not only be restitution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5588"> 5588 </A></B>
<P>
but demanding that the employer be libel to a fine of $100,000 or 
two years in prison.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of difficulties that legislators, in particular 
the federal government and provincial governments, get into when 
they try to right a situation, especially in the competitive markets 
and by doing so over react on the other end to the punitive 
measures if that situation is not fulfilled.
<P>
	I worry about any kind of legislation where we are actually 
talking about employers who through a fault of their own are fined 
$100,000 or two years in prison.
<P>
	In this country we have a hard enough time getting individuals 
for sexual assault to have these kinds of fines and two years in 
prison. I am not sure whether that strong punitive measure belongs 
in this bill.
<P>
	I would sincerely hope that the member who brought Bill C-266 
forward would reconsider that aspect and downsize the punitive 
measure. It should not be $100,000 and two years in prison, but 
something a bit more reasonable than that.
<P>
	I recognize that there is a respect for the confidentiality of the 
employee except in cases where upon inquiry the commission finds 
that employee knowingly accused an employer falsely. Therein we 
get into employer-employee relationships again and the problems 
that can happen.
<P>
	I do think this is a good bill. The difficulty with the other side of 
the bill is that the measures taken to ensure that it is enforced are 
too harsh. If the member wishes the support of this member, I 
would ask him to reconsider that. Then I think he has something 
that is very worthwhile. Indeed, it fits in with our policy. I would 
certainly be happy to go with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would first like to take this opportunity to congratulate the member 
for Nickel Belt on his excellent initiative. This is an issue that I 
have been involved with for over eight years now. This issue has 
received a lot of attention both in terms of public attention and 
attention in this House. A number of members have raised this 
issue on a number of occasions. I want to take this opportunity to 
thank everyone who has pushed forward the agenda on this subject 
matter.
<P>
	The idea is an excellent one. It is not a question of whether there 
is a need for whistleblower legislation when it comes to gasoline 
pricing in Canada but a question of when and how fast we can 
introduce such legislation.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	I have had a chance to look at the proposal of the hon. member 
for Nickel Belt and I must admit that on the surface it seems that a 
lot of adjustments would be required for his proposal to be 
effective. However, to reject it out of hand would be unfair. I 
suggest that the fair thing for us to do would be to allow this 
proposal to go to committee. At committee, if members of any 
party have suggestions or amendments which they would like to 
make, that would be the appropriate time to do that.
<P>
	I do not think it is fair to reject it out of hand because the people 
of Canada have asked us to take action on this issue. They want a 
system which is transparent, just and fair. They want a system 
whereby if someone sees a wrong or a mishap in the industry, that 
person will be able to come forward with the information without 
the fear of prosecution, peer pressure or employer pressure.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry and his department have done an 
excellent job. After eight years of pushing and shoving, finally we 
have a government that is very responsive. It is responding to a 
request by the people. The department has taken action on this 
issue and there is an inquiry under way.
<P>
	I want to commend the minister for his leadership, as well as the 
people who are working on the inquiry, without commenting on the 
proceedings of the inquiry. It is an excellent beginning. It is my 
hope that in the near future the inquiry will produce a set of 
recommendations and the government, as has been promised by 
departmental officials, will complete its review of the Competition 
Act and will introduce measures similar to those introduced by my 
colleague from Nickel Belt so that we can once and for all return 
some justice to the system.
<P>
	There is price fixing across the country. Sometimes it is sporadic 
but sometimes it is properly orchestrated and organized. I have said 
this over and over again and I will continue to say it.
<P>
	For us as a government to be able to get to the bottom of it, we 
have to implement provisions to protect people who have 
information. We do not only have to protect employees, as my 
colleague has proposed, but also employers, independent retailers, 
people who have outlets on consignment and anybody who has 
information about price fixing. They should be able to come 
forward with that information without fear. Unfortunately within 
the present system it is extremely difficult for someone to come 
forward with information because they are afraid for their lives. 
They are afraid for their jobs. They are afraid that their supply 
might be cut off.
<P>
	My colleague from Saint-Denis told me about a difficulty which 
exists in the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There have often been fierce battles in the oil industry. People 
from various parts of Quebec have mentioned the incredible 
pressures that were felt when an oil company decided to sell its gas 
below cost. This is really running roughshod over the competition. 
It was incredible. Such procedures also violate the Competition 
Act.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are unfortunate things happening. Certain companies and 
individuals know there are loopholes in the act and they can drive 
camels through them in some cases. They have studied the act and 
they know it inside and out.
<P>
	In fairness to consumers, retailers and everyone, we have to 
come up with something which is fair and square and which will 
ensure transparency in the system. I would say it is fair to have 
legislation with a provision for people to come forward with 
information without fear.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I want to commend the department for taking the initiative to 
introduce the 1-800 line, an excellent initiative. I want to 
congratulate the department for taking the initiative in terms of the 
inquiry. I also want to congratulate the department for reviewing 
the act, which it is presently doing. That is excellent.
<P>
	It would be fair to send the initiative proposed by my colleague 
to committee. There should be a provision within the committee to 
look at it. If the government comes forward with a proposal a 
month or two from now, my colleague may very well combine his 
initiative with what the government is trying to do.
<P>
	In private discussions I had with him on a number of occasions 
he clearly stated that his intention was to see something happen 
because his constituents were demanding action. I join with him 
although I have a number of concerns. For example, retailers are 
not mentioned.
<P>
	Discrimination also takes place against independent retailers, 
retailers on consignment or other individuals in the community 
who may have information. I discussed those concerns with my 
colleague and he was open to an amendment to his proposal. He 
was also open to allowing the government to make his 
recommendations part of a government proposal. That would be 
wonderful.
<P>
	There is another element which is not addressed in this proposal, 
the relationship between oil suppliers and retailers. The 
relationship between the supplier and the retailer is not properly 
defined in the act and it must be. Unless we define the relationship 
between the supplier and the retailer we will find an undue 
influence.
<P>
	Consider that a supplier of gasoline that owns company <I>a</I> sells to 
an individual who also sells gasoline from the same supplier. That 
particular supplier can influence the price of gasoline through his 
outlet and force the other person who is buying his gasoline to set 
their prices as per company <I>a</I>. It is a complicated issue to explain in 
the House but the bottom line is that it is time to pass this bill to 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague, 
the member for Nickel Belt, a fellow northerner from northern 
Ontario, on his private member's Bill C-266. It is important before 
we get into the substance of the bill to examine the historical 
context of why we are here today.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if you were a northerner from Ontario you 
would know that over the last number of years from the sixties 
through to the nineties a number of studies have been done. There 
have been discussions between northerners and southerners about 
the unequal treatment of consumers depending on where they live 
in the province of Ontario.
<P>
	Those individuals have asked their governments, both provincial 
and federal, on a number of occasions to look at the fairness to 
consumers of gas prices in the south versus the north, to look at gas 
prices at the pumps at different times of the year and at different 
times of the week.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	By looking at different studies, I know that every time one of 
those studies is completed its results and recommendations show 
that there is no proof that there is price fixing, but obviously 
something seems wrong with the system.
<P>
	I will give an example from a southern Ontario perspective, 
which is hard to believe coming from a northerner from 
Kenora-Rainy River. When I drive to my residence during the 
week after I have finished my day's work in the House of 
Commons, the gas price will be fixed, at around 56 cents a litre. Lo 
and behold, come Friday night the price goes up. The price then 
stays up around 57 cents to 58 cents all weekend long. Monday 
morning the price goes back down again. It does this in unison at 
practically every service station all the way down Bank.
<P>
	If the price changed every three or four months when there were 
fluctuations in oil prices around the world, I think consumers could 
buy the argument that because the price of oil was going up or 
going down by the barrel then the prices at different pumps at 
different service stations could be the same. The perception is that 
the prices are fixed but at least they could feel comfortable that it 
makes some sense to them as a consumer.
<P>
	However, we do not like to drive down the road and see the price 
changes on a weekend. As consumers, we know there is more 
business, more travel, more tourism and more people coming and 
going because they have Friday, Saturday and Sunday off. Gas 
companies are going to allow prices to go up in order to make a 
bigger profit.
<P>
	That is sort of the long and short of why people have some major 
concerns about the way prices at the pumps are arrived at. They 
wonder whether something needs to be looked at in depth by 
parliamentarians or provincial governments in their jurisdiction 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5590"> 5590 </A></B>
<P>
which will make us feel more comfortable as consumers that we 
are getting a good price and a fair price.
<P>
	Obviously my colleague's inspiration is gasoline pricing. People 
need the opportunity to have it explained to them as I have. As the 
ex-chairman of the natural resources committee who instituted the 
investigation a couple of years back, I had the opportunity to ask 
Mr. Addy in committee why these fluctuations occurred and 
whether there was an explanation for them. I also brought the 
industry in to explain it to us as well.
<P>
	Even when I sat as the chair of that committee I never got an 
explanation that I could buy, that I could feel comfortable with, that 
I could go and tell my constituents: ``Here is the reason''. They 
were all over the map.
<P>
	I will give another example. We buy our gas in northern Ontario 
from Winnipeg. It is shipped by Paul's Hauling. Paul's Hauling 
ships gas from Winnipeg right across my riding. It takes about two 
and a half hours to get to different points in the riding.
<P>
	The gas prices in Kenora, which is about two hours from 
Winnipeg, let us say for the sake of argument are 63 cents or 64 
cents today. I have not called so it may even be higher. It might 
even be 66 cents. Fifteen miles outside of town close to Winnipeg 
gas prices are five cents less. For people who are listening in major 
centres, this is in the middle of nowhere. It is small tourist place 
called Clearwater Bay. All the folks in Winnipeg come to spend 
their holidays in their cottages at this particular place. We have a 
little wee liquor store, a convenience store and two little gas pumps 
which have gas prices at five cents less. Drive to Kenora and the 
price goes up five cents. Drive to Dryden, an hour to an hour and a 
half away, and it goes down two cents from the price in Kenora. 
Dryden and Kenora are almost identical in size. I have asked the 
competition bureau and the people who run these companies to 
explain this. Members would like a fair explanation of how those 
prices could vary like that.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	You cannot say ``it has to be the transportation cost '' as my 
colleague has said. We are not buying that answer because I am told 
it is about a half cent difference, in the neighbourhood of 300 or 
400 miles on a litre of gas, based on the cost of transportation if you 
are hauling a huge semi. They said that is not the real reason. There 
are differences in the local competition. Local competition means 
that different gas stations have prices that they build in, therefore, 
the prices will naturally be different in a different community.
<P>
	We spent time blowing holes in that argument and they switched 
gears on us again. They said the reason why the gas prices are high 
is because there is no competition. Now we do not have any 
competition, transportation is not the problem and the different gas  
stations have different mechanisms of coming up with what their 
expenses are. Therefore the cost would be different but 
everybody's price is the same in the same community. At this point 
we still do not have a legitimate explanation of why those prices 
are the way they are.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you can understand why we have difficulty 
when politicians from either the provincial or federal level tell us 
everything is okay.
<P>
	My colleague from Nickel Belt has taken the bull by the horns 
and has said that if what the corporations say is true and if what 
governments say is true, then let us put in a mechanism to make it 
very easy for people to give us information if they believe there is 
something wrong with the industry. If the industry is clean and its 
explanations are solid, it should not have any problem with whistle 
blowing legislation.
<P>
	We have whistle blowing legislation in other jurisdictions, for 
example, in different acts, labour codes and labour protection acts. 
We have mechanisms where employers will be fined for breaking 
the law and helping employees. All these arguments are legitimate 
arguments that should be looked at.
<P>
	For the sake of my colleagues thinking it is a wrong term, this is 
a very simple bill. It is not complicated at all. All it asks is that the 
Competition Act have built into it a way for the competition bureau 
to make sure that there will be anonymous information given by 
employees or contractors without them feeling they are putting 
their livelihoods at risk.
<P>
	Some of the members I have listened to this evening suggested 
there may be individuals who will put in frivolous complaints just 
for the sake of getting back at their employers or a competitor. I 
doubt that very many people will realistically get into that kind of 
scenario where they are going to phone the competition bureau and 
suggest that there is an illegal act, if it does not have some 
legitimacy, for one simple reason. Can you imagine the hassle that 
would incur once they start putting forward these potentially illegal 
acts into the system? What could they incur if it was found to be 
nothing more than a frivolous act?
<P>
	We have waited as consumers-I put myself in the position of a 
consumer-for 30 years in northern Ontario, to have someone 
explain the best way to deal with this perception that things are not 
right. At this point we still have not had a government willing to 
look at this in a comprehensive way.
<P>
	If we continue to ignore the wishes of Canadian people and 
consumers, then what you will get is a process that is driven in a 
much more radical fashion. For example, in Quebec just lately, a 
process was brought into play where that government is going to 
pass legislation that which will be much more severe than what my 
colleague is suggesting. It is less competitive in the sense of having 
free market forces deal with how prices will be set.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5591"> 5591 </A></B>
<P>
	They are now getting into and going down the road of setting 
limits and monitoring the price of gas in such a way that it may 
hamstring fair competition.
<P>
	What a lot of people who believe in capitalism in this country 
would suggest is it is not good overall for the economy or for the 
consumer in the long run.
<P>
	That is what they get when they continue to ignore consumers 
and good solid pieces of legislation and ideas like those of my 
colleague from Nickel Belt.
<P>
	Another issue is that this is a very cheap way to deal with 
difficult problems. In times of financial difficulty, in times when 
there is financial restraint and we are looking for ways to improve 
the efficiency of the system, we ask members to come up with 
innovative solutions.
<P>
	My colleague has done that. He has come up with a solution that 
we all could live with financially and which may just help us with 
the problem we are trying to solve.
<P>
	I have said this in my constituency and I will say it here on the 
floor of the House. If governments are not willing to be reasonable 
and act in the best interests of their constituents, they will be 
surprised with radical ideas like those we see coming from the third 
party which are a simplistic way of solving problems.
<P>
	It will eventually catch fire and be worse for a lot of individual 
Canadians because people get very frustrated when they know 
there is a problem, they are waiting for a solution and they are not 
getting one.
<P>
	In the last few seconds I have, this is a very good private 
member's bill, a very good start. In the next two hours that we have 
at this reading, there will be other members talking about examples 
in their regions saying how difficult it is to show that there is 
nothing wrong with the way the pricing of gas is arrived at. We 
need to look at mechanisms to be sure that it is fair.
<P>
	The government would be smart to enact this as part of an 
overall package of reforms to the Competition Act to make sure 
that Canadians are protected not just now but of course in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Madam Speaker, I suggest that with mere seconds 
until 6.30 p.m. you declare it 6.30 p.m. and we adjourn the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent to call it 6.30 p.m.?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The time 
provided for consideration of private members' business is now 
expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.28 p.m.)
