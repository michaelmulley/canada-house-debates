</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (for the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services)</B> moved that Bill C-10, an act to amend the 
Municipal Grants Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address the House on Bill C-10, the payments in lieu of 
taxes act.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services in support of this important 
legislation which will go a long way toward strengthening the 
relationship between the federal government and municipalities 
across Canada.  As a former municipal politician, it is a real 
pleasure for me to speak to this bill in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I address the legislation I would like to congratulate 
the minister for his dedicated and constructive approach to this 
issue.  His efforts to improve the fairness, equity and 
predictability of federal payments in lieu of taxes are truly 
commendable.  In particular, I underline the minister's decision 
to directly involve local officials in developing these changes 
to the Municipal Grants Act and program.  An obvious sensitivity 
to the opinions of municipal politicians by the minister is 
reflective of his own years in municipal politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in 
June of 1998, the minister made it clear that municipal input was 
absolutely essential if we were to find the best possible 
structure for municipal payments in lieu of taxes.  He also made 
a commitment at that time to hear the voices of those who 
represent Canadians at the municipal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the summer of 1998 the minister presided over 11 
round table discussions in major centres from coast to coast to 
obtain firsthand views on the municipal grants program and to 
gather advice on how to make it work better for local communities 
and citizens.  These meetings gave mayors, municipal officials 
and appraisal professionals the opportunity to have a direct say 
in modernizing Canada's payment in lieu of taxes system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know for a fact that the minister's round tables were greatly 
appreciated by municipal officials.  His face to face meetings 
were a gesture of solidarity between the two levels of 
government, a sign of respect and a clear recognition of the 
challenging work undertaken by municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's undertaking and the enthusiastic participation of 
municipal officials demonstrate that much can be achieved through 
dialogue and co-operation.  Indeed, the minister's consultation 
tour has led directly to some important changes in the way the 
renamed and reformed municipal payments program will be managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two examples come to mind.  First, the minister has undertaken 
to establish a municipal payments program advisory council of 
stakeholder representatives to give advice on administrative and 
policy issues relating to the management of the program. 
This advisory council will carry on the constructive dialogue 
initiated by the round table consultations.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we learned during those discussions, issues that arise must 
not be be allowed to simmer for years until they begin to 
adversely affect relations between governments, as has happened 
in the past.  They must be dealt with expeditiously and the 
advisory council will play an important role in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second ministerial initiative is the decision to engage 
national professional appraisal associations to draft best 
practices for unique types of properties.  As the minister has 
noted, problems often arise when federal and municipal appraisers 
cannot agree on the value of certain types of federal properties 
such as penitentiaries and airports.  There are simply no 
equivalent assets in the private sector against which these 
properties can be compared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By developing best practices through a co-operative process 
involving municipal and federal stakeholders the government will 
ensure consistency in the treatment of these properties across 
Canada.  We will also avoid unnecessary and acrimonious 
disagreements with municipal officials and improve the 
predictability of payments to municipalities.  These 
administrative issues can be addressed without legislation; 
however, some of the changes included in the package proposed by 
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services do require 
amendments to the Municipal Grants Act, which is the purpose of 
Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During their meetings with the minister, municipal officials 
made it clear that the Government of Canada must behave in a 
manner similar to other property owners.  This is what Bill C-10 
aims to achieve.  The underlying objective of the proposed 
legislation is to make federal payments in lieu of taxes as much 
like the taxes levied against private landowners as is possible, 
while still recognizing the government's exemption from local 
taxation under the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Complicating this balancing act is the need to account for the 
uniqueness of certain types of federal properties, as I mentioned 
a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the government has pursued these objectives is by 
strengthening the principles of fairness and equity that have 
guided the municipal grants program since its inception some 50 
years ago.  Let me give the House some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 will require the federal government to pay a 
supplementary amount equivalent to interest when payments in lieu 
of taxes are unreasonably delayed.  It will make the disputes 
resolution process more accessible to municipal governments and 
make the objectivity of the disputes advisory committee more 
apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 will empower the minister to make payments in lieu of 
taxes on tenanted federal property when these tenants default on 
their tax obligations.  Under the current regime municipal 
governments often have little recourse when a tenant in a federal 
property defaults on taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation will also remove limitations on 
payments in lieu of taxes to first nations governments.  It will 
change the reference in the legislation from the word “grants” 
to the word “payments” in lieu of taxes.  This change will 
reflect the fact that the government receives valuable direct and 
indirect services from local governments for its payments in lieu 
of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 will expand the definition of federal property 
contained in the legislation to put the government on a more 
level playing field with taxable property owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities the 
minister also indicated that a primary goal of the consultation 
and reform exercise would be to improve the predictability of 
payments in lieu of taxes.  I might add on a personal note, as a 
former school board chair, that knowing how much money we could 
budget for each year was a very important issue with which we had 
great trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, several measures in Bill C-10 are designed to achieve 
this goal.  For example, the government has undertaken to make 
payments according to the municipally established schedule, 
assuming information from assessment and taxation authorities is 
received on a timely basis, equivalent to that accorded other 
taxpayers.  As mentioned earlier, the government will pay 
supplementary amounts equivalent to interest when these payments 
are delayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also work with assessment authorities to 
attempt to finalize federal property values prior to the close of 
the assessment roll.  This will reduce the number of disputes and 
improve predictability for municipalities when they set their tax 
rates and when they set their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will be working with tax appraisal professionals 
to arrive at an acceptable and balanced means of valuing certain 
types of property.  The government will also clarify the process 
to be followed when a taxing authority is unwilling or unable to 
provide a service to federal property which it customarily 
provides to taxable property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first comprehensive review of the municipal payments 
program in 20 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this fact, I am pleased to inform hon. members that these 
proposed changes will have a minimal impact on the cost of the 
program.  In fact, the cost increase will amount to less than 1% 
of a $400 million program, a total of about $1.7 additional 
millions, which will be distributed among departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives, we are all mindful of the need to 
control the cost of government.  However, I believe the movement 
of the federal government toward a more equitable position in 
relation to taxable property owners will provide more protection 
from large increases in costs by aligning the government with the 
common interests of the taxable community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate that Bill C-10 strengthens the fairness, equity 
and predictability of federal payments in lieu of taxes.  It 
achieves a balance between ensuring that Canada pays its fair 
share of the cost of municipal services while protecting the 
broader interests of all Canadian taxpayers.  It deserves the 
support of hon. members on both sides of the House and I would 
ask them to join me in supporting the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to express to the House my pleasure in being able to rise to the 
discussion on this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, in many respects, a very good bill.  As has been pointed 
out by the hon. parliamentary secretary, it follows the 11 round 
table discussions where representatives got together from all the 
provinces and a variety of municipalities, large and small, and 
had their input into this particular bill.  While the bill does 
in many ways meet some of the discussions that took place and 
some of the requests they made, there are some areas where the 
bill falls short and where the suggestions made were not 
accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the House in a way that suggests we ought to 
look at this not as a fait accompli or something that is finished 
but rather as something that is in the process of being put 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to recognize that it does improve the equality, 
fairness, equity and predictability of payments to municipalities 
and other taxing authorities in terms of the taxes that might 
otherwise be paid by people who own property in those particular 
taxing authority jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives the minister the right and power to pay those taxes and 
to make those payments in lieu of taxes, and also to make 
payments in case those taxes are late for whatever reason that 
might be.  It also adds to the provisions of the act a 
predictability factor in the sense that very often the assessment 
authority does not have its final number complete.  The 
government has always had the practice in the past of withholding 
at least 5% of that amount.  That will now be brought forward. If 
it is not, then the interest, or the amount of interest that 
might have been calculated out of that amount, will be paid. That 
is a good provision within the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also allows the federal government to collect from 
third parties if they do not pay their rent or taxes to make sure 
that the proper taxing authority gets that particular payment. 
That is a desirable thing as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It establishes an advisory panel, or council as the hon. 
parliamentary secretary has indicated, which is designed to 
resolve disputes between taxing authorities and paying 
authorities, in this case the Government of Canada.  At the same 
time as it does that, the advisory panel also has absolutely no 
teeth connected with it.  This then raises some concerns that we 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concern is that the advisory panel really has no 
teeth.  It may make recommendations at the point of the 
assessment.  It may make recommendations about whether the 
payment was late and was unreasonably withheld at the usual time 
or on the amount of money that should be paid. It can make 
recommendations but there is absolutely no provision in the bill 
that suggests that the minister may not unreasonably withhold 
approval of these recommendations.  As a consequence, the 
minister's discretion is complete. 
He or she may accept the recommendations, amend them, reject them 
or simply ignore them.  The interesting thing is that the panel 
has no real authority. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel is also to help resolve issues with regard to disputes 
when it comes to crown corporations, especially agents of the 
crown corporations that really exist for the creation of profit 
for the Government of Canada.  In this case too, the panel may 
make recommendations but there is absolutely no obligation on the 
part of the corporation to accept those recommendations.  The 
corporation may amend them, reject them or simply accept them, 
but it is totally at the discretion of the corporation to do so. 
I think that is a shortcoming within the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point within the bill is that the minister's 
discretion is so complete that the apparent willingness or 
direction from the municipalities and taxing authority is that he 
actually pay these amounts and that he do so at a predictable 
time and so on.  This discretion is totally his.  As a 
consequence, he has an authority that no other property taxpayer 
in Canada has.  When we get our tax notices, we must pay our 
taxes.  If we do not pay them we get taken to court and our 
property is eventually confiscated. The minister has total and 
complete authority and discretion as to what he will and what he 
will not do.  I think that is a shortcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect to the bill is that it totally ignores the 
recommendations from the committee.  This was a joint technical 
committee on payments in lieu of taxes.  This particular group 
made a representation to the minister saying that when it comes 
to schedule 4, these are agent crown corporations which are 
supposed to make money, should all be included under schedule 4, 
and that is what schedule 4 actually says. Specifically they 
recommended that Canada Post and the Royal Mint be added to 
schedule 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, we have had the amendment of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Act.  The act clearly indicates that the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation may make a profit and that the profit 
ought to accrue and will accrue to the shareholder, which is the 
Government of Canada, and it should be paying a business tax when 
and if the taxing authority taxes businesses that are in the 
business of making profit. There is this a very startling 
omission in the bill by not including under schedule 4 these 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may wonder why it matters.  It matters a lot because there 
are taxes here that are due and should be paid, and payment 
should have been made in lieu of those taxes.  This is 
particularly evident when one looks at that particular list of 
corporations.  Under schedule 4, we find the Business Development 
of Canada, which is clearly a profit making corporation and these 
others should be added in exactly the same way as that one is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be very careful how we examine the bill because we 
need to recognize that the bill has within it some very, very 
positive things, but it also has some negative things in it and 
we need to recognize what they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area in which I have a special concern has to do with clause 
3(6).  This clause reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“For the purposes of the definition “federal property ” in 
subsection (1), federal property does not include 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) any Indian reserve, or any land referred to in any of

subsection 40 2(1), except for the part

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds very good, particularly when one reads the 
explanatory notes as to the purpose of this particular change in 
the bill.  The purpose is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that First Nations governments have the same access to 
federal payments in lieu of taxes as do other “taxing 
authorities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the First Nation government is granted the status of a 
“taxing authority” as defined in section 2(1) of the Municipal 
Grants Act, they are entitled to the same payments in lieu of 
taxes as “federal property” as all other taxing authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under subsection 2(3)(c)(ii) of the current Act, the definition 
of “federal property” on Indian reserves is limited to property 
occupied by departments for providing service to the off-Reserve 
population, a restriction that does not exists for other taxing 
authorities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems fair and equitable and really sounds great, but let 
us take a closer look at the Municipal Grants Act definition of 
taxing authority.  I want to warn our observers that this will be 
a significant bit of reading and may very well cause some of them 
to ask themselves exactly what is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the definition of taxing authority from the 
Municipal Grants Act.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“taxing authority” means 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) any municipality, province, municipal or provincial board, 
commission, corporation or other authority that levies and 
collects a real property tax or a frontage or area tax pursuant 
to an Act of the legislature of a province, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) any council of a band within the meaning of the Indian Act 
that levies and collects a real property tax or a frontage or 
area tax pursuant to an Act of Parliament, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) any band within the meaning of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) 
Act, chapter 18 of the Statutes of Canada, 1984, that levies and 
collects a tax on interests in Category IA land or Category IA-N 
land as defined in that Act, 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from subsection(2): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) For the purposes of the definition “taxing authority” in 
subsection (1), where one authority collects a real property tax 
or a frontage or area tax that is levied by another authority, 
the authority that collects the tax shall be deemed to be the 
authority that levies and collects the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) For the purposes of the definition “federal property” in 
subsection (1), federal property does not include 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) any

the shelter of people, living things, plant or personal property 
or, for greater certainty, any structure, work, machinery or 
equipment included in Schedule II,

as “urban” by Statistics Canada, as of the most recent census of 
the population of Canada taken by Statistics Canada, other than 
any real property acquired pursuant to the National Parks Act or 
the Historic Sites and Monuments Act or any real property that is 
occupied or used as a park and has been prescribed to be included 
in the definition “federal property” pursuant to paragraph 
9(1)(d), 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) any Indian reserve, except for that part of the reserve (i) 
that is occupied for residential purposes by an employee of Her 
Majesty in right of Canada who would not, but for that 
employment, live on that reserve and that is prescribed 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act makes some changes in this area but the real issue goes 
back to the first part of this, which states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>any council of a band within the meaning of the Indian Act that 
levies and collects a real property tax or a frontage or area tax 
pursuant to an Act of Parliament,

Act, chapter 18 of the Statutes of Canada 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is whether Bill C-9, which numerically precedes 
Bill C-10, creates a new kind of taxing authority, a taxing 
authority that is the result of amendments to the Constitution of 
Canada.  I would suggest to the House that to change the 
Constitution of Canada is not something that can happen in a 
piece of legislation in the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it appears as if Bill C-9 creates under the Nisga'a 
treaty a level of government that is not recognized in the 
Constitution of Canada.  The Constitution of Canada clearly 
recognizes the federal government, provincial government and 
municipal government.  That is where it ends.  Somehow another 
level of government has been created under Bill C-9 which, 
according to the act that I just read with regard to a taxing 
authority, leads into some difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask what the complication is.  I ask, what other level 
of government can override provincial and federal laws?  There is 
not one.  Under Bill C-9 and the Nisga'a treaty it is possible 
that a new kind of government structure can override federal and 
provincial laws.  It is clearly stated that it does so in 14 
areas.  It says that the Nisga'a government can override federal 
and provincial laws in 14 areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read those areas into the record:  Nisga'a citizenship; 
structure, administration, management and operation of Nisga'a 
government; Nisga'a lands and assets; regulation, licensing and 
prohibition of businesses, professions and trades; preservation, 
promotion and development of Nisga'a language and culture; direct 
taxation of Nisga'a citizens; adoption; child and family 
services; preschool to grade 12 education; advanced education; 
organization and structure of health care delivery; authorization 
and licensing of aboriginal healers; Nisga'a annual fishing plans 
for harvest and the sale of fish and aquatic plants; and Nisga'a 
wildlife and migratory birds entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are areas in which the federal and provincial governments 
may make laws and the particular government structure created 
under Bill C-9 allows this group to override these provisions. 
How can that be when the constitution clearly does not recognize 
this form of government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill allows payment in lieu of taxes to a government that 
is neither fiscally nor democratically accountable.  That is the 
other part of Bill C-9 which I take strong exception to.  We 
would think that this was a simple matter but it is anything but 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 creates three levels of government within the Nisga'a 
treaty.  There is the central Nisga'a Lisims, then four village 
governments and three urban local governments.  Most of the 
individual Nisga'a will be dependent upon that government 
structure.  It is as if this government is somehow going to be 
independent and able to provide and have the resources to allow 
its citizens to make a living and create the kind of successful 
and healthy environment for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the provisions of that particular treaty, it is pretty 
clear that that is very doubtful.  There will be a concentration 
of power in this group of government structures at three 
different levels.  The Nisga'a citizens will be largely dependent 
on either the government largesse or will be employed by certain 
government corporations. It is concentrating power into a small 
group and giving it big powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gordon Gibson is a very strong scholar of democratic processes. 
He was the leader of the Liberal Party in British Columbia and is 
now a fellow of the Fraser Institute in British Columbia.  He has 
done a lot of research on the business of power and how democracy 
actually allocates power to certain groups.  He made the 
observation: “Small governments with large powers may acquire 
the ability to control the citizens rather than vice versa”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely critical to the success of a democratic 
system of government.  The people ought to be in control of the 
government, not the other way around.  That is an abuse of the 
basic principles and philosophies of a democratic form of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that not only has a new form of government been 
created under the Nisga'a treaty, but it has also created power 
in that group which really is too great in order to manage in a 
truly democratic fashion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another significant part.  This particular government 
will not be spending its own money.  It will be sitting there 
spreading largesse to its citizens, but it will not be money 
collected from the citizens given back to them in one program or 
another.  No, it will be money collected from taxpayers across 
Canada.  That is the money it will be spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people argue that it is not really all that much. The 
minister of Indian affairs told us it would only cost us $500 
million.  It is pretty clear that is the absolute minimum amount 
and if we analyse what some of the costs will be, it will be 
closer to $1.3 billion.  Talk about a change. We should take 
cognizance of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point to recognize is that with the new government 
created under Nisga'a, the act does not allow non-Nisga'a people 
to vote for that government.  They can pay taxes to it.  That 
government has the right to assess their property and force them 
to pay taxes but in no way are they represented on the group that 
actually makes the decisions about how their property should be 
assessed, how much the mill rate should be and the payment that 
should be made. These are serious shortcomings and should not be 
allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that there are some very serious problems. 
A taxing authority has been created.  Is this really a taxing 
authority in terms of the provisions and definition in the 
Municipal Grants Act as currently written, and the Constitution 
of Canada itself which overrides all these considerations?  What 
ought to be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There ought to be some equality created.  The kind of government 
structure that exists within the Nisga'a and the government 
structure that exists in other provinces and municipalities ought 
to be the same.  The rules governing the election of these people 
ought to be the same.  Everybody ought to be allowed to vote for 
those people who will ultimately decide how the money will be 
spent, how they will be taxed and things of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equality principle is absolutely fundamental in order for us 
as democratic citizens to feel that we have some equal 
opportunity to influence what is happening in government. Instead 
of doing that, Bill C-9 builds another brick in the wall of 
separation between ethnic groups.  For that reason I have some 
serious difficulties with it. But that is only one part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part is that there is no equality among Canadians 
generally, and even among those people who live on the Nisga'a 
lands.  There are those who are Nisga'a and those who are not. 
There is also a lack of accountability.  There is no clear 
statement about how this group shall be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can read the provisions of the treaty and say some of that is 
provided for.  I will read some of things that should be provided 
for, and to a degree are, but not completely or enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the procedures and processes for the election of local 
aboriginal governments on reserves whether it be Nisga'a or 
elsewhere, the services of Elections Canada should be made 
available to deal with allegations of vote rigging and 
intimidation.  That provision is missing.  It is important that 
Elections Canada have something to say about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal accounting procedures of local aboriginal 
governments, including the provision of the services of the 
Auditor General of Canada to ensure fiscal responsibility, should 
be made available and should apply in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The direction of a greater portion of Indian affairs funding, or 
Nisga'a funding, should go directly to aboriginal persons on the 
reserves.  Then local aboriginal governments would have to tax it 
from its own people in order to get access.  That would put the 
purse strings of local aboriginal governments in the hands of the 
people to whom the governments should be accountable. 
This is the essence of responsible government that 
non-aboriginals have enjoyed for 150 years, but which our 
aboriginal people are still waiting for on reserves.

the Nisga'a treaty.

those things.  What are our children and our grandchildren going

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> In fairness to the 
member for Kelowna who very cleverly and I thought with great 
ingenuity managed to bring the Nisga'a treaty into the Municipal 
Governments Act, my signal was that it might be time to make that 
linkage again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I was alone, but I am sure other members were wondering 
what bill was being debated.  As I said earlier this week, the 
responsibility rests with the member not to challenge the Chair 
on relevance.  I thought that the member for Kelowna had done a 
very good job in linking the two, but once that link has been 
severed, it is the responsibility of the member to bring it back 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with pleasure I will 
bring it back to Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 clearly indicates that it is to meet three principles: 
equality, fairness and predictability.  Those are the three 
principles that are supposed to be evident in Bill C-10.  To a 
degree they are in Bill C-10, but to a degree they are not.  It 
is the degree to which they are not that I wish to address and 
illustrate through the provisions of the Nisga'a treaty.  It is a 
very practical example of how this works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go further than that and indicate clearly how we would 
establish the business of becoming accountable and more equal in 
terms of the treatment of people, not only of Nisga'a but of all 
people across Canada, in particular people of ethnic origin that 
might be called aboriginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's ultimate goal is that all people be full and 
equal participants in Canadian citizenship, indistinguishable in 
law and treatment from other Canadians.  What could be more fair 
than that kind of a statement with regard to Bill C-10 which 
talks about taxation and payment in lieu of taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party maintains also that any form of Indian 
self-government will be a delegated form of government, and all 
land within the borders of Canada will remain part of Canada. The 
laws of Canada and the charters, including the Canadian 
constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
will apply to Indian government.  Any laws enacted by Indian 
governments must conform with the laws of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely the point we want to make.  This is another 
law that should be applied in detail here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party also supports that the Auditor General of 
Canada has full authority to review the management of federal 
funds by Indian governments and all governments.  We want that to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the right of individuals living on 
reserves and eligible for government benefits to choose and 
receive those benefits either directly from the federal 
government or through the Indian government.  That is a very 
significant issue and deals directly with payment in lieu of 
taxes.  Why would the government make payment in lieu of taxes if 
it was not to make sure that the people got the necessary 
services from government and the taxing authority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask specifically whether or not this issue is a 
significant one for us to consider in great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to draw to the attention of the House exactly where some 
of the people sit with regard to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty-nine per cent of the people in British Columbia believe 
that they did not have an adequate opportunity to provide input 
into the Nisga'a treaty.  Ninety-two per cent believe that they 
should have the right to vote on the principles of the treaty. 
The respondents want their member of parliament to vote against

92.3%, Vancouver—Kingsway at 82.1% and Vancouver Quadra at 
91.5%.  That is how their constituents want them to vote, but how 
will they vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we have constitutional and potential legal problems 
but we also have a political problem.  Will the Liberal 
government continue to blatantly show contempt for democracy and 
ignore what the people want?  Will the government continue to 
show spite and disdain for the people of Canada and the 
democratic process and not allow its political people to reflect 
what people want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attempted to show that the consecutive bills, Bill C-9 
and Bill C-10, are related in effect and to each other.  Both 
fall short of what people want.  Both should be amended to more 
accurately reflect what people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advisory panel created under Bill C-10 was created at the 
advice of the municipal councillors, and rightly so, but the bill 
does not go far enough to give these people any kind of authority 
so that their recommendations will be treated seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's discretion with regard to whether he accepts, 
amends or rejects their recommendations should be tied up.  His 
discretion should be limited much more than is the case.  That is 
what the people want.  That is not what the minister has given 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also clearly suggested that money making crown 
corporations, which are set up to make money for the Government 
of Canada, should be included under schedule 4.  Again these 
corporations are not talked about at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not listening to the people.  It is saying to the people 
that it does not matter what they recommend.  There is already 
evidence that it will not listen.  How can we believe that it 
will now listen when the panel makes a recommendation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need included in the bill that the recommendations of the 
advisory panel not be unreasonably refused by the minister. 
Finally, schedule 4 must include corporations that make money. 
There are three specifically.  Two were named by the joint 
technical advisory committee on payment in lieu of taxes and 
another I have added.  They are Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, Canada Post Corporation and Royal Canadian Mint.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member who 
spoke before me spent a good half hour using Bill C-10 as an 
excuse to introduce the Reform Party's objections to the Nisga'a 
treaty. I, however, am going to try to get the debate back to 
Bill C-10, back to the municipalities and to federal-provincial 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is going to have a title that is far better adapted to 
reality—for which I congratulate the minister.  It will no longer 
speak of grants. I am going to read its official full title—an 
act respecting payments in lieu of taxes to municipalities, 
provinces and other bodies exercising functions of local 
government that levy real property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust then that there will be no more talk of grants, for a 
grant is a gift, and that means that the recipient, the grantee, 
is receiving a present.  The federal government is very big on 
giving gifts.  Moreover, in this bill, as my distinguished 
colleague from Vancouver Quadra has indicated, the minister's 
discretionary power is omnipresent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point. It is the minister who will be going about 
distributing largesse.  That is one thing we can say about the 
Liberals: they are past masters at this kind of disguised gift 
and at ministerial interference.  If an MP from their party asks 
the minister to exercise his discretionary power on behalf of a 
municipality in his riding, it is a rare thing for the minister 
to refuse.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if someone from another political party is facing the 
same problem, the minister rarely has the funds.  He is rarely 
able to comply and to exercise this discretionary power, which 
he has obtained under just about all the laws passed in this 
parliament since 1993. I have been in this House since October 
of that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can congratulate the government on the new title. However, it 
is not accurate when it comes to legislation on payments made in 
lieu of taxes to municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between income tax and property tax.  But 
this is a minor fault that will not be held against the 
government. 
What we can criticize it for, however, is paving the way for 
discretionary action, petty political jockeying, under the table 
arrangements, as well as unjustified and unjustifiable gifts. We 
are not happy about this aspect of the bill.  The minister's 
discretionary power is really exorbitant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also something of grave concern to municipalities, in 
particular to the Union des municipalités du Québec, which we 
contacted.  The bill was introduced here on October 27, 1999 at 
first reading, that is, only a few working days ago. 
Municipalities were not given much time to examine the bill 
carefully and assess its real impact. 
The government is pressing us to adopt this bill immediately 
but, frankly, municipalities are not pleased with this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the substance of the bill and draw a parallel 
between this piece of legislation and other ones, we see a 
constant. It is always the same thing when the government tables 
any bill. With all its bills, the government has this annoying 
propensity, this bad habit of targeting the poor and making them 
pay because they form the largest group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Employment Insurance Act is a case in point. 
Today, we are told that the minister—who is using very 
conservative figures—will amass a surplus of some $95 billion over 
the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where does he take all that money? He gets it through cuts 
in transfers to the provinces, which are directly accountable to 
people. The provinces are on the front line when it comes to 
dealing with the public. So, the federal government makes cuts 
affecting hospitals and many other services, uses its tremendous 
taxing power to get more money, and then its spending power, all 
this with a cavalier attitude, bragging all along about having 
money and being able to interfere in just about any area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This often creates false hopes, false expectations or even real 
expectations. However, when the time comes to meet these 
expectations, the federal government passes the buck to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have a pharmacare program. It cost Quebecers a lot 
of money to establish that program. All Quebecers are paying for 
it. I am told that the program is working well. Fortunately, and 
thank goodness, I am not sick and I do not really use that 
program. But everyone says that it is working well. When the 
federal government noticed how successful the program was, it 
hastened to step in.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget speech, the government mentioned the possibility 
of launching a pharmacare program.  Once the program is up and 
running, once people have come to trust it and rely on it, the 
federal government will pull out, as it always does and leave 
people stuck with a program that they will then have to 
beginning supporting themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with employment insurance.  This government 
does not have the courage to bring in tax increases, but it 
knows that most of those with jobs pay taxes, since all of those 
with jobs are subject to tax. 
So, by keeping EI premiums high, the government can count on 
those with jobs paying premiums and will be able to rake in 
$95.5 billion over the next five years, which is shocking and 
scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say this bill is no different, or that the attitudes are 
the same as in the past, I mean that when a municipality wants 
to build a road, water or sewer infrastructure, the cost of 
laying down a bed so that lines do not shift, crack or break 
through freezing and thawing is extremely high.  Taxpayers 
figure that the cost of bringing in a line, or building a road 
or sidewalks will be shared among users, those who will benefit 
from the infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This holds for everyone except the government.  In my riding, 
for instance, there is a rehabilitation centre for young 
offenders with about 800 feet in frontage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. He has a 
little over 30 minutes remaining, but it being 11 o'clock, the 
House will now proceed to Statements by Members.  When we resume 
after question period, he will have the floor.

participant in the heavy fighting that occurred in northern

continuous dedication to our nation.

played a crucial role in shaping the fantastic communities we now

important services to the community.  We will not forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity—Spadina, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, six 
years ago today the Canadian people gave our Liberal Party a

embarked on a strategic plan to reduce the staggering 11.4% 
unemployment rate.  Taking a balanced approach we worked with 
various sectors of our economy, such as those involved in trade, 
research and development, tourism, youth employment and, of 
course, the small business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Trinity—Spadina, it gives me great pleasure 
to stand today and say that the unemployment rate in six years 
has moved from 11.4% to 7.2%.  In 1993, 13 million Canadians were 
working.  Today 1.8 million more Canadians have joined the 
workforce, a 14% increase, bringing the total to 14.8 million 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
fall of unemployment to 7.5% is good news as far as it goes, but 
our rate of unemployment remains staggeringly high when compared 
to earlier decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1950s 4% unemployment marked the depths of the recession. 
Today 7.5% is also staggeringly high when compared to other 
countries, such as Austria, the Netherlands, the United States 
and Norway.  All of these countries have reduced their 
unemployment to less than 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves.  Everyone here knows the 7.5% figure 
is not accurate.  It does not count those who find themselves on 
the welfare rolls.  Incredibly, it does not even count aboriginal 
people on reserves where unemployment could be 95%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the real figure is 7% or 17%, the question remains, why 
do we continue to tolerate chronic long term unemployment?  What 
ever happened to the goal of full employment for this country? 
Are there still people out there who are perverse enough to think 
that if unemployment drops too low it will spike the rate of 
inflation?

when the Liberal government took office in 1993 Canada was 
saddled with a $42 billion deficit.  Four years later that 
deficit was gone.  Achieving it was not without significant 
sacrifice by all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that sacrifice led to back to back surpluses for the

lowest level in nine years.  That is good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the economic statement of November 2 delivered by the

hundred years ago, there lived in Provence a greedy judge who 
decided one fine morning to lunch at an inn recommended to him. 
What should he see on arriving, there waiting for him, smiling, 
wearing his hat and carrying the spit?  A litigant.  The 
innkeeper was none other than one of the parties to a proceeding 
that he would hear.  So, with a heavy heart and an empty 
stomach, the judge turned on his heel and got himself a sandwich 
somewhere. 
The judiciary, which does not associate with just anyone, will 
soon have to appear before it.

was up for sale.  He urged the human resources department to 
sweeten the deal with a $1 million subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quelle surprise, Placeteco's buyer turned out to be a friend of 
the Prime Minister, the friend who bought land from his golf

the Placeteco deal, did he know that the interested buyer was his

<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Human resources documents confirm the Prime Minister's direct 
intervention to sweeten the Placeteco deal.  There is a clear 
history of business and political links between the Prime

to deliver the cash to the Prime Minister's friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find out that still another friend and patronage

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

was made by the department in administering the funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May of this year that was recognized.  In June a directive

which ends up being bought by another buddy, a business 
associate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are very proud of is today's labour numbers which

ties to the Prime Minister, government contracts given to a man 
who bought the Prime Minister's land, a trust fund administered 
by the friend of the Prime Minister, and an RCMP investigation 
into an unregistered lobbyist who is a friend of the Prime

question is for the minister of immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Canada's revolving door refugee system is a charade, puts an 
undue strain on Canadian taxpayers and constitutes a scandalous 
abuse of our border”.  These are not my words but the words of 
federal court judge Donna McGillis.  This judge is only telling 
the minister exactly what she has been told before by many 
Canadians.  Why will she not listen?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

determination system in Canada is not charade.  I think most 
Canadians are proud of the fact that we have due process in 
Canada and that we protect individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of multiple refugee claims is one that I hope will be 
discussed and addressed during the legislative review process 
that parliament is undertaking right now.  If the member opposite

collected since the 1906 census and information that will be 
collected in every future census.  Such transfer is currently 
prohibited.  The national archivist of Canada may make such

privatization of VIA Rail.  VIA Rail sold a part of its company 
to the private sector and then years later proceeded to try to

day, 365 days a year.

privatized, met good commercial standards and either run on its

could take over, as has been done by the Rocky Mountaineer in

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MUNICIPAL GRANTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK215">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, an 
act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was saying that 
in a civilized society, when a municipality develops an area or 
a street, or rebuilds infrastructures such as water or sewer 
pipes that are obsolete, blocked or broken, it is the abutting 
owners, that is the people living on either side of the street, 
who pay for such works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government is no ordinary citizen, even 
though it uses such infrastructures. Take, for example, a 
federal pier. Piers are huge things, even small ones. If a pier, 
a airport facility or something similar is located across from a 
federal lot or on it, there are astronomical costs involved just 
to go by the government's facilities, but the government refuses 
to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that these services are not for its 
servicing and does not want to contribute. In the bill, the 
government declines any responsibility regarding the payment of 
what is normally paid by abutting owners in the case of ports or 
national airports. As is always the policy with this government, 
the little guy the one who ends up paying. 
The little guy is the one who subsidizes the federal government 
and its facilities.  And this is profoundly unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this government is past master at the art of getting the 
most disadvantaged to pay.  Employment insurance was mentioned 
earlier.  This cannot go on indefinitely.  As we say in more 
colloquial terms, “the government is fouling its own nest”, and 
in the end, sooner or later, it will pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of its cutting its transfers to the 
provinces, notwithstanding the expected profits, the expected 
surpluses of $95 billion in the next five years. The government 
cut transfers to the provinces for health care.  In Quebec, we 
are told that the figures are hard to grasp, but over the past 
five years. it is something like $7.5 billion or thereabouts. 
And it is the seniors who are suffering the most as the result 
of these cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, seniors tend to support the party currently in 
power.  They are hurting themselves and do not seem to realize 
it.  The time for the government to be taking people and seniors 
for granted because it is the federal government and Liberal to 
boot is past.  It thinks everything is automatic, that seniors 
will vote for this government.  Unfortunately for the 
government, this is not always true, and these people are 
beginning to realize that this government, with its policies, is 
picking on the neediest, and they are often seniors, 
unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10—we are not going to quibble about it—is even better than 
what we used to have, except that the minister should perhaps go 
back to his drawing board and, in so far as possible, try to 
eliminate the discretionary power he is being given.  We know 
all about ministerial discretion—wisdom is not always the result 
when the minister exercises his discretion. The door is often 
opened to criticism and, even more often, to charges of 
political scheming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that our courts are backlogged. It is up to the 
lawmakers to do everything possible to ensure that laws are as 
clear as possible, so that challenges are kept to a strict 
minimum. 
Eliminating court backlogs and doing their job of drafting 
policies that are models of clarity, which Bill C-10 
unfortunately is not, is how the lawmakers can help society. The 
Bloc Quebecois is still going to support this bill, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works' press release put it this way 
“Modernized Municipal Grants Act Improves Fairness of Federal 
Payments in Lieu of Taxes”. I would have said the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to realize that its very presence in a 
municipality generates costs for the whole community that it is 
not prepared to assume.  Why do the federal government and Her 
Majesty not behave like good citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that their primary concern ought to be projecting 
the image of a good citizen, one that pays its way in society 
and gives the municipalities their due.  Federal buildings on 
provincial land also benefit from services, particularly in 
recent years when the government emblazons every federal 
building or office with a huge Canadian flag.  It is all very 
well to seek visibility, but the government should, in my 
opinion, start with paying its dues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is probably going to vote for this bill, but 
we will have questions for the minister when it is referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mention is made of extensive consultations, but the Union des 
municipalités du Québec, one of those consulted, complains of 
the very tight deadline. 
The bill was introduced barely a week ago, and its full impact 
cannot be gauged within a few days.  Far more time than that is 
needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to enter into the debate on Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from the investigation I have done that this bill comes 
to us as a result of two years of exhaustive consultations with 
various parties, most significantly the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities which is the organization that represents 
municipal governments. There were many compelling issues which it 
had to address.  From what I can understand the consultation 
process went very smoothly and people were well satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That satisfaction ended rather quickly when the FCM felt quite 
strongly that this bill was introduced too quickly.   The FCM was 
not given the time to review the contents of Bill C-10 and have 
further consultation with its members.  In other words, we are 
dealing with this bill now without having given the FCM the 
opportunity to do a broad consultation with its membership to 
look at the actual document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hope that after the FCM has had the time to open this 
document and look at the various clauses that it would meet many 
of the issues which were identified in the consultation process. 
I understand that there are many compelling issues because this 
bill deals with property taxes and we all know how critical 
property taxes are to municipalities.  Taxes are really their 
only source of revenue.  The way property taxes are levied on 
federal government properties and the way municipalities can 
collect those taxes is obviously of key and paramount importance 
to anyone involved in municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property tax is the basis for the major source of revenue for 
municipal governments.  It is the tax base that provides for the 
provision of municipal services and amenities. It is the capital 
against which municipal government itself can borrow for various 
undertakings.  Control over property tax and the authority to set 
taxes from year to year is the only thing which gives municipal 
councils the ability to function and to flourish and to do their 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the FCM took a very keen interest in this issue when 
the Municipal Grants Act came up for amendment and the 
consultation period began.  It is a mystery as to why we would 
jeopardize such a co-operative undertaking as the consultation 
period by bringing the bill forward now without giving the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities time to consult one more 
time.  We should have given it time to ask: Is the document the 
way we want it?  Have all the bases been touched?  Is the bill 
going to give satisfaction to the many concerns we have regarding 
municipal taxation et cetera? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Municipal Grants Act and various other acts establishing 
crown corporations provide for federal payments in lieu of taxes. 
They are called PILTs, payments in lieu of taxes.  They are based 
on local property tax rates and the assessed values of federal 
properties.  That is pretty straightforward.  I did not have too 
much trouble following up to that point.  It does get rather 
complex though. We are dealing with a very complex set of issues 
when dealing with the assessment of property taxes on properties 
owned by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people do not realize that the federal government only 
began paying property taxes to municipalities in 1950.  Until 
1950 the federal government did not pay property taxes to 
municipalities for the properties it owned.  It was only after 
very aggressive lobbying and representation by the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities that it undertook and finally succeeded 
in having the federal government pay its fair share for the 
properties which it owned within the municipal regions around the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose in making PILTs is to ensure that the federal 
government meets its financial obligations to those municipal 
governments where federal properties are located.  In this way 
the principles of fairness and equity can be upheld.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the goal.  That is the objective.  In my conversations 
with the FCM that is all it really wanted, to have the principles 
of fairness and equity upheld.  I am hoping to demonstrate how 
the federal government breached that noble aspiration.  It really 
failed to be fair and reasonable.  The principles of fairness and 
equity were not upheld in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the federal government paid $426 million on departmental 
properties to the municipalities, a fair whack of dough by 
anyone's account.  In addition, federal Crown corporations 
responsible to the treasury board paid another $175 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed all would be well with the land and people would be 
generally satisfied to receive payments to offset their own costs 
in running their municipalities.  However, in the last month of 
1992, the federal government imposed a two year freeze on 
property tax payments.  This is a luxury the federal government 
has.  Arbitrarily, out of the blue, the federal government simply 
said to the municipalities that it did not want to pay any more 
property taxes because it was in sort of a budget crisis or a 
deficit situation.  As one way to reduce its deficit it said that 
it would not pay its taxes to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is a concept.  I wonder how long we would get away 
with making a statement like that to the federal government.  If 
my personal household finances were in disarray, which in fact 
they are, I cannot say to the federal government that I will not 
pay my taxes for two years until I catch up on my other 
obligations.  It would not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see why the municipalities were very concerned that the 
federal government had the control, power and authority to 
arbitrarily and unilaterally announce that it would not pay 
property taxes any more.  When the Municipal Grants Act came up 
for review there was a great deal of attention paid from across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no prior consultation with the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities or with any municipal governments, many of which 
already had their budgets prewritten for 1993.  They had already 
planned on a certain amount of money coming in during 1992 that 
they were to spend in 1993 when their intergovernmental partner 
arbitrarily announced it would not give them the money. 
Understandably it caused some furor across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This freeze came just weeks after the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities finished participating in a two year evaluation of 
the municipal grants program by the department of public works. 
It had just gone through a long, drawn out consultation with the 
municipalities.  Again, much in the same way it happened here, 
the federal government arbitrarily stopped the consultations and 
did something that was entirely negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two year evaluation at that time concluded that federal 
property tax payments represented the government's fair share of 
local costs as property owner.  The freeze was arbitrary.  No 
concern over levels of property tax payments was expressed in the 
evaluation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important principle behind the federal payment of property 
taxes is that municipal governments and local ratepayers should 
not be at a disadvantage by having federal properties on land 
that could otherwise be taxed by a private sector owner at a 
better rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it should not be a liability to have federal 
government buildings within municipalities, but in fact it is if 
they have to forgo revenue.  If they cannot charge the federal 
government tax at the same mill rate they would be able to charge 
a private sector company on that land, surely the municipalities 
are at a real disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must structure the Municipal Grants Act in a way that people 
do not view having the government department as a liability, 
especially one which takes up a large area.  That is land which 
could otherwise be taxed at a reasonable rate of return and the 
municipality could prosper and function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All properties should be taxed equally regardless of ownership. 
That is the principle we want to see reflected in Bill C-10. 
There is some concern within the Canadian Federation of 
Municipalities that may not be the case.  It really has not had 
time to review Bill C-10 because it just showed up on its 
doorstep a few days ago and we are debating it in the House of 
Commons already.  There is a great deal of concern out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the largest property owner and taxing authority in the 
country, the Government of Canada set a dangerous example when it 
declared a freeze on property tax payments to some 2,200 
municipal governments with federal properties in their 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the federal government owns 50,000 buildings across 
Canada. 
Actually I have heard a figure as high as 68,000 buildings across 
Canada.  That is an awful lot of property on which it should be 
paying taxes at a normal mill rate to municipalities.  They 
should celebrate when a government department wants to move to 
their area.  They should not have to be suspect and worried about 
a net loss by hosting the federal government in their 
communities.

to look at options for long term improvements in arrangements for 
federal payment of property taxes and to consider the 
implementation of the freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its political and technical representations, FCM 
succeeded in having the federal government interpret the freeze 
on departmental properties such that it met all increases in 
PILTs during the first year of the freeze.  There was some 
satisfaction.  Some very in-depth negotiations went on and some 
very capable people on the part of the FCM came forward to 
represent, thankfully, the people who live in the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that municipal governments are really the 
level of government most close to us.  They take care of our 
immediate needs in terms of road repair, garbage collection, fire 
departments and cats stuck in a tree.  They are the ones who will 
help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that they are adequately funded because 
people often question what gets done with the taxes they send to 
the federal government.  Often the federal government is dealing 
with things that are at a level three steps removed from the 
ordinary Canadian.  It is very important what happens to the 
PILTs.  What the FCM does with its PILTs is very important to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCM made federal property tax payments a major issue in its 
call to action during the 1993 election campaign.  I dare say it 
played a big role in the 1993 election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happened in 1993.  The government of the day 
was humiliated.  It was absolutely dismantled.  It went from a 
couple of hundred seats down to two.  It was partly this campaign 
from municipalities, people who had direct contact with their 
people, that probably led to that.  They were so dissatisfied, in 
fact so horrified by the arbitrary freeze of their property tax 
payments, that they were angry at the government of the day in 
such a way that I believe they did help shape the results of that 
1993 election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the strong municipal support for FCM's 1993 
election campaign on PILTs, the newly elected government 
committed that all increases on PILTs, on departmental 
properties, would be met for the second and final year of the 
freeze.  They were getting some satisfaction from the newly 
elected government after the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are disappointed now, though, that the newly elected 
government that took power after 1993 is acting in the same kind 
of arbitrary way.  It is not dealing with the monetary issue, but 
it is arbitrarily ceasing the very productive consultation 
process and showing up with the document we call Bill C-10 
without giving the FCM a real opportunity to screen it, to test 
it and to make sure the language is such that it will meet the 
needs and very real concerns we see in the position paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that acts do not get opened for amendment every day. 
It is very difficult.  Once we have an act open for amendment, 
that is the opportunity to amend any section of the act.  We are 
not limited to the one or two specific reasons the government 
opened it up. We might want the opportunity to make an amendment 
to a completely different section.  We want to make sure to get 
it right because we do not get chances every day to amend 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly voice my concern too.  Why did the government stop 
listening?  When things were going so well and it looked like 
some co-operative settlement might be arrived at on what to do 
with the Municipal Grants Act, why did it then begin to act with 
such a heavy hand and arbitrary way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the strong municipal support for the FCM's 
campaign, again the newly elected government committed that all 
increases on PILTs would be met for the second and final year of 
the freeze.  The freeze on crown corporations was lifted outright 
for the second year.  Moreover, the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and the President of the Treasury Board 
agreed in 1995 to negotiations with the FCM on longstanding 
municipal concerns respecting laws and regulations governing 
PILTs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize what we have seen as the real concern through 
our research on this issue.  The real concern is that there 
should be rules in place in the Municipal Grants Act to ensure 
that neither party can arbitrarily alter the terms and conditions 
of the relationship by simply backing out, as we saw in 1992.  We 
also want to make sure the assessment on government buildings is 
no different from the assessment on private sector buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The predictable consequence of that is that no municipality 
would want a government department to set up shop in its area 
because it would be forgoing revenue.  Why on earth would a 
municipality want all that space occupied by a freeloader, one 
might say?  I do not think any responsible municipal government 
would encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules governing federal payments of property taxes have long 
been an issue in relations between federal and municipal 
governments.  There is a long history that goes back to 1950 when 
the federal government did not pay any taxes at all on its 
buildings.  It was only after quite a brouhaha that the FCM got 
satisfaction and the federal government started paying any taxes 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Municipal Grants Act the government is able to set its 
own assessed values on properties and pay lower property taxes. 
That is a key point that we would like to see addressed in Bill 
C-10.  The government should not be able to arbitrarily say what 
it will pay per year for occupying a couple of acres of land. 
That is a big brother type approach that is outdated and 
obsolete.  It does not speak well of the type of 
intergovernmental relations we would want to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently federal reviews of property values frequently lead to 
the retroactive reduction of PILTs, causing severe financial 
disruption to municipal governments.  I use the example of 1992 
where 2,200 municipalities already had their budgets set for 1993 
only to lose their main source of revenue, the federal government 
tax transfer or the payment of property taxes from the federal 
government to the municipalities.  We cannot have that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only recourse of the municipalities is to the municipal 
grants review committee comprised of appointees of the minister. 
If they have a grievance about the way property tax values were 
assessed, their only avenue of recourse is to a group of the 
minister's own appointees.  That is not in the interest of basic 
fairness or natural justice either.  I cannot see how that is 
fair.  I know that is one of the issues that is addressed in Bill 
C-10.  They want an appeals board or an advisory committee that 
will be structured in a more fair and democratic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I will certainly say about the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities is that it is nothing if not democratic.  It has 
great consultation with its people.  It does not move forward on 
an issue until it has done broad consultation across the country. 
It truly builds consensus on issues before it makes an 
announcement.  Hence its frustration that it is not able to have 
that level of consultation about Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After heavy and long drawn out negotiations in 1995 there was a 
consensus report of the joint technical committee on PILTs to 
which I referred.  Many of the issues I started my remarks with 
stem from that report, such as the critical importance of having 
a guaranteed stream of taxation revenue that they do not have to 
worry about being arbitrarily interrupted by one party and the 
fact that property taxes should be set at the same level for 
government buildings as they are for private sector buildings to 
avoid the bizarre spectre of losing revenue by having a 
government department set up shop in a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those few reservations and criticisms our party is 
reviewing Bill C-10 with the guidance and direction of the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  If it is satisfied with 
the bill we will do what we can to help get it through to give 
the federation the security it wants on at least the issues 
addressed in Bill C-10.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on Bill C-10, 
the proposed changes to the Municipal Grants Act, or what will 
become the payments in lieu of tax act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might not be the most exciting legislation to be debated in 
the House this fall.  Discussion of process and the internal 
mechanics of government are unlikely to make coverage of 
parliamentary debates one of the top rated shows on Canadian 
television, but it is certainly important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by bringing to the attention of members of 
parliament a concern expressed to me about the breakneck speed 
this legislation is being rushed through parliament. From there I 
want to review some of the history of the legislation, both the 
background and some of the most recent problems that have led to 
this new bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there, I will present a brief overview of the bill from my 
own perspective and then dive into an analysis of some of the 
changes proposed, particularly with respect to the dispute 
advisory panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will give hon. members my critique of the bill and I 
will try to persuade them that the legislation needs more work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, in conversations my staff had with representatives 
from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities or FCM, it was 
made abundantly clear that municipalities and their organizations 
do not appreciate having this legislation rammed down their 
throats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities were not given any advance notice that this 
legislation would be introduced.  No information, no background 
notes, no news releases, no summaries or other materials were 
sent out to municipalities.  They have also not had time to study 
the bill and respond to it.  In the case of FCM, it has not had 
time to consult its members on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This begs the question:  If this is such a great piece of 
legislation, then what is the rush?  We all know from experience 
that when legislation is rushed through the House, mistakes often 
get overlooked.  Quick legislation is bad legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the House and as a member of the committee that 
will attempt to clean up any mistakes in the bill, I call upon 
the government to allow more time for the House and the standing 
committee to work on the bill and more time for municipalities 
and other stakeholders to ensure the legislation will correct 
past problems without creating new ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of past problems, the very fact that we have a 
Municipal Grants Act is a bit of an absurdity of history in that 
the federal government does not officially recognize the 
existence of municipalities.  Towns, cities and local service 
districts are not mentioned in the constitution.  They have no 
official mandate.  They are entirely creations of provincial 
governments.  Furthermore, the federal government has a 
constitutional exemption from paying local taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the federal government, which owns property 
in almost 2,000 municipalities across the country, benefits from 
all kinds of municipal services such as water and sewage, roads 
and other infrastructure.  Those services are not free. In spite 
of its constitutional exemption, the federal government should 
pay for those services like every other good property owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This paradox was resolved in 1950 with the passage of the first 
Municipal Grants Act, which has been updated and revised many 
times, most recently in 1980.  Since 1980, there have been a 
number of issues pop up that the current legislation does not and 
cannot resolve.  This is the basis of the bill we have before us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a couple of years ago, I remember that there was a 
dispute between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and local 
municipalities as to whether the department had to make a payment 
in lieu of taxes on wharves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago, the federally owned Aeroports de Montréal 
protested a property evaluation by the city of Dorval.  Ottawa 
re-evaluated the land at $100 million less than the property 
assessment and told the city that if it did not like it, it could 
contest the figure before the federal government appointed 
tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province of New Brunswick, the provincial department 
of municipalities estimates how much municipalities will receive 
from federal payments in lieu of taxes and pays them that amount. 
The department then goes about collecting the payments from the 
federal government.  However, it is only some time later that the 
federal government actually pays the amount due and in some cases 
the payment has taken years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the city of Halifax yelled foul when after increasing 
the evaluation of the Citadel for $15 million to $36 million, the 
federal government reduced its evaluation from $15 million to 
$1.2 million. 
Short of going to court, the two governments had no way of 
resolving this dispute.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the Government of Quebec gave municipalities the right 
to replace all or part of their business occupancy taxes with a 
new real property levy.  The result was a sudden $41 million 
increase in federal payments to Quebec municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, the provincial government eliminated its business 
occupancy tax.  To make up for lost revenue, Ontario 
municipalities increased their commercial real property tax rates 
by an average of about 45%.  These reforms cost the federal 
government as much as $100 million a year more in payments in 
lieu of taxes and in leasehold occupancy costs. Furthermore, 
crown corporations are paying approximately $30 million more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a freeze on the payments from 1993 to 1995 made 
municipal governments distrustful of the federal government and 
made the current system unreliable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, it is time to update the legislation to deal with these 
problems that have presented themselves in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today proposes changes in a number of areas. 
The bill would change the name of the legislation from the 
Municipal Grants Act to the payments in lieu of tax act, while 
references in the legislation to “grants” will be placed with 
the word “payments”.  This is to better reflect the nature of 
the program and the relationship between the Government of Canada 
as a property owner and Canadian and municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes introducing compensation for late payments by 
the federal government to municipalities.  It would also give the 
authority to Ottawa to make payments when tenants on federal 
property default on their local tax bills. These are important 
changes under which the federal government accepts a position 
much closer to that of other property owners regarding its tax 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would establish a dispute advisory panel under the act with a 
minimum of two board members from each province and territory. 
The advisory panel would recommend solutions to the minister when 
disputes arise between municipalities and the federal government 
over the appropriate amount of payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outdoor swimming pools, golf course improvements, outdoor 
theatres, residential driveways and employee parking improvements 
would be added to the definition of federal property and the bill 
would clarify the wording of the act as it relates to other 
non-building structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-10 proposes to improve the predictability of 
payments for municipalities by clarifying how payments are 
calculated for federal farm property, how deductions are 
calculated when municipalities are unable or unwilling to provide 
the federal property with equivalent services to those received 
by similar private property or structures.  It will also clarify 
the status of Parks Canada assets as federal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill does introduce some important changes, there 
is one important area where I have strong reservations.  Other 
than in clause 4 of the bill, which states that the intent of the 
act, and which I think is a waste of space as it accomplishes 
nothing, I would say that 90% of the bill is an improvement over 
the existing legislation.  The important exception is in clause 
14, which would establish a new disputes advisory panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major difficulties with this proposed new panel, 
the first being one of fairness and balance and the second being 
the composition of the panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine a court trial in which the defendant got to pick 
his own jury, pay the jury and install himself as the final judge 
with no chance of appeal.  How do we think the defendant would 
do?  I suspect he would win just about every case.  Would anyone 
describe the system as fair?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this is exactly the kind of dispute settlement panel that 
the minister has proposed in Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Differences in opinion often arise between municipalities and 
the federal government over how much the crown owes for payments 
in lieu of taxes. These disputes are often based on the 
evaluation of a property or the definition and classification of 
a property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the  minister has proposed is that he should establish an 
advisory panel composed of a minimum of 2 persons for each 
province and territory for a total of at least 26 members.  The 
members would be chosen only by the minister.  The minister will 
decide how qualified the members of the panel need to be.  He 
will pay them $125 an hour plus expenses and they will report 
only to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister can fire any or all members of the board at any 
time for any reason if, for example, he disagrees with their 
decision.  He can completely ignore any decisions of the panel if 
it suits his purpose and his decision is absolutely final.  There 
is no appeal.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not a bad deal.  So much for fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On issues related to the composition of the panel, let us look 
at clause 14 in more detail.  As I have said, subclause 1 
proposes a panel consisting of no less than two members from 
every province and territory with relevant knowledge and 
experience.  My first reaction was that once the bill passes, 
there are going to be 26 very happy Liberals across the country 
who will have brand new patronage jobs.  After all, $125 per hour 
plus expenses is a pretty good day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the minister has an informal advisory committee that 
has a chairperson and two members from the three provinces where 
there are currently outstanding disputes with municipalities, 
namely in Alberta, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  On any 
particular dispute, the two members from that province and the 
chairperson meet to resolve the dispute.  Once all the disputes 
have been dealt with, the committee of three is disbanded.  In 
other words, this is a temporary committee brought together and 
paid on an as needed basis, and when the job is done everyone 
goes home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister is proposing is that we will replace this as 
needed committee of 3 with a permanent panel of 26 members or 
better.  My question is that, for example, if no payment disputes 
arise in the territory of Nunavut in the next 30 years, why do we 
need to have at least 2 permanent members from Nunavut on the 
committee before they have anything to do?  The same is true of 
any other province or territory.  Why should the government 
undertake a rigorous search process and ask professional people 
to serve on a panel and then never give them anything to do? 
Would it not be better to wait until a dispute arises? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that there is not upper limit on the 
number of persons who can be appointed to this panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 1 also does not define what is meant by “relevant 
knowledge or experience”.  I assume this is also left up to the 
minister. There are several professional bodies of appraisers in 
the country, such as the Appraisal Institute of Canada and 
L'Ordre des Evaluateurs agréés du Québec.  I do not think it 
would be too much to require members of the panel to have some 
sort of professional designation.  Otherwise, we leave the system 
open for abuse and we start to see such things as a panel full of 
members who have no qualifications to hold office other than the 
fact that they are Liberal Party members or once gave money to 
the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 2 sets out the mandate of the panel as being to advise 
the minister on disputes over payments with municipalities. 
However, there is nothing in the bill to indicate how the 
minister would handle potential conflicts of interest where panel 
members are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it is reasonable to assume that since many of the 
experts on valuation of property work for or with municipalities, 
that at some point there will be panel members who might be 
employed with municipalities. How is the panel supposed to 
conduct itself if a dispute arises with a municipality, and one 
or more of the panel members who will adjudicate the dispute 
actually works for that same municipality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, under subclause 5, the bill indicates members of the 
panel may be employed in the Public Service of Canada.  What 
would be the approach if a dispute arises concerning the same 
federal department?  It is clear that the legislation must 
indicate how the panel would deal with conflicts and potential 
conflicts of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 3 sets out the duties of the chairperson as 
supervising and directing the operation and functioning the 
advisory panel.  It does not, however, give a clear indication of 
the workload of the chairperson.  Is this a full time job? 
Apparently, if the chairperson picks up the phone to call a panel 
member for two minutes, he or she can then bill the taxpayers for 
$125 plus expenses for an hour's work.  These things need to be 
clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to subclause 1, it says that members of the panel 
serve at the pleasure of the minister.  This is a legal term 
meaning that at any time and for any reason the minister can fire 
any or all members of the panel.  As a result, panel members may 
be reluctant to give independent advice or to reach a decision on 
a dispute that they feel the minister might disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much rather see the phrase “good behaviour” used as it 
gives a much greater degree of independence to panel members to 
reach independent decisions without fear of repercussion from the 
minister.  I feel that this would give better balance to the 
panel's decision and result in better settlements for taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be working with municipalities and municipal 
organizations over the next two weeks in an effort to find areas 
where the bill needs to be fixed. 
I will also be looking for solutions to the problems I have 
enumerated today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the bill in its entirety, it is generally an 
improvement over the present act, legislation of 1980.  It goes a 
long way toward addressing some of the problems that have cropped 
up in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is clear that this bill still needs a lot of work. I 
look forward to fixing the bill in committee.  The bill should 
not be defeated at this point because it is imperfect. 
Nevertheless, the problems need to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I call upon other members of the House to support

upon the minister to be open to working with members of the 
committee to find ways to make the bill work better for him, for 
his government and for Canadian taxpayers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
extremely pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-10 since 
I once held the position of president of the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clear up a misunderstanding that has been 
presented to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is something that the FCM has wanted since the 
arbitrary freeze and the 10% reduction the Tories brought in in 
December 1992.  Two weeks ago federal officials briefed the FCM 
on the policy initiatives and proposed regulations in the bill. 
While it is true that the FCM general membership has not had a 
chance to review the details, the executive director of the FCM 
and the director of policy have reviewed it.  I can say from long 
experience if there were problems in the bill, I for one would 
have received a call because I am in constant contact with my 
municipal colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is something we have wanted for many years, 
particularly since the December 1992 announcement by the then 
Conservative Minister of Finance who brought in the 10% 
reduction. This is an extremely important bill for municipal 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To clarify in terms of how we got to this stage, the Municipal 
Grants Act and various acts establishing crown corporations 
provided for federal payments in lieu of taxes, PILTs, based on 
local property taxes in 1950 following years of persistent 
representations by the FCM.  The purpose of making the PILTs is 
to ensure that the federal government meets its financial 
obligations to those municipal governments where federal 
properties are located.  In this way we underline the principles 
of fairness and equity so that they are upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the federal government paid $426 million on departmental 
properties.  In addition, federal crown corporations responsible 
to the treasury board paid $175 million.  In December 1992 the 
Conservative government imposed a two year freeze on property 
taxes without any consultation.  This was done at a time when 
many municipal governments had already established their 1993 
budgets. The freeze was clearly arbitrary.  No concern for any of 
the levels of property tax payments was expressed when this was 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important principle behind federal payment of property taxes 
is that municipal governments and local taxpayers should not be 
at a disadvantage for having a federal property in the community 
which could otherwise be taxed at the applicable rate.  All 
properties should be taxed equally regardless of ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in 1992?  The Conservatives imposed a freeze on 
crown corporations with unfair tax advantages over the private 
sector competition, at the expense of homeowners and businesses. 
As the largest property owner and taxing authority in this 
country, the Canadian government set a dangerous example when it 
declared a freeze on property taxes to some 2,200 municipal 
governments with federal properties. This 10% reduction was 
unacceptable to the municipal leaders and to the general public.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately in 1993 this government came to power.  It sent out 
an immediate note that it was prepared to work with municipal 
governments. I would point out that in 1993 it was this 
government which supported the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities in its national infrastructure program. It was 
this government which supported and has promoted the 20% club, 
which is to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% over 10 years.  It was 
this government which supported municipal governments and 
provided the tools when it came to urban crime and safety issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has nothing to apologize for on this issue. This 
government clearly has worked every step of the way with 
municipal governments to make sure that the legislation which 
they have been asking for is before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 1993 election the newly elected Liberal government 
committed that all increases in PILTs on departmental properties 
would be met for the second and final year of the freeze.  The 
freeze on crown corporations was lifted outright in the second 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
and the President of the Treasury Board agreed in 1995 to 
negotiations with the FCM on longstanding municipal concerns 
respecting laws and regulations governing PILTs. Rules governing 
federal payments respecting law regulations have long been an 
issue between the federal and municipal governments.  1996-97 was 
a watershed.  The FCM and federal officials had intensive 
negotiations. My colleague from the New Democratic Party referred 
to the technical steering committee that was set up.  That 
culminated in an agreement in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was present when that agreement was reached.  My colleague 
from Dauphin—Swan River was one who was concerned as well when 
he was mayor.  Issues such as the following ones were agreed to. 
Interest on late payments would come into effect.  There would be 
improved assurance on payment amounts and greater timeliness of 
payments.  The federal government and crown corporations would 
begin to make PILTs on property improvements subordinate to 
buildings commonly found in the private sector, including 
fencing, paving, sidewalks, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that the government has now brought 
legislation to the House which will modernize the Municipal 
Grants Act to improve fairness and equity.  What is very 
important to municipal leaders is that we now have predictability 
of federal payments in lieu of taxes to approximately 2,000 
municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the minister of public works and the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities for the work they have done over the 
years which has led to this historic occasion. The legislation 
has been changed to payments in lieu of taxes. That in itself is 
an important recognition.  The federal government is not giving 
out grants.  It is paying taxes like everyone else.  It is no 
different from anyone else and it is prepared to pay on time like 
everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A goodwill clause has been introduced to better reflect the 
nature of the program and the relationship between the federal 
government as a property owner and municipal governments. Of 
particular importance, and what highlights the very positive 
relationship which has developed since the coming to power of the 
Liberal government, is that despite recent increases in payments 
in lieu of taxes brought about by provincial assessment and 
taxation reform, there is nothing in this legislative package 
which causes a reduction in the payment to a single municipal 
government. 
The government could always appeal its assessment like we can, 
but it would go through the same process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to consult with municipal leaders in my 
riding during the summer last year.  The feedback was extremely 
positive.  Many of the issues raised are now contained in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works and Government Services has clearly 
listened.  The parliamentary secretary to the minister indicated 
the minister had 11 consultations around the country. The 
feedback was extremely positive. The government, rather than 
imposing freezes or reductions, has been working co-operatively 
and constructively with municipal governments, particularly with 
the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. I am very delighted to 
note that many of the issues have been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation empowers the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services to pay at his discretion supplementary 
amounts when payments are delayed.  A dispute advisory panel can 
be established under the act with expert representation from all 
provinces and territories to recommend to the minister 
appropriate solutions for disputes by municipal governments and 
the department concerning payment accounts.  It also commits to 
meeting municipal payment schedules when information is provided 
on an equivalent basis to that accorded to taxable persons. There 
is the introduction of compensation for late payments and 
authority to make payments when tenants on federal properties 
default on their tax obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important changes under which the government accepts a 
position much closer to that of other property owners regarding 
its tax obligations. What a difference seven years makes. This 
bill marks a turning point in the federal government's relations 
with municipal governments through co-operation, consultation and 
respect.  These changes confirm a new era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are concerns by the opposition or if some municipal 
governments look at the bill and want to slightly change it, 
after this bill is passed at second reading it will go to 
committee.  I presume that is where, if needed, any <I>i</I>'s 
will be dotted or <I>t</I>'s will be crossed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's largest urban centres such as Toronto, Vancouver and 
Montreal will benefit significantly from these changes.  There 
will be no more unilateral tax freezes, no more tax reductions by 
the federal government and no more changes without consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to work together remembering that there is only one 
taxpayer. The goal of the government is very clear.  For federal 
leaders and municipal leaders, it is the same.  We have the 
common goal to serve the taxpayer best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill fulfils the commitment which the government made when 
it came to power in 1993 having been part of the negotiations 
from 1993 to 1997.  It is a commitment I am very proud of.  The 
government has this legislation before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCM was very anxious that this legislation came before the 
House because it provides the predictability.  It provides the 
fairness.  It provides the equity.  These are things which those 
of us who have been involved in this issue for some time have 
wanted. This legislation recognizes the realities of the 1990s. 
It is legislation that is modern and reflects the desire of 
governments to deal with each other in a fair and clear manner.

I listened to his speech.  He said that this bill will be fully 
debated in committee.  That is exactly what I said in my speech. 
He is just repeating what I said.  I said that our party will 
support the bill at second reading.  We hope that in committee we 
will be able to bring about the necessary changes so we can 
support the bill at third reading.  If we are not allowed to 
bring about changes in committee, we will not have a choice but 
to vote against the bill at third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to learn that the hon. member opposite was a 
former president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. My

yesterday.  They are very upset that this bill is being rammed 
through the House at this time, because there were no 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree to give the municipalities more time 
to look at this piece of legislation in order for them to decide 
what they agree with or do not agree with?  As the former 
president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, he should 
know how the municipalities work.  The government should have 
used caution and not moved so fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish my colleague had 
been here in 1992.  With those kinds of comments we might not 
have had the Tories impose the arbitrary freeze and reduction on 
municipal governments.  Where were our friends in the Tory party 
in 1992?  Unfortunately they were not here, but that is history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the hon. gentleman that the FCM was fully 
briefed two weeks ago.  The president of the FCM will be at 
committee.  There certainly will not be any ramming.  I presume 
there will be full debate.  I hope to take part in those 
discussions.  Even though I am not a member of the committee, I 
intend to show up.  This is obviously something that is near and 
dear not only to my heart but to all colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in agreement.  I was very heartened to hear that the

predecessors were not as generous or enlightened as the hon. 
gentleman across the way.  I thank him and look forward to his 
support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the speech of the member for Oak Ridges. 
When he was president of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities he certainly listened well and he did a very good 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with his statement that the government believes 
in being fair and equitable.  How can the federal government see 
itself as being equal to every other taxpayer in the country when 
it thinks it should be exempt from paying taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contacted people at the Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
yesterday to talk to them about Bill C-10.  To my surprise, they 
informed me that they had no idea the bill had come back to the 
House.  I know for a fact that it has taken at least three years 
for the government to take action on some of the recommendations 
the FCM made to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member for Oak Ridges to respond to the 
question of fairness and equality as between the federal 
government and Canadian taxpayers.  As well, why was the FCM not 
informed that the bill would be tabled in the House this week? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
opposite for his questions.  I have the greatest respect him.  In 
our previous lives we used to correspond a lot, but we never 
actually came face to face until we came to the House. 
I do not think it was a surprise to either of us that we have a 
fair number of things in common when it comes to municipal 
concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this legislation will treat the federal government as a 
taxpayer, just like everyone else.  The government will pay on 
time.  It will pay penalties if it does not.  The bill will 
ensure that if there is an assessment question the government 
will go through the same process as taxpayers go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities is 
concerned, it was briefed two weeks ago.  The minister in June 
1998 went to the FCM convention along with the Prime Minister. 
It is too bad the Leader of the Opposition was not there.  He 
missed a tremendous speech on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happened.  The minister, in consultation with the 
FCM, in June said to over 2,000 delegates “I want to hear from 
you”, which is why the round tables were set up across the 
country.  I am sure the minister met with mayors and councillors 
in their ridings to get feedback so that the minister would hear 
the concerns of the grassroots.  That is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will be going to committee after second reading.  I can 
guarantee members that the president of the FCM will be there and 
that he will make any comments with regard to anything in the 
legislation that the FCM may have a question about.  But to 
suggest for a moment that it was not briefed is not the case.  I 
do not know to whom he was speaking at the FCM, but the executive 
director and the policy director were fully briefed.  They knew 
what was in the bill.  Two weeks have gone by and my phone is not 
broken, but they did not call me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member from Oakville for suggesting that there 
was wide consultation, because there was.  We all know that.  It 
took a little better than four and a half years to go through the 
whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member insisted that people at the FCM were thoroughly 
briefed on the bill two weeks ago, and that may very well be 
true.  In fact, my consultation with people at the FCM 
corroborates that indeed they were briefed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is what happened between the time the FCM 
people were briefed and the actual presentation of the bill. 
Clearly the FCM people then had to be advised that there were 
certain recommendations that were originally proposed to be 
included in the bill, but were in fact not in the bill.  The 
addition of certain corporations to schedule 4, for example, was 
deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is that the panel should have some teeth and 
that everything should not be at the discretion of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These recommendations were included in the report of the joint 
technical committee and the consultations which took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member is so absolutely convinced that everything is 
hunky-dory with regard to the FCM and with regard to the 
briefing, why is it that not all of those things, which 
apparently he thought they understood, they apparently did not 
agree with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, although I come from the 
fastest growing community in Canada, Richmond Hill, the riding is 
Oak Ridges.  We have not expanded to Oakville yet, although we 
are probably working on it, but I do thank the member for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the FCM was on Parliament Hill two weeks ago. 
At that time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Nobody is denying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  I appreciate the fact that the hon. 
member collaborated what I said with regard to the fact that it 
was consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not remember saying that absolutely everything that every 
municipal government or the FCM wanted was in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand we are saying that it took four and a half years 
to get here.  I guess the inference is that the process has been 
slow. It was deliberately done in a way that got all of the 
parties to the table, and that concluded in the agreement of 
1997.  If there was not a federal election in April 1997, the 
legislation may have been before the House at that time.  To 
reinforce that we were getting it right, we held consultations 
during the summer of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is, in general, without question, what the FCM 
wanted to see.  When the bill goes to committee, I am sure that 
anything that needs to be clarified or added will be dealt with.

would ask the Chair to ensure that I get my full 20 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, does not go 
far enough to ensure that municipalities will be treated fairly 
and equally by the federal government and crown corporations on 
the issue of property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the minister and crown corporations still 
retain too much discretionary power.  If federal governments, 
both past and present, really understood and did the right thing, 
why would we need any kind of legislation regarding the whole 
issue of the federal government paying taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians all pay taxes.  We know what happens if we do not. 
None of us want to encounter Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of grants in lieu of taxes goes back many years. 
Whenever municipal leaders get together, grants in lieu of taxes 
seems to be a favourite topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite federal constitutional powers for tax exemption, as we 
approach the new millennium why does the federal government not 
operate under the principle of equal and fair treatment when it 
comes to paying its taxes on federal buildings located in 
municipal jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words about municipalities.  They have been 
around for a long time in the country, a lot longer than the 
Canadian federation.  Like many of my colleagues in the House, 
such as the member for Oak Ridges, I was a former municipal mayor 
before coming to Ottawa.  At least 10% of the members of 
parliament in this House came from a municipality, and there is 
no doubt that we all know the effects of both federal and 
provincial downloading on the municipalities, as well as 
governments not paying their taxes to municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government needs to pay all of its taxes, period. 
The federal government should not expect special treatment from 
the taxpayers.  The federal government uses the same services as 
everyone else.  It uses roads, sewage systems, water services, 
garbage collection and other services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipal governments are the backbone of the country's economy. 
There are currently a couple of high cost items that municipal 
governments across the land have to deal with.  Those are water 
and sewage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that in a country like ours there are many 
municipalities and communities that do not have full water 
treatment facilities.  These communities basically rely on 
chlorination.  Giardia is commonplace in many of the communities. 
Over the last couple of years we have heard in the press about 
large communities, such as those close to Toronto and Victoria, 
having cases of giardia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even deadlier bacteria, like cryptospiridium, cannot be treated 
effectively with chlorine.  These water treatment plants require 
a huge capital investment and obviously the source of the capital 
comes from taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I believe you are signalling me to end my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to

and will have approximately sixteen minutes in which to speak

<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</B> moved that Bill 
C-238, an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act (mail 
contractors), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to have the bill come 
forward.  I felt very fortunate when my name was drawn in the 
lottery and then very grateful when the standing committee chose 
to make the bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is an issue of broad public interest and something 
that is long overdue.  I will argue, and I hope that I can prove 
to the House, that we have an opportunity to correct a 
longstanding injustice.  We have an opportunity to right a 
longstanding wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill, Bill C-238, is probably one of the shortest.  It is 
certainly the shortest that I have ever seen.  I think it might 
be the smallest bill on record.  It is one line exactly.  It 
calls for one simple thing, to repeal subsection 13(5) of the 
Canada Post Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 13(5) is a very small subsection that bars rural 
route mail contractors from the right to collective bargaining. 
They do not have the right to form a union.  They do not have the 
right to join a union.  They do not have the right to bargain 
collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that support for giving these people these rights is 
spreading broadly.  I know that the hon. member from Kamloops 
strongly supports the concept because in his rural setting there 
are rural route mail couriers who have probably sought him out to 
lobby and to explain the problems they run into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this particular group of workers barred from collective 
bargaining?  The Canada Labour Code, the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, international conventions and covenants all 
guarantee the right to free collective bargaining for employees. 
The reason is that subsection 13(5) makes the argument that these 
are not to be considered employees.  They are to be considered 
independent contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with that problem, this group of workers went to the 
Canada Labour Relations Board and asked, “Are we employees or 
are we independent contractors?”  They brought that question to 
the only avenue of recourse that they really could bring it to. 
The Canada Labour Relations Board ruled unanimously that these 
are not independent contractors and that their relationship with 
Canada Post is that of an employer and employee.  At best, it is 
a wholly dependent contractor.  Under the Canada Labour Code, a 
dependent contractor is, in fact, an employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would wonder, then, what the problem is.  This group of 
workers went and got the ruling they were seeking.  The problem 
is that the government went to the Federal Court of Appeal and 
had the CLRB ruling overturned, not on the basis of merits. 
Frankly, the federal court did agree that these people are in 
fact employees.  It came to the same conclusions that the labour 
board came to.  It was strictly on jurisdiction.  The Federal 
Court of Appeal ruled that the Canada Labour Relations Board does 
not have the jurisdiction to overrule a section in the Canada 
Post Corporation Act.  That is something that only parliament can 
do and that is the reason we are here today, at the request of 
the many rural route mail couriers who feel strongly about this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are they?  There are roughly 5,000 rural route mail 
couriers.  They are the people who deliver mail anywhere other 
than in an urban setting.  They drive over the country roads 
delivering mail to farms, homes and businesses all over rural 
Canada.  They get their work by tendering and contracting the 
work.  The contract is given to them and they keep it for a 
period of five years.  They then have to renew it after that 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is that if they are truly independent contractors 
there are a number of tests that they go through and look at to 
say what the difference is between an independent contractor and 
a dependent contractor or an employee.  I would like to go 
through some of the things that the Canada Labour Relations Board 
looked at in making its ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the concept of economic independence is one of the key 
issues.  Are they being directed and controlled by someone else, 
or do they truly have control of their own job and workplace?  In 
this case, the Canada Labour Relations Board found that they were 
economically dependent and not independent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the control over the day to day operations of their 
job, the Canada Post Corporation still dictates exactly how these 
workers must do their job, how they have to sort the mail, what 
route they have to take and when they have to drive it.  It 
dictates virtually every aspect of the person's working day.  If 
they were truly independent contractors they could make up their 
own mind as to how and when they would get the job done, as long 
as the job did get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Federal Court of Appeal reversed the decision, it left 
the rural route mail couriers with no option but to seek recourse 
in the House of Commons today.  I am very proud to take the issue 
forward as a private member's bill.  I believe, as I began in my 
comments, this is a historic injustice and it is fundamentally 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only group of workers in the country who are 
specifically barred from collective bargaining strictly for 
financial reasons.  There are other groups that are not allowed 
to form a union.  CSIS is not allowed to form a union for obvious 
reasons of national security.  Even the Parliament Hill staff are 
not allowed to form a union, although I disagree with that.  At 
least we could make some argument that there are reasons why we 
would not want some issues showing up on the bargaining table. In 
the case of rural route mail couriers, they are really delivering 
mail.  It is not an issue of any kind of risk to our national 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not allowing the rural route mail couriers to have collective 
bargaining rights is a denial of their basic rights, the rights 
that all working Canadians enjoy. I firmly believe it is a 
violation of the principles conveyed and promoted in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  It is certainly a violation of 
our international commitments to the ILO convention regarding the 
freedom of association and the protection of the right to 
organize.  It is in violation of the international covenant on 
civil and political rights.  It is a violation of the 
international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights. 
These are all international covenants that Canada willingly 
enters into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to the ILO with the Minister of Labour and have 
heard wonderful, grand, eloquent speeches that the Minister of 
Labour has given at the ILO, saying that this country supports 
the right to free collective bargaining so that workers can 
elevate their standards of wages and working conditions.  I 
believe him.  I do not accuse the Liberal government of being 
anti-union in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at an anomaly in subsection 13(5).  When subsection 
13(5) was put in, it was just at the time when the Canada Post 
Corporation Act was created in 1981.  It was a time when the 
Canada Post Corporation was showing a huge deficit.  There was a 
real money crunch.  The lawyers involved obviously realized that 
when the employees went from being under the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act to being under the Canada Labour Code when the 
corporation was created and that the Canada Labour Code 
recognizes dependent contractors as employees, that they would 
have a problem with the rural route mail couriers. So they 
deliberately and specifically contemplated this with subsection 
13(5).  So that no application to have these workers considered 
employees could succeed, they would be specifically barred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was strictly financial.  I have quotes from Andre Ouellet, 
the postmaster general at the time, admitting the same.  He said 
that it would be cost factor if these employees were allowed to 
bargain collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tendering process, if it ever did serve the couriers well, 
certainly does not serve them well now.  Never before have they 
needed to have the right to elevate their conditions somewhat. I 
will give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example that I am aware of concerns a courier named Mavis 
Wiebe who has been a rural route mail courier just outside of 
Surrey, B.C. since 1978.  It is Rural Route Number 8 in 
Cloverdale.  When she started she had 326 calls to make and she 
was paid $1,000 a month to do her 26 kilometre route.  Some 21 
years later, Mavis Wiebe's route is now 1,000 points of call and 
she is now paid $1,900 per month.  Out of this, she has to pay 
for her car, gas, repairs and insurance. 
She gets no benefits whatsoever, like a normal employee does. 
There is no UIC, no CPP and no workers' compensation.  She has no 
sick days.  If she gets sick she has to hire somebody to take her 
place. Ironically, the minister responsible for Canada Post uses 
this as an example of why these people really are independent 
entrepreneurs.  He says that they hire people.  Well they only 
hire people if they are sick and they have an obligation and a 
duty to do their route. It is a fact that they do not have sick 
days.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mavis Wiebe puts her operating costs at $1,000 a month, leaving 
her with $900 a month for days that can go as long as 12 to 14 
hours during the busy season.  She takes home an average of $6.84 
an hour.  If I was an independent contractor, I would not 
structure my lifestyle to make $6.84 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has an interesting quote.  She says “My granddaughter at 14 
just started working at McDonald's and she earns $7.15 an hour, 
the minimum wage in B.C.  She said to me, `Nana are you nuts? I 
make more than you do”'.  There is clearly something 
fundamentally wrong here when a woman who has been doing this job 
faithfully for 21 years finds herself in a position where she is 
making less than minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on in the article, many of the rural route couriers talk 
about the tendering process and how it has been bastardized. It 
is not a fair tendering system.  When it is time to renew their 
contract they are often told that there is a lot of competition 
and that they had better bring their numbers down or they will 
not likely get their contract. That is interfering with the fair 
tendering process, yet there is case after case of this 
happening.  Rather than having their salaries go up with the cost 
of living, they are actually being manoeuvred down and are 
getting less money now in many cases than they did from previous 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very aware of the whole concept of independent contractors. 
I worked in the building industry where this has been a problem 
for quite some time.  Contractors, who used to keep maybe 20 
drywallers on their staff, would say to them “I am paying you 
guys $20 an hour.  I will give you $25 an hour and you just be 
your own man.  You are your own independent contractor now.  You 
still have to be at work at 8 and go home at 4.30.  You still 
have to take your lunch at noon. I am still going to provide 
everything else to do your job but for the purposes of the law, I 
am going to call you an independent contractor”.   We could go 
into a place with 20 drywallers working in a big area and each 
one of them would consider themselves to be independent business. 
They have no workers' compensation, no UIC and no CPP.   It is 
really trying to avoid payroll burden and payroll costs.  It is a 
net gain to the employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the game that the Canada Post Corporation has been 
playing since 1981.  I think it is wrong.  It is wrong in the 
building industry and it is wrong in the mail delivery business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supervision aspect alone is enough to win the argument in 
terms of whether these individuals are dependent or independent, 
but we do not have to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all members who plan on speaking to the bill or 
even when they get the opportunity to vote, to please read the 
labour board ruling, decision 626 from April 29, 1987.  It is a 
very easy document to read.  Canada Post Corporation is the 
applicant and various unions are the respondents.  It is a very 
clear-cut decision.  This is actually an area of labour law that 
has been very well studied. There is a lot of good jurisprudence 
that very clearly sets out the tests as to whether someone is 
independent or dependent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of the 5,000 rural route mail couriers in Canada, I 
would urge all members to please have a good look at these 
rulings and see for themselves if it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that this is really a rural-urban issue. 
These people are being disadvantaged because they live in rural 
Canada.  A disproportionate number of them are women.  Some of 
them are working off the farm trying to get some supplementary 
income for their family.  The going rate for a mail delivery 
person living within the city limits of Winnipeg or Toronto is 
$17 or $18 an hour, plus benefits.  Because these rural route 
couriers live outside the perimeter highway they are at $6.86, 
lower than minimum wage with absolutely no benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we defend that in this day and age?  There is no 
justification whatsoever, certainly not for financial reasons. If 
we were going to conduct ourselves in that manner then why would 
we not put kids back in the mines?  They would be cheaper than 
putting miners down there. 
We have to pay miners $25 an hour.  Maybe we could get some 12 
year old to crawl through the cracks with a fuse between his 
teeth like they did in the old days.  That is obviously taking 
examples to a ridiculous end.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is not justification for denying people basic civil 
rights.  Organizing a union or bargaining collectively is a basic 
right in this country.  It is the only way we have managed to 
elevate our standards for working people over the last many 
years.  Everyone agrees, our government agrees and states 
publicly that it is in favour of free collective bargaining. 
Here is the opportunity.  This is our chance to demonstrate that 
we really do care about the freedom of workers to join and to 
form unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reservations I have and the only reason I can give as 
to why this matter was not resolved years ago is the terrible 
hostility between the government and the union representing 
postal workers.  We should not let this group of workers suffer 
just because of management's inability to get along with its own 
workforce.  That is clearly a poisonous environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in my bill would automatically tie the rural route mail 
couriers to the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.  Who is to say 
they will join that union?  Who is to say they will join a union 
at all?  They would just have the right to bargain collectively 
and they would have recourse to the Canada Labour Code like all 
other Canadian workers enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has gained broad public interest and broad public 
support.  There was a one hour special on one of the TV news 
magazine programs.  There have been numerous articles in 
newspapers and magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of rural route couriers has been very active 
politically.  I would think that virtually everybody in this 
House has received some communication from the RRMCs trying to 
explain the basic fairness of their issue.  It has been a long 
lobbying effort, 10 years long.  These people have waited long 
enough to exercise the same rights that all other working people 
enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that there is broad support from other members in 
the House.  I have canvassed most of the opposition parties and 
they seem interested in extending this kind of right.  There is 
nothing more noble that we can do as parliamentarians than to 
extend rights and to expand the rights of Canadians so that we 
all enjoy and benefit equally from the protections in this case 
of the Canada Labour Code for employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I get into my prepared notes, I would like to do as the 
member opposite suggested and share with the House a few court 
decisions on this very subject. The courts have already ruled on 
the compliance of section 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act 
with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 3, 1989 the federal court trial division found section 
13(5) did not contravene the equality provisions of section 15.1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis of 
occupational status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 29, 1990 the federal court trial division found the 
allegation that section 13(5) creates discrimination on the basis 
of gender was frivolous.  The court also found there were no 
grounds for a claim of discrimination on the basis of 
differential treatment of rural and urban residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 1, 1999 the U.S. National Administration Office, 
responding to a NAFTA challenge issued by the Canadian Union of 
Postal Workers on behalf of rural route contractors, rejected a 
claim that rural route contractors should become employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both national and international tribunals have found no fault 
with the independent status of rural route contractors under the 
Canada Post Corporation Act. The member for Winnipeg Centre 
should take note of these judgments to fully comprehend the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981 parliament created Canada Post to ensure that all 
Canadians, wherever they lived, would receive reliable and 
affordable postal service. In several ways the enduring 
contribution of independent contractors has helped Canada Post 
achieve this crucial goal. However, the bill we have before us 
today could easily compromise the provision of good and 
affordable postal service to rural Canada.  Affordable is the key 
word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post's ability to use contractors for the delivery of 
mail has made reliable, affordable postal service possible. 
Nowhere is this more true than in rural Canada. 
With a sparse population spread over one of the largest countries 
in the world, providing a postal service to all Canadians has 
always been quite a challenge.  It is thanks to the ingenuity, 
persistence and resourcefulness of independent mail contractors 
that the many obstacles to providing universal postal service in 
Canada have been overcome.  We still need their dedicated service 
if we are to maintain the quality of service rural Canadians 
deserve.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider what the proposed amendment of the member 
for Winnipeg Centre does for Canadians.  Does it improve service? 
Not at all.  Will rural Canadians get their mail any faster as a 
result of this change?  No they will not.  Independent 
contractors have always provided excellent service to Canada Post 
customers and they will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's reference to hostility also catches me a little by 
surprise. Both the minister and I have met with representatives 
of the rural contractors on four occasions in the last year.  The 
discussions have been very amicable and are producing very good 
results.  Canada Post unions may benefit however from a few 
thousand more members who would pay dues but there is no benefit 
to individual Canadians in the hon. member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes in creating opportunities for all 
Canadians as does Canada Post.  The opportunity to work as a mail 
contractor has benefited countless generations of rural Canadians 
who have often needed to supplement their incomes.  The member 
for Winnipeg Centre wants to put an end to all that. I do not 
think rural Canadians want to see these contracting opportunities 
simply vanish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a competitive tendering process that gives rural 
Canadians the opportunity to perform meaningful work at a fair 
value.  In parts of the country with no nearby industrial or 
urban area, the chance to have a turn at a decent paying job 
means a great deal.  That chance vanishes once a system is 
created that only benefits a few to the detriment of many.  I 
find it surprising the hon. member supports a proposal that may 
well translate into real losses for those Canadians who most 
deserve and need those income opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of service rural Canadians have enjoyed for 
generations and continue to expect is a direct outcome of the 
competitive bidding process which attracts the most motivated and 
enterprising people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre wants everyone to believe that 
rural route contractors are all overworked, underpaid and 
underappreciated.  Simple facts reveal the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dedicated men and women who deliver mail throughout rural 
Canada are all compensated at a fair market value.  The majority 
of contractors often need less than six or even four hours to 
complete their route assignments leaving ample time for other 
gainful pursuits.  This work is mostly part time and that fact is 
consistently ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, rural mail contractors in Canada Post are 
appreciated and recognized for the immense value of the service 
they provide.  In wanting to preserve that tradition of good 
service, Canada Post is introducing meaningful ways to improve 
the fair and equitable treatment of all contractors.  All rural 
routes will be contracted on an individual basis.  Previous 
experience coupled with good performance will be regularly 
considered upon renewal.  This will promote the sustained quality 
of service for rural customers while rewarding the hard work of 
dedicated mail contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post will rigorously ensure that the tendering process is 
accepted as fair and competitive by all participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is not the best way to improve Canada Post's 
relationship with its independent mail contractors.  The 
previously cited examples of Canada Post's efforts demonstrate 
that immediate improvement is achievable.  Moreover, these 
changes represent a genuine effort to make co-operation a 
keystone of the relationship between Canada Post and its mail 
contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada Post Corporation was created in 1981 through a 
widely supported act of parliament, it was made clear that Canada 
Post was to operate like a business.  To this day the corporation 
continues to have the important public mandate of providing 
postal service to millions of addresses while keeping letter mail 
rate increases below the rate of inflation.  To achieve this 
mandate, it was and continues to be understood that Canada Post 
needs to manage its expenses just like a business does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financially responsible management of Canada Post has meant 
taxpayers have not had to subsidize their post office since 1988. 
By recording modest profits over recent years, Canada Post has 
been able to balance the financing of its operations with the 
need to invest in the future but it is still a precarious 
balance.  The fact is that 99 cents of every dollar Canada Post 
earns must be spent on the annual cost of operations.  With this 
little room to explore its new direction such as that proposed by 
this bill, the arguments for the prudent management of costs ring 
as true today as they did in 1981. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate cannot ignore the mandate imposed on Canada Post by 
the Canada Post Corporation Act.  No other delivery company is 
legally required to offer affordable uniform service in every 
corner of the nation while maintaining financial 
self-sufficiency.  Canada Post has been able to meet this 
challenge.  The hon. member wants to tinker with the act but he 
is not prepared to acknowledge the consequences of his tinkering.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Contractors are naturally independent.  They are entrepreneurs 
and as such, assume a degree of risk in deciding whether or not 
to engage in a certain commercial activity.  Although they depend 
on contracts to earn revenue, they realize that the source of the 
revenue is not indefinitely fixed and they certainly have the 
freedom to seek revenue from other sources.  As small business 
operators they can make full use of tax advantages not available 
to employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To look further at the importance of the independence of rural 
mail contractors, I am reminded of the explanation offered by one 
of my hon. colleagues opposite.  It may have been the hon. member 
for Tobique—Mactaquac.  If so, he is to be congratulated.  If I 
recall, his words were: “The nature of this change would remove 
some of the flexibility for both parties to negotiate an 
arrangement particularly suited to each individual contractor”. 
An astute observation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every mail contractor faces many challenges in providing 
effective mail delivery within his or her territory.  Therefore, 
each contract must recognize these unique and varying factors. 
Imagine the burden of negotiating a global agreement that 
effectively addressed the regional complexities of all the 
delivery routes.  The cost of administering such a process would 
be considerably higher than those of a competitive bidding 
process that takes into account the needs of individual 
contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debate the status of mail contractors, we are not only 
talking about the men and women who deliver mail along Canada's 
rural routes.  Canada Post mail contractors provide air freight 
services, expedited parcel services, highway transport and many 
other services that are essential to moving the mail in Canada. 
All of these contractors fall within the scope of section 13(5). 
Alarmingly the sponsor of this bill seems to have missed or 
ignored the fact that eliminating section 13(5) has far greater 
implications than changing the status of rural route contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post has over 7,000 contracts for the delivery of mail. 
It simply cannot afford to take on thousands of new permanent 
employees as part of some union membership drive.  The numbers 
speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post has achieved a measure of financial health which is 
utterly dependent on a very prudent cost management formula. 
Identically, the formula for Canada Post's long term viability 
contained in the recently announced financial framework of the 
corporation depends on sound financial management.  We must stay 
the course if Canada Post is to continue giving Canadians the 
service they expect at a price they can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post must preserve a tradition of service that has 
benefited rural Canadians for so long.  At the same time it must 
ensure that good affordable service to all Canadians remains a 
priority.  To accomplish this, competing interests must be 
balanced and the Canada Post Corporation Act does that very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not interfere with the success of Canada Post.  It has 
had a fulfilling, challenging career.  It is doing a very 
effective job and I think we should leave sleeping dogs lie.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased that the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre has brought this 
issue to a debate.  It is good because it has focused on certain 
things that ought to have been focused on for quite some time. 
It is not a new idea.  It has been around for a long time. The 
bill does focus our attention on an issue that is rather 
significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the contracting procedure that is engaged in 
by Canada Post.  The hon. parliamentary secretary gave a rather 
well reasoned speech this afternoon but avoided some of the 
problems that exist within the contracting procedure itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have before me an affidavit sworn before a notary public in 
Alberta. I want to read part of it.  It deals with the very issue 
I am talking about, the contracting procedure.  It reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of 1996, I knew my contract with Canada Post Corporation 
would be expiring on June 30th.  As I had done in the past, I 
decided to phone Contracting Services in Edmonton to see what 
they were going to do.  I was hoping, as they had done in the 
past, just extend or renew it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to Lee Alexander.  He asked me how long have I had 
the contract.  I told him ten years.  He then said they would 
have to tender out this route as a matter of course to show the 
public that I did not own it permanently.  He told me to bid the 
exact amount I was being paid at the time and I would get it back 
for another five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the tendering process was closed, I received a phone call 
from Lee Alexander.  He said there were bids received lower than 
the one I submitted and would I drop my price to get the contract 
back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him how much was the lowest bid.  He said they don't 
release that information.  He again asked if I would go down or 
lose the contract.  I said I could if I had to, but by how much 
would I have to down?  Five hundred dollars?  He said no, go down 
much more.  I kept dropping and dropping until he finally said 
“okay, that's enough”.  I ended up taking a cut of $5,077.08 
per annum to keep my job.

happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RRMCs is a reliable, resourceful, friendly and independent 
group of people.  I admire these couriers.  Our mail is delivered 
by a rural route mail courier, a wonderful person.  They love 
freedom.  They love enterprise.  This lady loves to be 
independent and I agree.  I am an entrepreneur and enjoy that 
freedom and independence.  I believe they have been treated 
shabbily.  In some cases I dare say the treatment has been 
disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question now before us is:  Will eliminating subsection

to the problem?  Can the problem be resolved?  Of course it can. 
I clearly understand the frustration and the anger of the RRMCs. 
No one should be treated as some of them have been treated.  I am 
not suggesting they have all been treated this way.  I do not 
know, but I know that some of them have been treated very badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contracts were awarded and then negotiated after they were 
awarded.  Mr. Speaker, you have been a businessman for many 
years.  Many of us have been in business.  We do not negotiate 
contracts after they are awarded.  We negotiate them before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process was secret.  In this case the particular mail 
courier was told there was another bid.  He was not told how much 
that bid was or whether there really was a bid.  He does not know 
to this day whether there really was a bid or how much it was. He 
was simply told to drop his price.  When it was not enough he was 
told to drop it a little more.  It was not an isolated case. I 
have only the one affidavit, but a number of them have told me 
that this is the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressure was exerted to lower the bid.  Conditions, or whatever 
else the supervisor wanted, became negotiable items after the 
contract was signed.  Some couriers were coerced into submitting 
a tender they felt was unreasonable, but due to personal 
conditions or requirements they went along with it.  In some 
cases whole lifestyles had to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The playing field was unfair, capricious, unstable and often 
unreasonable.  A question has to be asked in this regard.  If it 
was so bad why did they stay?  I think one of the reasons was 
that for them it was a lifestyle, something the family was used 
to, a second income or a variety of indications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not whether it is a second income or whether it is 
subsidiary to something else.  The question is whether the 
contract is fair, honest and above board, and does everyone know 
what are the conditions.  That is the principal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They stayed because it gave them flexibility.  They did not have 
to punch a clock.  They did not have to do things exactly the way 
someone else told them to.  They could exercise their own 
initiatives and resourcefulness in applying their own 
innovations.  Many of them, I suggest all of them, liked their 
neighbours and the social contact as they went from delivery post 
to delivery post.  They were proud and they still are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say with pride that the mail must go through no matter what 
the weather or road conditions.  They are proud to live by that. 
To overcome these problems is a challenge to them and they like 
that.  I commend them for it and have great respect for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repealing subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act 
would eliminate the quality of independence of the entrepreneur. 
They would become employees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would take away the flexibility these people enjoy today both 
on the RRMC side and on the Canada Post side.  Clearly it would 
do away with that.  It would do away with a way of life.  It 
would become a job.  It would take away their sense of personal 
freedom, flexibility and opportunity to exercise their 
initiative, their innovativeness and their resourcefulness.  It 
would make them employees, not contractors or entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be proposed as an alternative to eliminating section 
13(5)?  Clearly it is better to do something else than to 
eliminate that clause.  The hon. parliamentary secretary said 
that removing that clause would apply to a lot more than just the 
RRMCs.  It would apply to a whole host of other contractors doing 
business with Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to happen is that the contracting procedure must be 
changed.  It has to become fair, open and transparent.  Everybody 
should understand before they bid what they are bidding on.  The 
bidding should be open and then on the day the contracts are to 
be awarded or opened everybody would know exactly what bids are 
on the table and what the conditions are.  Then they could move 
ahead.  All coercion must be removed. There should be absolutely 
no way in which the bidding procedure could be interfered with by 
some kind of a supervisor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some indication there is a movement in that direction. 
I have a letter from the hon. André Ouellet, chairman of Canada 
Post, in which he indicates clearly some of the things that have 
been done.  It does not go far enough.  He is moving in some 
directions but not nearly adequately in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless Canada Post changes and implements a whole new 
contracting procedure and gets a contract that is fair, open and 
similar for couriers in a particular region, it will invite 
continued pressure by the RRMCs to do the kind of thing the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre has presented to us.  I do not believe 
it is the best solution, but I fear that unless Canada Post has a 
better relationship with its rural route mail couriers and gets 
into a contracting procedure that is fair and honest, it will 
simply invite more of this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be a movement toward solving some of the 
contractual process problems.  Let us not do this now and slam 
the door shut before they have a chance to improve their 
relations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to this bill, which I am interested in because I am my 
party's postal service and public works critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very closely to the remarks of the member who 
introduced this private bill.  I also listened with great 
interest to the remarks of the government member on the Standing 
Committee on Public Works and Government Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side of the House are naturally in favour 
of any government initiative. 
I recall that, not that long ago—in the spring, I think, or last 
fall—our committee considered the renegotiation of the contracts 
for the small postal outlets that have sprung up everywhere, in 
drug stores, shopping centres or other small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada Post Corporation launched this idea, it was hoping 
to reduce its operating costs, generate additional profits and 
provide work for the operators of postal outlets, but at the 
lowest possible cost, so as to generate additional profits, 
because otherwise Canada Post Corporation would have run these 
postal outlets itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for Canada Post Corporation, and fortunately for 
the operators of these small postal outlets, the profits 
generated were higher than those initially estimated by the 
corporation.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the contracts came to an end, the Canada Post Corporation 
negotiated mercilessly with people, putting a gun to their heads 
and saying “Take it or leave it.  Sign here.” and their 
commissions were cut.  This is the cavalier behaviour of the 
Canada Post Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are no different with rural mail delivery.  As the member 
said, a person buys a small car or truck to deliver mail in the 
area.  They collect their mail in the morning at the central 
post office; if the person sorting the mail is sick and could 
not sort the mail the day before, the independent mail delivery 
person will do it. 
In winter snow storms, this is the person who takes out his 
shovel and clears the snow in order to get to people's 
mailboxes.  It is wrong, as the party in power is claiming, to 
say that these people are independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to hide all the time behind legalistic reasoning like that 
cited by the representative of the party in power is sad and 
unfortunate, I find.  These people are working for less than the 
minimum wage in their respective regions, it is a fact.  This is 
abusing people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the charter of rights and freedoms so often cited here 
in Canada establishes the freedom of association.  Freedom of 
association is the rule.  There must be as few exclusions and 
exceptions to the rule as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But every time the government is involved directly, through a 
crown corporation or in any way in confrontation with groups 
that may make a claim, such as the RCMP or the letter carriers 
at the moment, the people delivering rural mail, it wastes no 
time breaking the rule of freedom of association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It thumbs its nose at its own charter in prohibiting collective 
bargaining just so that the Canada Post Corporation can pay it 
another $200 million annually in net benefits that it gives back 
to the government, which claims the corporation owes it money 
from back when it was not breaking even. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did invest money. Now it wants to recover that 
money but, true to its ways, the government will not take it off 
the earnings of its senior officials, or that of CPC chairman 
André Ouellet or his directors and deputy directors, but from 
those as the lower end of the pay scale, who walk in the snow to 
deliver parcels and letters to mailboxes. The government is 
making them pay for the mismanagement that occurred in previous 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot accept that. It is one thing to be partisan, to do 
one's utmost to support one's party—and the member opposite is 
doing a good job at that—but one must still have some moral 
principles. 
Regardless of our political allegiance, when people are forced 
to slave away for less than minimum wage, partisanship is no 
longer acceptable. This issue has to do with dignity, and we 
must allow these people to preserve their dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was floored to hear the Reform Party member, whom I respect, 
say “We will break the contractual relationship that exists 
between Canada Post and contract employees'.? That relationship 
was prescribed by the act. They did not choose it, they did not 
want it. It was imposed on them by the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, those who deliver our mail are asking us to help them. I 
think we have a duty to do so. It would be too simple, as a 
governing party or a political party, to stay away from 
society's problems, to not face these problems, to hide behind 
the rulings of the Federal Court of Appeal or of any other 
court.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government is missing a prime opportunity to give 
some dignity back to these contractors who no longer want to 
remain independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken part in such negotiations. Someone will buy a small 
vehicle in order to get a contract. When the contract is about 
to expire, the local or regional postmaster says “You know, you 
have some competition. A few people have called us this year”. 
That person is still making payments on the vehicle and the 
contract is coming to an end. If that person does not get the 
next contract, he or she may get stuck with the truck or car 
still being paid for. So that person is told to make a 
reasonable bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year after year, contract after contract, this poor person has 
to submit lower and lower bids. Such behaviour is unworthy of a 
representative of the Canada Post Corporation, which claims to 
be so honest and great. Wanting to make a profit on the backs of 
poor workers is despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I will wholeheartedly support, as my party will, the 
bill introduced by the hon. member. I urge the members opposite 
to show some mercy, to rise above party politics and to try to 
imagine what it is like to work hard and still have trouble 
earning a living. Not everyone earns as much as federal 
ministers do and gets to travel anywhere in the world whenever 
he or she feels like it. There are people who are hurting in 
their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party suggests that the existing contracts be 
cancelled. This is total nonsense. 
I remember that the members of the Reform Party opposed a 
measure limiting to three months of interest the penalty imposed 
by the lender when someone wants to renegotiate or pay off his 
or her mortgage before it was up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They opposed it as though all Western farmers who owed money on 
machinery, land or farms were so rich that they did not care 
about paying the big penalties imposed on them when they wanted 
to renegotiate or pay off mortgages or loans before they were 
up. Only the Reform Party could oppose such a measure. As if all 
Western farmers were millionaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they turn around and describe the hardship suffered by 
Western farmers, saying how sad it is when grain prices drop. 
However, when the time came to help the farmers through modest 
private members' bills like that one, Reform was always the 
first to oppose them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member who introduced the bill that he can 
count on my support and on the support of my party. I hope that, 
at some point, the people across will see the light and 
understand that they cannot act as if their party were the only 
one on the face of the earth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-238, 
which involves private mail contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved with this issue almost from the day I was 
elected two and a half years ago.  I have met with and discussed 
this issue with representatives of the Canadian Union of Postal 
Workers, the Organization of Rural Route Mail Couriers and Canada 
Post Corporation itself. In addition, as a beneficiary of daily 
rural mail delivery, this is an issue that concerns me 
personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post became a crown corporation in 1981 by means of the 
Canada Post Corporation Act, and as such, its labour practices 
were no longer governed by the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
but by the Canada Labour Code which allows dependent contractors 
to unionize, something not provided for by the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act provides an 
exemption to subsection 3(1) of the Canada Labour Code that deems 
mail contractors, including rural route mail couriers, not to be 
dependent contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1981, under the guidance of the former postmaster, and at 
that time Progressive Conservative postal critic John Fraser, our 
caucus voted to support subsection 13(5) for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this provision continued the historical relationship that 
Canada Post has always had with its mail contractors. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1420"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1420
<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was felt that changing that relationship could 
potentially increase the operating costs of the corporation 
substantially with no corresponding improvement in service levels 
to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the nature of this change would have removed some of the 
flexibility for both parties to negotiate an arrangement 
particularly suited for each individual contractor. For example, 
under the current arrangement, contractors have the ability to 
subcontract while employees do not. 
Finally, this arrangement kept Canada Post on a level footing 
with many private sector companies who also use private 
contractors for their own deliveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, our party continues to support subsection 
13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act, and that is why we 
cannot support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean, however, that we are indifferent to the 
problems faced by private mail contractors in their dealings with 
Canada Post.  In many conversations I have had with individual 
contractors, with representatives from the Organization of Rural 
Route Mail Couriers, CUPW and with some Canada Post employees, I 
have heard many horror stories about the contracting practices of 
the post office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, at one point it was common practice that when a 
delivery contract was up for renewal, a Canada Post employee 
would phone up the contractor and tell them that they had 
received a bid from another source that was thousands of dollars 
less than what the contractor was currently being paid. Because 
Canada Post operates a closed bidding system, there was no way 
for the contractor to verify the claim of the postal 
representative.  The contractor would then be faced with a 
difficult decision: undercut his or her own price by several 
thousand dollars or else lose the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and other bad faith practices by the post office have led 
others and myself into discussions with Canada Post.  As a result 
of complaints from contractors and others acting on their behalf, 
the post office has introduced a series of new measures that I 
hope will alleviate a great number of the difficulties 
contractors have had in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These include the following:  one, rural routes will be 
contracted on an individual contractor basis; two, contractors 
who in turn subcontract out their routes at a reduced price, 
known as master contractors, will no longer be eligible to renew 
their rural contract; three, if a master contractor previously 
held the route, the previous employee or the subcontractor 
actually performing the work will be the first potential supplier 
offered the contract at renewal; four, rural contracts will be 
issued for five years with a five year renewal option based on 
satisfactory performance and tendered after ten years; five, a 
negotiated adjustment will be included for the five year renewal 
option to ensure that market conditions, such as inflation, are 
considered; six, a quality and performance component will be 
included in the contract renewal and awarding processes to 
recognize the past performance of incumbent contractors; and 
seven, the evaluation of tenders will be based on criteria such 
as experience, service performance, reliability, image and cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, when contracts are up for bids, Canada Post will 
make contractors aware of the specifications of the routes they 
will be performing, such as the number of points of call, daily 
kilometres, number of stops for personal contact items and the 
amount of ad-mail they can expect to deliver.  These numbers will 
be updated annually or more frequently if a significant change 
occurs and contractors will be compensated for these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The post office has also prepared a handbook or what it calls a 
delivery reference manual for its mail contractors.  The purpose 
of the manual is to provide assistance and guidance with a 
reference book and a phone directory of key individuals at Canada 
Post whom they can call when a problem arises. In conjunction 
with this, local supervisors and postmasters will be provided 
with an operator's handbook and support training material to 
assist them in working with contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures probably will not prevent disputes from arising. 
They probably will not ensure that all contractors will be 
treated fairly and honestly by Canada Post employees at all 
times.  However, I feel that the changes announced will bring 
much greater fairness and openness to the relationship between 
rural mail contractors and the post office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to work with and listen to rural mail contractors to 
ensure that they are treated fairly and that Canada Post deals 
with problems that arise in a timely and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a person who has been in the contracting business for over 
22 years. I have bid on a lot of contracts for the federal 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1425"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1425

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On every contract on which I bid it never meant that I became an 
employee of the government.  I was on my own.  I was the employer 
and the people I hired to help me perform that contract were my 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the intent of the rural mail couriers, but when 
they are under contract they are not employees.  They cannot 
benefit from sick leave, vacations, and all that they would 
encounter.  If they want to become full time employees of Canada 
Post, they should apply for a job when a job opens up. Until that 
job becomes available, they are contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bid comes up, it is up to them to decide if they want to 
bid on the contract or not.  If they are going to bid on a 
contract to lose money, that is their own problem.  As a 
contractor myself, I never bid on a contract to lose money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sympathize with the rural mail couriers, but they have to 
understand that they are contractors and not employees of Canada 
Post.  When it comes to the rural routes, if all those people 
became employees of Canada Post, imagine how much it would cost 
Canada Post Corporation.  We would not be getting better service. 
For all the money it would cost Canada Post, we would be getting 
the same service, not better service.  This is the taxpayers' 
money so let us put the money in a good place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the rural mail couriers will understand that when we 
were in power we were the ones who put in section 13(5) to 
protect them and Canada Post employees at the same time.  As I 
told many people in the mailing industry and even Canada Post 
itself, I will continue to support section 13(5). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is a good private member's bill and I have 
the greatest respect for the hon. member from the NDP, but I just 
cannot support this private member's bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, very simply, in the time that is left, while I applaud 
the initiative of the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre, his bill 
certainly does not work as intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to eliminate section 13(5) in order to put the 
independent mail contractors in the union.  However, the 
essential words of that clause are “a mail contractor is deemed 
not to be a dependent contractor or an employee”. We can 
substitute “mail contractor” for “independent contractor is 
deemed not to be a dependent contractor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we eliminate this section, it will not change anything. It is 
one of these sections that get into legislation every now and 
then for political reasons.  In fact, Canada Post, whether or not 
that section exists, will retain the right to hire independent 
contractors as it does now and as it will in the future.  While I 
applaud the hon. member's good intentions, I assure him that his 
bill will not achieve what he is setting out to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say, however, that I am a great supporter of private 
members' business and I am very glad that the hon. member brought 
this bill forward.  As the member for Kelowna said, there is no 
doubt there are grave injustices being done in the way contracts 
are being negotiated with our rural mail carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem is not a matter of whether they are in or out 
of a union.  The real problem is with Canada Post itself.  It is 
a body that is neither fish nor fowl.  It is not a business, yet 
it is an arm of government.  If it conducted itself as a 
business, indeed if we privatized Canada Post, it would have to 
conduct good business practices in a spirit of transparency that 
does not exist now.  We cannot see how Canada Post operates.  We 
would find that it would have to bend to good market practices 
and I would expect that it would negotiate contracts with these 
rural mail carriers in a decent and orderly manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of private members' business has now 
expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the order paper.
