      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the bill would designate a date in October four years away as the date of the next election but , within our parliamentary system, a government can fall on matters of confidence, particularly financial issues, and this would invalidate the so-called fixed election date for that particular Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bill C-16</A> is, however, a significant change to our electoral system and one that is long overdue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently in the midst of our second minority Parliament. While many will argue that minority governments tend to be more accountable to voters due to their vulnerability, there is clearly a significant element of political instability that exists during these mandates. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is important to note that in our parliamentary system, in its current manifestation, this uncertainty is always present to some degree, regardless of whether it is a minority or a majority government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sitting prime minister has significant powers of persuasion over members of the government and Parliament itself, not least of which is the ability to ask the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and call a general election. This certainly affords the prime minister considerable leverage but, in many respects, removes from elected members of Parliament the freedom that is in the best interests of voters, their country and our democratic system of government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In establishing fixed election dates, the ability of the prime minister to call an election at will would be severely curtailed, at least in principle. Outside of the defeat of the government on a treasury bill, it would have to be a very sound matter of confidence that would see a government risk the political implications of ending a mandate prior to the fixed election date.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56129"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary tradition of an election call following the defeat of a government treasury bill would remain in place but this would be the only practical condition beyond reproach that would warrant a premature dissolution of Parliament. On matters of policy outside the realm of fiscal issues, it would be more likely than at present for a Parliament to continue, even if a government measure were to be defeated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of designating bills as confidence matters is quite simply a means of exerting influence over government members and even opposition parties fearful of a general election It is rarely the case that the integrity or validity of a government actually rests with the passage of these so-called non-treasury confidence matters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I believe members would be better placed to serve their constituents more effectively if they could avoid the constant threat of a general election simply because a matter is deemed to be a confidence issue. In other words, there would be a greater sincerity in trying to make Parliament work without the automatic move to a general election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest this, not only for reasons of political stability but for freer expression by members of Parliament and to facilitate more effective representation. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010">(1010)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para56133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all realize that general elections are extremely expensive and it is particularly dismaying and wasteful that they can occur without a truly justifiable reason. How many of us, along with our fellow Canadians, abhor the traditional spending spree that has accompanied the period just before a government decides that the time is right for a general election? </div>
    </p><a name="Para56134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether true or not, the point is that public money should not be used to attempt to influence voting practices. These practices are wasteful and not sound public policy. It is difficult for political parties in power to resist the temptation to pursue these strategic spending initiatives all the while denying what is often the obvious reality of a pre-writ period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality of fixed election dates would make it much more difficult in terms of political realities for governments to embark on pre-writ spending sprees. The fact that a specific election date is fast approaching would lay waste to any denials associated with the motivation for these kinds of announcements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in implementing fixed election dates we would be effectively ending the practice of allowing parties in power, or even opposition parties in a minority Parliament, to simply choose the best time politically for their members to face the electorate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often the timing that best suits a political party may not be the most conducive for voters. The last general election was a campaign that took place over the holiday season with an election day in the midst of the coldest month of the year. Although this election was one that resulted from the defeat of the government on a treasury issue, the timing was certainly not popular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, fixed election dates would eliminate the ability of elections being called for reasons of political expediency at times which serve the interests of a political party. Having elections take place in the third week of October recognizes the reality of Canada's climate and the challenges that other times create for both candidates and voters. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October elections are also much more realistic in terms of practical considerations associated with voters' calendars. Most people are back at work and school and few are on vacation. This would be most beneficial in terms of encouraging voter turnout as people are available to exercise their franchise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, fixed election dates would encourage the candidacies of many more Canadians who would otherwise be reticent to seek elected office due to issues like their current employment situations and the realities of family life. Knowing when an election is going to take place removes this uncertainty and would allow for concrete planning to take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of fixed election dates are recognized by most of the traditional developed democracies. In fact, studies indicate that 75% of these countries now operate on fixed election dates. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those who will argue that fixed election dates undermine the traditions of our parliamentary system. I would suggest that our parliamentary system is one that needs to evolve and one that is strong enough to undergo these changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many parliamentary systems are based on the British system as is ours. If we look to the situation in the United Kingdom, there are many changes that have taken place and many that are under consideration. In fact, the devolved Parliaments of Scotland and Wales operate with fixed election dates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that this is the first step on the path of democratic renewal. By allowing for greater political stability, more effective representation and less politically expedient elections, we will be helping to restore the confidence of Canadians in our democratic institutions. Indeed, this is what I would call a significant first step in the process of democratic renewal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of British Columbia has spent considerable time attempting to pursue democratic renewal and in fact led the way recently with its first fixed election date campaign. It is time for the federal government to do so as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is only the beginning of the process of democratic reform. By taking this step, we are signalling to Canadians that we are serious about democratic renewal. I would maintain that this first step is but part of a process that will encourage Canadians to become involved in democratic renewal aimed at restoring public confidence in our political institutions and encouraging greater involvement by voters in the conduct of the federal government.</div>

    </p><a name="Para54808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find this type of behaviour undermines the very essence of what we are trying to accomplish with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A>.

I share my colleague's sentiment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second part of her question on the NDP amendment, I have not seen it but I certainly am interested in looking at it, because we should do anything we can to in fact tighten that prerogative, as it might be called, to call an election on any whim and waste $300 million of taxpayers' money. Canadians should not be having elections every year, as seems to have been the case in the last two minority parliaments. We should do whatever we can to make sure that we are taking good care of taxpayers' money and we should not call an election whenever we deem it should be the case. I am interested in looking at the amendment and welcome the opportunity to do so.</div>

The government said then that it should be narrowed down to only a few issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Speech from the Throne and the budget are the only two areas where votes of confidence should occur. Obviously the Speech from the Throne outlines the program of government and the budget gives government the fiscal tools to implement that Speech from the Throne.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its legislation, the government talks about fixed election dates on the one hand, but on the other hand the government is constantly throwing up straw men by suggesting that the vote on softwood lumber, on Afghanistan or something else could be a vote of confidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member agree with my view that the votes on the Speech from the Throne and the budget should really be the only votes of confidence because they test whether the government in fact has the will of the House on these two critical issues? Or does he believe that there should be others? Again, does the member believe that there should be a very prescribed approach rather than this knee-jerk reaction, which we have often heard from the government now that it is in power, that every time it feels threatened it will call an election because the government is obviously looking for an excuse to go to the people?</div>

If anything, we should try in any way possible to limit those times that the Prime Minister can in fact deem something to be a vote of confidence. It seems, at first glance, that certainly financial issues, in particular the budget, should be a vote of confidence. This has been the tradition of the House. I believe it is the Westminster tradition as well that an election should be called when a government falls due to a vote of confidence or lack of confidence in the House on the budget bill. I think the throne speech is also a major initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that I would hope that by moving forward on this bill the Prime Minister would change his tone in the House in terms of when an election should be called, as well as his behaviour in terms of deeming everything to be a vote of confidence and threatening an election whenever he finds that the polls are going well for him. That is not the way to behave. If we are to be true to the spirit of this legislation, then we should try to make sure we live by it. There should be very specific issues on which a vote of confidence can be called, such as the budget issues, and nothing else beyond that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of special importance to my riding of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar is that October 19, in good years, allows farmers to finish their harvests. Agribusinesses and the people employed in those businesses could become involved in the election process.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third Monday of October allows our youth to get settled in the school year. Students could hold candidate debates so they could actively participate and become aware of the issues. As we all know, youth voter participation is at an all time low, with only an estimated 35% of 21 year olds to 24 year olds voting. The most cited reason for this lack of participation is cynicism of the political process. This cynicism extends further than youth, with manipulation of election dates increasing voter apathy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poll in 2004 by the Environics Research Group found that 81% of people supported having elections at fixed times. The government listened and now we are acting. By removing the politics from calling elections we are restoring trust in Canadian democracy. No longer will election dates be manipulated by politicians behind closed doors. Combined with the federal accountability act, we are responding to the concerns of our youth and all Canadians by doing politics differently.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill makes elections predictable but also makes room for flexibility.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are providing predictability while still working with the traditions of parliamentary democracy. This bill is truly the best of both worlds. It would also allow for provincial governments to plan their elections around federal elections. They could plan to hold them closer or further away from federal elections based on their preferences. One thing is clear, though, and that is that it would make election planning a more rational and easy to follow process. People could plan in advance to get involved in the political process knowing exactly when the next election would be called. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will increase voter turnout by giving more access to our electoral system. Predictable elections will also reduce waste in government machinery and give Canadians value for their money. Elections Canada has to be in a constant state of readiness, which forces it to keep a high level of staffing. This is very costly. In the case of a majority, Elections Canada knows when to expect an election and can plan accordingly. This bill will substantially reduce the cost of holding elections in the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political parties, individual candidates and staff will also be able to plan better. Staff members may be able to join a hockey league knowing that they will not have to leave it midway through to participate in an election. Candidates can plan their election strategies knowing precisely when they will start campaigning. Government departments can plan their agendas more effectively. Instability and uncertainty means that departments have to hold off on projects because they are unsure who will be in power. Committees will be able to plan policy in advance, making it a more focused and efficient system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Predictability has many political rewards for government and allows us to do our jobs better. In the current system, the governing party has an unfair advantage over opposition parties with the ability to call elections when that suits its purpose. We have seen this done in the past by federal and provincial governments and parties of all stripes. Governments can call elections to coincide with upturns in the economy after large capital projects have been completed or if they are doing well in the polls. This is clearly an unfair advantage for the governing party. Levelling the playing field is an important aspect of democratic government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in my riding often come up to me and say that they do not feel the democratic process is working for them any more. Instead, they say, it is working in the interests of those in power and their friends. With this bill, election dates will no longer be set to benefit the ruling party but set to benefit the people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue the process of restoring trust in our democratic institutions by making them independent of internal party politics. Parliament has been developing a non-partisan electoral system for the past 100 years. Electoral boundaries are drawn by independent commissions and elections are administered by Elections Canada. The date of elections, though, continues to be in the hands of politicians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let us finish the process by taking politics out of electoral date setting. Let us restore trust in Canadian democracy.</div>

I like what I hear and it makes a lot of sense, but I have a real concern about fixed dates. I think back to 1988, when municipal and federal elections took place at the same time. At that time, the government fell and elections went on. My concern is that I do not see anything in the bill, and I hope there will be an amendment, so that this would not happen. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My big fear is that at some point the federal government will fall due to non-confidence during a time when there is a municipal election. Municipal elections now are scheduled every four years in Ontario. What would happen then is that in perpetuity, until the next non-confidence vote takes place, we would have elections happening at the same time at the municipal level and the federal level. The same thing can happen at the provincial level, because Ontario now has a fixed date. It all depends on when that non-confidence vote happens. My big concern is that we would have two levels of government having elections at the same time and it would cause a lot of confusion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are trying to do is mix a congressional system, like those in the United States and other countries, with a parliamentary system. I have a concern when we start blending those two things and do not look at the consequences, because we solve one problem but we may cause 500 more. That is my concern. Other than that, I really do not have a problem with fixed date elections. Maybe the member can comment on what we can do to prevent that from happening.</div>

My hon. colleague has spoken about how this works very well in the province of British Columbia. We in Saskatchewan do not have fixed election dates. I think it would be a great benefit for our province. We know when the municipal elections are and we know when they are going to be held. Non-confidence is always something that we cannot work around, but I think this whole bill would start to make a very positive change at the federal level in this country.</div>

I certainly agree with that, except that in the beginning of the bill it states that the Governor General still has discretionary power to dissolve Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of course can go to the Governor General and say that this was a vote of confidence. The bill does not define what is a vote of confidence. Is it only going to be, as I suggest it should be, on the Speech from the Throne and on the budget? </div>
    </p><a name="Para54841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments still have the power to dissolve Parliament based on what they perceive to be a vote of confidence. If the government is really serious about fixed election dates it will define that. Otherwise, by saying that in fact we are going to have a fixed election date four years from now does not prohibit in the interim this government or any government in the future from calling an election based on a perceived vote of confidence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the weakness I see in the bill. Neither the government House leader nor members of the government have been able to address that, which to me is window dressing and not dealing with the real issue. The real issue is how to prevent an election from happening either by accident or still by design by a government, which the member claims she does not support.</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para54847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly what the bill does. By now, the opposition, the media and the voting public are starting to understand that the promises we made during the last election are promises we intend to keep. They watched us fulfill our campaign promises to cut the GST, deliver truly universal child care benefits, present criminal justice reform and pass the accountability act. They will see many more commitments from our platform fulfilled this fall.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular bill, though relatively modest in scope, is significant for what it represents. It signifies this government's strong commitment to an ordered and measured reform of our democratic system of governance. The 19th century model of government our fathers of Confederation founded our nation upon has served us for nearly 140 years. Yet, in recent decades, we have seen a tendency of our current system for power to become consolidated at the centre. Provincial powers have become subsumed into the federal power and the power of Parliament has become subsumed into the Prime Minister's Office. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concentration of power at the centre has had serious consequences in many areas of Canadian life. For instance, we have seen the rise of regional alienation and even the formation of various separatist movements. A chief complaint they level is that Canada is not working. I disagree with those separatist sentiments, but it is a fair criticism to make that Canadian democracy does not work as well as it could. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we will begin to correct with basic democratic reforms such as fixed election dates. With these reforms we will begin to move from a 19th century toward a 21st century system of democracy that better serves the needs and aspirations of our many provinces, our much larger population and our modern society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly 140 years of Confederation we have seen little democratic reform up until now. We have long heard promises of democratic reforms from other parties including the previous Liberal government. We saw reports commissioned. We saw ministers of democratic reform appointed under the Liberals. The previous Liberal minister of democratic reform said just last year: </div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para54853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with that statement, but we will take action and not just talk about it. Yet, it is this new Conservative government that has delivered during the first months of office.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of Parliament from British Columbia, I am particularly proud to be speaking in support of fixed election dates. My province has long been the leader in the area of democratic reform and was the first province to implement fixed election dates in 2001.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbia made history when we had our first provincial election with a fixed election date of May 17, 2005. I believe it is no mistake that B.C. in particular has become a driving force behind our democratic reform in Canada. Indeed, B.C. is literally the furthest from the centre of political power in Canada; three time zones away, with high mountains and vast prairies between us and Ottawa. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, despite the distance and the political alienation that many sometimes feel, British Columbians have always taken the constructive approach. Rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater by choosing separatism, we have asked ourselves what needs to be done to fix these problems. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbians strongly believe that our system of government can be renewed and reformed. We have worked hard in recent years to make that a reality. We have legislation to allow for the election of senators to represent B.C. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently undertaken a process called a citizen's assembly to examine the question of proportional representation and we held a province-wide referendum on that proposal. We have passed recall legislation. We have successfully implemented fixed election dates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixing the election date levelled the playing field for everyone in B.C. Voters knew when the election was coming and had plenty of time to gather information, discuss the issues and formulate their decisions. Every party was able to plan accordingly. Parties could find candidates and those candidates could plan their lives around the known dates of the campaign. Candidates and parties could plan their fundraising. The governing party lost a real advantage, but this reform worked and democracy in B.C. has ultimately strengthened.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the reforms in B.C., we now see Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador adopting similar methods that are proposed here in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A>. Federal election dates would no longer be chosen with the advantage they may provide to the governing party. Every party would have the same opportunities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reverse is also true. Not only are snap elections out, no longer will governments that have passed their “best before” date and face certain defeat at the polls be able to drag out their terms simply for the purpose of remaining in power as long as possible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disastrous Ontario administration of would-be Liberal leader Bob Rae comes to mind as a prime example. His unpopular government clung to power for 57 months out of the 60 possible maximum.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting the dates of future elections in law would also have a noticeable benefit for the Canadian economy. As a trading nation with borders that are open to the flow of goods and capital, Canada's economy prospers when investors enjoy stability. Knowing the date of an election enhances the ability of businesses to engage in longer term planning. We also avoid the potential for large fluctuations in our currency due to speculation, which can harm our export based economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the example of a government that has overstayed its welcome and is intent on grasping power for a full five years, the four year election cycle would give voters the opportunity to judge a government on its economic performance sooner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disastrous Bob Rae government in Ontario, which ground the economy to a literal standstill on its infamous “Rae days” could have been tossed out nearly a year earlier. Ontario might have avoided that final year of high taxes, huge deficits, high unemployment and record welfare rolls.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A date fixed in October would also steer clear of many of the shortcomings of the recent federal election that straddled Christmas and New Year's. The October date would avoid interfering with most of the religious holidays and observances of Canadians. It would also avoid the summer and winter seasons, when many Canadian may be away from their homes and communities for extended periods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding of South Surrey—White Rock—Cloverdale has one of the highest populations of seniors in the nation. A large number of these seniors head to warmer climes in the winter months, for reasons of health and recreation. An October vote would allow my constituents to discharge their civic responsibilities without interference to their vacation plans. As such, making it easier to participate in an election with a fixed date in October should encourage a higher voter turnout; and the higher the participation rate, the healthier our democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our democratic reforms do not end with fixed election dates. These are only the first steps. We promised a series of substantive reforms during the recent election. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these, we promised to begin reform of the Upper House by creating a national process for choosing elected members for that House from each province and territory. We proposed further reforms to make the Upper House an effective, independent and democratically elected body that would equitably represent all regions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We committed to restore representation by population for Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta in the House of Commons while protecting the seat counts of smaller provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54871"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We committed to making all votes in Parliament, except the budget and main estimates, free votes for ordinary members of Parliament and to increasing the power of Parliament and parliamentary committees to review the spending estimates of departments and to hold ministers to account.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the government supposedly held a consultation process on post-secondary education.

    </p><a name="Para54882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, there are four clear benefits from the legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides fairness. No longer will the governing party be allowed to manipulate the process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides transparency and predictability. Canadians will benefit from knowing exactly when these fixed elections will occur so they can plan their lives and the businesses around it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It improves governance by removing power from the prime minister's office and devolving it to the people, as it should be. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, it will result in a higher voter turnout. The date in October was chosen particularly to avoid conflicts with municipal elections and religious holidays, such that the voter turnout should be higher if we adopt this legislation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para54889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the principle of fixed election dates, however the hon. member has said that snap election dates are out and that a government cannot manipulate the process. There is absolutely nothing in the legislation that prevents the government or any future government from manipulating the process. It does not define what votes of confidence are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later today we are going to have a vote on the softwood lumber deal. The government, which just the other day and over the summer, said that if in the vote did not go its way, it would be a vote of confidence, the government would fall and we would have an election. At the same time it has Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A> before the House.

    </p><a name="Para54891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the legislation prevent the government from manipulating election dates when in fact it is silent on it? </div>
    </p><a name="Para54892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless there is an amendment, which clearly defines what votes of confidence would be, we will be subject to future manipulation by the government.

    </p><a name="Para54897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to run for political office, as many here did, to make a difference. I believe we were sent here by our constituents to improve the state of the nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the areas where our nation definitely needs improvement is the structure and the function of our democracy. Before the last election, our party put forward a seven point plan to clean up and improve the state of our democracy. A friend of mine and a colleague of many who are here, Mr. Broadbent, proposed the seven point plan to clean up and put in the hands of Canadians some ideas that we could then bring to this place to improve the state of our nation and, indeed, the state and health of our democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go over those points. We know that with the accountability act the government quite smartly and rightly took some of our ideas and brought them forward. We certainly contributed to the committee on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A> in which the member for Winnipeg Centre and I proposed, as opposed to just opposing, ideas. We proposed some of the ideas that we had put forward in our plan, which was available to Canadians not only during the election but before the election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize the seven point plan, the first was to have democratic accountability in the House. We proposed that no member of Parliament could ignore his or her voters and wheel and deal for personal gain. No member of Parliament should be permitted to ignore the wishes of their voters and change parties. This was before the interesting musical chairs by the member for Vancouver Kingsway. We wanted to ensure that the wishes of voters were honoured. To cross the floor and become a member of another party, without first resigning his or her seat and running in a byelection, was not on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy is something that is evolving. It is an experiment of sorts and it is something where we know that when voters are not honoured, they do one of two things. Fist, they just walk away from the process, and no one wants to see that happen. Sadly, we have seen that happen over time. Second, they propose to change things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing we wanted to do in our seven point ethics packages was to ban floor-crossing. We saw that it dishonoured the wishes of voters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of our seven point plan was that election dates should be fixed, which is the spirit in the proposition the government has put before the House in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A>. There are many reasons for that, which I will explain in a minute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point three, which we proposed before the last election, was to set spending limits in leadership contests. We saw in the previous Liberal Party leadership contest the contestant, who then became the prime minister, had over $12 million in the bank. Obviously, there was not much competition in the end, but he had lots of money. We had concerns at the time about the amount of money in leadership contests, and it was not just with the Liberal Party. Parties are largely financed by the public and the same principles pertinent to the public good should play to the internal affairs of parties as they do to electoral competition between parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point four was electoral reform. This has been a demand, a suggestion, a proposition that was made probably before I was born. An organization of Canadians from coast to coast has been brought together from all parties. It has decided to focus on electoral reform, which obviously needs fixing.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100">(1100)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para54906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have suggested we look to the other healthy democracies that have proportional representation, that the will and the spirit of the voters is represented in legislative bodies. This clearly has not happened in the last number of elections. We need a process and we need to ensure that we get on with that process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair Vote Canada, the organization to which I referred, has been tireless in advocating for fair elections so voters are not cheated, which has happened. It is not about parties. We know we have had majority governments that are false majorities, governments that are based on 38% and 39% of the vote. That is clearly wrong, it is undemocratic and it should be changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point five was that unregulated lobbying and political cronyism must end. We have started on that path with some amendments we made on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2158135,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2158135&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> C-2</A>. We have to change government appointments so they are not patronage appointments. We have made some changes, but there is work to be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point seven was access to information. Clearly, that is the window on democracy. It is a bit clouded now. We are working on that and there is more to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the bill before us. The reason why we put forward fixed election dates long before others were talking about it in this place was because we saw the concerns that people had with the executive power, which has been concentrated over time, in the hands of the Prime Minister's Office. Some put it back to just after Pearson. We saw this lead to the deepening of cynicism among the voters of Canada. We had a previous government call a snap election when it was clear that the opposition at the time was not coalesced or organized. Why? Because it could win the election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned, governments sometimes go on too long. We remember the previous Conservative government, which waited until 1993 to finally let Canadians have their say. We could see a government call a snap election to get power or a government that hangs on to long. We see the benefit of having fixed election dates, but there are many other reasons, if we look to the people who have studied it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I refer to Henry Milner, who is an author, visiting scholar and professor of political science at Laval University. He has studied this, and I consider this an objective opinion. He is one of the people we tapped into taking a look at fixed election dates. He showed that Canada is only 1 out of 12 of 40 comparable democracies that does not use some form of fixed election dates. Clearly, when we look at the juxtaposition between our democracy and others, it is worth examining, and he did that. He also said that these numbers contradicted the widely held misperception that flexible election dates were incompatible with parliamentary systems, as some have suggested.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will turn to concerns with the fact that there have not been constitutional changes proposed in the bill. In effect, a prime minister can walk down the street and still call for an election. My colleague has made a proposal. In committee we will look at proposing ways to ensure that there are criteria on what is a confidence vote.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most parliamentary democracies in Scandinavia and continental Europe, including several Westminster style systems, have what is called a flexible fix. In other words people would have concerns if there were a loss of confidence and the government should fall and set criteria accordingly. That is really what we are talking about: not fixed election dates, but nuance. It is a flexible fix so if there is a minority Parliament and the government loses the confidence of the House, there is an opportunity to go to the people, and that will not change. Therefore, we have fixed election dates when it is opportune.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many others, I am concerned that the present government is simply trying to engineer, between policy and brokerage politics, the fall of the House so it can then gain a majority. I actually think that with this debate and this bill in front of us people will become wise to that kind of backroom politicking. Not only with fixed election dates would we avoid the cynical use of power within the Prime Minister's Office, as we saw with previous governments, but the public would be aware of a fixed election date in October and would then question the government if it were orchestrating the fall of the House. The government would need to make that political argument. Is it playing brokerage politics simply to have the House fall so that it could gain a majority government? I see that as an important debate to have. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By adopting a precise date, preferably early in the fall as has been suggested, it would allow a campaign to take place at the end of the traditional vacation period in Canada. We also must take rural Canada into account. If we were to have an election too early in the fall it would affect farmers. Farmers, goodness knows, have had enough challenges and they do not need another one in front of them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many of us had a terrific time going door to door in the last election and found it very invigorating ploughing through the snow, many of us, and probably most Canadians, would rather that be a footnote in history and not a practice to embrace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to build in provisions for holding early elections when necessary and in such an event stipulate that the following election would occur on the designated date four calendar years later, I believe Canadians would embrace that and it would help fix democracy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to conclude by emphasizing the fact that this is something the NDP proposed before the election and it is something we embrace. We have some concerns but they can be dealt with in committee. We fully support fixed election dates. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to leave the House and Canadians with the fact that this is not the end of electoral reform and democratic reform. Canadians are demanding that we fix our democracy, that we embrace the idea of democratic reform and that we embrace the idea of proportional representation. Canadians would then have genuine confidence in democracy. This is the beginning, definitely not the end. I look forward to engaging in debate with my colleagues.</div>

    </p><a name="Para54922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that during elections, the parliamentary process is blocked. It affects our ridings too. Plenty of things get put on the back burner. I find it has a huge impact on what we are trying to do for our constituents.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that when the election date is unknown, we often drop certain issues the moment the election is called so we can prepare for the campaign.

    </p><a name="Para54927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw in this town and across the country that things came to a standstill around the time there was a perception of an election coming and files were not moved. In this past election, because it was a fairly long period, things were not getting done and, as a result, service to Canadians was affected negatively.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that fixed election dates, particularly when it would occur just after summer vacations and when business is done throughout the land, people could begin ratcheting up their campaigns before the actual election date, which is common.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do not think the business of the country will come to a standstill. People will understand and accept that an election is happening and that the government will no longer be able to manipulate it and, if it does, it will be in what I will call the public square. Everyone will be saying that we are throwing more money at something or we are going to stranglehold the bureaucracy by not allowing it to do anything because there is an election coming.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally think what should happen is what has happened in other jurisdictions that have brought in fixed election dates. It will make government more effective, more comprehensive and will, hopefully, avoid what we have seen in the past, which is the manipulation by the Prime Minister's Office, the executive branch or the bureaucracy simply for its own pursuit of power.</div>

However, with this legislation and this concept of fixed election dates, as we see this with the present government, this will take the rug out from under it, the strategy of trying to orchestrate a non-confidence vote simply to get a majority, as we have seen with previous governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if the bill were to pass and we do have fixed election dates, Canadians will question why the government would try to play brokerage politics, playing one region off the other simply to have a government fall and then gain a majority. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, let us be honest that is the elephant in the room, that the government is simply looking for a way to orchestrate the fall of Parliament, particularly while one party is going through a leadership process. It may be a strategy it learned from another political party, I do not know, but that will be known to Canadians who will ask why the government is orchestrating the fall of Parliament when we have a fixed election date two or three years hence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two criteria. One is that we can look at making amendments and set criteria for confidence, if that is possible. The second is that Canadians are smart and they will see when they are being manipulated. If there is a fixed election date and we have a government that is cynically trying to cause the fall of Parliament simply to get a majority, it will pay the price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at that in combination with the fact that this is the beginning and not the end of electoral reform, this is something we should embrace. We can see how we can make it better in committee and that is why my party will be supporting it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para54943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply suggest that the member take a look at the reference in my speech to the work that has been done by Professor Milner. He takes a look at the fact that it is not only the United States but that many other jurisdictions have successfully embraced fixed election dates, fixed but flexible. The American system does not have that flexibility. We would have the flexibility and it honours the Westminster tradition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to my colleague's question on proportional representation, we need to honour the voters of this country with a system that is fair. What we do not have presently is a fair system. It was referenced earlier that we have a system that was created back in the 18th century and obviously needs reform. We have seen reform in every other jurisdiction. Every other mature democracy, save two, have embraced some form of proportional representation. Why? It is because it is more democratic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the House and to Canadians that this is not something that needs to be studied. We need to go to Canadians and have a citizens assembly, as has been done in other jurisdictions. We must provide these citizens with some of these ideas and hear from them what they think makes sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We proposed that process, by the way, as something we were going to follow in the last Parliament. Sadly, the government abandoned that commitment. I would like to see that embraced in this Parliament and discussed with Canadians.</div>

However, we do have some comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is like many bills that seek to improve how the federal system works. They sometimes add to our difficulties as sovereignist members in this place. Many of our constituents tell us when we meet with them that we are not here to improve the federal system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tell my fellow Quebeckers that the Bloc Québécois remains a resolutely sovereignist party. Until Quebeckers say yes to themselves, Quebec will work within a British parliamentary system. Incidentally, the same is true in the Quebec National Assembly. The British parliamentary system that is in force here means that sovereignist members represent Quebec, and until we achieve sovereignty, if improvements can be made to the way the parliamentary system works, we will make them. I wanted to make that clear so that the Bloc Québécois is not accused of improving how the system works and turning its back on sovereignty as an option.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this bill on fixed election dates, Canada will join the ranks of countries that have adopted the same principle, countries with a clear democratic tradition such as Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg and the United States. In Canada, three provinces have passed legislation providing for fixed election dates: British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, this is nothing new. For decades, it has been customary to hold elections on fixed dates for what I would call lower levels of government. I cannot think of any other term for this, but I am referring to different levels of government, such as the municipal level. I want to be careful what I say, especially since we have in our ranks the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, the former president of the Union des municipalités du Québec. I would not want him to accuse me of implying that municipal elected officials are lower or inferior in any way, during the upcoming period of questions and comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately I have just had a stroke of genius and found with a synonym. I am talking about the municipal level as a different and very important level of government. I should know since, before being elected here, I was municipal councillor for Boischatel, in Côte-de-Beaupré where I live. I still live in Boischatel and I am a proud Boischatelois. I can tell you that working in a municipal government is not a prerequisite for working in the federal government or at the Quebec legislature. It is nonetheless an asset and I am proud of the years I spent at the municipal level.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec we already have fixed-date elections at the municipal level every four years. In the past two or three years, the Government of Quebec has harmonized these elections because there were still some municipalities that held their elections on different dates. Now in Quebec, municipal elections are held the first Sunday in November every four years. My memory fails me but I believe that our school boards in Quebec also have fixed-date elections.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been going on for decades, as I was saying. This has not hindered the accountability of the elected representatives or democracy in general.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the main advantage of this bill will be eliminating the prerogative of the party in power—I will go a bit further—the prerogative of the Prime Minister.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jean Chrétien was the Liberal leader and Prime Minister he used to say that it was his wife Aline who chose the election dates. This was done very privately. Mr. Chrétien, a dramatic man, told us the story somewhat like this: he would get up in the morning and be shaving in front of the bathroom mirror when suddenly Aline would appear and tell him not to arrange any more appointments, to go see the Governor General and ask that an election be called. It went a little something like that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the prerogative of the party in power is a rather secretive decision.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> My colleague from Hochelaga is suggesting that it is a spousal decision. Nonetheless, it is a rather secretive decision and is more or less the Prime Minister's prerogative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the government, the leader of the Conservative Party, the Prime Minister, probably remembers how former Prime Minister Chrétien legally exercised his prerogative and took advantage of whatever situation certain opposition parties were in.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House of the facts. On March 15, 1997, the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie was elected leader of the Bloc Québécois. An election was held two and a half months later, on June 2, 1997, called by former Prime Minister Chrétien. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeated the same strategy in 2000. On July 8, 2000, the current Minister of Public Safety was elected leader of the Canadian Alliance, one of the many names of a party that changed names frequently, in search of its identity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall from my law practice that requesting a name change is relatively easy and lucrative. That party often changed names. At that time, however, it was the Canadian Alliance. The current Minister of Public Safety was chosen to lead the party on July 8, 2000. Five months later, Prime Minister Chrétien called an election for November 27, 2000. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Conservative Party, who is the current Prime Minister, was elected leader on March 20, 2004. The former Prime Minister, whose name I cannot mention since he is still the member for LaSalle—Émard for a few more weeks, called an election to be held on June 28, 2004, three months after the election of the Conservative Party leader. It was an opportunity for barely legal tricks aimed at furthering a possible division or realignment within a party that had just chosen a new leader. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that this did not serve democracy, which is why we like the fact that this bill removes the for the party in power's prerogative to call an election whenever it would be most politically advantageous for that party. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An election will now be a sure thing, exactly as it is in the United States. If you would like to try a little exercise, ask any grade 6 class on what date the American election of 2092 will be held. They need only look at a calendar. Everyone knows that the election is held every four years. This removes the possibility of playing games or engaging in political manipulation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This principle places all the parties on a more equal footing. The party in power no longer has an organizational advantage because only they know when the elections will take place. All parties democratically represented in the House, and even registered parties without parliamentarians, would be playing by the same rules. I believe there are 21 registered parties in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also believe that this bill would make it easier for more people to participate in the electoral process, whether as supporters, election workers or even voters. The issue of motivation and advertising by the Chief Electoral Officer could create a certain buzz among voters, with the goal of increasing voter participation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 20 years there has been a decline in voter turnout in Canada. I believe there was a slight increase of a few tenths of a point during the 2006 elections even though they were held on January 23. The strong trend over the past 20 years has been a decline in voter turnout. This is worrisome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fellow citizens can be grouped into certain categories. There are citizens who have lost interest in public affairs and who no longer vote. Unfortunately, when we have gone door-to-door and regardless of whether or not an election campaign is underway—Bloc Québécois members have a reputation for being visible not just during election campaigns and, as the whip, I receive my colleagues' schedules and I can confirm that the 50 Bloc Québécois members are known to have a strong presence in their community—our fellow citizens have told us over the years that they will no longer vote. They feel it is useless and that it makes no difference if the government is Liberal or Conservative. They will no longer vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is worrisome in a democracy. We must find ways of increasing voter turnout.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of having fixed election dates would be to enhance the effectiveness of the work done by parliamentarians, since committees would then have an opportunity to plan their work schedules better. Certainly some parliamentary work is done in this House of Commons, but we must also not forget the work done by the standing committees, the equivalent of parliamentary committees, sometimes called commissions, in Quebec. Here, they are standing committees. We have 26 of those committees, and they do fantastic work and deal with a huge work load, whether by approving bills on second reading or in the special studies they do. Unfortunately, people too often see only the work that is done here in the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes we have visitors. People sit in the galleries and are surprised to see that there are not more members in the House. What I tell them then, and I take this opportunity to tell the people who are watching us on television, is that you must not base your impressions solely on the number of people physically sitting here. If my memory serves me, there are 16 or 17 committees meeting on a Tuesday. Our members of Parliament, who are not blessed with the ability to be in two places at once, cannot be in the House and at a committee meeting. That does not mean that members are not working, even if they are not physically present in the House. Too often, people consider only the work done in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If committees knew that elections would be held on fixed dates, they could organize their work accordingly and could avoid initiating an extensive study, knowing that elections would take place in seven months, and that it would demand a lot of work. Conversely, they could start work earlier on an extensive study, knowing that elections would take place in a year and a half or two years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another consequence of this bill is that when the time did come, the public would be in a better position to evaluate the track record of the party in power, the party chosen in the election campaign to form the government.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1130">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para54976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would be in a position to use better judgment when exercising the right to vote. As well, knowing it would soon have to face the dangers of the polls, a government would be more inclined to make tough decisions, decisions that might be unpopular but that are necessary. A government could decide to go ahead, and, because there were fixed election dates, tell itself that the public would be able to judge its actions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para54977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the opposition's approach to its work would change. Knowing that the government had a fixed term, the opposition would opt for different approaches and would contribute positively to the bills before the House. One of the roles of the opposition is to be the critic of the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois has taken on the responsibility of not acting simply as a critic for the joy of criticizing or the joy of saying that what the government is bringing in makes no sense. When we think that the government is bringing in things that that make no sense, we say so. However, when we think that the government is bringing in things that are serious or reasonable, that could be improved, we voice constructive criticism. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, the softwood lumber agreement on which we are going to vote at 3:15 this afternoon is a good example. The Bloc Québécois still believes that a billion dollars are missing from the American trust fund. We consulted with working people in the regions. The leader of the Bloc Québécois and our critics for industry and international trade toured exhaustively in the regions. We consulted people in the pulp and paper industry. They tell us that this is not necessarily a good agreement but they want us to ratify it anyway. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a purely partisan standpoint, we could vote against the agreement because it was signed by a Conservative international trade minister, who used to be a Liberal minister—but that is another story. But after consulting, we decided that we would support it. We are therefore providing constructive criticism, and this is why the Bloc Québécois still wants an assistance plan. In any case, though, that is not the purpose of my speech and questions could be raised about the relevance of what I am saying. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This principle would also make it easier for Elections Canada, the parties, and the candidates to plan for election campaigns and ultimately might well improve them and possibly reduce their cost. That is a major point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Kingsley, just testified before this committee. When we do our election post-mortems and ask all our caucus colleagues to tell us about problems with the implementation of the Elections Act, Mr. Kingsley or one of the members of his team always shows up with a notebook. They certainly do listen because after I speak in the House, I sometimes receive e-mails or telephone calls from them. They do not always agree, or they provide further clarification. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, we are occasionally critical, and quite rightly so, of the Chief Electoral Officer and the Elections Canada team. Sometimes, however, in view of the short deadlines involved, we must bear in mind that the Chief Electoral Officer could have difficulty getting his election preparations quite right. I would think he would like fixed election dates because he would always know where he stood since he would be aware of the exact date of the next election, for example in 2009. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been signalled that I have only a minute left and will finish up as follows: in general, this bill will help to fix some contradictory situations that currently arise. We in the Bloc Québécois support the basic principle. If the bill passes and works well, who will be the ultimate winner? I think it will be democracy and also the respect that citizens have—citizens who decide through their vote who will represent them in the House of Commons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois legitimately represents its constituents. Everyone in this House, regardless of whether or not they like the individual who was elected, must respect democracy and the persons chosen in a democratic election by the people of Quebec and Canada. </div>

He knows that the difference between fixed election dates in the municipal world and under this legislation is that the mayor, for example, cannot at his discretion decide to dissolve the council and call an election. If it is a fixed election date, it is a fixed election date both in terms of principle and in reality. Under this legislation, we would have a fixed election date, but still have the ability of government to have discretionary power to call an election any time it sees fit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para54987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member or his party be prepared to look at specific amendments to reduce that discretionary power, for example, only on money matters, money bills or the Speech from the Throne? A government could come along and say it promised 15 things in the last election and has deemed each and every one of those 15 as confidence matters. Therefore, notwithstanding that we have a fixed election date four years or three years from now, it is going to deem this a confidence matter and if it loses of course it would go to an election.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should say something about weekends and the parliamentary recess. It must be said, and I do so as a non-partisan comment, that on Monday members of all parties did not return from a vacation that began June 22. We were not on vacation. We spent some time with our families because we are human beings and we do need a little rest. However, we continued to work in our respective ridings. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed-date elections are not something that preoccupies the voters of Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord on a daily basis. This summer, the people were talking about the government’s position on the war in Afghanistan, about their hopes that the Kyoto protocol would be respected and the Prime Minister’s position on the bombardment of south Lebanon and about many other subjects such as the higher price of gasoline. Those are the subjects that the voters are concerned about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not need to say how good this Conservative government is in wanting to improve the democratic process by means of fixed-date elections. The government needs rather to be concerned with settling the most pressing problems. I believe it needs to increase its credibility because this summer the government’s credibility was at its lowest point. </div>

As many members have already stated, a degree of cynicism has made its way into our Canadian democratic system. If I understand correctly, the purpose of this bill is to restore the confidence of Canadians and Quebeckers. However, I believe that Canadians are concerned about a party that is pledged to break up our Canadian federal parliamentary system. I put this question to the member: how does the Bloc propose to restore the confidence of those Quebeckers who see their future in a strong Quebec, but within Canada? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a very strong desire in Quebec to manage our own affairs. We are saying that sovereignty will not be a vote against the people of British Columbia. We are going to say “Yes” to ourselves. According to the polls, between 48% and 52% of the population shares that view. What more can I say? The desire to manage your own affairs is not against anyone else; it is for yourself. It is exactly like a young couple that decides to live together. Do they ask permission from the butcher, the grocer or anyone else? They do not even ask permission of their parents. A young man may tell his mother that he loves her. She does his laundry and cleans his room, but he has decided to spread his wings and leave the nest. That is what freedom is. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A>, legislation that seeks to amend the Canada Elections Act to bring in fixed election dates at the federal level in Canada. The bill provides, subject to an early dissolution of Parliament, that a general election must be held every four years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of fixed elections is embraced by many people as a way of addressing some of the perceived cynicism in our political system. Rightly or wrongly, people do believe that what happens here in Ottawa is often out of sync with ordinary Canadians. I think we could all think of circumstances. I will vote for the legislation at second reading so the committee can deliberate and make any changes, particularly as it relates to the issue of confidence and confidence votes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not always a fan of fixed elections. In fact, I can recall when I was the president of the Liberal Party in Nova Scotia, my good friend and former leader, Danny Graham, upon becoming leader, proposed sweeping changes on how the government and the House of Assembly operated. He had a large number of democratic reforms about which he was very passionate, including fixed elections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As party president at the time, I thought there were more important issues to be addressed and I was not at all enthralled with this idea but, as is usually the case when I look back on it, Danny was right. I have come to believe that fixed elections do have useful elements and are worthy of support. I think they are generally good for government. I think they are generally good for the public service. I think they are generally good for the media who have to cover and portray campaigns at their cost. And I think they are generally good for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the primary arguments for fixed elections is to remove the unfair advantage that the government has in setting the election date. Does this take politics out of the election dates? I do not think it takes all of the politics out of election dates. It does mean that the government cannot determine in a majority situation that it will have an election early or even go for five years if it wishes. It does determine that the date will be held at a certain point in time, but it certainly will not take the politics out of fixing an election date, nor will it shorten election campaigns. In fact, looking south, I suspect that it will make election campaigns much longer. People are already preparing for the 2008 presidential elections and for senatorial elections two or even three years down the road as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this fixed election date will mean that a prime minister would no longer have the opportunity to call an election when it is thought to be to her or his advantage. In Nova Scotia, we had a case in the 1980s. Premier and then Senator Buchanan was elected in 1978. He called an election in 1981 and another one in 1984. It was similar to what we had at the federal level through the 1990s.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed elections might also level the playing field for all participants by providing certainty for candidates who are seeking to become members of Parliament. I think that is important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that when I was seeking election, there were a lot of decisions to be made. There is a lot of planning with one's family and with one's business if one happens to be a business person. There is an awful lot of work that has to be done around identifying when one is going to make the announcement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of people who may be in business, or partners in business, a position similar to my own, can one in fact be a nominated candidate for a year or perhaps even two years not knowing when the election might be? I think that is worthwhile considering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know the risk involved in running for office. We set aside our lives to run in the hopes of winning. Many who have jobs without protection must, in a relatively short period of time, make significant changes in their lives to run for office, so I think fixed elections will allow individuals the opportunity to plan effectively to run for public office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are positive elements and, as I say, I look forward to supporting the legislation and bringing it to committee. It is my hope that when it comes back I can vote for it again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, some questions that I think need to be addressed, not the least of which is the issue of what constitutes confidence and what parameters might exist that would not allow a government the opportunity to circumvent the legislation for its electoral advantage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, we would want to avoid any situation whereby an election is called, or orchestrating an election, let us say hypothetically next spring or even this fall, perhaps after the introduction of a budget before it has been debated, or triggering an election before bad news arrives. For example, maybe the government has some indication of pending release of documents suggesting there might be some ill-conceived action that has taken place.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need clarity as to what constitutes confidence and what parameters would exist in that regard. Could the softwood lumber vote today be an issue of confidence? Could the gun registry vote be an issue of confidence? I think these are some important constitutional issues that need to be addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution does not contain many provisions regarding elections. Section 50 tells us that the House of Commons shall continue for up to five years. Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms suggests that:</div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>No House of Commons and no legislative assembly shall continue for longer than five years from the date fixed for the return of the writs of a general election of its members.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para55025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, I will support this bill in the initial stages, and I hope in the later stages, in the hope that the committee will spend as much time as possible in ensuring the bill makes sense and answers some of the questions proposed here and yesterday in debate in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must address another issue tied into public confidence, and occasionally public cynicism, about what happens here and how we conduct ourselves in Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the real issue is not who calls an election or when, but how parliamentarians treat each other and the institutions of Parliament, such as, for example, question period. Question period is the time when most Canadians see us in the House of Commons. Debate clips do not usually get on TV, but question period does. During this 45 minute period, accusations are made, although the accusations seem to me to be more reasonable this year than last year, and reputations are sometimes ruined. We see false outrage and packaged answers. We wonder why people might think their elected representatives do not connect sometimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the issue of cynicism in politics solved by the introduction of fixed elections or by an overhaul of how we treat each other in this chamber? Why is it that colleagues from all sides can speak well to each other outside the chamber and enjoy a drink or dinner together, but when the cameras are on we cannot resist the temptation to replace debate with feigned outrage?</div>
    </p><a name="Para55029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one thing to reform our election process, and I support that, but I hope all members would also reflect on issues related to our level of discourse in this chamber. I do not suggest that there are any angels among us. We all share that responsibility. We should all do better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I will support this bill, and I hope to support it when it comes back. We need more certainty about what constitutes confidence, about what determines when an election is called. The advantage of this bill for Canadians is that it would provide some certainty. It is important that we define certainty before we pass this bill. I will support it going to committee. I hope some changes are made. I hope very much to support it when it comes back.</div>

I would be the last person to ever engage in either parliamentary questions or issues of the Constitution with the member for Mississauga South, but the concern of course is that, yes, the way the bill is written, there is still every opportunity that the government could force an early election if it felt that was to its advantage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas this bill is singularly about fixing an election date, I think the prime result of this bill is that Canadians should know when the next election would be, barring a loss of confidence and what would constitute confidence in the House of Commons.

I can see the issue being a real problem down the road.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like the hon. member sitting next to me to comment on a couple of things. One would be on priorities. The other is that the provincial elections in Ontario have been set for a certain date as have municipal elections. We know exactly when they are going to happen. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is that if a minority government all of a sudden falls just before a municipal or a provincial election, two elections would happen at the same time. This would cause a lot of confusion. I do not see anything in the bill that would prevent this. There is a clause that allows for three days' movement, but that does not make any change to a whole election campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the member be open to discussing an amendment that would allow that to be changed? I am not sure exactly what the parameters are. I have identified a weakness in it. Unfortunately, I do not have a solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like fixed election dates; I think they are a good idea. However, I am really concerned that if there is an election at the same time as a municipal or provincial election and they are both held at the same time in perpetuity every four years, it would cause real problems not only for the parties, but also for the voters. It would be very confusing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I have is on priorities. There were five priorities and now it is down to four. Where does this come as a priority? It does not seem to be terribly high on the list. I never saw it before. All of a sudden it is a priority. It is the first item that we are talking about. Could you comment on that please?</div>

I do not know how to manage that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to address the member's other question which is on priorities. This issue clearly is not a priority for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of budget 2006 we are seeing once again a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. Government initiatives in my view do little to help those who most need assistance. They do little to help students to gain access to post-secondary education, and do nothing for the productivity agenda which is so important to Canada. The government's initiatives do very little, if anything, for Canada's first nations people and do nothing for child care. There are all kinds of priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went around my constituency this summer, people said to me, “The GST was cut, but I didn't notice. A penny and a half on a cup of coffee does not make a lot of difference to me, but if the personal exemption had been kept where it was, it would have helped”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As priorities, this issue is not one of them. It has been presented as legislation and I will support it, but we could have done a lot more for Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first like to comment on the response given by the hon. member for Montmorency—Charlevoix—Haute-Côte-Nord to the hon. member for Victoria.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para55051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member said that when Quebec left and part of Canada was taken away it would not hurt British Columbia or any part of Canada. I disagree. I refer to the great English parliamentarian, John Donne, who said that when just one clod of earth washed away from the shores of England, when one was lost, it affected the entire country. When we lose one person, for whom does the bell toll? It tolls for thee. Losing any part of Canada would have a great effect on all of Canada. It is a subject of great concern and importance to everyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the bill, most of the discussion so far has been on the philosophical aspects of the bill, but I want to talk about three technical aspects of it. The drafters and departmental officials may want to consider some technical points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about proposed subsection 56.2(1). This refers to changing the fixed election date slightly if there is a provincial or municipal election. The government philosophy that it does not want to conflict with other governments' elections is good. It could be a nightmare if two elections were going on at the same time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this section is very flawed, because it refers only to municipal and provincial governments. Canada is not made up simply of provincial and municipal governments. There are four orders of government in Canada and the federal government has neglected two of them: the territorial and the first nations governments. It was only a few parliamentary days ago when we had a vote in the House of Commons and only two of us, the member for Nunavut and I, voted against it because it referred to federal and provincial governments but had left out the territorial governments. Here again the territories have been left out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we characterize the current government since the election, it has been a government of omission: who has been left out; who has been left behind. Think about the low income people whose taxes were increased, as mentioned previously. Think about people with disabilities and seniors whose income tax increased from 12% to 12.5%. Global warming is having a dramatic effect on the people in the north while many of the climate change programs have been allowed to expire and are not being renewed. The aboriginal people were also left behind when the greatest agreement in the history of this nation, with funding of $5 billion, was abrogated. It was a good faith agreement and those people were left behind. Single mothers have lost the $5 billion day care program which would have given them some relief, some possibility of getting into the workforce and building new lives for themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are leaving behind geographically almost half the country: the territorial governments and the first nations governments. I want to talk about first nations governments. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, federal departments, agencies and politicians too often do not realize the new reality in Canada, the great land claims and self-government agreements. I am sure every member in the House is in total agreement with the modernization of dealing with these other governments in Canada. Too often we forget that we have made these arrangements. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210">(1210)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55057"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we sign deals with first nations, we have created new governments in Canada that in some cases have more power than a province. These governments have to be legally and morally dealt with on a government to government to government basis. We cannot just omit them when we are talking about governments in this country. We have signed deals that mandate consultation. We have signed agreements that are constitutionally protected in some cases that mandate consultation with these governments. Sometimes people do not understand and they think it is only the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, but it is all federal departments and agencies and it is all politicians. We have signed these agreements on behalf of Canada and not on behalf of a single department.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would certainly be looking for a technical modification to proposed subsection 56.2(1) to include governments that are omitted in the present drafting. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other major point I want to make relates to proposed subsection 56.2(4). My colleague from Nipissing—Timiskaming made the same point. As I have said earlier, this is in relation to not having elections at the same time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2221899,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2221899&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-16</A> were to come into effect in its present form, the federal election would occur three days before all the municipal elections in my jurisdiction. Any member who has had the unfortunate situation of having two elections going on at the same time knows what a mess it is. When enumerators go door to door, people say that they have already been enumerated. There are signs of all different colours for different elections. The voters do not know which advance poll is for which election. It is absurd to have two elections going on at the same time. If possible, it should be avoided.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill will mandate that two elections go on within three days of each other in 2007. Some technical modifications are needed. I know the government is acting in goodwill. The government does not want to pile up elections. This was part of the government's philosophy in bringing forward the bill. Unfortunately, the technical aspects of the bill do not make that possible now. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill allows for small changes in timing, but only three days. It could be the day after or a week after, which in effect would only be three days from the election that I am talking about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need more flexibility in that section, perhaps a month, so that the Governor General has enough flexibility and that provincial, municipal, first nations or other government elections do not overlap. As the NDP member from Ottawa said earlier, when there are conflicting situations what happens is that the electorate stops showing up. There is already a big enough problem with that. We do not want to create more problems for the electorate which is already having a problem getting enthused with the process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed subsection 57(4) talks about changing the election day to the Tuesday if the Monday happens to be a holiday. That does not jibe clearly with proposed subsection 56.2(4) which talks about the alternate dates, because it could be the alternate Tuesday or Monday. Technically we must make sure that those two sections work together and that the results are very clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, there are two major technical flaws with the bill. One is that the bill only talks about two of the four orders of government where the federal election date would be altered. The other is the bill does not have enough flexibility to change the federal election date slightly by a number of weeks, a month or so, in order not to conflict with a provincial, municipal or first nations election.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach would build on the strong points of the merger review process now in place for airline companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This process was put in place with the amendments made to the Canada Transportation Act in 2000 as a result of the issues of public interest raised by the acquisition of Canadian Airlines International by Air Canada. This new mechanism replaced the requirements of the Competition Act respecting merger reviews. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the chief elements of the proposed provision respecting mergers:</div>
    </p><a name="Para55094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merger applicants must address specific issues in the new merger review guidelines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be authorized to appoint someone to review the proposed transaction if the proposal raises enough issues with respect to the public interest as it relates to national transportation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The provision provides for a single government decision to be made so as to avoid duplication. I will handle public interest concerns, and the competition commissioner will look at competition concerns.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para55097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments include a new provision that authorizes me to enter into an agreement with a provincial authority under which the provincial authority would regulate a federal railway. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other main element of the previous Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> that I would like to explain is a proposed new provision on the grain revenue cap, which limits the amount of revenue that Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway can earn from regulated grain movements in western Canada. The provision is linked to the costs of maintaining hopper cars for such movements. On May 4, I announced that the government would retain its fleet of 12,100 grain hopper cars in order to maximize benefits for farmers and taxpayers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> that would enable me to make a one time only request to the agency to adjust the revenue caps to reflect the current maintenance costs for all hopper cars used in regulated grain movements. This will more closely align the costs in the revenue caps with the actual costs of maintaining the hopper cars in revenue cap service. Estimates show potential savings for farmers of approximately $2 per tonne or about $50 million per year based on an average movement of about 25 million tonnes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to explain the proposed amendments to the Railway Safety Act. They are fairly straightforward. The Canada Transportation Act authorizes federally regulated railways to establish and operate their own police forces. CNR and CPR maintain police forces as do provincial railways and transit authorities. The duties of railway police constables relate to the protection of property owned or administered by the company, and of the persons and equipment on that property. Only a judge of a superior court, upon the application of a railway, is allowed to appoint, dismiss or discharge railway police constables. The power to appoint police constables is being moved from the CTA to the Railway Safety Act. The Railway Safety Act deals with matters pertaining to the safety and security of railways, making it a more appropriate statutory authority to deal with railway police.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, amendments to the Railway Safety Act will require that the railways establish an independent review mechanism for responding to public complaints against railway police. The review mechanism will be filed with me for approval.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I want to reiterate that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> is consistent with the government's legislative strategy for amending the Canada Transportation Act. The strategy is to proceed with amendments that stakeholders are already demanding, have awaited for several years, and that reflect extensive consultations and consensus building. </div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para55105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to congratulate the minister on being here this morning. We have not seen him for a few weeks, even though the important issue of security at the Montreal airport has been under discussion. This is a rather disturbing issue for Canadians.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para55106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to raise a couple of core points before responding officially to the government's bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of pointed questions for the minister that deal with what is not in the bill as opposed to what is in the bill. I do also at the same time congratulate the minister for his candour in reminding the House of Commons that the vast majority of this legislation is in fact legislation from our previous government. There was an awful lot of heavy lifting done by government officials and all members of the House, but I do want to give him those kudos because it does take great big shoulders to admit that the lion's share of the work here was accomplished by previous governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two pointed questions I want to put to him. First, if I understand the bill correctly, this bill provides new powers to the minister and the government to devolve further the responsibility for federally regulated railways, and this at a time when the government represents a government which strictly interprets the Constitution and responsibilities. Is that the case?</div>
    </p><a name="Para55109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is no talk at all in the bill about final offer arbitration, a very contentious issue. I would like to ask the minister for his views in this regard. Why is final offer arbitration not addressed in the bill?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could ask the transport minister to think back to his career in the municipal arena. I say this because clause 29 refers to noise. I would just like to explain to the minister that whole communities are experiencing serious problems with marshalling yards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, as we know, federal law takes precedence over provincial law and even municipal laws. As the clause is written, when determining whether a company is making excessive noise, the Transportation Agency is limited by the company's obligations and operational requirements. This is therefore related to how the company operates and what constitutes reasonable noise. Municipalities do not work in this way. A municipality would have set standards to obey, with decibel levels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would simply like the minister to send an important message, especially to the Transportation Agency, to avoid the tendency to target industry practices and instead make sure the industry can adapt to the surrounding area. Clearly, it is important to ensure that the Transportation Agency plays more than just a mediation role. Cooperation has to be facilitated, and in the end it has to be possible to impose standards when the industry does not want to listen. In many places, mitigation measures have been taken and discussions have been held with the companies in operation. But the parties do not reach an agreement, because there is too much noise for the surrounding area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like the minister to tell us that he will keep abreast of this situation and will make it clear to the Transportation Agency that steps must be taken to solve the noise problem.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my part of the country, in British Columbia and specifically on Vancouver Island, a rail line was to be abandoned by CP Rail and VIA Rail. I know our communities up and down the island spent years trying to arrive at some solution. The process was cumbersome. It was not transparent.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do, quite humbly, think that the amendment provides a benefit for all these transportation companies that are asking to be able to use the existing rail lines, and that it protects consumers from prices that might be charged. We had to find a way of enabling these transportation companies and public transit agencies to be able to operate, while at the same time ensuring that consumers come out ahead, because fundamentally we need to be able to use these infrastructures for the common good, the good of the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of these rail lines, my colleague is of course referring to policies that were applied several years ago, when a number of rail lines were transferred, for example, in Quebec, to regional municipalities or local authorities. Some of them ultimately recycled the rail lines by making them into bicycle paths or pedestrian trails.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can study this. I must humbly say that I do not have the answer to my colleague’s question, but this question can certainly be raised during the debate that will take place in committee in the near future.</div>

While we agree in principle with much of what is being presented, there have been substantial changes to the workings of the bill. My colleagues and I will address some of these and outline our concerns today and in the days ahead. In turn, though, the onus remains on the government to convince us and Canadians that the legislation is still well-founded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parliamentary history of the bill is important at the outset for our context and so too is the wider history of the two bills that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> aims to amend.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in 1996, a decade ago, the first of the two, the Canada Transportation Act, laid out our national transport policy. It was really a vision to modernize and deregulate rail and airline traffic. It consolidated the 1987 National Transportation Act, which itself had roots in a 1967 predecessor, and the venerable Railway Act into one unified law. At the same time the new Canada Transportation Act took steps to reduce or eliminate subsidies for transport, costs that were borne by all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second act to be amended by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> is the Railway Safety Act. The act allows Transport Canada to review and upgrade the regulations, the standards and rules for rail safety oversight. It is precautionary legislation and should be the home of our attempts to improve the safety for the millions and millions of children and pedestrians, motorists, travellers and workers who come into contact with trains every day across our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough statutory review of the Canada Transportation Act was completed again by our government in 2001 and it was very important in forming Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> by way of its earlier incarnations. The bill we debate today is the third attempt to legislate following that review.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin our consideration with provisions that are similar in principle to the most recent version that we presented, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to review some of the provisions of this bill beginning with those concerning noise caused by railway operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding, like a good number of Canadian communities, is home to railway activities and I am fully aware of the disputes arising between residents of the communities and the railway companies because of noise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that proposed amendments to the Canada Transportation Act empower the Canadian Transportation Agency to deal with noise complaints and, if necessary, to order railway companies to make changes in order to reduce unreasonable noise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important matter, one aspect of the problem that my colleagues and I look forward to examining in greater detail.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para55150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on the subject of rail, proposed amendments in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> involve the expansion of the provisions on railway line transfers and discontinuances to cover rail corridors, such as spurs and sidings, in urban areas that could be used for urban transit purposes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members may know, I have long been a strong proponent and advocate of public urban transit. In fact , right here in the city of Ottawa I was pleased to help deliver $200 million of federal funding to expand our own O-Train.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps that we can take to improve public transit and advance the use of rail in Canadian cities are worthwhile undertakings. Giving a right of refusal for urban transit authorities to purchase rail that would otherwise be abandoned is very good public policy. That is why two previous Liberal ministers of transport have tried to pass the legislation through the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related subject, I am also frustrated with the government's ill-informed tax break on public transit passes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many riders, as we know, do not have monthly or yearly passes to use public transit. In fact, many users forgo passes for the flexibility of tickets. The most needy riders simply do not have the wherewithal to buy an annual pass. Studies that were shown to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> before he took his decision to make transit passes tax deductible, and brought to his attention by his own officials, demonstrated that tax deductible transit passes did not encourage increasing ridership and did not have the corollary intended effect of substantial greenhouse gas reductions that the government purported they should have. The cost per tonne of GHG reduction through these transit passes is exorbitantly high. This again speaks to the pattern of the government of never letting the evidence get in the way of governing by tax credit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives should have spent the budget money on better infrastructure and lower rates for all users.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, getting back to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>, if these amendments mean more urban rail, then I say that we should take a look.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has asserted that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> would bring clarity in airfare advertising by giving the Canadian Transportation Agency the authority to regulate advertised pricing of airfares. The goal, of course, is to indicate all fees, all charges and all taxes collected by the airline on behalf of a government body or an airport authority. It must also disclose the price of an airline ticket for both domestic and international travel.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these provisions, which are also inherited from our Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, ultimately help everyday Canadians to more readily understand and determine the total cost of a travelling ticket and the terms and conditions that apply to its purchase, then I will welcome them on behalf of my constituents who, as consumers, face a barrage of misleading information, often from the travel sector.</div>

We need to give our government the tools to protect us in the event of threats to Canadian life that are meticulously planned and malicious. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I recognize that this provision sets off alarm bells for many actors in Canadian society, not least because it would allow the minister to set administrative monetary penalties for individuals or companies that do not supply data that the minister might request.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated earlier, the onus is on the minister to justify this expansion of his powers to all Canadians. I look forward to the explanations from the minister about the import of certain other provisions as well. Let me briefly outline some of them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> would reduce the number of members of the Canadian Transportation Agency from seven to five. We just heard the minister state that this would lead to cost savings. I would be looking for the numbers. If we move from seven part time members to five full time members now resident in the Ottawa area, I would like to see the numbers to substantiate this claim that it will amount to cost savings while at the same time the mandate of the Canadian Transportation Agency is being seriously expanded.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposal was to streamline the agency in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> and it could have been law by now. The minister will have to explain to Canadians why fewer members can do the job better than the seven who are currently endorsed, while the mandate of the agency is being expanded in the act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> would allow Transport Canada to review mergers and acquisitions in all federal transportation sectors, not just airlines as our Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> planned in the last Parliament. This is a very large discretionary power, a power that is being invested in the minister and in the government. I imagine that the government would say that it is necessary to protect the national interest. However, it is a provision with economic consequences. I would ask the minister to outline his rationale for this incursion, for this disturbance, for this fettering of the market. It is unusual to hear a Conservative government speak of fettering the marketplace, particularly as it expands into the precious area of mergers and acquisitions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> would require companies to set a process for complaints against their railway police constables under the Railway Safety Act.

It refers to the creation of an internal complaints process rather than a government process or board of some sort. Is an internal process up to the job? The minister has not addressed the question at all. By demanding that records be kept it should permit us to retrace the facts and timeline of any complaints.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area that has attracted public attention and will inevitably require the government's thorough explanation is the elimination of the post of Air Travel Complaints Commissioner.

The minister spoke moments ago about cost savings and about a net saving of $2 per tonne of material shipped. No evidence has been presented to the House and I see no evidence at committee. I am looking forward to hearing why it is the government has reneged and why farmers continue to pay more than is necessary to ship their product. </div>

    </p><a name="Para55178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member were to check that out he would find that the cabinet table, consisting of Liberals and so on, had signed off on that initiative but the Privy Council Office had not taken that route. Therefore, there was nothing to honour that this government was forced into.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took a look at a number of different things that were pertinent to the future of rail transportation, especially in my area on the prairies. Even good Liberals, such as Red Williams and his group, Agrivision, out in western Canada have done an exceptionally good study on the use of container cars as opposed to these bulk cars and saying that is the future and that hopper cars will become obsolete in the very near future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wheat Board has continued to study that initiative and it is saying the same thing. It says that there is a tremendous opportunity for the back haul on a lot of these container cars coming in, especially from the Pacific Rim, China, Japan and so on, and we can be shipping our product back in that, a more specialized way of doing it when we get into the niche and innovative market that is the future for a lot of western Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering why he would hang us with that 10 year old program that was out of date at that time? Why does he not allow us to move into the future, which containers will give us?</div>

    </p><a name="Para55183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about a deal that was negotiated over many years. The member himself, in the preamble to his question, made it very clear when he said that cabinet had supported the measure but that the Privy Council Office was opposed. In my understanding of the Constitution and the workings of the federal government, it is not for the PCO to tell cabinet what to do. It is for the cabinet to instruct PCO what to do. The Privy Council Office, as the department of the Prime Minister of Canada, is in no position to overturn a cabinet decision of this kind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the minister has to come clean for us on this. The western farmers who have contacted me and many of my colleagues in our party are deeply disturbed by what they are seeing. They are asking how it is that they will save $2 a tonne, as the minister asserted only moments ago, by keeping 12,100 rail cars in the government's ownership. This again I find a little bit rich because the government, presumably, is a Conservative one. It speaks often about unfettering the marketplace. I am wondering how it is that keeping 12,100 cars in the hands of the federal government is not fettering the marketplace.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is perfectly right. He misunderstood what I said. At no time did I say that the railway subsidies in Canada should cease.

Whether it is the gun registry, the appointment of judges process or other issues, apparently evidence does not always rank as highly as it might for a government when it comes to making informed choices for Canadian citizens. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I will take it to the committee on Thursday. The committee will be examining questions for the future. This is a very important point that ought to be raised and I commit to doing so.</div>

Bill C-26 was introduced on February 25, 2003, and Bill C-44 on March 24, 2005. The Conservative government decided not to use the entire content of all these bills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister did in fact say that what is being introduced today is essentially identical to what has been introduced before. However, he failed to say that the bills that were introduced by previous governments and received the support of the Bloc Québécois were much more consistent, especially in matters relating to the railway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, among others, had the advantage of resolving the VIA Rail situation. Everyone knows why the Conservative Party decided to split Bill C-44 and not present the same bill: because it was always annoyed with the part of the bill affecting VIA Rail. It was always against allowing VIA Rail to develop so that we could finally have a rail line between Montreal and Windsor, between Quebec City and Montreal, and even between Montreal and Boston. To the Conservative Party, developing transportation does not mean the railway. My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79023,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79023&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brome—Missisquoi</A> is absolutely right: this is more than a refusal to subsidize; they do not want to allow VIA Rail to be a corporate entity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> would have enabled VIA Rail to become an entity capable of taking charge of its own rail development and of arranging its own borrowing. That did not suit the Conservative Party. We have to look at the context. Today, it is a good thing that we are presented with a bill on railway transportation, but we have already gone beyond Bill C-44. Indeed, we are now involved in some major amendments. However, we have put aside the question of VIA Rail and railway development in such major corridors as Quebec City and Montreal, Montreal and Windsor, and even Montreal and Boston. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been very difficult for us to understand that position. It is important that Quebeckers understand the values that the Conservative party is defending. They are values that are completely different from the values that we proclaim. Clearly, rail transport is more environmentally friendly. We should be tabling bills that recognize that fact and allow rail transportation to develop to its full potential. The Conservative party refuses to do this, as I have explained, in the Montreal to Windsor corridor, between Quebec City and Montréal, and between Montreal and Boston. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, they developed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>, based on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, which had been introduced by the previous governments, by the Liberals, and out of which they retained one part dealing with railways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have time to talk about the entire bill, because it also deals with air transport. I will concentrate on several important matters. If I had the unanimous consent of the House to use the entire afternoon, I would be pleased to discuss it all. However, I will not even make that request because I would be surprised if my colleagues were to give consent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are some important points concerning railway transportation. I will go directly to one issue that in many Quebec ridings has always been an environmental concern, that is, noise pollution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollution cannot always be felt or touched. However, it can be heard. Thanks to new technology, we have replaced humans with mechanical devices and machinery. When trains are being assembled in the marshalling yards, the shunting of cars makes a devilish noise. Many communities have spoken out against these operating companies. The echo has reached as far as the federal government. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310">(1310)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite a few examples. Hochelaga has the Moreau yard; Brome—Missisquoi has the Farnham yard; and Jeanne-Le Ber and Lévis—Bellechasse also have yards. They all have problems linked to noise pollution caused by the work carried out in a marshalling yard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might all think that new technology allows everything to be done quietly, as circumstances evolve, and that noise pollution is now at the safest possible levels. On the contrary, decreased manual handling actually means mechanical switching that is less effective and very noisy. Neighbouring communities have every reason to complain. Thus, such complaints led to the change proposed in this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the House that the Bloc Québécois will support this bill, especially those sections, which I will summarize here, that address noise pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would have liked to see even stricter provisions, but we are willing to give this system a chance, a system that involves mediation, cooperation and, finally, decisions taken by the Canadian Transportation Agency. Earlier, I asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A> this question. Although the municipal level has tried to resolve the issue of noise pollution with decibel standards, as custom dictates, we face a simple problem: federal laws override all other laws, including provincial and municipal. In other words, even if cities want to adopt regulations regarding decibels or noise pollution, the entire federal sector does not have to comply with municipal standards. We should therefore support the content of the bill as tabled today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would reiterate to all Quebeckers who endure the problems caused by these yards: we accept this approach to resolving the problem. This is evolution, after all, and the reason for it is understandable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 reads as follows:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the obligations “when constructing or operating a railway”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the standards do not set out a specific limit on decibel levels. Rather, this bill says that you are not allowed to operate unreasonably or to create unreasonable noise pollution. We are setting a standard based on what is unreasonable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What impact would that have? It would be an improvement over the status quo, which does not touch on this. Any complaints would be addressed as follows:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para55232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the idea is to promote cooperative measures: sitting all the parties down together and finding the best way to solve the problem. Before establishing guidelines, the agency consults the stakeholders. Nothing would be imposed; instead, there would be discussions and negotiations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that in certain locations, including the Moreau yard in Hochelaga, despite ten years of negotiations between citizens' committees and the company that operates the yard, they still have not managed to reach an agreement on possible measures to please the majority. We would like to see that happen, but the only thing now permitted by law is direct intervention by the agency. It can then act once a complaint is received. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 95.3, the agency:</div>
    </p><a name="Para55235"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small> on receipt of a complaint, may order a railway company to undertake any changes in its railway construction or operation that the Agency considers reasonable in order to prevent unreasonable noise.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para55236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time a bill has stipulated that the agency can oblige an operator to resolve the problem based on cooperative measures negotiated between the various stakeholders. This is more or less the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the cure-all. We are not yet at the stage of obliging companies to comply with a standard regarding a certain number of decibels. Yet my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78641,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78641&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</A>, who is our expert on the environment, knows very well that international standards regarding noise pollution now exist. It becomes dangerous to human health when certain levels are exceeded. However, we are not quite there yet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, whether the government is Conservative or Liberal, it is often said that one is the same as the other.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315">(1315)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a slight change, a slight movement in the direction of change, but we are not yet ready to adopt international standards for noise pollution. We could set the number of decibels that companies must not exceed and we could monitor the noise levels with decibel meters now that this equipment is available. However, we are not quite there yet. Nevertheless, there has been change. We are giving authority and some teeth to the Canadian Transportation Agency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it appears that the government, whether Conservative or Liberal, has not wanted to go any further, we will see what happens, and we may be able to exert some pressure in the committee. Nevertheless, it is better than what we had before. Quebeckers will always be able to rely on the Bloc Québécois to represent their interests. If they are not properly represented, we will demand legislative amendments. That represents the first, important part of this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part concerns the obligation of airline companies to publish in all media, including on the Internet, their prices for air services in Canada. This is dealt with in clause 27 of the bill. The regulations may require that an advertised price for air services include all costs to the carrier of providing the service, and that the advertisement indicate all fees, charges and taxes collected by the carrier on behalf of another person so as to enable a purchaser to readily determine the total amount to be paid for the service. This has been called for by the Bloc Québécois for a long time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families put money aside. We work 50 weeks in a year in order to pay for one or two weeks of vacation. We read the advertising and think we have enough money to cover all costs. When we make the reservation we realize that the price does not include charges and taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some time now the Bloc Québécois has been asking for this situation to be clarified, so that Quebeckers, who work hard to earn a living and pay their taxes to the governments, can treat themselves to vacations without having any surprises when they make their reservations. It is understandable for the Bloc Québécois to be in favour of the amendment proposed in this bill. So when the airlines post a price, it will be the full price. We are not demanding that hotel expenses be included, although now the all-inclusive package exists. All expenses will be included once this bill has been passed. The Bloc Québécois is pleased to give its consent to this part of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third part I would like to discuss concerns the section of clause 39 and following, respecting the abandonment of railway lines and sidings. It was time the government cleared up this situation so that, when a railway company gets rid of a railway line, it can be obliged to offer it before selling it to private enterprise or doing whatever it wants with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obligations contained in the bill seem clear: the railway line is offered first to the passenger service provider. Let us say that VIA Rail operates a passenger train and decides to stop running it. Via Rail must first offer it to the local transit authority, which can then decide to operate it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for all the rest, that is, sidings and other tracks that would not be used for passenger transportation, the provision is to offer them to the province, then the transit authority and finally the cities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that the Union des municipalités du Québec has already asked to appear before the committee. In committee we will see what the cities think. We will see whether it is still necessary to make an offer to the transit authority before offering it to the cities. There is still this dilemma, given that the operating budgets of the transit authorities often come in large part from users. Often the transit authorities have grants to purchase equipment, but operations are often subsidized by cities. We will see what the municipal unions ask for in this file. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For us it seems very important that we have a policy respecting the transfer of railway lines, that is, of those that are or will be dismantled. It seems important too that we can offer them and use them appropriately, especially for the transportation of passengers. The future in transportation lies in maritime and rail transportation, more ecological ways of transporting freight and people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Bloc Québécois is still defending the Kyoto objectives, we seem to be increasingly isolated in this House. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320">(1320)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservative Party wants to have its own green program, its own green plan. It seems to be more in agreement with the positions taken by the United States and other countries that are not abiding by the Kyoto protocol, rather than the large majority of countries that have signed the protocol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, in our view, railway transportation is a very worthwhile and important way of looking at development. That is why we could never stress enough the importance of VIA Rail’s mission. I will repeat what I said at the very beginning. Sometimes, it is important to state the message that one wants to convey more than once. In Bills <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',719988,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=719988&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A>, there was an entire part dealing with VIA Rail, which enabled it to develop and to adopt a plan that would, in particular, have enabled Quebec to open itself up in terms of the railway. Quebec could then have turned its gaze to the rest of the world, for example to Boston, the United States and Ontario. The Conservative Party has decided to settle the VIA Rail issue. We had been told that one day, perhaps, we might come back to it. I think that what is happening here is that the entire development of VIA Rail is being buried, but that is the choice made by the Conservative Party and it is not adopted by the Bloc Québécois. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of this bill is to solve the various safety-related problems involved in transportation. The minister told us earlier that this bill has set us on the green path. I have taken a few minutes to explain that what eliminating VIA Rail actually did was throw a big lead weight, a big rock, into the canoe the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A>is paddling toward a green development plan using rail transportation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, I sensed that the minister was quite uncomfortable when he was asked a question about transportation safety. The title of this bill is, in fact, <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts</A>. We might then think that this bill is going to solve safety problems. Far from it. There is not one cent for safety. Thanks to what the <i>Journal de Montréal </i>has revealed concerning Dorval airport, we have seen how the minister, the government and Transport Canada manage safety. Plainly Canada is just putting out fires.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money was put into resolving the passenger problem because at one point passengers had taken control of planes. We also experienced the events of September 11. Then the government decided to focus on passenger safety. However, we can make ourselves at home in the rest of the terminal. As we saw in the <i>Journal de Montréal </i>report, nothing has changed. The more things change, the more they stay the same. There is no culture of safety in Canada. We can forget that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a culture of safety is to ensure at all times, when there is an objective, that absolutely nothing is forgotten and that we are capable of analyzing every plan. That is not what Canada does. Canada has a piecemeal approach. When something happens then we try to address it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close on this idea of the culture of safety that Canada is lacking. They preferred putting our money in provincial jurisdictions. They preferred engaging in regional development, which is a responsibility of the Government of Quebec, instead of taking care of security at the borders. The problem is that the Government of Canada was unable to secure funding for its own mandates. There is no culture of safety. That is what the <i>Journal de Montréal</i> showed in Dorval. And it was just a year later when the same thing happened at Toronto's Pearson airport.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Conservative Party be able to resolve the security problems? Forget about it. It has neither the will nor the means. It wants yet again to interfere in the provinces' responsibilities and it chooses to spend outside its own jurisdiction. This just further proves that the Canadian government does not defend the interests of Quebeckers, since it is unable to take care of its own security.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be sufficient resources? We can always discuss this. I think that the real question is whether we will have the will to solve the problem. We are prepared to give the new system a chance and have two fewer members of the Canadian Transportation Agency. If we do not have the will to solve the problems and impose standards that prohibit noise pollution on operators, we will not accomplish much. I think we should sit down and discuss this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Canadian Transportation Agency have to hire additional personnel because it is centred in Ottawa? Time will tell.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this bill becomes law, the Canadian Transportation Agency will receive complaints from Quebec about at least five marshalling yards, if not more. This will happen very quickly, because this position is known. Citizens' committees have been formed and they will receive complaints very quickly. If they are unable to handle the demand, we will know in short order. I hope that what my colleague mentioned will not happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, my fear is that there is no will to solve the problem and that officials will try to sit down and work out mitigation and cooperation measures and try to find a solution without requiring the operators to solve the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is my fear right now. As for the rest, we are prepared to give it a chance, but certainly the members will be supported by inspectors.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she is right that there is a safety problem, especially on the railways. Ninety per cent of railway accidents take place on a curve or coming out of a curve. All the reports from Transport Canada state that it happened on a curve. Yet, these curves are not inspected. There is no systematic inspection of curves. The companies state that there was an accident on a curve. Clearly, the problem is that the rail lines were not in good condition; that there had been no preventive maintenance and they had not taken the necessary steps. All accidents happen on curves. Transport Canada knows that. The reports are available and we do nothing. A very effective remedy is needed for a very serious problem that is now plaguing us, the fact that railway lines are not being maintained, especially by the rail industry. We know that 90 per cent of accidents take place on curves and we say that the next one will be on a curve. That is the problem we are living with. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no decibel level standards.

If ever the industry fails to abide by the standards, and if the Canadian Transportation Agency is too indulgent, we will have to adopt international standards. As for noise pollution, we know the international decibel level limits. We could include a decibel level limit in the bill, but we have not yet reached that stage.</div>

There are mountains of blue barrels along the railway, mountains of pieces of wood that were used to hold the rails. The area all along the railway going to Vancouver is terrible. It is littered with all sorts of debris, and I am not the only one who noticed.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer to the first question is no. From an environmental standpoint, and this is the tragedy, everything she mentioned—the products and pieces of wood—are all contaminated. What we need to understand, and I said so from the outset, is that everything that is federal, including the railway corridor, is not subject to provincial and municipal legislation. Theoretically, therefore, Environment Canada is supposed to deal with this problem, but the department closes its eyes. Why? Because it would cost too much to clean up. So my colleague is right. It is Canada’s image that suffers the consequences of this government’s decision not to comply with its own legislation on its own lands. That is the tragedy. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to the second part of her question about charges on board aircraft, I do not think that we have got that far yet. Everything that is on the outside before the aircraft is boarded will be included in the advertising, but everything that is inside, the pillows and other amenities, is something else. We have not got that far yet. The hon. member is quite right that the government does not comply with its own regulations. </div>

First, I can assure the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel that this government does stand up for the people of Quebec. We listen to the people of Quebec and this is an example that we listen and will make changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, these are common issues across Canada. I had the opportunity to put some 3,000 kilometres on rental cars this summer travelling around the lower mainland of British Columbia and Alberta. I visited many of the members of Parliament from British Columbia, for instance, the members for South Surrey—White Rock—Cloverdale, Kelowna—Lake Country and Abbotsford. All of these members had issues that were very similar to the issues that the member raised. I can assure him that our caucus as well as many other members of other caucuses come to me with these issues and we will act on them for the betterment of the people of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the driving reasons for the introduction of this bill is that this government sees and believes that a modern, effective transportation system is integral to the well-being of Canada's economy. A proper and well planned out transportation initiative across the country, a hub system, as well as a system that has adequate highways and rail will be only good for the people of Canada and we understand that. It contributes to the air industry in Canada that is competitive as well as continental and global markets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's air industry is a vibrant and dynamic one, as the member knows. It contributes to a prosperous and innovative economy which benefits all Canadians. The air industry in Canada helps drive economic development in all sectors of our society. The Conservative government and the Prime Minister is committed to promoting competition in the air transportation sector because this increases consumer choice to the travelling public and provides better service and pricing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is also committed to regulating only where deemed necessary and advantageous to the Canadian public. The objectives of the proposed air transportation amendments meet this government's commitments to Canadians. This bill provides for technical and housekeeping amendments necessary to modernize the act since it was last amended in 1996. As all members of the House know, the transportation industry is integral to Canada's economy. It is an ever changing environment and we need to stay as good stewards on that, making changes as necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will also provide a clear role in how the Canadian Transportation Agency will continue to exercise its functions in the future, which is also very important. The proposed legislation offers additional consumer protection to assist Canadian travellers as they continue to make choices respecting travel in Canada and abroad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak to the proposed amendments that would enhance the protection of Canadian consumers. Although there were concerns regarding some potential abuses that may have taken place when Air Canada acquired Canadian Airlines in 2000 due to the resulting market dominance of Air Canada, this is no longer the case. In fact, we have seen dynamic changes in the Canadian domestic industry over the last few years, as most Canadians recognize.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments would actually reflect the reality of today's Canadian air industry by returning the agency to its well established regulatory and complaints based function and structure which was in place prior to 2000. The government is committed to regulating only where necessary and where the Canadian public would be best served.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am proud to say that Canada has a world class air system and boasts several well established airlines providing international, national, regional and charter airline services. Airlines such as Air Canada, WestJet, CanJet, First Air, Air North, Air Transat, Air Mikisew, which is actually located in my constituency of Fort McMurray—Athabasca, and many others. All of these companies are providing increased competition and consumer choice in all areas of the country and indeed on the global stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to recognize that new carriers are seeking to enter the Canadian air industry because it is so healthy. These industry carriers propose to offer Canadian consumers additional choice in air travel. This government listens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments would continue to allow our new and expanding airlines to make their decisions based on private sector commercial realities free of unnecessary legislation that is not providing any benefit to Canadians. The government is committed to letting Canadian air carriers develop and grow based on the merits of the business choices they make.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office of the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner was created in 2000 to review complaints and attempt to resolve the issues informally on behalf of air travellers. The commissioner served as a useful tool during this transition period only to assist consumers with their complaints following Air Canada's merger with Canadian Airlines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian air transportation market has dramatically changed even since then. Today the complaints received by the airline agency are distributed more proportionately across Canada's air carriers, including even low cost carriers. Competition in the marketplace is one of the most effective mechanisms to ensure service quality. The government encourages competition for the betterment of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints now increasingly relate to matters that fall within the ongoing jurisdiction and mandate of the agency itself. The government recognizes the importance of an ongoing informal complaints process to get results for Canadians. The proposed amendments would therefore make transparent and permanent, like this government, the air travel complaints function. The informal complaints resolution function launched so effectively by the commissioner would be made permanent and would be integrated into the regular operations of the agency. This would be supplemented by the agency's ongoing regulatory responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the fall of 2004, the agency has demonstrated its continued effectiveness in its ability to handle consumer complaints. Canadians have received results, the same as this government is dedicated to doing. It has consolidated its ongoing informal processes in an air travel complaints program. With this step and the legislative measures proposed, the Canadian public can be reassured that the agency will continue to respond to travellers' complaints in an informal manner and consistent with its ongoing mandate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wishes to ensure that Canadian consumers are offered clear choices in air travel. Where necessary, the government will take on the responsibility of protecting consumers in exercising these choices. The government is aware of consumers' concerns that airfare advertising be clear, transparent and not misleading. Consumers have told us that they want to be able to compare different airline advertised pricing and to know up front how much they will pay for these air services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian carriers have heard the message. Canadian airlines have taken important steps to respond to consumer demands even so far. However, some consumers remain concerned that price advertisements prepared by air carriers, either in the newspaper or on the Internet or other methods, do not always contain complete or clear price information. This government is listening to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have implemented policies, legislation or voluntary mechanisms with the cooperation of the airline industries in order that consumers have sufficient pricing information regarding air travel ads that display their prices. Some provinces such as Quebec and Ontario require transparent advertising of air travel by travel agents and other provincially regulated operators. Canadian consumers have told us that they want a similar level of transparency for advertising by airlines across Canada, and the government intends to do that with the cooperation, of course, of the other parties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As already noted, Canadian airlines are moving toward improving advertising transparency with the encouragement of the government. These decisions are prompted by past year demands and respond to other dynamic changes in the industry. The government recognizes that market forces will maintain the pressure on air carriers to take further steps to ensure clear and transparent advertising.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for this reason that the proposed amendments provide the minister with the ability to authorize the development of regulations for transparency in airfare advertising in all media. These regulations, should they become necessary only, would be enforced by the agency. This would ensure that these standards are consistently applied across the industry by all domestic and foreign carriers and their agents for flights operating within or originating within Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions clearly signal the government's expectations in this regard and put the industry on notice, that notice being to further modify their practices voluntarily as required by Canadian consumers or be regulated by the government.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350">(1350)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, consumers are entitled to know the terms and conditions of the air service before they book a flight. Consumers want that and this government is responding. This is consistent with the government's commitment to ensure the transparency of information to allow consumers to make informed travel choices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments would require all commercial air operators, both domestic and foreign carriers, operating air services in Canada to promptly display their terms of carriage. That will be necessary at their places of business and on any Internet site, or from wherever else they sell these air services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposed amendments would ensure that Canadian consumers are adequately informed of their rights and the obligations of the air carrier for flights offered as they make choices regarding their travel arrangements. It gives them choices because they know what decisions they need to make.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the proposed amendments reflect the Government of Canada's commitment to a liberalized and competitive air transportation system for the betterment of Canadians wanting to make choices, a system that balances the need to update statutory and regulatory instruments, where necessary, to respond to developments in the air industry marketplace, with the responsibility as well to ensure that consumers, as I have said a few times, are offered choices and options consistent with a fully deregulated market so they know what they are going to buy before they buy it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We firmly believe that these changes to the Canada Transportation Act are warranted, that they will give the Canadian Transportation Agency the ability to continue to serve the travelling Canadian public well, and will ensure that Canada continues to have a viable and competitive air service industry in the many years to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government listens to Canadians and will act on their priorities.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on the question of transparency and openness. For most Canadians, if they had a problem with the airlines and the airline system previously, they would go to the position then filled by Mr. Bruce Hood as was created in 2000, the air travel complaints commissioner. I understand that position is being folded into the mandate of the Canadian Transportation Agency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put to the parliamentary secretary and to the government a couple of comments made by some important actors around that move. Bruce Hood himself, the former commissioner, in May of this year expressed his concern that the proposed elimination of the position would make it increasingly difficult for Canadians to resolve problems with airlines. Furthermore, a Canadian Transportation Agency spokesperson went on to say that these changes would reduce the Canadian Transportation Agency's role in dealing with airline complaints on a case by case basis as opposed to being able to tackle larger ongoing problems with airline service or quality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the parliamentary secretary help illuminate and explain for Canadians when the average citizen may have a problem with an airline and is seeking transparency, is seeking recourse, just how Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> in transferring this commissioner's office to the CTA is going to ensure that the same kind of function--</div>

I do not know if it has anything to do with the revisions or the hearings leading up to this comprehensive bill which amends rail and air transportation, if any of that analysis dealt with the do not fly list, but it is crazy that a Canadian member of Parliament cannot get a boarding pass on a domestic flight within his own country because his name is on an American do not fly list.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last comment was on railroads and some people may wonder why. The Yukon Territory has a historic railway, the White Pass and Yukon Railroad, which was built during the gold rush. It is one of the engineering wonders of the world. There is also the potential of joining the Alaska Railroad, one of the few successful railways in North America, through the Yukon, to the B.C. rail system which ends almost at the Yukon border. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly as a northerner myself, I can assure the member that I do have places in my particular constituency, like Fort Chipewyan, that are inaccessible by any way except air, or snow in the wintertime of course.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the conference, the Prime Minister indicated that he was not attending because it had become “too political”.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort Macleod was selected out of 29 other towns and cities in Alberta to become the home of the new Alberta Police and Peace Officer Training Centre.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort Macleod has a long and proud history of policing, going back to its early days when the North West Mounted Police set up barracks there in 1874. This new training centre will revitalize the community of Fort Macleod and provide Alberta's police and peace officers with the training they need to serve and protect our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55377"></a><p>

The NDP finds that there are some aspects of this bill that are worthy of consideration. I will address the aspects that Canadians might consider less interesting a little later. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle set out in this bill is that this is a government that listens. However, given the vote that has just taken place and the pressure that was brought to bear in all the proceedings surrounding the softwood lumber agreement, I am not convinced of this. In this corner of the House, we are in fact not convinced that this government is capable of listening to people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An agreement has been made on softwood lumber that is in almost all respects bad for the Canadian softwood lumber industry. Nonetheless, and notwithstanding all the consultations that were held this summer at the Standing Committee on International Trade, it is clear that the government has not listened to people’s concerns and worries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the question of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>, the same problems arise again, the same questions that arose in relation to transportation. For some months now, we have seen that the government is trying to weaken the regulations governing transportation, whether in relation to railways, aviation or marine transport. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what concerns the NDP. What we have is a government that does not listen and that does things backwards. We saw this when it came to the softwood lumber agreement. In fact, we have just had the first of several votes that will take place in the next few weeks. The Senate will then of course have to consider these questions. We are seeing the same thing in relation to transportation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We therefore have concerns. Even though we are supporting Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> at second reading, we shall see, in committee, whether the government is capable of listening or whether, after only seven months in power, it is leading us back into the same situation as we had under the former Liberal government: no listening, no genuine consultation, no ability to understand its mistakes. Even though we are supporting the bill now, we are giving notice that our support is conditional on the improvements that we hope will be made to this bill at the next stage. </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para55598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak more specifically about some of the aspects of this bill that we support and some of the aspects of the bill that we are concerned about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start with the issue of railway noise complaints. The legislation provides a mechanism, finally, for individuals and communities to make complaints about railway noise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from the community of Burnaby—New Westminster. There are railway yards around the Westminster Quay area of downtown New Westminster. Many constituents have approached me, including Brian Allen and others, to raise very serious and very legitimate concerns about railway noise in their neighbourhood. They have tried to deal directly with the railways, as have I as their member of parliament, but there has not been a formal, structured mechanism in place to deal with the railway noise complaints. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urban areas this is a matter of grave concern, when people cannot get the sleep they need. Families are working harder and harder in Canada now for less and less. Most Canadian families have seen their real income decline over the last 15 years and they have seen the hours of work per week increase. Now it is even more important in an urban setting that our constituents from coast to coast get the opportunity to have legitimate sleep when they need it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> has a section that deals with railway noise complaints. It provides a mechanism for citizens who live in the Westminster Quay area or in South Burnaby who are near railway yards, particularly with railway shunting back and forth. They and their members of parliament will have a mechanism to try to resolve those noise complaints. This is welcomed and is one of the most positive aspects of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second element deals with mergers and acquisitions and provides for a public interest review process. This is important as well. We need to have much more public consultation, particularly when we talk about the transportation industry. Canada is a vast land, the world's largest democracy. We are linked together by our transportation modes. If there is any area of interest that unites Canadians from coast to coast to coast, it is in maintaining the safest and best possible transportation facilities in all areas of transport.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important step forward to have the protection of a valid review process and public consultations when there are mergers or acquisitions in the transportation industry. That is also an element which we support, although in committee we will perhaps be looking at tightening what is currently stated in the legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important component is a framework for passenger rail services. I come from an area which is served through TransLink by the West Coast Express. The West Coast Express is a very well run commuter railway operation that runs from Mission through to Vancouver. However, the West Coast Express has had some real difficulty having the kind of arrangement with the rail operators that allows access to the rail lines that it needs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> provides a better framework for the kind of negotiations that sometimes take place between commuter rail services in our larger cities and the rail operators themselves. This is important. It is a benefit and an improvement. We would like to see this go further. We need that mechanism to allow the commuter rail services to negotiate directly with the rail lines, but we have to be aware that the public good has to be served as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cases where rail lines will be discontinued. We have to make sure that there is a public good, a public benefit, for example, urban bicycle paths. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545">(1545)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for Victoria, has raised the issue of ensuring that further to providing access to commuter rail when we are talking about discontinued rail lines, there should also be access to the public in general as another alternative through various facilities, bicycle paths or rail paths themselves. The member for Victoria has been effective in articulating this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to see something in the legislation to advance that right, that if the rail line is not being used for rail purposes, not being used for commuter rail, there are other alternatives for the public good that must come first. The improved framework is a good first step for that, and another element why at this stage, in any event, we will be looking at supporting the legislation so it moves forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the advantages, the bill itself speaks to greater transparency in advertising airfares. This is an important component. Consumers need to be aware of how much they are paying for tickets. We do not want to see hidden costs. Greater transparency undoubtedly would be an advantage. However, I say that this is an advantage if we are looking at the type of regulation that provides greater transparency. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate aspect, something that the transport committee will have to look at in much more detail, is the idea of integrating the complaints function of the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner into the Canadian Transportation Agency. I am not convinced that this provides for the transparency of which the government is speaking. I have some concerns. At committee we will be expressing those concerns, bringing the appropriate witnesses forward to examine whether that is the best mechanism, whether expanding the office of the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner, expanding those powers or providing for other methods of dealing with the same transparency better serves the travelling public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is there. We in all four corners of the House want to see transparency on airfares so that members of the public know what they are paying when it is being advertised that there are no hidden fees. I should add that hidden fees include the fees that Canadian passengers are paying on airlines for things like headsets, to eat, to get a glass of water, to get a pillow or a blanket. Increasingly there are fees for the simple fact of travelling on that transport and those are fees that need to be taken into consideration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on a flight from Quebec City to Vancouver, back to my riding of Burnaby—New Westminster. One gentleman joked that he was being asked to pay for his pillow and blanket and soon passengers would be asked to bring their own chairs. This is a good point. The situation now is that members of the travelling public are being asked to pay fees that they should not have to pay once they have purchased their tickets. They should not have to pay for a pillow or a blanket. They should not have to pay to get some chips or some water. They should not have to pay these small costs. If the air transporters want the consumers to pay those fees, they have to be front and centre.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can imagine that with completely transparent advertising it would be very difficult for an airline to say that passengers will have to pay $2 for this, $3 for that and $5 for something else. Those hidden fees would be forced away by having that transparency because it would not be to the competitive advantage of the airline to gouge members of the travelling public once they were on board.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater transparency in advertising is a component that we support. We do question whether the best method is through the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner through the Canadian Transportation Agency. Hopefully this will be sorted out during the committee process. We look forward to participating in that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have concerns about other areas. We will raise questions and possibly amendments as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grain revenue cap adjustment, we have concerns about how that might be dealt with. As I expressed at the beginning, we have concerns about the government's ability to listen. Certainly with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board and supply management there have been major concerns about how the government deals with the preoccupations and concerns of rural Canada. Though in principle having that adjustment is important to us, we want to see in very strict details how that would work in practice and whether there would be honest public consultation around it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the question around advertising airfares and the air complaints function. Again the same question is raised, whether the best mechanism for air complaints is through the Canadian Transportation Agency and the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner. It is something that will come out through the committee hearing process in which we will be very pleased to participate.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in terms of the exact details of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>, the details that we have concerns about are around the national transportation policy statement, which was very specific on the private sector's contribution to transport policy and mum on the whole impact and the importance of the public sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this corner of the House are not caught up in the ideology, that it has to be the private sector. There are many things the private sector cannot do as well as an efficiently run, effective public sector. That is why over a 20 year period, the best financial managers in Canada were NDP administrations. Despite the flop of the Bob Rae government in Ontario, which was due a lack of leadership, when we take the actual fiscal period returns of all the NDP administrations from 1981 to 2001, we see that Liberal governments across the country were in deficit 85% of the time. The Conservative governments over that period of time were in deficit 66% of the time. They did not balance the books. NDP administrations, most of the time, balanced the books.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the best track record in financial administration and we are proud of that, but we also believe in a very prudently run, effective public sector. Our concern around the national transportation policy statement is that it does not reflect the importance of the public sector working with the private sector to ensure that we have the kind of safe, effective and accessible transportation system that should exist for Canadians from coast to coast to coast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no country on this planet is transportation as important as it is in Canada. We are a vast land. We are the largest democracy. Throughout that vast land, transportation infrastructure is of primary importance. We profoundly believe that we need a national transportation policy statement that actually reflects the importance of the private and public sectors working together and that there has to be an effective public sector to ensure that we do get the kind of effective transportation infrastructure that we need to have. That is something we will be looking at as well in committee and it is something about which we are concerned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a few words about the general direction. I talked about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> and I have talked about some of the elements we support, some of the elements to which we will be looking at providing changes and improvements. Our role in this Parliament is to ensure that we get the best possible policy. New Democrats are not ashamed to work very hard to ensure that we get the best policy process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>, we have concerns over the general transportation thrust of the government. I will raise some concerns that we have raised in the House and that we continue to raise. To date we have not received the response that we believe a prudent and responsible government should give.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the issue of railway safety. Because of self-managed railway systems and a cutting back of that important public sector role to watch over our transportation sector and ensure that it is as safe as possible, what we have seen is railway accidents are on the rise. In 2005 we saw the highest number of railway accidents in nearly a decade, much higher than the 10 year rolling average that existed before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen an increase in railway accidents. We have seen, tragically, deaths in the Fraser Canyon this summer. We have seen environmental damage such as the Cheakamus Lake in the Squamish Estuary and Lake Wabamun in Alberta. We have seen consistently a greater number of railway accidents over the last few years. This is a matter of some concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have called for an inquiry. The government has not responded. We have called for the tightening of railway regulations and we have seen very little response and activity from the government. That is a matter of very real concern because people's lives are at stake. The well-being of communities is at stake when we see the kind of environmental damage, when we see the lives lost most recently.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555">(1555)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a tragedy and we need to deal with it. We will be repeating the call for a public inquiry because we do not believe the existing lack of regulations in rail transport is to the public advantage. Obviously, if the number of accidents are on the rise, the number of fatalities are on the rise and environmental damage is on the rise, there is a problem. A responsible government deals with the issue. We certainly hope the government will deal with this issue, and quickly.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para55629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, there is the entire question of regulating air transportation. We talked about precisely that last June at the Standing Committee on Transport. We talked about the government’s plan, or objective, of reducing the number of flight attendants on Canadian aircraft. This is a major concern. We know very well that a large majority of Canadians are opposed to this measure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A survey was done on these questions in June 2006. Respondents were asked whether they wanted to keep the existing Canadian regulations or wanted regulations similar to the ones in the United States. And 69% of Canadians wanted to keep the existing regulations in relation to flight attendants. Only 19% of Canadians wanted regulations like the ones in the United States. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we consider all these questions, that is, whether safety standards have to be lowered so that airlines can continue to be competitive, 72% of Canadians are opposed to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of how this government seems to do things, we are indeed hoping to be able to change its perspective. We support Bill C-11, but it remains to be seen whether the government will listen to our concerns and make the changes that are called for. </div>

    </p><a name="Para55634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the current climate of rampant anti-Americanism promoted by some parties in this House, if we ask Canadians whether they want something more like Canada or more like the U.S., we will get a biased answer. With respect to the question of flight attendants, the question should be: Do we want Canadian airlines to have the same standards as every other air transport jurisdiction in the world when it comes to the number of flight attendants per passenger, or do we want Canadian airlines to simply stick with the Canadian system which is 40:1 versus 50:1?</div>
    </p><a name="Para55635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my hon. colleague understand that every other air transport jurisdiction in the world adheres to the 50:1 ratio?</div>

In Australia the standards are actually tighter than they are in Canada. It is just not true that those standards are universal. There are other jurisdictions that have safer standards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the point of what the question was. I raised the comparison of Canadian standards as opposed to American standards. Another question that was asked was whether Canadian airlines should lower their safety standards to stay internationally competitive. Seventy-two per cent of Canadians opposed that: 65% of males and 78% of females. In all the generations, regardless of the age group, Canadians disagreed. In fact, I think most Canadians would be in line with the NDP perspective on this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have competitive international airlines because we have the safest standards in the world. If Canadians know our airlines are safer than the airlines of any other country, then our Canadian airlines will have a major competitive advantage. That is something the NDP stands firmly behind. It is not a question of cutting back on safety standards to save a few cents. It is a question of ensuring we have the safest possible transportation structure, and that becomes a competitive advantage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen over the past few months some of the problems that exist already within the airline industry. The government has been talking about the potential of cutting back on safety standards, of bringing in self-managed systems similar to what we have seen in rail. We have seen the deterioration of safety standards with respect to rail. We have seen a rise in accident rates and fatality rates as well as a rise in environmental damage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would the government act like the previous government and diminish safety standards? People have raised concerns about some of the airlines flying out of Toronto like Air Canada Jazz, and concerns exist now. We should be moving forward to tighten safety standards, not loosening them. Clearly, most Canadians agree with our stand.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will know that under current section 85.1 there is the provision for the complaints commissioner, which was a temporary post established back in the year 2000 when Canadian Airlines was taken over by Air Canada. As a consequence, since the marketplace has somewhat stabilized, new clause 25 in the bill will effectively eliminate the position of the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ensure that there is an air complaints mechanism that is better than what we have now. We want to ensure that passengers, the travelling public, are better protected and have better mechanisms or better ways to follow up if they have concerns.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read for the record, because I did not get a chance during my speech, an article in the <i>Toronto Star</i> of a few months ago on these increasing violations within the air safety sector. It states:</div>

    </p><a name="Para55662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned earlier in my speech that there has been a call for a public inquiry into rail safety. What we are seeing increasingly with the larger number of rail accidents is a greater risk to Canadians, particularly in urban areas where these hazardous wastes are transported. This is of real concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last December there was a rail accident in my riding of  Burnaby—New Westminster. Fortunately, it was not hazardous waste but had it been hazardous waste going through a populated area, goodness knows what the result might have been.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55664"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a matter of great concern to us that the government seems to want to move to self-managed systems when clearly in rail transport it has not worked. It certainly would not work in air transport. It would be highly irresponsible for the government to move toward less regulations on things like hazardous waste. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55665"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will be looking at this issue. We want to ensure Canadians are protected but we also urge the government to do the right thing. It should move to a public inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can finally determine all the elements that are there in terms of rail safety, why we are seeing these increasing numbers of accidents and try to avoid what could well be a catastrophe for Canadians if the present situation continues. More rail accidents mean greater danger for Canadians.</div>

This bill would allow Canada to position its transportation system to respond to the needs and expectations of Canadians and address domestic and international pressures to remain competitive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill includes many of the good provisions found in the previous bills that would make rail and air sectors more efficient, enhance competition and environmental protection, and create stable conditions for investment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to concentrate my remarks on the rail industry, the industry that helped build this country and still links us from sea to sea to sea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although railways make a tremendous contribution to Canada's economy, the growth of the industry has also contributed to a significant increase in concerns expressed by those who live or work near railway property. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Transport Canada is responsible for regulating the safety of rail operations, including the transportation of dangerous goods, under the Railway Safety Act and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act. However, it is not currently involved in matters involving noise or fumes from railway operations, except train whistling. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government recognized the complexity of addressing these kinds of issues and obviously wants the communities and the railway companies to seek solutions through collaborative approaches or mediation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, 2000, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Canadian Transportation Agency had no jurisdiction to address complaints related to noise, vibration or fumes generated by the operations of railway companies regulated under section 95 of the Canada Transportation Act. Consequently, there are no specific provisions in the act or in any other federal legislation setting out how the agency or any other body can regulate issues concerning railway operations that are not related to railway service or safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, in May 2003 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the Railway Association of Canada signed a memorandum of understanding in order to build common approaches pertaining to the prevention and resolution of issues that arise when people live and work in close proximity to rail operations. After May 2003, the Canadian Transportation Agency implemented an improved mediation initiative but it was not enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government recognized that circumstances exist whereby mutually agreeable salutations may not always be possible. While there have been successful collaborative and mediated solutions to railways' nuisance issues in the past, these solutions are not always sufficient and may not be sufficient in the future given the important role that rail transport may continue to play in Canada's economic future. This being the case, action was required on both the legislative and collaborative fronts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following extensive public consultation, an act to amend the Canada Transportation Act was first introduced in Parliament in February 2003 that included several provisions related to railway noise and gave jurisdiction to the Canadian Transportation Agency to address noise related complaints. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',719988,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=719988&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> made it to the transport committee but died when the House prorogued in November 2003, as I previously indicated. In the next session of Parliament, the Liberal government entertained additional representations from the public, members of Parliament and other stakeholders on the proposed legislative amendment. The result was Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> tabled in March 2005 and now Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes to the act authorized the Canadian Transportation Agency to review noise complaints and, if required, order rail companies to make changes to reduce unreasonable noise when constructing or operating a railway or rail yard. The agency must be satisfied that the parties were unable to reach a voluntary settlement of this dispute on their own.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615">(1615)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents and municipal leaders in the city of Thorold in my riding of Welland have been very supportive of the changes to these sections to all incarnations of this bill. Excessive noise and emissions emanating from a rail yard in Thorold have significantly concerned citizens residing in the close proximity for many years. While prolonged noise like this could be irritating enough during the day, it is far worse to have it going throughout the night and into the early morning hours. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally visited adjacent homes and heard and saw how serious the problem is. All night idling and shunting of rail cars force some residents to go to sleep using ear plugs. The vibrations are so severe at times that household furniture shakes. Some have complained of air emissions with a soot like material landing on their cars and residences. We all can appreciate that such fine particles will move inside by numerous ways thereby constituting even more significant health concerns. Outdoor pollutants become indoor pollutants. Such particulate matter can adversely affect human health. The very young, the genetically predisposed, the elderly and those with pre-existing heart or lung disease are more susceptible to the adverse effects of this particulate matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well-documented that long term effects of noise exposure can cause a myriad of health problems. According to the World Health Organization, people may feel a variety of negative emotions when exposed to community noise and may report anger, disappointment, dissatisfaction, withdrawal, helplessness, depression, anxiety, distraction, agitation or exhaustion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise can produce a number of social and behavioural effects in residents, besides annoyance, that include changes in overt everyday behaviour patterns. Residents close windows, do not use balconies or decks, turn TV and radio volume up louder or write letters to elected officials. It can also change their social behaviour for the worse. People affected by noise may experience aggression, unfriendliness, disengagement and non-participation. There can be adverse changes in social indicators such as residential mobility, hospital admissions, drug consumption and accident rates. Finally, their mood or mental health can be affected. They may be less happy and more depressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research of the World Health Organization also states that stronger adverse reactions have been observed when noise is accompanied by vibrations. It is no wonder that these residents want to see a better way of dealing with this noise problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This community wants to deal with those noise complaints through the Canadian Transportation Agency. They believe in mediated solutions that are reached through fair and non-confrontational ways. As has been mentioned, this approach is less litigious, quicker, cheaper and a more friendly resolution but they can only stand the aggravation for so long.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried working with the rail company to come to some kind of solution, such as allowing the trains to idle in a more rural area. We inquired about technologies so that the diesel engines could be shut off rather than idling for hours on end. However, we met with no willingness to compromise and the rail company hid behind the position that a caveat about the noise had been written into the municipal subdivision agreement that is registered on the titles of the affected homes. Admittedly, a caveat on the titles of their property should constitute notice of many of the concerns expressed. However, the reality is that few are made aware of such notices and no one appreciates their full implications. It also is cold comfort to the residents who have invested their life savings in properties that they cannot enjoy to their full benefit. Caveats on titles to properties must not mitigate or be an unequivocal response to noise pollution or air pollution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rail company's defence one must concede that the changes required may affect their operating efficiencies and most certainly the cost of relocation to a more appropriate location. However, in such situations one must consider the greater good. My support is for the constituents in my riding and in communities in ridings throughout country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thorold community knew the benefits of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A> and was disappointed when it died on the order paper and can now be hopeful that it is included in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area I would like to address very briefly is the abolition of the Air Travel Complaints Commission. It does concern me. This commission was there to assist consumers with complaints on air travel. The government takes the position now that competition is an informal way of utilizing a complaints process. One can choose another airline. This might be fine for the frequent flyer travelling between major cities who can choose another airline but in many rural areas there is not the luxury of service by more than one airline. Retention of the Air Travel Complaints Commission is most important to service these communities and these flyers.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clarity in air fare advertising is a very positive initiative. The Canadian Transportation Agency would have the authority to make and enforce regulations to require that the advertising price includes all costs to the airline for providing the air service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advertisements would also indicate fees, charges and taxes collected by the airline on behalf of a government body or airport authority. In addition to the prices of airline tickets for both domestic and international travel, the travelling public is often literally shocked when actual ticket costs are far in excess of the advertised costs of the flights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the reduction in the membership of the Canadian Transportation Agency from seven part time to five full time centred in Ottawa. With all their increased responsibilities I am sincerely concerned that they will have insufficient manpower to undertake their current responsibilities and the new responsibilities that the act would give them. That would be a travesty if they certainly do not have the tools to deal with the situation presented to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I look forward to a full review of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> at committee and listening to the comments and concerns of the transportation industry and the public.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we have a bill that makes it possible to respond to this situation and to take these elements into consideration, by offering a mechanism to settle this problem through the Canadian Transportation Agency.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is whether there is going to be sufficient manpower in these five members to deal with all the solutions or all the problems that come from across the country.

There may be a plethora of complaints to the commission or to the agency and whether it will be able to deal with it in a timely fashion again remains to be seen, but as I said, it is a good first step that we did not have before.</div>

In looking through the act, as a representative of northwestern British Columbia, we have a terminus in Prince Rupert where many of the trains and goods pass through, particularly to the Asian markets but other markets as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noticed over the last number of years, particularly with the absolutely diabolical sale of B.C. Rail to CN, that the accident rate has gone through the roof. Hazardous materials are spilling into lakes and rivers near communities. Just recently, volunteer fire departments in my region were sent a letter by CN that suggested that if any of these materials were to cause a major spill in the region that these fire departments were meant to hold tight for 12 hours until CN could get its act together and show up with a hazardous materials crew.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are volunteer fire departments. They do not have the equipment, training or money to handle such spills. Looking through the act, we know that the government, neither the previous one nor this one, has not really taken on aggressively what is in the new age of shipping of increased traffic and diversity of goods and also the increased complexity of materials that are actually being transported. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear from my colleagues of the work being done in the United States to prevent the bad combination when the stars line up in the wrong way to have a material passing through either a sensitive environment or ecosystem or through a community. My first question to the member is, is not such a powerful review required?</div>
    </p><a name="Para55704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is around the agency and appointment process. I know there have been some bad legacies in the previous government's appointment process of not always being able to distinguish talent from partisanship. I wonder what confidences he has with respect to the new government's ability to make that important distinction and actually appoint people to this vital committee who are known and based on transparency, which is not written into the act as it is right now.</div>

I cannot really respond to that because the new government has been very derelict in making its appointments. There are many vacancies on many commissions, judicial vacancies as well, and it is difficult to comment because the government has to move very quickly to fill some of these positions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to my colleague's first question, certainly the transportation of dangerous goods is a matter of real concern. In fact, I attended a training exercise with volunteer firemen in my region along with the former member for Churchill who was present from his party. They were concerned as well about what was travelling through their region, especially if there was a wreck. They were concerned about how quickly they could find out what exactly was in a tanker that was leaking some kind of substance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there should be a better tracking system and there should certainly be one for rail lines that go across our borders. The rail lines in my region cross a major river and if there was a derailment or the possibility of an explosion, it would create a tremendous problem not only from an environmental perspective such as water pollution, but a main arterial route leading to the United States would be affected. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage and support more stringent requirements to deal with goods which are potentially explosive, noxious, et cetera. I welcome the member's comments. I feel the same way.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that my colleague mentioned, just in passing, our record of appointments. I am particularly proud, for example, of the fact that our government fought for the appointment of Stephen Lewis, a very well known former leader of the NDP, as Under-Secretary-General at the United Nations. I am even more proud of our appointment of Ed Broadbent for seven years as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Rights and Democracy in Montreal.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come back to a question that was raised by the member for Welland which dealt with the Air Travel Complaints Commissioner. If I am paraphrasing right, the member said there are a number of average citizens who fly from time to time. They are not regular commuters and they do not use airports like bus stations like many of us in the House who travel regularly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to come back to what was said by Bruce Hood who was the first actual Commissioner of the Air Travel Complaints Office and a former NHL hockey referee. He expressed his concern that the proposed elimination of the position of the Air Travel Complains Commissioner would make it increasingly difficult for Canadians to resolve problems with airlines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little concerned about this and I would like to put it to the member for Welland to see what his instinct is in this regard as we look to transfer the commissioner from an independent status into the Canadian Transportation Agency.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would update the Canada Transportation Act of 1996. It is the result of extensive consultations and its basic purpose is to improve the act by enhancing transportation safety and transparency, by reducing inconveniences to users—in terms of noise as we saw earlier—and by protecting the consumer, who uses the modes of transportation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today my presentation will focus more on air transportation. There are businesses in Lévis—Bellechasse that regularly ship products manufactured in the area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are amendments that would protect the rights and entitlements of the air travelling public by ensuring that air carriers will always represent their products in an open and transparent manner. This afternoon we saw that sometimes there are hidden costs. Air carriers are currently being more transparent on a voluntary basis. The industry is taking steps in the right direction, but this government must not derogate its responsibility to the air travelling public. It therefore proposes to amend the act, to permit its administrator, the Canadian Transportation Agency, to develop, implement and enforce regulations on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, if necessary, to ensure transparency in the pricing of passenger air services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in the bill would make clear the government's expectations with regard to the air carrier industry. These amendments would be in keeping with initiatives in the U.S. and Europe that are also designed with transparency in mind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed approach is also consistent with the broader strategic thrust of this government to legislate only when necessary and to make carriers accountable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments would also require all operators providing commercial air services in Canada to prominently display their terms of carriage at their business offices and on any Internet site from which they sell these air services. Many travellers buy their tickets on the Internet. It is important to ensure that when a price is posted, it is in fact the price the traveller will pay. That is how this will work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another addition.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para55729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are amendments that would make clear that Canada is wholly committed to all of its trading relationships in international air services. The amendments would ensure that an international agreement or convention respecting air services would have prevalence over the Competition Act in the event of an inconsistency or conflict between the two. Canada is a trading nation and so the government believes it is imperative that Canada's partners can rely on their air transport trading relationships with us. These amendments would send that signal.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para55730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr. Speaker, there are amendments that would ensure that air services provided on behalf of the Canadian Armed Forces or in the case of a declared emergency are not subject to part II of the Act. Part II of the Act provides the framework for commercial air services. Military aircraft are sometimes used in humanitarian missions and, consequently, should be exempt in such cases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only sensible to distinguish that air services provided for our nation's armed forces, or in the case of a declared emergency, are not regular nor for-profit occurrences. Therefore the provision of these types of air services should not be covered by the act. In that sense these amendments would bring clarity to such situations, and should be considered housekeeping measures that ensure the continued relevance of this act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proposing these amendments because they would ensure a higher degree of transparency and consumer recourse, as well as bring clarity to its application. Also they make the complaints process simpler and more efficient by integrating it into the Canadian Transportation Agency's permanent functions. In this way, the amendments to the air transportation provisions in the act contribute to building a modern, efficient transportation system, which is integral to the well-being of Canada's economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the amendments would continue to allow air carriers to develop and grow based on the merits of the choices they make in the course of doing business. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the proposed amendments reflect this government's commitment to a competitive air transportation system; one that balances the need to update statutory and regulatory instruments, where necessary, to respond to developments in the air industry marketplace, with the responsibility to ensure that consumers are aware of their rights and entitlements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vote was taken in this House today on softwood lumber. Our government is taking action. I believe that Canadian taxpayers, our constituents and parliamentarians want a government that works and that is up to the challenge. This bill will improve the Canada Transportation Act and give results. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentarians are asked to take concrete action. People expect parliamentarians to be up to the challenge and want them to ensure that our government functions as efficiently as possible with the utmost respect for democracy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government believes that these amendments to the Canada Transportation Act are warranted, will give the Canadian Transportation Agency the ability to continue to serve the air travelling public, and will ensure that Canada continues to have a viable and competitive air services industry in the years to come. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My speech focused mainly on air transportation, but there are many aspects to this bill. It aims to solve the problem of noise pollution caused by rail, and proposes measures to improve safety and to protect consumers who travel by plane. </div>

    </p><a name="Para55740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the junction and many other parts of my riding, because of growing deindustrialization in our community we are seeing a greater density of residential development, and we are finding more and more homes right up near railway lines.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the hon. member is twofold.

    </p><a name="Para55744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, my colleague has raised the case of a real and current situation in this country. Essentially, two situations have arisen. Urban development has indeed occurred near railway stations and rail lines, but also near switching yards. This has created a cohabitation problem, to start with, a cohabitation problem that has been exacerbated by a kind of rationalization in railway operations, and in particular the privatization of railway companies. There has been a real and significant conflict between these uses, which continues today and which this bill is intended to resolve. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer I might give my colleague is that in its present form, the bill does in fact try to provide some tools for people who have complaints arising from the fact that a lot of noise is being caused. They can complain to the Transportation Agency. I can tell you that in the riding next to mine, in Charny, people are very concerned about noise, since, as was just being said, noise creates major problems for people who live around the station. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the proposed amendments to the act will authorize the Canadian Transportation Agency to deal with noise complaints and, when necessary, to order the railway companies to make changes to reduce unreasonable noise resulting from the construction or operation of a railway or a switching yard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before taking action, the agency will have to ascertain that the parties are unable to reach agreement. That is what the bill says at present. I hope that, with the consent of the members of this House, it will be able to go to committee where it can be examined clause by clause. </div>

    </p><a name="Para55752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, with respect to the premise of his question, I should perhaps remind him that in fact railway transportation is one of the most ecological modes of transportation there is, and that it is entirely in our interest to make it part of a sustainable development policy. That being said, the objective of the bill before us today is to improve the existing bill, on which consultations have already been held. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I think that there are some very commendable projects, like the one mentioned by my colleague. I hope that one day we will have a high-speed train running through Quebec and the provinces of Canada and that it will help to strengthen the Canadian federation. </div>

It concerns the whole issue of sustainable development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We on this side of the House have read the bill several times. There is no reference to sustainable development. There is no mention of “greenhouse gases”. This minority government is apparently in the process of proposing a new environmental strategy for our country. There is no reference to that strategy in the bill. At the same time, the Minister of Natural Resources has advised the employees of his department to stop using the expression “sustainable development,” and in place of that term, to begin using the expression “responsible development.” </div>
    </p><a name="Para55756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the member simply clarify the situation a little? Does this bill seek to protect the environment, yes or no? He has just said in the House that a railway system contributes enormously to the reduction of greenhouse gases. On this side of the House, it is very difficult to reconcile that with what is going on. </div>

    </p><a name="Para55758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the underlying objective of the bill is sustainable development, it seeks to rationalize the regulation and thereby facilitate the expansion of the railway industry, and also to promote the creation of short-distance railways. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that rising fuel costs are prompting carriers to look to other modes than road transport, for example, to move their goods. That, indeed, is one of the objectives of the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also remind my colleague that one of the benefits of our government's approach to this bill, and also in a more general way, is not to introduce bills that are loaded with so many elements that they becomes difficult to adopt because of their complexity. We have before us a relatively simple bill, containing a series of measures designed to improve transportation safety. For that reason, I hope the bill will go forward and receive the support of all members present today. </div>

    </p><a name="Para55762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I want to tell you how disappointed I am concerning the length of time the Parliament of Canada has taken to bring this bill to fruition. We should recall that earlier versions of this bill have already been presented twice, in the form of Bills <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',719988,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=719988&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-26</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1703256,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1703256&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-44</A>, introduced on February 25, 2003, and March 24, 2005 respectively. However, the adoption of this bill is of major importance for the people of Quebec and for all of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This delay reminds me of the saga surrounding repairs to the Quebec bridge. Remember the Conservatives’ election promises from last winter. Then they were promising to settle this issue as quickly as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last election campaign, the Conservatives enjoyed repeating that the Bloc Québécois could not solve this problem, being an opposition party. The Conservatives boasted that they could finally provide a solution to something the Liberals had been unable to do anything about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until the company partially mandated to repair the bridge decided to dismantle the scaffolding that the Conservative government woke up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A government source said that an additional $69 million to $76 million would be needed to complete the work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The headline in the July 19 issue of the daily newspaper<i> Le Soleil</i> read: “New hope for the Quebec bridge.” There actually were discussions among spokespersons from Ottawa, Quebec City, Canadian National and the owner of the bridge on July 18. No timetable, however, was put forward and the people in Quebec City are still waiting, and waiting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is like this bill that is supposed to amend the Canada Transportation Act. Lots of people have been waiting for it to be adopted for a long time, but it has not yet come to fruition and this may prove to be catastrophic for urban transit, as we will see later.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin with, I would like to underscore an amendment that I deem to be important and that was added to the bill’s declaration of principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, respect for the environment is being added to the various obligations of transportation systems. In committee we will see what provisions may be added so that this obligation is really enforced and complies with the Kyoto protocol.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give the example of the locomotives. The rate at which the old locomotives are renewed has to be speeded up, since only 29% of all diesel locomotives comply with environmental standards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we must encourage the use of the Green Goat switchers, a hybrid diesel-electric system tested in 2004. It seems that this hybrid switcher reduces fuel consumption by 60%. These are but a few examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three measures among the legislative provisions proposed in this bill that particularly attract our attention. They deal with air and rail sectors and concern airline advertising, noise relating to rail operations, and the abandonment of rail lines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that consumer protection is absolutely vital, and that increasing open competition must not in any way penalize the consumer, who is entitled to greater transparency</div>
    </p><a name="Para55775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this connection, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>will amend the Transportation Act in relation to complaints processes, the advertising of prices for air services and the disclosure of terms and conditions of carriage.These new measures will provide for greater control over the sale of airline tickets, among other things by giving the agency jurisdiction over ticket sales advertising.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensees must in future display, in a prominent place, the rates for the service offered, including the terms and conditions of carriage. This new condition also applies to services offered on the Internet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the terms and conditions of carriage must be made accessible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Transportation Agency will have a new regulatory power allowing it to require, through regulations, that the advertised price of air services indicate the fees, charges and taxes collected on behalf of another person, enabling the consumer to readily determine the cost of the service. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is a step in the right direction, we must ensure that the Transportation Agency exercises this power in a rigorous, proactive way and in the best interests of consumers. Consumer associations have been requesting far more transparent pricing for a very long time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These new measures to improve transparency will benefit both consumers and the airlines, which will be able to engage in healthier competition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to raise one point. That is the abolition by the former finance minister of the position of Air Travel Complaints Commissioner in the 2005 budget. The previous government announced at the time that the Canadian Transportation Agency would henceforth assume responsibility for the complaints program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A>, as proposed by the Conservatives, no longer provides for the position of Complaints Commissioner and includes this function in the ordinary operations of the Transportation Agency. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We take a positive view of the fact that the Transportation Agency can henceforth order carriers to compensate people for damages caused by a failure to comply with the conditions of carriage. This is a step forward because the previous Complaints Commissioner could only make suggestions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some shortcomings, however. For example, the Transportation Agency no longer has to submit an annual report on the complaints and how they were settled. This report would point the finger at the guilty parties and their failings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commissioner was also able under the complaints process to demand a lot of information from carriers, something that the Transportation Agency cannot do. The Bloc Québécois deplores this weakening of the role of the Transportation Agency, which loses its ability to investigate and some of its visibility. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We certainly cannot forget the Jetsgo saga, when hundreds of travellers suffered damages when this airline abruptly ceased operations at the height of the holiday travel season. This must never happen again. The Bloc Québécois severely criticized it at the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that, in the Bloc’s view, the government must assume its responsibilities. In particular, it could help set up a compensation fund which would ensure that tickets are reimbursed when consumers buy them directly from carriers, as happens increasingly often. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, this bill can be improved considerably in a number of ways. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the legislative changes in connection with air transportation, another very important aspect of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> concerns rail transport.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would amend part III of the Canada Transportation Act by creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints concerning noise and by amending the provisions for dealing with the transfer and discontinuance of operation of railway lines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years now, the Bloc Québécois has been calling for legislative changes to deal with the serious noise problems faced by many communities. I am referring to the harmful effects of noise resulting from the construction or operation of railways, and the movement of cars in marshalling yards in particular.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the public and the railways have often been at loggerheads. The public bothered by noise has no recourse but to complain directly to the railway concerned or to initiate civil proceedings. No federal agency currently has the authority to intervene in such instances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the importance of legislating in this regard, so that the railway companies feel some pressure and take the initiative to limit the disturbances caused by railway construction or operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These legislative changes are a step in the right direction, but I have some amendments to propose. I will try to ensure that the agency's jurisdiction will not be just over noise, but also over emissions or vibrations from rail cars. In this Kyoto protocol era, environmental issues are extremely important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that rail transport is an excellent alternative to road transport and is key to economic development in Quebec.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655">(1655)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there must be a balance between such economic objectives and the environment, particularly in terms of respecting the public's quality of life and well-being.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers granted to the Canadian Transportation Agency are in no way prejudicial to the railway companies, particularly since the agency will now have the power to issue and publish guidelines, after consulting with interested parties, and to propose a mechanism for the collaborative resolution of noise complaints. Consequently, each party will know the other's limits. The purpose of this is to resolve such conflicts peacefully and without delay. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see that urban transit authorities will now be recognized. A section has been added under which a railway company wishing to sell a railway line shall first offer it to the federal government, the provincial government and the urban transit authorities concerned. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These new provisions are desirable and will provide better protection for the unique transportation network provided by urban railway corridors. I have always considered rail transport to be an excellent alternative to road transport. Such measures, therefore, should be encouraged. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned at the beginning of my presentation that this bill has been floating about these halls since the 37th Parliament. Not passing it could have irreparable consequences. If things continue as they are, the survival of agencies such as the Agence métropolitaine de transport, which serves greater Montreal, will be threatened. The new act gives them an arbitrator, the Canadian Transportation Agency. They will also benefit from new regulations that will let them negotiate on a more equal footing with bigger players such as CN and CP, which often behave like monopolies in the face of these agencies. The survival of these agencies is important in the context of the Kyoto protocol, and that is why I sincerely hope this bill will finally be passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support this bill in principle, and we will try to improve it by making amendments in the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities.</div>

I would like my colleague from Alfred-Pellan to describe his experiences in committee during the last Parliament. In fact, Conservative members exerted tremendous pressure to ensure that everything to do with VIA Rail never come to fruition. All of the Conservatives were against developing VIA Rail. This clearly affects Quebec directly, given the rapid rail project for the Quebec City-Windsor corridor.</div>

We have often mentioned the derailments, which have occurred repeatedly, but it has not been addressed. Perhaps we will add these elements in committee with a view to improving this bill. </div>

We therefore have the privilege, and the advantage, of hearing directly from the people we invite to our working session, who include representatives of the government and all the opposition parties, to provide us with the information we need for considering the bill. Never imagine that a bill introduced by a government is complete in itself and that all possible stakeholders have been consulted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will make a point of inviting the Agence métropolitaine de transport, which has told us about the difficulties it is currently having in developing its commuter train service in the greater Montreal region. Montreal is one of the important regions of Quebec when it comes to transportation. There is always talk of adding more highways and bridges in that region, despite the fact that there are rail lines lying unused because of the lack of coordination and cooperation between the railway companies. Those companies sit on their monopolies and their vested rights and refuse to give the commuter trains that could serve a larger population free rein to expand. We will have the opportunity to hear these people at the committee and they may have important things for us to add to the bill.</div>

I offer the example of my constituency, Chambly—Borduas. Trains, rail lines, go through 10 of the 12 towns that make up that constituency, and one of them, Saint-Basile-le-Grand, has two access roads. Sometimes a train stops at the municipal access roads for a long time. We had one occasion when a train stopped for an hour and a half. If there were an emergency in the municipality, or for some other reason, this would create a major problem. And yet the act already contained monitoring provisions.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the issue of blocked entrances and main thoroughfares in municipalities has yet to be addressed at committee.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore encourage my hon. colleague to identify stakeholders who could meet with us to discuss this issue, even though the bill as it stands, which assigns many responsibilities to the Canada Transportation Agency, could give it the authority to hear any complaint dealing with transportation in general, which is not the case at present.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation does provide, however, that a consultative body may hear all these complaints to arrange for the mediation provided for in the bill.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by speaking briefly on the history of CN Rail and the important role it has played in the lives of Canadians for nearly a century. The Canadian National Railway has mirrored the history of Canada for more than eight decades. The company's roots lie in the turmoil and disillusionment that accompanied World War I. In the 1920s and 1930s, CN's fortunes reflected the peaks and valleys of the Canadian economy. During World War II, CN, like Canadians themselves, met challenges that could not have been predicted even a few years earlier. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the decades after the war, Canada became a supplier of resources to the world, resources such as lumber, which we dealt with earlier today, grain, sulphur, potash and petroleum products, and CN carried them. In the 1990s, when the North American economy became more integrated, CN followed suit as it expanded its U.S. presence and took a north-south orientation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because CN was for more than 70 years a government owned railroad, it had a social role in the life of the country as well as an economic one. This role is exemplified by narrow gauge freight and passenger services across Newfoundland, by mixed trains on low density branch lines, and by passenger cars used for schooling and medical services in remote parts of Ontario and Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that CN and the railways of Canada represent an integral and important part of our history as Canadians. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-11</A> recognizes the great importance of our railways and focuses on achieving a balance between the modern interests of communities, consumers, commuters and urban transit authorities with those of today's railway carriers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight the bill's proposed changes in the railway aspects of the bill. The proposed changes to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172053,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172053&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Canada Transportation Act</A> will help ensure that our railways remain innovative, strong and healthy in the 21st century.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill looks at existing policy and regulations from an urban quality of life perspective to see if we can make them work better on behalf of our cities and our communities. At a time when Canadians are increasingly concerned about rising energy prices, particularly prices paid at the gasoline pumps, I am very pleased to be able to say that the proposed amendments will contribute to the well-being of urban transit services as well as intercity passenger rail services like GO Transit and VIA Rail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a number of amendments to the CTA, the government is introducing several measures that will benefit the passenger rail services that are critical for the movement of the growing number of commuters in my community and throughout the GTA with and between our largest urban centres. For example, on the average workday in Burlington alone, between 70 and 80 passenger trains pass through Burlington's three GO stations and one CN station. Nearly 90% of all trains that pass through Burlington carry passengers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government recognizes the benefits of providing publicly funded passenger rail services such as those operated by VIA Rail across Canada, the Metro in Montreal, the O-Train here in Ottawa and the GO Train in Burlington through to Toronto and the east side of Toronto.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also recognizes that because these services are essentially government mandated, the operating entities may encounter difficulties in negotiating on even terms with the host railways over those infrastructures they operate. To this end, the amendments to the CTA will include new dispute resolution provisions clearly aimed at public passenger services.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the only recourse available to the CTA for public passenger providers for resolving rate and service disputes with the railways is final offer arbitration. The new provision would replace the existing final offer arbitration provision that became available to commuter and other publicly funded passenger rail operators in 1996. However, passenger rail that is not publicly funded would continue to have no recourse in the final offer arbitration system.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715">(1715)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new recourse will improve access to rail infrastructure for public passenger services, under commercially reasonable terms. The government strongly encourages VIA Rail and commuter rail authorities to conclude commercial agreements with infrastructure owners. However, when commercial negotiations are unsuccessful, which does happen on occasion, these public passenger service providers will be able to seek adjudication from the Canadian Transportation Agency on terms and conditions of operation on federal rail lines, including fees and services charged by that host railway.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, since the contracts are entered into by public bodies, in the interest of greater transparency, the amendments of the CTA will require that such agreements are made public for the first time. As such, any future contracts between public passenger service providers and federally regulated railways will be made public. Existing amendments will also be made public unless one of the parties can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the agency, that the contract contains commercially sensitive information and that it would be harmed by its release.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also recognizes that preserving surplus rail corridors for subsequent use by urban transit is of growing interest in large urban centres, including my own centre of Burlington. Often these corridors represent the only land available for transportation uses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently a railway can discontinue operations on a surplus rail line only after it has followed the notification and advertisement steps prescribed in the CTA. The objective of these provisions is to promote the takeover of lines of new owners or operators in place of service abandonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a railway is no longer required for freight service, it must first be offered for continued railway operations, then must be offered to federal, provincial and municipal governments for a price that is no greater than the net salvage value. This approach to corridor evaluation will be retained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the current transfer and discontinuance provisions of the CTA, urban transit authorities, which in some urban areas serve several municipalities, including mine, have no right to receive such offers from railways. In the interest of protecting valuable corridors that may be required for urban transit, the CTA will be amended to require an offer of sale to urban transit authorities before municipal governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the current provisions do not apply to railway spurs and sidings, some of which could sufficiently serve the needs of commuter rail services. Nor do the present provisions apply to passenger railway stations. The amendments would require the railways to offer these segments in urban areas and passenger railway stations to governments and urban transit authorities, not for more than the net salvage value, before removing them from service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I noted earlier, the CTA currently requires that no interest has been expressed in the purchase of a line for continued rail operation. A railway company must offer to transfer the line to governments for not more than its salvage value. A government interested in purchasing the line must advise the railway company in writing that it accepts the offer. If the government and the railway company cannot agree on the net salvage value of the line, either party can apply to the agency for a determination of such value. In other words, the government is required to accept and bind itself to the purchase offer without knowing the purchase price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to these provisions in the bill will improve the notification processes to governments, urban transit authorities and agencies at certain stages of transfer and discontinuance of the process. As well, the amendments will allow a government of an urban transit authority to seek a determination of the net salvage value from an agency when it receives an offer from a railway and before it binds itself to an offer of purchase. Again, this is transparency. This will provide a government and an urban transit authority the necessary information to decide whether it is the right business decision, whether they want to purchase the line or not.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one area that is important to me in this bill and important to my area of Burlington and Halton and of the urban transit issues that we face every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area in the bill that is very important to me, and I have been dealing with on an ongoing basis, particularly this summer, is noise, and noise is addressed for the very first time in the act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I noted these amendments would introduce measures that would make communities such as mine served by railways more livable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past several years, some members of the House have heard community concerns, and I have heard that from a number of speeches here today, about railway noise and the Federal Court of Appeal decision of December 2000, which ruled that the agency had no jurisdiction to entertain complaints relating to noise from the operating of federally regulated railways, and that is about to change in the act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of Canadian communities are home to railway operations and disputes can arise from railway noise between residents and communities and railway companies. While citizens adversely affected by noise from railway operations can make a formal complaint to the company through a 1-800 number, which I have received and passed out many times, or seek civil action through the courts, no federal body is mandated to regulate railway noise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposed changes to the bill authorize the Canadian Transportation Agency to review noise complaints for the very first time and, if required, order railway companies to make changes to reduce reasonable noise when constructing or operating railway and railway yards. The agency must be satisfied that the parties were unable to reach a settlement voluntarily of the dispute on their own, which of course is the preference of everyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Railway Association and the CPR have established voluntary mechanisms with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to address noise and other complaints stemming from the proximity to railway operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government applauds and encourages this voluntary approach for resolving these often contentious matters, which I have had this summer in my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the government also wants to ensure the agency, and I support this, has the authority to resolve noise complaints if a voluntary settlement is not achievable. The agency is well-positioned to strike a balance between operational needs of the railway, with which I think we all agree, and the expectation of communities and those who live beside the railways not to be subjected to unnecessary and unavoidable inconvenience.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments would require railways not to cause unreasonable noise when constructing and operating a railway, taking into consideration the requirements of operation, services and interests of affected communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to pause for a moment and talk about a specific example in my riding. GO Transit is adding a whole new line, a new track through my riding of Burlington to Toronto, to provide us with ongoing, everyday, all-day GO Train service. As a GO Train user this summer and over a number of years my wife has used GO Train to Toronto on a daily basis when she works in downtown Toronto, it is a very important thing. The people who live in Burlington understand the need for an expanded GO Train service to Burlington, but do they need to have the railway constructed in the middle of the night with no notice? That is what has happened over the summer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This past week I had the fortunate opportunity to meet with railway officials, their communications people, their construction people. They freely admit that there are no rules and regulations, that they are basically able to do whatever they want, whenever they want, and that is the way the law is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new changes that we are proposing in this bill do make changes on the noise side to give us some authority to ensure that, at the bare minimum, the people who are affected on a daily basis due to the changes, the growth in railway, get an opportunity to comment on it. Whether they get to stop it is a different story, but at least they have the knowledge, they have the right to know what is happening in their backyard. I am looking forward to seeing the bill pass so we can start working on those issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency has been given the statutory power to provide guidelines for what it will consider in deciding on noise complaints, elaborate measures on the noise resolution and require complaints to demonstrate that all voluntary measures are exhausted. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first want to ensure that the citizens and the railway contact and communicate with each other to ensure they cannot find a solution on their own. They will investigate noise complaints and order railways to take appropriate action to prevent unreasonable noise, taking into consideration the requirements of railway operation and the interests of affected communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55860"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments I have outlined today go a long way in improving passenger rail service across the country, preserving valuable railway infrastructure in urban areas such as mine and reducing railway noise and complaints in ridings such as Burlington.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately these measures will reduce congestion in our urban areas and make our transportation system more environmentally sustainable. Not only are we adding railway lines in our area, but the tax incentive for people to get out of their cars, to use GO Transit and to take the mass transit system to Toronto has been a tremendous support to Burlington and to the people of my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to improve the quality of life of those who have to live beside the railway lines. They understand that they are there for a reason, that they do have a good public role. However, they also need to be dealt with respectfully and in a reasonable manner. The changes to the CTA will make that happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been listening very actively today. All parties seem to indicate that they are willing to send this to committee, which is what I would like to see done, where it will be reviewed and some changes may or may not be made. It has had significant consultation. Our friends from the official opposition have said a number of times today that the bill has come to us a couple of times in different formats.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us get on with it. Let us get it passed. Let us get it to the transportation committee. If there are any amendments, let us hear them and deal with them appropriately. Let us start helping those people in the urban areas who are affected by transit needs on an everyday basis.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister spoke this morning very clearly and referenced two or three times that the bill would have environmental implications. My colleague highlighted GO Transit and the notion of public transit support in his riding. We even heard that his wife takes the train, which is a good thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to raise the fact that there seems to be a disconnect here. On the one hand the government is speaking now about a new environmental platform, apparently rejecting 13 years of our work in this field. This is somewhat exaggerated. There is also a tax deductible transit pass, which does not seem to be supported by the economists.</div>

    </p><a name="Para55874"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary began his intervention by pointing out that clause 6 of the bill would oblige the Minister of International Cooperation to establish an advisory committee for international development cooperation with remuneration and expenses for members of the committee to be set by the minister. In arguing that this provision has financial implications, the parliamentary secretary referred to the Speaker's February 8, 2005 ruling where it was stated that a similar provision in a bill was judged to require a royal recommendation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55875"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary continued to explain that clauses 7 to 10 of the bill also described functions of this committee and obligations of the minister that entailed new expenditures. He described these functions as receiving, recording and replying to petitions, as well as preparing and submitting reports. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55876"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair has reviewed this matter carefully and agrees that the establishment of the advisory committee for international development cooperation provided for in clause 6 clearly would require the expenditure of public funds in a manner and for a purpose not currently authorized. Similarly, the provisions in clauses 7 to 10, which describe the functions of the advisory committee with regard to the process of petitioning and reporting, are also functions which would require the authorization of spending for a new and distinct purpose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, clause 6 and clauses 7 to 10 cause the bill as a whole in its current form to require a royal recommendation. Accordingly, I will decline to put the question on third reading of this bill unless a royal recommendation is received. Today, however, the debate is on the motion for second reading which will proceed as scheduled.</div>

We appreciate the ruling on that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55881"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A>. I also want to thank the member for Scarborough—Guildwood for introducing a bill, flawed as it may be, to create legislation for Canadian development assistance. Indeed, the bill introduces proposals that are very close to some of the issues that have been raised by the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55882"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development is a moving target. Today, more than ever before, we have a better grasp of what works. As an individual country and with the international community, we have embarked on a complex journey that is leading to more effective aid, aid that can better harness the energies and talents of developing countries, and that can truly make a difference in the lives of the poor. There is a vision in Canada for aid programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55883"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a vision of donors and partners working together to achieve the reduction of poverty, of mutual accountability, of trust and respect, and of good governance which makes all of these things possible. However, visions must also be practical if they are going to work. Canadians want us to be certain that this bill in fact actually does guide us to the delivery of that vision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55884"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already heard in the first hour of debate in the House on the bill that there are many members of Parliament who do not feel that the bill facilitates Canada's vision of our federal government's aid program. I would remind members of the House that the Speech from the Throne stated that the government is committed to “a more effective use of Canadian aid dollars.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para55885"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wants to ensure that we do the right thing with our aid money in putting this vision into practice. We will ensure that aid dollars are provided to the countries that have created a climate in which progress can be achieved. We will ensure that such progress can be achieved as efficiently as possible and that the people who most need the help will receive the assistance they need to find their way out of poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55886"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have yet to be convinced that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A> will allow us to build a dynamic and effective development assistance program, but we are keeping an open mind and we are anxious to participate in the committee that perhaps will study the bill in the event that it is passed at second reading. We want to ensure, and I know all members of the committee want to ensure, that it gets a fair hearing in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55887"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is very complex and seems to contain a number of mixed messages that may not bring precision to Canada's development assistance. If our assistance is going to be effective, our objectives must be simple and clearly defined. Yet, this does not appear to me to be a simple bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, in the first hour of debate we heard comments that some are concerned about the possibility of escalating administrative costs as the result of the bill. Development assistance should reach the people for whom it is intended. We need to be careful that Canada's aid dollars, which ultimately are Canadian taxpayers' dollars, are not being tied up in lengthy process or procedures in Ottawa. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill's proposed petition system, reporting requirements and advisory committee would add layers of bureaucracy into an already well-developed system. They could, quite conceivably, turn current consultative processes into cumbersome Canada-focused procedures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system, as proposed in the bill as I read it, would risk the focus or could risk taking the focus off of the recipient country and put it back onto Canada. I would argue that the recipient nation's particular circumstances, that of poverty or need, should always be the focus in terms of what is needed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new Conservative government has made the enhancement of accountability within government one of our highest priorities. We are committed to strengthening the rules and institutions that ensure transparency and accountability to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that the bill may bring considerable confusion to those accountability rules and institutions that we have created in government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the foreign affairs and international development committee, the committee that will conduct the hearings on this bill if it is passed by the House, will study carefully the roles and responsibilities of the Minister of International Cooperation. In my view, the minister's extensive roles and responsibilities are worthy of great consideration. I have not seen that reflected in this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill adds to the already considerable reporting requirements of the minister and may not help clarify in legislation what she does in practice. We do not want to simply add to her administrative responsibilities without demonstrating real value-added to Canada's aid program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill would give considerable oversight to a committee of unelected individuals who would function on the basis of complaints from aggravated individuals in other countries. I am not sure of the extent that this may be really counter to the letter and the spirit of the democratic process and whether or not this comes close to making the minister responsible or accountable to an advisory committee rather than being accountable to Parliament and ultimately to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would require the minister to report on how she has implemented the guidance of this advisory committee rather than how she has implemented the guidance of the will of Parliament. I am not sure Canadians support having our cabinet ministers accountable to authorities outside of the parliamentary precinct and in reality outside of our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would remove from Canada the authority to define development assistance and would place it within the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, a high level, multilateral organization not based in Canada, not based in Ottawa, but based in Paris.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Canada values highly the role of the OECD and is an active supporter of greater collaboration between OECD members, it is clear that the current formulation would result in Canada having reduced control over where it targets development assistance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I checked, Canadians want control over the taxpayer dollars we send around the world as foreign aid. Under this bill Canada's development assistance program would be subject to the rules of an unelected institution. Such a move could potentially restrict both programming and the countries to which development assistance may be given.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For accountability purposes, it is extremely important that Canada be able to choose where its development assistance can be most effectively utilized. Experience has taught us that countries that promote sound governance, democracy and human rights, are more likely to be able to make good use of Canadian aid dollars and that we can make a true difference in those countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's aid program has had results by taking this approach. We should be careful about undermining the effectiveness of the aid program that already is working. Someone said that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I would suggest that there have to be some changes. Our committee is looking at that and has looked at that. We do not want to diminish the effectiveness of our programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDA has concentrated on implementing the principles of aid effectiveness in our bilateral operations and has worked effectively with countries that are committed to improving governance and making effective use of resources. With our assistance, countries such as Tanzania and Ghana are beginning to show results. There is more to be done in these countries. There is more to be done in other countries in terms of improving and focusing Canada's aid program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the intent and the spirit of this bill. I believe the member, as he puts this forward, will recognize the concerns we have with this bill. If it passes the vote at second reading in the House, the foreign affairs and international development committee will look forward to working on this bill.</div>

However, some aspects of it should be studied more extensively in parliamentary committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill proposes the establishment of a committee of experts in international assistance to be appointed by the minister responsible for this file. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really wonder. Is it appropriate for members of the House of Commons to be on this committee? </div>
    </p><a name="Para55916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parliamentarians already have an opportunity to express their views and make their recommendations known in the House as well as in various committees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it not be better for the members of this committee to be experts who are active in the field and can be found by the hundreds in different non-governmental organizations, religious organizations and the private sector that does business in these countries? </div>
    </p><a name="Para55918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have another question. Should the appointment of these specialists not be subsequent to a study of their candidacy by the members of Parliament and a vote in the House to approve the suggestions of the minister in charge? </div>
    </p><a name="Para55919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the minister has the ability to appoint the members of the committee, determine their remuneration, and dismiss them any time he likes, who in this House would really believe that these future committee members are impartial? </div>
    </p><a name="Para55920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is all the more true in view of the fact that some NGOs are very dependent on federal government funding for their work in the field and will feel obliged to keep quiet in order not to displease their funder.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another question arises as well. Will the moneys allocated to the establishment of this committee be taken from the funds, already too paltry, that we have invested in international assistance? </div>
    </p><a name="Para55922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us hope not, since Canada currently is not even able to meet its Millennium Goals commitment to invest 0.7% of its GDP in international assistance by 2015.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this morning, my colleague from Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher, the Bloc Québécois critic on international assistance, tabled a motion to force the Government of Canada to respect its commitments on this matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55924"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring, the Auditor General of Canada criticized the way Canada spends its money on international assistance.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A> is to enhance transparency in the department, but nothing is proposed for improving the internal management of funding at CIDA.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the panel of experts proposed here would not be necessary if CIDA resolved its internal management problems once and for all and if the Government of Canada finally adopted a concrete and effective plan of action for the distribution of its international assistance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A> raises another problem and that is the way it defines development assistance, limiting it to poverty reduction and sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the other six targets put forward by the UN in its Millennium Goals has been emphasized in terms of Canada's action for eliminating poverty in world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to recall these goals, which are all necessary to put an end to poverty in developing countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First is the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. We know that more than a billion human beings live on less than one dollar a day and that 800 million of these people do not have enough to eat and cannot function day to day. One quarter of all children under the age of five in developing countries are malnourished. This starvation has long-term consequences, making these children frail and vulnerable to sickness and disease. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next is the achievement of universal primary education, because 115 million children of school age do not have the opportunity to attend primary school. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the promotion of gender equality in developing countries is more than necessary. Here are some examples: family violence; crimes of passion; trafficking of women; female circumcision; early and forced marriage; elimination of young girls through infanticide; violence related to dowry; acid throwing; and violence related to sexual exploitation. Such is the daily lot of millions of women in the world. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the infant mortality rate, the United Nations calculates that more than 11 million children die every year in the world. Those 11 million victims equal the entire population of Ontario. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty thousand children die every day from causes directly related to poverty. The loss of those 30,000 children is the equivalent of the city of Alma disappearing on a Monday, and the city of Mirabel vanishing on Tuesday, and the population of Val-d'Or wiped out on Wednesday. In other words, there are far too many victims. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an enormous amount of work to be done in order to improve the health of mothers in poor countries. Mothers are generally the last line of protection for children of these countries in the face of poverty. The death of mothers during pregnancy, delivery or soon after the birth of a child leaves infants in a very fragile state in the face of extreme poverty or exploitation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HIV-AIDS is also a fierce adversary to the advancement of women in Africa. More than 60% of the people infected are women and that has countless repercussions, in particular, reduced education of children, a decrease in per capita GDP, and more food crises, because women are at the heart of the agriculture industry in those countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must also mention the struggle to eradicate such diseases as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV-AIDS, which is the main cause of early death in sub-Saharan Africa, and the fourth leading cause in the world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for promoting environmental sustainability, Canada is truly pathetic right now thanks to Conservative inaction. Canada's withdrawal from Kyoto reveals the Minister of the Environment's lack of awareness and vision. Two weeks ago, she decided not to act on Canada's commitment to poorer countries to help them reduce their greenhouse gases. This proves that this government does not care about our planet's and our children's future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last goal is to establish a global development partnership that includes all countries struggling against poverty. That way, all human beings, whether they are born in Quebec or in Rwanda, would be guaranteed the basics of life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support and my party's support for bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A>.

    </p><a name="Para55943"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same government that, as soon as it came to power, tore up the Kyoto protocol, turned its back on poor countries seeking to help stop global warming despite their many social problems, spent billions of dollars on arms, but failed to keep its word on the millennium development goals, turned its back on its commitment to correcting the fiscal imbalance with Quebec and reneged on its promise to establish a new program for older worker adjustment. </div>

The bill is a central part of the four goals of the Make Poverty History campaign which asks us to enact legislation to make ending poverty the exclusive goal of Canadian foreign aid in a way that is consistent with our human rights obligations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received correspondence and visits from hundreds of people in my riding who support this campaign. I want to make it clear that I strongly support the international campaign to make poverty history. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my constituents, 14-year-old Sally, has written to me several times on this campaign. She has also written to the Prime Minister and has urged the Prime Minister to show true national and international leadership on the issue of making poverty history. In her most recent e-mail to the Prime Minister, she says that all the eyes of the world are on us and that she wants Canada to show real international leadership by increasing support for HIV-AIDS prevention and treatment programs in developing countries, investing in public health care in developing countries, promoting access to affordable medicines and cancelling the debt of the poorest countries. We should heed the words of Sally and show the world that we are determined to act to end world poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in this House should be supporting the bill, which is very similar to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A> put forward by my colleague, the member for Halifax, who is our party's international development critic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, Prime Minister Pearson authored the report “Partners in Development”, in which he put forward the idea of the government providing 0.7% of gross national product to official development assistance, as well as 0.3% of ODA coming from the private sector. Since then, several countries have met this goal, including Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Most recently, several members of the G-8 agreed to reach that goal, the U.K., Germany, France and Italy, but sadly Canada did not make that commitment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of ODA in Canada is quite sad. We have never reached our goal of 0.7%. The highest was in 1974-75 at 0.53% and peaked again in the late eighties and early nineties. During the Liberal government's term in office from 1993 to 2005 it cut official development assistance in half from 0.44% to 0.23%, which is quite shocking. Incredibly, Canada rated 14th out of the 22 OECD members in terms of official development assistance as a percentage of our gross national income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else disturbing that began under the Liberals was the first move toward redefining ODA so that it would include not just humanitarian and development spending but also military assistance as well. We now see, through what is happening in Kandahar, Afghanistan, how that is pertinent today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must guard against changing the definition of official development assistance. Changing the definition could allow the government to artificially inflate its ODA figures by including some money spent on national defence or foreign affairs, which has nothing to do with reducing poverty, and then deem that to be part of the spending on ODA.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government should not be able to change the goals of development assistance at a whim. The commitment to reducing poverty must be put down in legal form to bind the actions of government. The bill would guarantee that official development assistance would be focused on poverty reduction, which is a good thing. This would ensure that Canadian money was used to fight not just the effects but also the causes of extreme poverty. The bill, therefore, would give real hope to those in poverty.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that the Conservative government is opposed to this legislation, because in February 2005 the Prime Minister endorsed the idea of this legislation in a joint letter to the former prime minister which was also signed by the leaders of the Bloc Québécois and the NDP.

This bill fully addresses Canadians' concerns about the international aid Canada provides. That is why we should not only salute the initiative by the member for Scarborough—Guildwood, but also support its implementation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of my various parliamentary duties, especially on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, I have long had the opportunity to talk with Canadians about this important issue, which concerns our country's commitments and responsibilities in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether from members of the public who take the time to express their views individually or from associations involved in international aid and businesspeople, we always hear the same message, stated loud and clear. Our resources must be allocated with greater concern for effectiveness, transparency and good democratic governance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practical terms, this means that the vast majority of Canadians not only feel concerned by this major issue, but also demand that our international aid really promote the values that characterize our country. We must work to ensure that Canadian aid initiatives abroad are better targeted so that our country really attacks the poverty that afflicts so many peoples that are part of the human race.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, young people strongly support this objective, as evidenced by the large number of international solidarity organizations that are found across the country, even in schools, and that youth intuitively gravitate towards, often very early in their education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our youth are therefore sending a very strong message that we as parliamentarians must listen to, because they represent the future of our nation and its role in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's world, where so much economic, technological, scientific, cultural and democratic progress has been made, it is scandalous that peoples in whole areas of our planet still suffer such extreme poverty that they do not even have the bare necessities of life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, our government and others, as well as multilateral organizations such as the UN and many more, declared that they would work towards reducing poverty. However, as we have seen, it is not enough to make a declaration. Concrete action is required to achieve real results. In this regard Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A>represents a true step forward because it unequivocally states that “all Canadian development assistance abroad is provided with a central focus on poverty reduction”. This is crystal clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed in its present form, as I dearly hope, this bill will give us a legislative tool enabling parliamentarians to better oversee Canada's efforts to reduce poverty. This bill also seeks to provide better means of assessing the true impact of our international aid, in a context where accountability for management of public resources is increasingly important in the conscience of our citizens, and will lead to greater transparency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparency is required for the Canadian government to provide its citizens with a clearer account of its management of international aid. I mentioned the goal of poverty reduction. However, there are other crucial aspects of this bill which make our support all the more important. These include the requirement to respect international human rights standards. Canadians are very clear on this issue: they do not want international aid to support oppressive political regimes that do not respect human rights, the rights of workers or the duty and obligations of any democratic country with respect to its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state must seek to improve the well-being of its citizens. It must have no other purpose. Thus, international aid must never be used to line the pockets of tyrants who are incapable or unwilling to take on such a responsibility and one that we cannot shirk. This bill also requires the government to ensure that the criteria for Canadian foreign aid include respect for the principles of sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns regarding responsible management of natural resources and environmental conservation are also an important focus of our fellow world citizens, for today and the future, as well as the responsibilities they demand of their governments in those areas. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para55968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a matter of clarity or common sense. We see it all too often these days: the planet's ecological balance is seriously threatened by the destruction of resources and pollution has crossed our borders, only to now affect us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, we Canadians are connected to everyone else on the planet, whether we like it or not. In terms of environmental degradation, the future of our entire species is at risk.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore take action in this area, as well, or we would be reneging on our responsibilities to future generations, who are just as entitled as we are to live in a healthy ecological environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why it is so important to include this element in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A>, since we can no longer avoid this aspect of international aid. The issues inherent to human development are becoming increasingly interconnected, and resolving one depends more and more on resolving the other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, this bill contains an essential element of our international aid that not only must become an integral part of the responsibilities of any government in the world today, but that also addresses the concerns and desires expressed by so many of our fellow citizens. Accordingly, it is the duty of this Parliament to pass this bill and we should be privileged to do so. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member has a reputation that has put him at odds with other members of his party when it comes to children and family issues.

    </p><a name="Para55975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pleasure for me to participate in this evening's debate. I am on record both here and outside the House as supporting measures that assist families and children. One example is my public opposition to the clawback by the Liberal Party of Ontario of the national child benefit from some of our neediest children in Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Renfrew County Child Poverty Action Network, CPAN, is asking for the public's help in its backpack campaign that supplies backpacks and shoes for children who may otherwise have to do without. Due to the overwhelming demand, there are so many children who are in need. In my riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, children suffer from the clawback of that benefit. As a result CPAN is asking for the public's help to assist us in filling every request. Sixteen dollars buys backpack supplies for one child, and $20 to $40 will purchase shoes. I encourage those who are able to help to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to support the plan of the new Conservative government to provide parents with a $1,200 annual allowance for each child under the age of six.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the choice for child care allowance is to support the choices of all parents of young children, whether they choose to work, study or stay at home with their children, live in a small community like Eganville, a rural community like Brudenell, a small city like Pembroke, or do shift work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55979"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point this out in the context of the private member's bill before us today for what is being argued by other groups that deal with child poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective way to help parents is not through another government program that eats up more cash by administering a bureaucracy rather than what is actually provided to the recipient. The most effective way to help is to provide the cash directly to whom we want to assist. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was never the intent of our new Conservative government to fully subsidize the cost of institution based child care. Not all parents use or choose to use such care.</div>

The phrase “beer and popcorn” I believe was used to criticize parental choice in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the bill gives to aid recipients in other countries the right to petition or challenge the type of aid being delivered. Yet when our new Conservative government proposed to give the same right to Canadian parents to make child poverty history in Canada by providing a $1,200 annual allowance for children under the age of six directly to their parents to use as they deem necessary, members opposite opposed this child poverty initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of Parliament with many of the same concerns when it comes to family as the the hon. member for Scarborough—Guildwood, I welcome the interest in international development that the bill demonstrates. However, as my colleague on this side of the House has already stated, while the intent of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A> is good, it falls short in terms of practicality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill as it is drafted could hamper Canada's ability to make a positive and effective contribution to international development. I will not go into the detailed reasons why the bill is unworkable since the hon. member for Crowfoot has laid them before the House so clearly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a long tradition of international engagement and of meaningful contribution in international development and to poverty eradication. We were at the forefront of the very first formal international development initiative in the 1950s called the Colombo plan. Hundreds of Canadian people travelled around the globe in the early 1960s to serve as volunteers to help people in developing countries. Many of those volunteers went on to become leaders in private and public sectors. In fact, they set an example that has been followed by thousands of their compatriots every since.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right at this moment, as we debate this bill in the House, a number of our fellow citizens, some from my own riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, are working around the world in Africa, Latin America, and yes, Afghanistan, lending a helping hand and making a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada and Canadian citizens are committed to making lives better for people around the world. We do it because we are compassionate and caring, and because it is the right thing to do. Our fellow citizens have indicated they are supportive of Canada's efforts to eradicate poverty around the world. Consistent with their compassion for the less fortunate, the new Conservative Government of Canada is committed to providing much needed assistance to the world's poor. To achieve this objective, we are committed to poverty reduction as seen most clearly in our commitment to the millennium development goals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para55992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium development goals are the global yardstick against which the world can measure progress in key areas. These goals were agreed to by every country, including Canada, in September 2000 at the United Nations millennium summit. They continue to provide a framework for the global community to work together toward a common end.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goals, which include reducing poverty and hunger, achieving basic education for all, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and forming global partnerships for development, represent a minimum agenda for action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure members of the House that our new Conservative government understands the importance of international development work. The Speech from the Throne clearly stated that the Prime Minister and our government are committed to making Canadian development assistance more effective. We are reviewing our aid to strengthen its focus and to put resources where the impact will be the greatest and to show tangible results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, has not concentrated on implementing the principles of aid effectiveness in our bilateral operations, and this is the opinion of the member as an MP in the old regime in bringing forward this private member's bill, our new Conservative government is certainly prepared to examine this position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is working with countries that are committed to improving governance and making effective use of resources, countries such as Tanzania and Ghana. I am pleased to say that our efforts at undertaking this innovative work are showing some very positive results. In Tanzania, for example, Canada and other donors have focused on primary education, which has yielded a very impressive outcome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the program began in 2002, the enrolment rate has soared from 60% to more than 90%. More than 32,000 new teachers have been recruited and nearly half of all students in primary schools are girls. In fact, now that donors are aligning and coordinating their approach to basic education, we are seeing amazing results throughout Africa. Between 2000 and 2003 the number of children out of school dropped from 44 million to 40 million. When we consider that the population rate has continued to grow, this is a substantial achievement. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important, the number of girls in school continues to grow. This is a very positive thing, not only for girls but for their communities as well. When girls are able to access education, it means improved family income, better agricultural productivity, better health awareness, delayed marriage and healthier children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para55999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could cite many other examples, but I understand that tonight my time is limited. Nevertheless, before I conclude I think it is important to put on the record the fact that the new Conservative government is committed to international development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first budget allowed us to show how serious we are about advancing Canadian values and Canadian interests on the international stage. By 2010-11 we will have doubled international assistance from 2001-02 levels. In other words, it will grow to about $3.8 billion in 2006-07 and then to approximately $4.1 billion in 2007-08.</div>
    </p><a name="Para869332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I welcome and appreciate the spirit in which the hon. member for Scarborough—Guildwood has proposed the bill. I look forward to continuing the debate about the provision of development assistance abroad and the debate here at home on how we can make poverty history here in Canada.</div>

Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I want to say what a pleasure it is to speak on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195279,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195279&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-293</A>. I congratulate my colleague from Scarborough—Guildwood for having the foresight to put forward this bill, a bill that over time has been supported by members from every single political party in this House, including that of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the need? Over the last 50 years the international community has spent more than $2.3 trillion on aid. I am going to focus my comments on sub-Saharan Africa because that dark corner of the world is the only place in the world where lifespans are decreasing and poverty is increasing. In fact, 30 years ago, the average income in sub-Saharan Africa was twice that of Southeast Asia, but today it is half that. Indeed, as I said before, for many reasons it is the only place in the world where lifespans are decreasing and poverty is growing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is ironic given that sub-Saharan Africa possesses 40% of the world's natural resources. Why in the midst of the resource-rich countries is there this grinding poverty that is inhumane for any person? The reasons are actually quite complex, but there is much we can do. My colleague's bill would go a long way to focusing CIDA, to make it an organization focused to task and to do that which is required to alleviate this grinding poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption, conflict and a lack of capacitance: these three are major problems in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately for too long our aid has been unfocused and scattered and too much of it has been spent here in Canada. That is why this bill put forward by my colleague from Scarborough—Guildwood, contrary to the comments made by members of the government, would actually aid the  Minister of International Cooperation. It would enable her to have an accountable, focused, effective agenda so that Canadian taxpayers' money would be spent most effectively to actually make poverty history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do? As a previous speaker said, let us focus on the millennium development goals. When we Liberals were in government we focused those efforts on 24 countries. How about if we also do the following? We can focus on primary health, primary education and water and food security, along with corruption and governance issues. Those are niches where we can make a big difference and those are things that we can do on the ground.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience in 23 visits to Africa and working there as a physician, it has been profoundly tragic to see what takes place. Many of these countries are actually set up to fail. In fact, the aid nexus can be seen as a big funnel, with the big circle on the top where the money goes in and the little circle down at the bottom where the people are. Money comes in that way and frameworks are built, but the frameworks are given to countries that do not have any chance whatsoever of implementing them because they do not have the capacity to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can do is take up the Canada corps, the plan that our previous prime minister put forward, use that as a vector to be able to pool the best and brightest we have in our country and use those human resources here in Canada for work abroad. We can do it because we have an interesting demographic issue in our own country. As our population ages, we have a collection of individuals who are young retirees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If 60 is the new 40, then we have a population of people with the resources, the capabilities, the talents and the desire to work abroad. By working abroad they will be able to fill that capacity in these developing countries through working with the local populations, not only to provide the care and the expertise but also to train the people on the ground. We can do this in our own country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to administration, I would encourage the government to look at what UNAIDS has done in terms of developing an effective administrative structure. CIDA would be wise to look at the three ones: one oversight mechanism, one framework, and one administrative body. If it does that with respect to aid and development, we will be able to have a focused, effective and administratively functional aid department and we will have aid initiatives that will make a difference on the ground.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820">(1820)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para56011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us have travelled abroad, I think, and for those who have had the privilege of being in developing countries, they will have seen and they will know of the incredible courage and talent that exists in these countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the people just want to have an opportunity. They just want to be free of somebody trying to kill them. They just want to be free of somebody trying to shoot them. They just want to be free of people who are putting the people's money into their own pockets and thereby depriving them of the basic social structures that all of us enjoy in this country. In short, they just want to have a chance. They just want an opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last point, the AIDS pandemic, where the government did not put forth an opportunity at the AIDS conference in Toronto, here is something we could do. What if the Prime Minister were to stand up at the United Nations this week and state that Canada was going to plant its flag on the care of the pregnant women and the care of orphans?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56013"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through focusing on the care of pregnant women, we can use it to build the health care human resources structures, the prevention, the education and the testing. We could deal with our partners and with the ARVs, the antiretroviral medications.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we give these medications to a pregnant woman after her first trimester, the incidence of the transference of the virus to the fetus is reduced from 40% to 1%. It is a simple, lifesaving and effective plan that will save millions of lives and reduce the sea of orphans that is happening now and will only worsen as time passes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56015"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 14 million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa right now. That number will balloon to 18 million in the next five years. In the next 10 years that number will be up to 25 million, with no end in sight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a country can decide this week that we are going to stand up and make the care of pregnant women and orphans our contribution to the fight against AIDS. It is simple, effective, easy to do, easy to understand and focused. We could do this in the 12 to 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that we have chosen to focus on. In doing so, we will start the process of enabling the international community to have an effective plan on the ground that is going to save lives and turn the tide on this pandemic that will claim up to 250 million lives in the next 30 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the history of our planet has threatened our species as much as this one virus. I would implore the government, and indeed I would beg and beseech the government, to take this opportunity to do this. We have wonderful people in CIDA with extraordinary capabilities. Eighty per cent of them, tragically, sit across the river in Hull. We need to get some of them out into the trenches. We need to get them into our embassies and high commissions. We need to get them working on the ground with the countries. We need to align our efforts with the principles and ideals that the people on the ground want, consistent with that which will be effective for the poor and the poorest of the poor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to focus on the five areas that I mentioned, primary health care, primary education, water security, food security, governance, and anti-corruption activity, we would be able to make a difference. We would be able to save lives. We would be able to ensure that Canadian taxpayers' moneys are going to be spent wisely.</div>

    </p><a name="Para56020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in this government share a view on the importance of ensuring the government does what it can to help others abroad in alleviating poverty and addressing those issues in developing countries. That is why in our budget last spring we committed to add $320 million to our international assistance funding and that was in addition to already budgeted increases over five years. This puts Canada on track to more than double international assistance from 2001-02 levels by 2010-11 at which point it will amount to over $5 billion per year. It is an important amount, particularly in light of the many competing domestic and international priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the bill, unfortunately, although it is very well intentioned, is naive in terms of some of the unintended consequences. I read from the legislation which says, “Development assistance may be provided only if the competent minister is of the opinion that it contributes to poverty reduction”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's international development assistance has historically, even under the previous government, and I give it credit for this, gone well beyond poverty reduction into other very important areas: democracy promotion; the training of judges on how to run a proper judicial system; good governance support like that; and helping former communist countries translate their statutes into other languages so they can get accession to the European Union. These are all examples of financial support we have given to other countries and they are consistent with Canadian values. They are certainly consistent with the values of this government of promoting freedom, promoting democracy, promoting human rights and the rule of law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say that we are going to shut it down so we can no longer promote democracy around the world, to say that we can no longer help countries, which are struggling to develop their institutions, by supporting them in developing good civil service and good governance and by helping train promising new parliamentarians on how a democratic system works and so on, programs we have done in the past to help countries overseas make that advance, all of which we think is very important to make them good, stable parts of the world, none of that would be permitted under this legislation. That is unfortunate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for Canada to continue to play that important role. Think of all the projects around the world. In Afghanistan, which is our principal recipient of foreign aid, we are involved in things that go well beyond poverty reduction. We are training civil servants. We are helping people develop the institutions they need to run government. We are helping people with schools. Is a school part of poverty reduction or not? Is creating civil servants part of poverty reduction or not?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An argument could be made that those are not strict poverty reduction. The concern is that we will run into realm where that kind of activity to help people develop those institutions simply will not be permitted. For our government, those priorities of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law have to remain paramount.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate this, Canada has been providing development assistance in some places to help people in civil society, for example to help women become more involved in their community and to defend their rights. That is nothing to do with poverty alleviation necessarily. It has to do with fairness, equality and justice, but those are issues we should be allowed to encourage and continue to support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in countries which continue to have authoritarian regimes that resist democracy, should we not be able to provide support for elements of civil society whether they wish to promote the environment or other democratic development? Should we be allowed, through our development, assistance to give opportunities for people to learn, to study, to acquire education elsewhere so they become more effective when they return home to their countries?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these are important priorities and part of the tradition of development assistance for Canada and something that we should continue to do in our tradition of promoting democracy, human rights, rule of law and freedom, great Canadian values that should not be ruled out by this well-intentioned, but poorly written legislation.</div>

What is official development assistance all about? Is it about poverty alleviation or is it about a whole bunch of other things? That is what this bill is about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that on the other side we received what I might call spiritual support for the notion of the bill. As in life, spirit does not pay the bills. I hope that we are strong enough and that we will see through this issue, so that we put some teeth in our official development assistance. The teeth are in this bill. The practicality is in this bill. Whatever else this bill is, it is not naive. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not dispute with the hon. member that we do other good things. I do not dispute that for a second. Our official development assistance must be focused on poverty alleviation and only on poverty alleviation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact those are values that we all adhere to and support, fine, then we will continue to do those things, but it will not come out of this particular budget. It will only count if it is in favour of poverty alleviation. Those are the issues and that is where the debate is to be joined. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see this as a naive bill, with the greatest respect to my friend opposite. I see this as a bill that asks for accountability. Presumably accountability is something that this new government thinks is an important thing. Apparently, those members thought it was an important thing when they were in opposition, as Mr. Harper, Mr. Duceppe and Mr. Layton wrote to the then Prime Minister--</div>

    </p><a name="Para56041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That concept was supported by the foreign affairs committee in June 2005 and in the House on June 28, 2005, with all party support.

I cannot use it for security. I cannot use it for other noble goals. I can only use it for poverty alleviation”.

I still have not received a satisfactory answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56058"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students and families continue to deal with absurd tuition fees, even for average-income Canadians. Graduates have a hard time starting their careers while burdened with crushing student loan debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that current financial aid and tax credit programs for students are nothing more than a motley assortment of measures that do nothing to improve access to or enrolment in post-secondary studies. Too many Canadians are left behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professors are faced with huge class sizes and a shortage of resources and materials. In colleges and universities, administrators are having difficulty balancing tight budgets as they face a pressing need for new professors, infrastructure renewal and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provinces and territories are still under tremendous pressure. Some have frozen tuition fees, often at the expense of class sizes and quality. Other have allowed tuition fees to skyrocket.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government must stop confusing tax credits with a well-thought-out social policy.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para56063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time the government put some real effort into achieving a universally accessible, high quality public system of post-secondary education and skills training in Canada. The federal government has a key policy role to play to increase access to post-secondary education for all Canadians and that starts with a substantial, long term reinvestment in core funding through a dedicated transfer to provinces and territories. Even the premiers can agree on that, if nothing else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social justice aside, surely a Conservative government can see the economic case here if Canadians are to compete globally. In the global economy they need access to quality education. We also know that post-secondary education enrolment has remained static since 1995. Is it any wonder, when tuition costs have reached unreasonably high levels in those provinces?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a young married couple this summer, each with $35,000 of student debt at 30 years old. They asked me how they could even begin to think of starting a family. I had no answer. Would a reasonable person think this is a manageable debt level at that age?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to hear that the 2006 budget of the Conservatives helped all students. It helped those students who already had a scholarship and tossed a free textbook at the rest. We can help all students by funding truly accessible, quality post-secondary education with lower tuition, more teachers and better resources across the board.</div>

Government investments in education and training are critical to productivity and economic growth. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As announced in budget 2006, our government has taken action in support of a more skilled and educated workforce by including measures for students, apprentices and tradespeople. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures for students include: a new $500 tax credit to help about 1.9 million post-secondary students with their textbook costs; making all scholarship, fellowship and bursary income received by post-secondary students exempt from income tax; and expanding the eligibility for student loans to more students from middle income families. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures for apprentices include: a new tax credit of up to $2,000 per year for employers who hire and train apprentices to help them cope with the difficulties they face in finding skilled tradespeople; and apprentices themselves will be eligible for $1,000 grants as of January 1, 2007 as part of the new apprenticeship incentive program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures for tradespeople include: a new tools tax deduction of up to 500 for tradespeople for the cost of tools in excess of $1,000 that they must acquire as a condition of their employment; and, in addition, we are increasing the limit to $500 on the cost of tools eligible for the 100% capital cost allowance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help provinces and territories provide high quality post-secondary education, the government is also providing a one time payment of $1 billion through the post-education infrastructure fund to support critical and urgent investments in innovation, accessibility and infrastructure. Moreover, this government is making progress on its commitment to restoring fiscal balance which has a post-secondary education component.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, over the past several months the Government of Canada has been consulting with provinces and territories, stakeholders and citizens. The Government of Canada is committed to hear from as many individual Canadians and stakeholder organizations as possible that share an interest or role in post-secondary education and training. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sought input from a range of Canadians, including businesses, employers, educators, training organizations, students, parents, academics and experts. Also, over 100 national stakeholders were contacted to share their views. They were encouraged to forward the invitation to their regional and provincial member organizations as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is continuing its consultations with provinces and territories which, along with Canadians' views, will help inform the proposal for post-secondary education and training that will be brought forward as part of the Government of Canada's overall proposals to restore fiscal balance in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Canada's economic prosperity and social well-being is dependent on our ability to nurture a highly educated and skilled workforce. Governments must work together to ensure that our country's post-secondary education and training system remains of high quality and responsive to national and provincial economic and social needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, post-secondary students need to be supported for their hard work in pursuit of academic excellence and this government is committed to this goal.</div>

    </p><a name="Para56080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Statistics Canada has recently released a report showing that undergraduates in Nova Scotia, for example, pay almost double the tuition that undergraduates in Manitoba pay and that is over triple what undergraduates pay in Quebec. It is something like $6,700 in Nova Scotia compared to approximately $1,700 in Quebec. Does the parliamentary secretary believe that is making post-secondary education accessible to all Canadian students?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56081"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para56083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to address the situation where we allow the provinces to participate more fully in the revenues that we receive. Quite frankly, there is quite a large disparity between the revenues received by governments on a provincial basis and revenues received by the Government of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ongoing discussion we have been having with the provinces and territories is to find a solution to fixing the fiscal imbalance situation and where provinces can more fully participate in the revenue sharing. Once that happens, and I am quite convinced it will, provinces will hopefully have the financial ability to address the post-secondary education delivery system more effectively.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that after years of neglect by a federal government that did not even acknowledge there was a fiscal problem in the cost sharing between governments, federal and provincial, this government is committed to solving that problem. We hope to make our first foray into that with the approvals, frankly, of all of the provinces and territories this fall. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the hon. member that hopefully by no later than the next fiscal year and the budget of 2007 many of her concerns will be answered.</div>

I would have liked to rise in the House today during the adjournment proceedings and tell the government that the company had got the business restarted and was asking for a helping hand. Unfortunately, this is not the case. There no longer is a business to speak of, unless a miracle comes along to restart it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para869333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many lessons to be learned from this situation. If the Lévis shipyard cannot be turned around—which seems to be the case, since the piecemeal selling off of the shipyard has been announced—the Conservative government must at least acknowledge that if we had a real marine development policy in Canada, businesses would have been interested in investing in that shipyard, which, in terms of infrastructure, was quite an interesting opportunity. However, when I remember the response given by the Minister of Industry, the hon. member for Beauce, Lévis' neighbouring riding, and when I read the comments made by the hon. member for  Lévis—Bellechasse when the Teco Management company was supposed to get the business back on its feet, I can almost understand why we now find ourselves in this situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the minister replied, and I quote:</div>
    </p><a name="Para56090"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—that the Lévis shipyard is up and running thanks to the private sector and free enterprise.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para56091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today we see that it is not up and running because the necessary conditions are not in place for free enterprise to develop. This has not been done by the former governments nor by the current Conservative government, which has been around since January 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same matter, the hon. member for Lévis—Bellechasse, who seemed a bit alarmed by the question I asked in the House, said the next day in response:</div>
    </p><a name="Para56093"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—I will ensure that the shipyard and its partners have the same financial mechanisms as other Canadian shipyards.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para56094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that we do not have a maritime policy in Canada. We are in a situation where shipyards are having a hard time surviving and those that do are making suggestions and proposals, like Groupe maritime Verreault. However, their suggestions do not get the attention we would expect from the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take the opportunity of this adjournment debate to ask the government to review the whole transfer costs policy. You know how it is, when work must be done on a vessel, the transfer costs that must be paid to bring it to the shipyard must be taken into account. The federal government decided to include these costs in its calls for tenders. Consequently, shipyards like the Verreault shipyard on the St. Lawrence River are at a disadvantage compared to those in the Maritimes, like Irving shipyards. That has major negative consequences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Conservative government not take into account regional and local development when it sets its standards concerning transfer costs? It is a legitimate question and I would like the parliamentary secretary to answer it to see if, for the sake of fairness between regions, he should leave those costs aside.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, those transfers raise other issues, concerning non-competitive supply for example. In that regard the Conservative government should consider what was done with regards to the Davie shipyard. It must realize that if nothing is done, if there is no real development policy for the shipbuilding industry the other shipyards in Canada will also suffer, and I mean those that are still able to operate. That would be really a shame, considering the current tremendous market opportunities on the international scene.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, mere months after the minister said that the private sector had given new life to the Lévis shipyard, that it was for the best and the way things should be, does the parliamentary secretary believe that the government should learn from it and propose a real shipbuilding development policy, at least to save the shipyards that are left?</div>

    </p><a name="Para56100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member for the opportunity to talk about Canada's shipbuilding industry. The Canadian shipbuilding industry has a long and proud history. Today we have firms recognized as world leaders in the manufacture and repair of ships, the building of offshore oil and gas structures and supplying shipyard related services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key stakeholders for our shipbuilding and marine industrial sector include offshore oil and gas exploration, marine transportation, and defence and security. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the member opposite should know, the Government of Canada supports the shipbuilding industry in a variety of ways. With budget 2006 Canada's new government is working to ensure an economy durable enough to withstand the up and down cycles of world markets by creating a business climate that will attract investment to Canada for the benefit of all Canadians. Budget 2006 demonstrates our commitment to keeping this strong economy moving forward and signals how we want to proceed as a government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way is through the economic boost that will come from 29 tax cuts for Canadian businesses and individuals, reductions worth $20 billion over the next two years. Small business owners will have more money to invest in their businesses because we raised the income ceiling for the small business income tax rate and then cut that tax rate from 12% to 11% by 2009.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2006 we are reducing the general corporate tax rate from 21% to 19% by 2010. We eliminated both the federal capital tax and the corporate surtax. The unemployment rate in Canada remains near its lowest level in more than 30 years, while the employment rate is near its highest on record. This is because, despite challenges in some parts of the manufacturing sector, Canadian companies continue to grow and create more jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para56105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is reviewing various industrial sectors with a view to increasing our economic competitiveness. For Canada to compete globally, we have to establish an environment for investment where those who wish to innovate and bring new products to market have the opportunity to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that the Canadian shipbuilding industry sees government support in two more direct ways: a 25% duty on vessels imported from countries with which we do not have a free trade agreement; and in June the government announced a $2.9 billion joint support ship project for Canada's navy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will deliver three multi-role vessels for Canada's navy and includes a base cost of $2.1 billion, plus an estimated $800 million in contracted in-service support over 20 years. The Canadian shipbuilding industry is well positioned to play a significant role as the joint support ship project proceeds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes the global commercial and trade environment is changing and we are evaluating our policies to meet that new reality.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the weeks and months ahead, the government will review what is the most effective role for it to undertake with respect to the Canadian shipbuilding industry. We are committed to the competitiveness of Canadian industry and to fostering a climate where all businesses, including shipbuilding, can thrive.</div>

    </p><a name="Para56111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, would it be possible to get from this government, in the review it claims to be undertaking, a real policy on ship building, so that the remaining shipyards, such as the Groupe Maritime Verreault shipyard in Méchins, the Océan shipyard and others can continue to develop and have a chance at getting their share of the market?</div>
    </p><a name="Para56112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current inaction of the Conservative government has contributed to today's result, namely the closure of Canada's largest shipyard. We were told the private sector would take care of it and that it was not up to the government. Today we are facing the consequences. There is nothing to be proud of on this day and the parliamentary secretary  did not even bother to mention the name of the Lévis shipyard in his answer.</div>

    </p><a name="Para56114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of effort both from the Quebec government and the federal government to save Davie Industries. Everyone tried very hard, but even with all the government support, it did not save Davie.</div>
    </p><a name="Para56115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry Canada has provided substantial support to Davie over the years.
