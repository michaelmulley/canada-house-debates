[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MAINTENANCEOFRAILWAYOPERATIONSACT,1995">MAINTENANCE OF RAILWAY OPERATIONS ACT, 1995</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-77, an act to provide for the maintenance of railway 
operations and subsidiary services, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the current dispute in the railway 
sector requires firm intervention by the government to ensure 
the resumption or continuing, as the case may be, of railway 
operations and subsidiary services.
<P>
	It is also important to provide a process to resolve matters 
remaining in dispute between the parties. The bill before the 
House today, the Maintenance of Railway Operations Act, 1995, 
orders the resumption of operations at Canadian National, 
Canadian Pacific and VIA Rail, and provides for establishing 
mediation-arbitration commissions in respect of each of the 
bargaining units of the three railway companies.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, negotiations in this dispute have 
been extremely difficult. They covered a number of complex 
issues including employment security, occupational flexibility, 
extended routes and the two-tier compensation system for train 
crews. Despite efforts to reach an agreement which went on for 
several months, the parties failed to agree on these crucial 
issues.
<P>
	Both the unions and the employers agreed that Canada needs a 
viable and competitive railway system. Even the Bloc 
Quebecois admitted as much in its motion in amendment of 
section 12. The matters remaining in dispute must be resolved if 
the parties are to start establishing relations that will help them 
meet the challenges of the future.
<P>
	I believe the dispute settlement process provided under this 
legislation will help them defend and reconcile their interests 
dispassionately and objectively. It did not take long for the 
impact of work stoppages occurring in the railway sector to be 
felt across the country. The disruption in railway operations has 
affected certain industries, which are now unable to obtain the 
parts and supplies they need for their operations and cannot ship 
their goods to destinations on domestic or the world markets.
<P>
	Many businesses that depend on railway freight services are 
being forced to lay off workers. The economic repercussions of 
a prolonged work stoppage in the railway sector are very serious 
and cannot be tolerated for very long. The same applies to the 
impact on passengers who normally take VIA Rail and are now 
deprived of those services.
<P>
	I realize that the parties have tried to settle the various 
disputes, but the government is faced with a situation that 
requires immediate and decisive intervention. Consequently, 
last Tuesday, I had to table the Maintenance of Railway 
Operations Act, 1995. This legislation consists of three parts. 
Part I concerns the Canadian National Railway Company; Part II 
concerns the Canadian Pacific system and Part III concerns VIA 
Rail Canada.
<P>
	All three parts of this legislation shall come into force 12 
hours after the bill has received royal assent. Under this 
legislation, the disputes will be quickly resolved, thanks to a 
mediation-arbitration commission that will have 70 days to 
carry out its mandate. The mediation-arbitration process gives 
the parties one last chance to reach an agreement with the help of 
the commission. If at this stage the parties are unable to reach an 
agreement, the commission will have the power to make final 
and binding decisions on the matters remaining in dispute.
<P>
	In its work, the commission shall be guided by the need for 
terms and conditions of employment that are consistent with the 
economic viability and competitiveness of a coast-to-coast rail 
system in both the short and the long term, taking into account 
the importance of good labour-management relations. In the 
course of the debate on this bill, we have heard different 
interpretations of sections 12, 34 and 56 from the employers, the 
unions and the Bloc Quebecois, and I would like to clarify the 
legislator's intent in this respect.
<P>
	The best job protection that workers can have is the certainty 
that their employer is competitive. In this context, it is 
increasingly clear with successful companies that 
competitiveness depends on good human resources 
management, which includes harmonious labour relations. We 
realize as well that various 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11016"> 11016 </A></B>
<P>
internal and external factors may affect a business' 
competitiveness, including such things as quality of 
management, efficient financial management and, in the case of 
railways, appropriate regulations, not to mention the economic 
environment the business is in.
<P>
	There is another factor we must not forget, however, and that 
is labour costs. In the present case, we want both parties to come 
to terms with these facts. Accordingly, the legislator must 
express the commissions' mandate clearly. We are not requiring 
the commissions to achieve specific results in terms of job 
security clauses or any other working condition of the railway 
workers.
<P>
	The unions and the companies will have ample time to tell the 
commissions what working conditions they consider consistent 
with economic viability and good union-management relations. 
No specific results must be achieved. We have simply indicated 
the factors the commissions are to take into consideration in 
their deliberations.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, it is only if the parties fail to reach an agreement on 
these matters during the mediation period, that the commissions 
will have to reach a final decision. All in all, this is a fair 
approach to resolving the disputes between the parties.
<P>
	I would like it to be perfectly clear that the government 
remains firmly convinced that collective bargaining is a far 
better way to resolve disputes than emergency legislation. It is 
significant that nothing in the legislation prevents the parties 
from modifying any provision in the collective agreements, new 
or changed, except for the provision on the term of these 
agreements.
<P>
	Furthermore, should the parties reach an interim agreement or 
concur on the approach to resolving the matters in dispute, the 
establishment of the mediation-arbitration commission could 
be deferred.
<P>
	The facts speak for themselves. Considerable effort has gone 
into resolving the various disputes between the three railways 
and the various unions, but to no avail. The bill before us gives 
the parties one final chance to agree through mediation, before 
the outstanding issues are submitted to arbitration.
<P>
	Since the start of negotiations, the parties have indicated that 
they were opposed to legislation to put an end to the dispute, and 
I agreed with them on this point. Unfortunately, they have not 
managed to reach an agreement and, as a result, have caused 
serious economic problems in the country by initiating work 
stoppages. As the government, we took the necessary steps and 
tabled the Maintenance of Railway Operations Act, 1995.
<P>
	I therefore ask my hon. colleagues to support this measure so 
that it may be adopted.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, regarding this issue, the Bloc deplores the 
government's simplistic position and its extravagant if not 
biased speeches.
<P>
	The government has always stressed the negative 
repercussions of the strike and its real economic impact, of 
which we all are aware, and really went overboard on the issue. 
It kept on repeating that factories were closing everywhere in 
Canada, coast to coast, particularly in Quebec, since the Bloc 
Quebecois was the government's main opponent in the House on 
the issue. Very few economic sectors in Quebec were spared the 
threat of imminent closures, yet nothing of the sort actually 
happened.
<P>
	The government tried to terrorize and brainwash people by 
exaggerating the economic consequences. I do not want to 
minimize the consequences, but I think that a government 
dealing with such an extensive labour dispute, like the one 
currently affecting the country, should be more reserved, 
impartial and objective. The government should not upset 
people; it should reassure them while trying to find a solution. 
The government did the opposite. We were witness to an 
incredible demagogic offensive, we were bombarded with a 
slew of disastrous predictions, which did not turn out to be 
accurate.
<P>
	We must nevertheless acknowledge that considerable 
economic interests and jobs are at stake, not only in the sector 
directly affected, but also in the sectors spinning off from it.
<P>
	We are not oblivious to the economic impact of the strike. We 
proved this by proposing to the government, as early as last 
Monday, a classic solution of the sort normally used to settle this 
kind of dispute.
<P>
	With such an important issue, it is not only necessary to look 
at the economic impact, but also to be nuanced. So, this is an 
example of the kind of issue debated in the Parliament of Canada 
where we need to examine all facets, if we are to debate it wisely 
and carefully, in the interest of all.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	One of them is also, of course, that there are important issues 
and interests at stake that immediately call into question 
Canadian democracy, Quebec democracy and parliamentary 
democracy, and this has been forgotten in the debate.
<P>
	What we in the Bloc Quebecois wanted to do was to situate the 
dispute, and the resolution mechanism, in the perspective of a 
balance to be achieved between the right to negotiate and peace 
on the labour front, for all of this was at stake. It is not true that 
because a strike has broken out that an illegal act has been 
committed. It is not true that because a strike has broken out that 
it is necessary to push the panic button, to bring out the big guns. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11017"> 11017 </A></B>
<P>
And it is not true that because a strike has broken  out that the 
opposition can be prevented from speaking about it in this 
House. Events have taken a very strange turn this week.
<P>
	The Bloc has been vilified for wanting to recognize rights that 
exist in law, in legislation passed not by a foreign Parliament, 
but by the Parliament of Canada, legislation that provides for the 
right to strike, that recognizes the existence in Canada of this 
fundamental democratic right.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> In a democracy such as ours, in a country in 
which we have often been faced with labour disputes and in 
which we have acquired some experience in resolving this sort 
of conflict in a civilized and competent manner, it is vital that 
we take this opportunity to examine the need to maintain some 
sort of balance.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I believe I am disturbing the people across the 
way who are speaking.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Colleagues, this debate is so important 
that we are sitting on a Sunday. It is a very historic sitting. I 
would ask all hon. members to have the courtesy to please hear 
out the person who has the floor at this time and all other 
members who will be speaking in this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have a system of law. We live 
in a society governed by laws. We have a parliamentary 
institution, and a government, charged with enforcing existing 
legislation. The entire Canadian legal system as it relates to 
labour relations is based on the freedom to negotiate, on the 
objective of ensuring peace between the parties to an industrial 
dispute and the harmonious operation of the factories and 
workplaces once the dispute has been resolved. I believe that the 
freedom to negotiate is a key element in all of this.
<P>
	The freedom to negotiate is dependent on the balance between 
two powers: the very important economic power wielded by the 
employer, which is countered by the union with its own brand of 
power, given to it under law in the form of the right to strike. It is 
a legislated right.
<P>
	One would think that, generally and normally, when both 
parties exert pressure, when they act in good faith without 
anyone trying to disrupt the process, when they are willing to 
make concessions, with common sense prevailing, an agreement 
will eventually be reached. The legal system and government 
services are designed to help reach an agreement because 
everyone understands that the best and only effective solution is 
a negotiated solution.
<P>
	What happened in this case? They may well criticize the Bloc 
Quebecois for being the only party in this House which defends 
the legal system of free collective bargaining. Well and good, 
but they forget that the main culprit in this dispute is the 
government, in particular the  Minister of Labour, who turned 
into an employer in this matter.
<P>
	They will say that, the opposition being the opposition, it will 
attack the government and try to bend the truth a little. It is 
common practice in politics.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Instead, let us read the report and conclusions of an impartial 
witness, conciliation commissioner Hope, whose job was to 
observe, minute by minute, the progress of the negotiations.
<P>
	This report contains devastating comments on the behaviour 
of the government and the Minister of Transport. In this matter, 
the government, far from favouring settlement and protecting 
against any external disruptions the progress of the usual 
settlement mechanisms whose results are based on free 
collective bargaining, sought to disrupt and destroy this balance 
by siding with the employer. I would even say that it became an 
employer. The government behaved like an employer in this 
matter. I would go so far as to say that it prevented the official 
employers from negotiating.
<P>
	Let us suppose for a moment that we are all CN 
presidents-we would be happy in some respects, of course, as 
this would be a remarkable promotion-and that our 
representatives, reporting on the discussions, tell us that we 
ought to make concessions on our demands to drop 
non-monetary clauses, that if we make no concessions, the 
resulting strike would hurt us and that the public may not 
appreciate our behaviour during the negotiations, so that we 
must make concessions.
<P>
	Normally in such conditions, an employer makes concessions 
and uses some common sense to reach a compromise with the 
union, which is also under pressure. But why would an employer 
negotiate when, like the president of the CN in this case, he has 
the government's assurance that it supports his position, as 
denounced in the Hope report, when he knows that the 
government is 100 per cent behind him and that, in the event of a 
labour dispute, the government will take out the bludgeon to 
quash immediately the right to strike and pass special 
legislation providing for a third party to impose working 
conditions? There is no motivation to do so.
<P>
	In fact, the employers did not negotiate in this case. They did 
not negotiate because they relied on the complicity, I would say 
the collusion, of the Minister of Transport, expecting him to 
make sure that back to work legislation would be tabled in this 
House within hours of the start of a strike or lockout.
<P>
	So, what was bound to happen did: the employers put on the 
table major clawback demands and, according to Mr. Hope, 
refused to negotiate. They even refused to consider the 
possibility that their demands be discussed or revised in any 
way, or that reservations be made about them. They did not even 
take part in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11018"> 11018 </A></B>
<P>
discussions on their demands. It was a take it or leave it 
proposition.
<P>
	So, of course, this lead to a conflict. Barely 12 hours into this 
conflict-and this illustrates what I just said-the Minister of 
Labour, who is new to the issue, sets in motion a process to break 
the strike through special legislation. The Minister of Labour is 
therefore a major player in this issue. We must recognize 
however that there was not much she could do because, as the 
saying goes, the scene was set. All she now had to do was follow 
the script. The scene was set thanks to the great producing 
abilities of the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	What could she do except become the employer herself and 
ensure that the strike could be quashed immediately, while at the 
same time setting the working conditions? I think that a Minister 
of Labour worthy of the name would have borne in mind that she 
or he has a job to do and is not accountable to the Minister of 
Finance-who wants to privatize CN-but is responsible for 
social peace and to the parties. Her role involved trust and 
confidence.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour should tell her colleague for transport 
that, while he had been able to reach the agreements he wanted 
with his friends, the employers, she, as Minister of Labour, 
could not take sides, that she was responsible for social justice 
and fairness. What should she have done then?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I am not saying that the government should tolerate the 
negative effects of a strike indefinitely. It would have been 
appropriate to table this special legislation on Monday and get 
the parties back to work. It is at this level that the Minister of 
Labour could have played an important part in cabinet. She 
could have enlightened her cabinet colleagues and told them: 
``Yes, we will get these people back to work to avoid the 
negative effects of the strike, but we will also ensure that the 
parties can negotiate without interference, while it is still time 
to do so. For the first time in this conflict, we will put in place 
conditions such that the parties involved can negotiate in good 
faith and find a solution to their problems. We will force the 
employer to negotiate by not giving it the assurance that the 
government will impose back-to-work legislation and thus 
serve its interests''.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour knew what to do very well. She was 
very familiar with the usual solution in such a conflict. This is 
something that people involved in labour relations learn 
quickly. The minister knew what to do: go to mediation. She 
knew it so well that she did so in another conflict, in Montreal, 
which had persisted for 25 months. In this case, it has been 18 
months, but in Montreal, it had been 25 months. So what did she 
do? Following the wise counsel of her senior officials, and 
assuming her responsibility as Minister of Labour, she decided 
that there would be mediation in the Port of Montreal conflict, to 
force the parties to conduct true negotiations under appropriate 
conditions, so that a negotiated solution might be reached. The 
process proved to be successful in the days that followed. 
Considering  that the solution is known and that it gave very 
positive results in Montreal, why does the Minister of Labour 
decide to go all out in the case of the railway work stoppage and 
pass a piece of legislation imposing working conditions?
<P>
	I want to be clear. We are not opposed to back-to-work 
legislation. We believe it is legitimate to resort to such 
legislation and we would have agreed to do so as early as 
tomorrow, so that by Monday evening the act would have been 
passed in this House. However, we do not accept the fact that 
this situation be used as a smoke screen. After all, what do you 
think is the goal of the government in this issue?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear. Hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The comments I just made raise a question. 
Those who may be listening to us on this lovely Sunday 
afternoon may ask themselves: What did he just say? Why 
would the government do such a thing? Why would a decent and 
responsible government do that? Why would a government team 
up with the employers to distort the conflict resolution process? 
This is a good question, but we have the answer.
<P>
	The answer was provided by the Minister of Transports. The 
Minister of Transport himself told us in this House last week, I 
think it was on Thursday, but I could be wrong, any way he told 
us on Wednesday or Thursday in answer to a question put to him: 
``Yes, but the truth is that our goal is to get rid of some 
provisions in the collective agreements''. They do not like these 
collective agreements, so they are going to change them, to do a 
hatchet job, to scrap them.
<P>
	Once this is done, they will be able to soothe the employers 
and sell the CN. They will sell the CN and make a lot of money 
out of it, because they will do so at the expense of the workers 
and of their rights and entitlements. They will shave down the 
collective agreements and then hand a very nice package to the 
private companies interested in buying the CN. This is the goal 
sought by the minister. He has said so in this House. We thought 
that was what he was trying to achieve, in fact, we were quite 
sure of it, but now he has admitted it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> I think the government was swayed by the 
interests of the employers in this issue. You can tell just by the 
way it has handled it, if only at the parliamentary level. Will 
people not find it strange how eager the government was to 
muzzle the opposition, to use tactics which had never been used 
before in this House? For the first time ever, a gag was put on 
committee proceedings. That is really something. Was there an 
emergency? Was there an imminent political crisis? Was there a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11019"> 11019 </A></B>
<P>
state of war? No. But the government was eager to fulfil its 
commitments to its friends in the railway companies.
<P>
D (1330) 
<P>
	The government wanted to do a job on the CN collective 
agreements, in order to be able to sell the company for less. This 
is the goal it was aiming for and that is why, throughout last 
week, the government did things I really did not like. One of our 
hon. colleagues, the government whip, even stated yesterday 
that the Bloc was costing the taxpayers $17,000 a hour, all for 
nothing. We, in the official opposition, were blamed for having 
these sittings. We, in the official opposition, in a democracy, 
were blamed for making Parliament work. Here was someone 
complaining because we have a Parliament. With this kind of 
arguments, we will soon be without a Parliament at all, we will 
just have to close shop.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> What are we debating here this weekend? I 
understand that the government is very unhappy to be working 
on Saturday and Sunday-maybe not as unhappy as NDP 
members, our allies in the defence of social causes, who have 
not shown up at all during these two days-but are we not 
dealing with some important issues? We did not come here this 
weekend to talk about trivial things. We came here to talk about 
Canadian democracy. We came here to try and find a way to 
reconcile two fundamental rights, namely the right of citizens to 
have access to public services, in this case rail transport, and the 
right of unions and workers to negotiate their own working 
conditions instead of having these conditions imposed on them 
by the government or by an arbitration commission.
<P>
	Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the Bloc Quebecois is proud 
of the way it has defended the rights of workers in this dispute. 
Even if we were the last party left in this House to defend the 
rights of workers, and it seems to be the case, we would be proud 
to do so. It is a tribute to Canadian democracy and I think that we 
should be recognized for doing this job for and in the place of the 
Liberals who have abandoned their traditional creed and who, 
just like the New Democrats, frightened by the right wing wind 
that has been blowing in this House since the arrival of the 
Reform Party, have caved in to the pressure in a situation which, 
normally, would not have warranted this course of action.
<P>
	All the Liberals who are here have made speeches in the 
House in the past to defend the very same viewpoint that we are 
defending today. I am sure that they feel bad and that they regret 
giving in to the pressure from the Reform Party because soon 
there will be only one party in Canada apart from the Bloc, and it 
will be the Reform Party and what it stands for.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Of course, there will be consequences. The 
government may have conducted fifteen polls over the last 
week-a government has money to conduct polls-and these 
polls may have shown that people in English Canada support the 
Liberals' position, but it has to be careful not to be shortsighted. 
This situation will have far-reaching effects and the 
government, having chosen to have working conditions imposed 
by a third party, will find itself in an awkward situation when it 
is all over.
<P>
	I wonder how the government will be able to sell CN if the 
labour relations climate in that company is what it could become 
after this move by the government. I hope not, but the climate 
may not be very good. When employees are legislated back to 
work and, especially, when they know that their terms and 
conditions of employment will be determined by a third party, 
that nothing will be up to them to decide and that vested rights 
will be dropped, the climate may not be very conducive to 
efficient privatization.
<P>
	Furthermore, this government feels it made a tremendous 
concession by promising, and in fact this is in the bill, to have 
judges chair the arbitration commissions. I have every respect 
for judges. I am a lawyer, and I know we have the best judges 
anyone could wish. The integrity of our judicial system is 
beyond question, and I am glad to have an opportunity to say 
this, but because of that integrity, our judges will act according 
to the mandate they are given.
<P>
	What will that mandate be? If we look at clause 12, we see that 
the arbitrators will have an extremely narrow mandate to work 
with. The arbitrators have no flexibility because they will have 
to make their decisions strictly on the basis of economic 
viability and competitiveness in the short and longer term. This 
means, and I refer to the people who accept these appointments, 
that their hands are tied, and I know several people who will 
refuse to sit on these commissions. There are decent people who 
will refuse to sit under those conditions because they do not 
have enough latitude to hand down a fair judgment. I am not 
saying that those who do accept are any less decent, and I have 
every respect for them, but they will be working within a very 
restrictive framework where they will have no flexibility and 
will have to more or less accept the employers' arguments, one 
by one.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	They are going to change the role of the arbitrators as well, or 
at least try, by turning them into the employers' allies. The 
Minister of Transport probably had something to do with that as 
well.
<P>
	I wish the Minister of Labour, in her initial performance as 
minister, had been more impervious to the power-hungry 
demands of the Department of Transport's appetite for power.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11020"> 11020 </A></B>
<P>
	We can only hope that everything will turn out well. I hope 
so. But the trouble with this debate is that the government tried 
to suppress it. The government tried to suppress the debate. 
This government does not like debate. It does not like 
dissenting opinions. This government will only give in to its 
own impulses.
<P>
	In concluding, we will vote against this legislation, of course, 
and we hope that in the future, the Department of Labour will 
take a more objective stand and will act more responsibly with 
respect to its obligations to the parties, both employees and 
employers, because there are not only employers, there are also 
employees.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are sitting here today on a Sunday, I am told, for the 
first time in the history of Parliament at a cost of $25,000 an 
hour.
<P>
	Why are we here? We are here because of very vindictive, 
narrow minded, malicious partisan politics brought on us by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. They have done it for two 
reasons.
<P>
	They have done it, and it seems appropriate, to try to get their 
separatist movement back on the tracks. It seems they do not 
care what else they derail in the process of doing it. Also they 
have done it to hit the Liberal Minister of Labour in her home 
area of the Montreal docks. This is the kind of vindictive 
partisan politics that makes this place something less than the 
public has a right to expect. That is the reason we are here this 
weekend.
<P>
	The reason we are here at all, however, is that the Liberal 
government did not act as quickly on the matter as it could and 
did not act long before it happened to prevent it from happening 
in the first place.
<P>
	The reason that we come to Parliament is twofold. First, it is 
to bring solutions for new problems such as the drunk defence. It 
was something that was not anticipated but it came about and 
requires legislation to repair it. Second, we come here to provide 
solutions to all problems brought forward by the parties and 
people of the past, problems such as the budget.
<P>
	We try to find permanent solutions to different problems, not 
stop gap ones. It does little good to sit in Parliament and come up 
with a solution that will have to be repeated year after year. The 
solution to the transportation problem has to be a permanent 
one. The Liberals have failed to do it in the past and their current 
legislation fails to address the permanent need for a solution as 
well.
<P>
	Transportation strikes are not new. Turning to recent history 
the Vancouver port was out in 1994 and back to work legislation 
was brought in. What was wrong with the legislation? There 
were two things wrong. First, as in this case it took too long to 
come forward. There was a lot of economic pain and suffering 
by people far beyond  the port of Vancouver. We will never 
recover from some of that damage. Second, the Liberals brought 
in something relatively new by way of settlement, final 
settlement offer legislation.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	That is something I favour but it was wrong in the way they 
did it in that specific case, the reason being that the two parties 
had bargained on the basis of an old system. When they were 
given the new system they were not given the opportunity to go 
back to the table to try to resolve the problem using the benefits 
of the new type of settlement. The concept was good but the 
method in which it was done was not as good as it could have 
been.
<P>
	Then there was another Vancouver strike in 1995. That time it 
took only two days for the Liberals to act to get the port, which is 
very crucial to the entire Canadian transportation structure, 
back to work.
<P>
	What is interesting is that we have the Bloc Quebecois sitting 
down the way, these brand new saviours of the labour movement 
in Canada. These were identical situations. In neither case did 
we hear a single word from the Bloc Quebecois. I reject its 
rationale for being the great voice of labour this time. It is 
nothing but petty partisan politics.
<P>
	Now we have a rail strike affecting all of Canada. The Liberal 
legislation that is coming forward does not resolve the short 
term wrong because of the method of arbitration. The Liberals 
have gone back on the solution they used in Vancouver in 1994 
and have gone to straight binding arbitration. Hopefully the two 
parties will be able to get together during the mediation period 
and resolve some of the differences. However the most 
outstanding issue, that of job security, is unlikely to be resolved 
through regular bargaining across the table.
<P>
	When it comes time to move to the arbitration settlement we 
have an arbitration council set up with one representative of the 
union, one representative of the company which is owned by the 
government, and one representative selected by the government. 
Is there anyone in the House who has any doubt about how the 
arbitration will come out?
<P>
	The whole way in which labour negotiations are carried out is 
unbalanced and unfair in our modern society. If the employees 
of a whole chain of grocery stores in the Ottawa area including 
all the surrounding communities went out on strike or were 
locked out for some reason, it would be primarily between the 
employees and the owners of the store. People would be 
inconvenienced but they have alternatives. Life would go on. 
The general economy would not be hurt.
<P>
	However it is absolutely unthinkable that we would have the 
police standing by watching someone being mugged or raped 
because the police were out on strike. It is equally unthinkable 
that we would have a fireman standing by on a sidewalk 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11021"> 11021 </A></B>
<P>
watching a house burn, perhaps with a small child inside, 
because the firemen were out on strike.
<P>
	For 22 years I was an air traffic controller. During that time 
there were two strikes, both of very short duration. In both cases 
the controllers were legislated back to work. In both cases when 
the controllers were on strike they did not picket because they 
recognized that a relative handful of people had too catastrophic 
an effect on the entire air transportation industry and it would be 
unfair and unrealistic to put up a picket line.
<P>
	It ended up that air traffic controllers to this day retain the 
right to strike but each and every controller is designated in the 
event of a strike to provide minimum safety services. It has been 
decreed and declared in court that those minimum services are 
everything they do. The reality is that they can go on strike but 
they still report to work, the only difference being that their 
contract is null and void. They are in great jeopardy of having 
something legislated that bears no resemblance to their old 
contract.
<P>
	We penalize certain groups of people in society because they 
are important. We have to come up with some kind of alternative 
so that we can fairly deal with people who are important. If we 
can come up with something that is fair and equitable, why 
should we not look at broadening the type of system it replaces?
<P>
	Long ago in the history of mankind people lived in caves. 
They had no fire for a long period of time. They got their food by 
going out with clubs and hunting down wild animals. We have 
progressed from that. We progressed into the Middle Ages when 
there was slavery and continuous ongoing wars. We evolved 
further and developed North America. Still there were very 
tough times. There were winters when many peopled starved to 
death. There were diseases for which there was no treatment. 
There was a lack of help for people in any situation. The changes 
that have taken place are evolutionary. This is the way we 
progressed and evolved into the society we have now.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Unions started in the 19th century because companies were 
oppressive. The managers and owners of certain big industries 
were absolutely brutal in their unfair treatment of workers. That 
was the origin of unions. Then we got into the process we have 
today, this concept of negotiation and strike when agreements 
could not be reached.
<P>
	That started in the 19th century. As we approach the 21st 
century is it not realistic to think there should be some evolution 
in the process of trade unionism and in labour/management 
negotiations? It is time for evolution to take place in that area as 
well.
<P>
	Most collective bargaining ends up in a settlement. I have 
talked to many unions and they believe this happens because 
they always have a hammer, the option of a strike. We must 
reinvent the hammer. The new hammer, unless someone has a 
better idea, which I have not heard anyone bring forward, is final 
offer settlement arbitration; the very hammer the government 
used for the legislation to settle the Vancouver port strike in 
1994.
<P>
	When given the proper time to be dealt with, this tends to 
settle most if not all of the differences between the two parties. 
It then brings the parties as close as possible on all the remaining 
issues so that each party can get into the most reasonable 
position so that position will be selected during the final 
arbitration.
<P>
	The government needs to carefully design legislation to deal 
with a new form of labour settlement. The loss we have 
experienced in this strike goes beyond the transportation 
industry and beyond the strike itself. There are many types of 
transportation that will be set up now that will shortcut our 
ports. They will get goods as quickly as possible across the 
border into the United States and be sent from there. There are 
also many ships that have now found that instead of dealing on 
the east coast of Canada they can deal more reliably on the east 
coast of the United States.
<P>
	Rail unions and their companies, other companies, workers, 
farmers and Canadians have paid a very heavy price for this 
strike. Let it not be in vain.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to continue the debate on Bill 
C-77, the Maintenance of Railway Operations Act, 1995, in 
order to ensure the country is not deprived of vital rail services 
essential to the economic well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	My riding of Windsor-St. Clair is the beginning of the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor, or the end depending which way you 
look at it. In Windsor we think it is the beginning.
<P>
	Thursday night and Friday morning I was in Windsor. I went 
to the VIA rail station, to the CN yards and to the CP yards. I 
spoke to the people on the line. I spoke to the people who have 
been telephoning my office and who have been asking to return 
to work.
<P>
	The Ford plant in Windsor was slowed down. The Ford plant 
in Talbotville just east of my riding was closed, all because of 
the rail strike. People in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada are out 
of work. People in Quebec are out of work. These people are out 
of work and the Leader of the Opposition stood here today and 
told us that suddenly he is filled with the milk of human 
kindness for collective bargaining.
<P>
	Where was he on December 15, 1989? Where was he when the 
cabinet and Parliament enacted the Government Services Re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11022"> 11022 </A></B>
<P>
sumption Act? The parties were the Treasury Board and the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada. The Leader of the 
Opposition was in the cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	There were two conciliation boards established and there 
were enforcement procedures, binding arbitration on the public 
sector. Where was the Leader of the Opposition?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition was here. He voted yes to back 
to work legislation providing arbitration for public sector 
employees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He was here. He voted yes and he put the public servants back 
to work. Where is he today? He is voting no. I ask why. All 
Canadians should ask why. The people of Quebec should ask 
why.
<P>
	Could it be that he is trying to curry favour with the unions in 
Quebec? Could it be that he thinks they are so foolish, so naive, 
so stupid they will vote for separation because he turned his 
back on what he voted on in 1989? Could that be? I think not.
<P>
	The people of Quebec who are out of work want to go back to 
work. The people in Windsor who are out of work want to go 
back to work. The people of Canada want to go back to work.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to speak for a few minutes on this very 
important matter. I want to say that Canada needs new labour 
relations and it needs a government capable of imposing 
leadership in this regard. Leadership in this regard means that it 
must establish that employers have rights, and so they do, but 
that employers must respect the rights of their employees.
<P>
	In Quebec, we can say that we entered a new era of labour 
relations some ten years ago. This happened because we went 
through a major crisis and because employers and employees 
realized that they needed each other and that each had to respect 
the other so they could come to terms with the new economy.
<P>
	The federal government could have shown the way today in 
this time of crisis, because this transformation in the economy is 
a time of crisis. It is showing the way backwards, back to a time 
before labour laws empowered workers to counterbalance this 
extremely powerful economic force ever so slightly.
<P>
	We are entering an era where the economy seems to be the sole 
force. Only states, governments and parties would seem to be 
able to stop the relentless march of the force to globalize the 
economy that is sweeping everything in its path.
<P>
	This is why we consider it so important right now for the 
government, for the government of this country we live in, to 
assume its responsibilities and affirm that there is more than just 
the economy. Yes, the economy is important, but people too are 
important and respect for people is important. It is true today for 
the unions, but tomorrow it will be true for individuals, who are 
not entitled to unionize or have no opportunity to do so; they too 
will be swept aside by the relentless advance of this force to 
globalize the economy.
<P>
	People will have to stand up and let it be known that there is 
more than just the economy. The economy is important, but 
other things are important too.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour had the opportunity to show that she 
considered the need for railways to be viable and competitive.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	But, at the same time, she could have given the judge the 
mandate of looking at what the workers had gained over the 
years and of trying to reach a balance, so that when the workers 
returned to work, when they started to look to their future, they 
would envision co-operation between them and management.
<P>
	Instead, she gave one mandate: short and long term viability 
and competitiveness, while keeping good labour-management 
relations in mind. Anyone with any knowledge whatsoever of 
labour relations knows that giving such a mandate to a judge, 
who has the last say, constitutes a major change of course.
<P>
	I am sad to see that, instead of giving workers a minimum 
guarantee in one of her first laws, the Minister of Labour chose 
to give in to the government's commercial and financial 
demands.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> It is regrettable and deplorable. I think that 
Quebecers will also remember this when they have to make 
important choices regarding their future. They will remember 
that the woman the government chose to lead the referendum 
fight was forced to use strong-arm tactics, was put in a situation 
where she could not even choose to be impartial, which was 
what we expected her to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a few comments to make, of course, 
regarding an event in ancient history, December 14, 1989. Let us 
go way back when, back to an era where the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean championed different causes than those he 
defends today.
<P>
	On December 14, 1989, this House adopted Bill C-149, 
bringing public servants back to work.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Who did this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> A Conservative government. Just look at what 
was forced on recalcitrant workers at the time: a fine of $500 to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11023"> 11023 </A></B>
<P>
$1,000 per day for each worker; $10,000 to $50,000 per day for 
union representatives; $50,000 to $100,000 per day for union 
bosses.
<P>
	Would you like to know which parliamentarians voted for 
such draconian measures way back then? Here is the list of those 
who said yes to such a bill. The hon. member opposite knows all 
about voting yes. I will read off a few names: Atkinson, Beatty, 
Blackburn, Bosley, whoops! Bouchard, Lac-Saint-Jean. Just 
look what I discovered.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker: </B>The hon. chief whip for the government has 
only a few seconds left to conclude his remarks, after which we 
will allow the hon. member for Mercier to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had almost forgotten who 
exactly was responsible for imposing arbitration on public 
servants, with the same type of bill as this one. Who am I talking 
about? The Conservative members sitting at the time. And as I 
said a moment ago, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, in an 
earlier incarnation as a Conservative, also voted at that time in 
favour of similar measures.
<P>
	I would ask the member opposite what brought about this 
sudden conversion of the member for Lac-Saint-Jean. Perhaps 
she can explain to us the virtue by which the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean and his colleagues are now possessed, but by 
which it seems they were not troubled on December 14, 1989?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that at that time the 
hon. members opposite had voted against this measure. I also 
believe that, when they were elected, they gave not the slightest 
indication that if this sort of situation arose this is what they 
would do.
<P>
	As for the reasons behind the evolution of the Leader of the 
Opposition, I can tell you that I know, and he has said so himself, 
that he has evolved in many areas, and that he has no problem 
defending himself.
<P>
	And I know that those members who are now laughing 
promised not to do what they are doing. And they are supposed 
to be ``liberals''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In keeping with the letter and spirit of the law, 
the hon. member has approximately 90 seconds. The hon. 
member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to state the case in one question for the hon. member for 
Mercier.
<P>
	We are discussing back to work legislation for the purpose of 
protecting a third party which is being injured, the exporters, the 
shippers. What has happened in this House is that the Bloc 
Quebecois has attempted to move the discussion into the future 
of collective bargaining. No one is talking about that. That is not 
the purpose of this debate.
<P>
	We are not saying it should be done away with. All the Reform 
Party has said and what we are saying in this debate is that a third 
party is being injured. The Leader of the Official Opposition did 
not mention and was not even concerned about the economy or 
the exporters and farmers, the people who are being hurt. He was 
not one bit concerned.
<P>
	It is time for the Bloc Quebecois members to admit whether 
they are concerned in the least about the third party we are 
talking about here, the people who are being injured, and 
Canada's broad economy. They are being injured by this delay, 
this nonsense and politics which are going on by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>Mr. Speaker, I have two things to say. The first 
is that in life as in labour relations everyone finds himself at one 
time or another in the role of third party. Let me tell you a story.
<P>
	One day I picked up a worker who was furious because the 
subway was not running outside peak hours, because in Quebec 
we have essential services during a strike. This health worker 
said to me: ``I hope this is over soon. When we go on strike, 
people want to see us back at work as quickly as possible''. We 
are always the third party in somebody's eyes. It is important 
that we remember this when it comes to labour relations. That is 
my first reply.
<P>
	My second is that there should be an anti-strikebreaking law 
in Canada because 75 per cent of workers in other Canadian 
provinces are covered by one.
<P>
	And thirdly-
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, immediately following the adoption of this Order, the sitting shall be 
suspended and shall be reconvened for the sole purpose of attending a Royal 
Assent;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Provided that, immediately upon return from the said Royal Assent, the

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He said: The purpose of this motion is to suspend the sitting of 
the House while the other place passes this bill and ensure that, 
by tomorrow, railway operations will have resumed in our 
country, so that, for instance, the people from the suburbs of 
Montreal who commute by train can do so tomorrow.
<P>
	The other day, the Leader of the Opposition congratulated the 
Minister of Labour on having resolved the conflict in the port of 
Montreal. But now the port of Montreal is cluttered with 
containers and, if trains could get rolling as soon as possible, 
they could be shipped out. This way, factories would get the 
parts they need and workers could keep working.
<P>
	That is why, for the last time, we ask the opposition to give 
consent to suspending the sitting of the House to allow this 
legislation to be enacted today and railway operations to resume 
tomorrow. I know that my colleague, the House leader of the 
opposition wishes to speak, but I hope that after he has done so, 
the sitting of the House can be suspended to ensure that this 
legislation be given royal assent before the day is over.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Members opposite 
have no need to worry about my wish to speak to this motion, 
Mr. Speaker. I have no intention of beating, or even getting close 
to, the recent parliamentary record for the longest speech on a 
motion, which was set by the current Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans in the last Parliament when he spoke for three hours on a 
fisheries bill. Despite the Deputy Prime Minister's invitation, I 
have no intention of beating this time record, far from it.
<P>
	Some matters must be clarified before we agree to adjourn.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Last Monday, when the government and the opposition faced 
off on the rail transportation problem, we had no idea that we 
would sit until today, Sunday, before solving this serious 
problem. We were prepared from the first and sincerely believed 
that it was possible to settle this matter very quickly with a 
minimum of co-operation.
<P>
	This past week was certainly not democracy week in Canada's 
Parliament. In fact, the government set parliamentary rules 
aside four times in order to pass this bill. This week, they set 
aside the rights of CN workers as well as the very rule of free 
collective bargaining in Canada. This was certainly not the most 
glorious week for the government and the new Minister of 
Labour.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> This was neither democracy week nor a very 
good week for the Minister of Labour, who will go down in 
history as the ultimate trigger-happy minister, who rejected all 
the recommendations in the conciliator's report, who refused to 
discuss the matter with the opposition, who refused to keep an 
open mind in this debate, who refused to co-operate with the 
people on this side in order to settle the labour dispute.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> During this debate, and particularly at third 
reading, members opposite referred to previous debates during 
which the Leader of the Opposition or other members may have 
held different views. But we are quite comfortable with that. 
After all, let us not forget that the Prime Minister and leader of 
this government fought tooth and nail against free trade, leading 
an extraordinary charge which lasted for months and which was 
also part of his leadership campaign. Back then, all the members 
opposite were against free trade, whereas today they extoll the 
virtues of NAFTA.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11026"> 11026 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Liberals want to talk about changing one's views, that 
is fine with us. Remember when they lambasted the previous 
Conservative government for making cuts to the UI program. 
Canadians and Quebecers are not stupid. The Liberals blasted 
the Conservative government regarding these changes to the UI 
program. Yet, as soon as they took office, the Liberals set out 
to do twice as much damage as the previous government had 
done.
<P>
	Before adjourning, let us remember how hard these Liberals 
fought to protect social housing in Canada. Now that they form 
the government, they cut all the budgets for social housing. 
These are the people we are dealing with, across the floor.
<P>
	We, as well as Canadian and Quebec workers, will remember 
the Minister of Labour and her government, which imposed four 
special motions to suspend the normal rules of Parliament. The 
first one, on Wednesday, March 22, 1995, was a time allocation 
motion limiting to one hour the debate at second reading. For 
those who are listening to us, the debate at second reading 
consists in examining the principle underlying the bill.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	When we are preparing to change the rules of the labour 
relations game, following the conciliator's report, it seems 
rather presumptuous to us, to say the least, not to allow 
Parliament to speak for at least a few hours on the principle of 
this bill. Only one hour to discuss the principle of the bill.
<P>
	Secondly, on March 22 as well, a second motion on the 
allocation of time, unheard of in Canadian Parliament, limiting 
the work of the committee to four hours. Why? Why not allow 
the committee a few hours to discuss the bill as a whole? It had 
only four hours and was obliged to stop its deliberations at 9 
p.m., when it could easily have carried on until 10 p.m. or 11 
p.m.
<P>
	This is the strongest evidence that the government and the 
Minister of Labour never had the intention of listening to what 
the opposition had to say.
<P>
	At 10 a.m., on Thursday March 23, even before the House 
began its proceedings, with no discussion between the 
government and the office of the Opposition House Leader and 
without any prior negotiations, the government decided, by 
tabling a particular motion here in this House, that we would sit 
Saturday and Sunday. It was not the opposition that decided this. 
It was at the government's request, and it is in the Hansard.
<P>
	A fourth time allocation motion, on Saturday, March 26, 
again limited the work of the House, this time to three hours. 
How in all seriousness can they have so little respect for 
workers' rights? How can they not want to listen for one second 
to what duly elected members want to say to the government? At 
no time, it must be said, did the opposition take a stand outside 
the rules of Parliament. We simply refused to suspend the rules 
of this House. We wanted the debate to take place in the same 
way as most, if not all, parliamentary debates, that is, through 
the normal process of discussion.
<P>
	At no time did I ever say to the government, to the press or to 
the electronic media that we wanted to filibuster this bill. On the 
contrary, I have always reminded the government and citizens 
that the opposition realizes that we have to resolve the railway 
dispute quickly yet responsibly and without contravening 
parliamentary rules, in order to avoid the economic problems 
associated with a lingering dispute.
<P>
	Although there was no indication whatsoever that we wanted 
to delay the work, no indication whatsoever that we wanted to 
put the bill off until later, the government decided to introduce 
no less than four special motions, one of which, need I remind 
the House, was to sit Saturday and Sunday.
<P>
	I was surprised. I was disappointed yesterday when the hon. 
government whip said that this was something absolutely 
unusual and wrong, and that we should not be sitting Saturday 
and Sunday, because it costs $17,000 an hour to run Parliament, 
and a little more to do it on Sunday. As if democracy did not 
warrant Parliament's decision to run as long as it sees fit, as long 
as it takes to solve problems affecting the citizens of this 
country.
<P>
	It is utterly unacceptable that a debate on a point as basic as 
the right to strike or the right of workers to have their say on the 
issue comes down to a question of how many thousands of 
dollars it costs an hour.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	As for the Deputy Prime Minister, she called members of the 
opposition stupid-what gall-because we talked about 
workers' rights. I have never seen such a thing. In the eight and a 
half years that I have been a parliamentarian, this is the first 
time that I have seen a Deputy Prime Minister stoop to so low an 
insult in describing the attitude of the opposition, which never 
did any filibustering, but merely wanted to ensure that 
parliamentary rules, the rules imposed on us by members 
opposite, were respected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Insult is the weapon of the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Before agreeing to let the House adjourn, I 
just wish to remind you and the population that, during the 
debate on this matter, the Minister of Labour refused to make the 
slightest concession allowing the workers not to disrupt rail 
transportation but to return to work and be heard. As even the 
conciliator admitted, the workers were not given the opportunity 
to be heard.
<P>
	We asked the government to give the workers a chance to be 
heard by imposing a return to work. We agree that they should go 
back to work, but they should be given a chance to be heard 
without the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. The 
Minister of Labour rejected this minimum demand by the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11027"> 11027 </A></B>
<P>
opposition, which would have allowed us to settle the whole 
dispute as early as Monday.
<P>
	Do not forget that, instead of agreeing to or discussing this 
demand, the Minister of Labour and the government adopted a 
hammer-like approach in conducting parliamentary 
proceedings this week. This is not democracy week; it is a 
record for a new minister recently elected to this Parliament to 
flout parliamentary rules four times in order to speed up debate 
and settle this matter as quickly as possible without any respect 
whatsoever for those involved.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would remind you that the Minister of Labour 
made a statement in this House which was quite surprising, 
coming as it did from a new member of Parliament who, we 
personally believed, wanted to advance labour relations. On 
March 22, the Minister of Labour said this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let us be realistic: Kruger is closed, while BÃ©cancour, Alcan and Petromont are 
in the process of shutting down. Let us do something, Mr. Speaker.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the Minister of Labour said. Are those the words 
of a serious-minded person? Who would make such alarmist 
remarks, when Alcan never ceased operating, BÃ©cancour never 
shut down, Kruger was closed for no more than 24 hours and 
Petromont remained open? Is it the responsible thing to do for a 
government minister to use scare tactics to settle a dispute?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Not only is this minister the bludgeon 
minister, but she is the minister of economic terrorism. This 
gives a good idea of what to expect in the Quebec referendum 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Imagine the Quebec referendum debate, in 
which she is supposed to represent this government. She was 
called in because the government wanted to have a credible 
spokesperson in Quebec. No sooner is she in that her first move 
as Minister of Labour is to violate the rights of the workers. How 
so? Through economic terrorism.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we cannot suspend the sitting of 
this House without first giving the people of Quebec this piece 
of advice: remember what the Minister of Labour did. Workers, 
whether unionized or not, do not forget how she handled her first 
labour relations assignment. Remember how she tried to scare 
people. Remember her arguments, arguments that turned out to 
be untrue. Remember that the Minister of Labour is to blame for 
the worst week we have gone though since we were elected to 
this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party and my colleagues here today support the motion 
before us because we want to get on with the job. We want this to 
move to the Senate and we want to have royal assent today. That 
is the responsible thing to do at this time.
<P>
	I also want to talk about democracy. The House leader for the 
Bloc Quebecois tries to epitomize democracy in the House. If 
members listen very carefully they will see his definition of 
democracy. One moment he talks about being for the worker. 
The next moment he talks about fighting for the economy of 
Canada. The next moment he is saying something about 
management. Very soon he is talking about the responsibilities 
of the Minister of Labour and how she should be involved.
<P>
	He is all over the place. I cannot understand any kind of 
definition of democracy in these guttural utterances. It is a 
delaying tactic in dealing with some very important legislation 
before us that must move to the other place.
<P>
	I would like to say to the Bloc Quebecois that democracy is 
representing those who need representation in an emergency 
situation. This is demonstrated by the legislation before us.
<P>
	We have had a group of people who needed immediate 
representation. There are the shippers, the exporters, the 
farmers and a number of other people who are innocent third 
parties who cannot be involved in the collective bargaining 
process. They are in need of representation in a democracy so 
that they have equal opportunity. What we have done in moving 
third reading is say those people are going to be represented in 
our system and are not going to be injured in any way. It is time 
to recognize that is an important aspect in this democratic 
process.
<P>
	On that basis we urge the support for the motion before us, 
that the House rises until the call of the Chair, that we resume 
and give royal assent so that tomorrow the transportation system 
is operating and taking its rightful responsibility.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the
