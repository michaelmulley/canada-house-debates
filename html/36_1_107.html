</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (for the Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-19, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part I) 
and the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to rise in the 
House to begin our final debate on Bill C-19.  We have come 
nearly full circle in our efforts to modernize Part I of the 
Canada Labour Code.  Perhaps a more accurate description would be 
that it has been a long and winding road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By now all members of the House will know that this road has 
been marked by extensive consultation.  There were numerous 
written and oral submissions made to the Sims task force.  The 
labour management consensus group wrestled with the difficult 
issues we debate today.  Parliamentarians debated with much 
vigour and passion in the last session the provisions of Bill 
C-66 and those in this session have contributed their ideas and 
suggestions over the past few weeks in the House of Commons and 
in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I wish to note that the Minister of Labour is in 
the House.  Generally he would be the one to give this speech. 
However, he graciously asked me to do this because I have put so 
much effort into the bill.  I would like to pay tribute to him 
because sometimes we can work a long time on legislation and 
never get a thank you.  I would like to say that the minister is 
a real gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have been part of this 
important debate, so no one will ever accuse us of rushing to 
judgment in determining labour relations legislation for the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us cut to the chase and look once again at some of the 
contentious items in this bill, items that no matter what 
decision we make about them, we may just have to agree to 
disagree. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1005

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first has to do with dispute resolution mechanisms.  Some 
opposition members have wanted to push back the clock of history 
and tradition by insisting that the code has built within it 
binding arbitration provisions.  They believe that this sort of 
“when in doubt, let us rely on the government to bail them out” 
mechanism is the best way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We beg to disagree.  Any built-in system of compulsory 
arbitration flies in the face of a century of deliberately 
developed labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would certainly be a 
departure from the practice of all Canadian jurisdictions.  As a 
nation we have made commitments to the principles of freedom of 
association, the right to organize, the right to bargain 
collectively and the ultimate right to withdraw labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the Reform heckling and saying garbage.  Unfortunately 
this bill has been tough because of the Reform.  They have not 
been supportive of the labour movement.  Clearly we believe in a 
democratic process in this country and we will continue to make 
laws for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These commitments are embodied in our membership in the 
International Labour Organization.  The system works very well at 
least 95% of the time.  To be sure, there are some disputes that 
will go to impasse and unfortunately work stoppages will occur, 
but this is the motor that drives the system and no one has found 
a better one.  If we move to a situation where lurking in the 
background there is some standing system of binding arbitration 
that can be imposed upon the parties, the result can only inhibit 
the principle of good faith bargaining.  Such a broad based 
weapon that could be imposed at the will of the government of the 
day has no place in our democratic tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first deputy minister of labour was a very wise man.  He 
held that post in 1900 and went on to become the minister and 
then the prime minister.  At the beginning of the last century he 
knew that the government had a role in the collective bargaining 
process, a minimal one.  His view, and I am talking about none 
other than the Right Hon. William Lyon McKenzie King, was: 
government intervention if necessary, but not necessarily 
government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a good view then and it remains so today, which leads us 
to the next topic of contention, grain handling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue which has perhaps given rise to most comments and 
correspondence both for and against is the provision in the bill 
which requires the continuation of services to grain vessels in 
the event of a work stoppage at our ports.  While the provision 
could apply in all regions, its main application would be on the 
coast.  Those hon. members who have been in this House for some 
years will be well aware that west coast longshore strikes and 
lockouts have all too frequently required attention by way of 
back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 25 years or so nine longshore work stoppages closed 
our west coast ports and seven of them had to be terminated and 
settled by legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two independent studies found that longshore employers and 
unions have avoided their collective bargaining responsibilities 
by using disruptions to grain exports to trigger back to work 
legislation.  The result has been more frequent legislative 
interventions than in other Canadian ports and industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the parties avoided their responsibilities and passed them 
over to parliament, they did not avoid damaging the west coast 
ports' reputation.  Frequent work stoppages at the ports severely 
undermined their reliability in the eyes of international 
customers.  Still, those who opposed the bill's provision, like 
the Reform Party, made it clear that they fear losing the 
assurance of legislative intervention.  Yet I say that no group 
in this country has the right to hold parliament to its beck and 
call.  No group should be allowed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our part, we remain committed to the basic principles of 
free collective bargaining, even in sensitive areas such as this. 
The Sims task force agreed. 
It examined the issue of essential services.  It concluded that, 
except for reasons of public health and safety, the right to 
strike or lockout should not be removed from any group of workers 
or any employer subject to the code.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The compromise that is included in the bill is specific and 
narrow in its focus.  It will enable the longshore industry to 
retain grain vessel work, but will remove grain from the equation 
in longshore collective bargaining.  It will also reduce 
disruptions to exports grain movements and discourage reliance on 
parliament to resolve port work stoppage.  At the same time 
collective bargaining rights will be maintained in both the grain 
handling and longshore industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claims that this provision discriminates against other resources 
by singling out grain for special treatment overlook the fact 
that grain has already been singled out by longshore employers 
and unions using it as a trigger for back to work legislation. 
We have refrained from following recommendations which would have 
divorced the longshore industry from grain handling and otherwise 
have intruded into its bargaining structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision has the full support of our western grain farmers 
and those in the grain industry who, unlike some other resource 
producers, have no relationship or influence on collective 
bargaining between the longshore employers and unions.  It is 
hard to understand how Reform cannot be responsive to their 
farmers, the grassroots of this country.  It is hard to 
understand.  We are committed to reviewing the effectiveness of 
this provision in 1999, following completion of the next round of 
west coast longshore bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not in my nature to issue dire warnings, but any 
indications of deliberate sabotage of this provision by the 
parties would not be looked on kindly.  Parliament cannot be 
consistently required to resolve labour disputes.  The parties 
have the ability to negotiate with each other and conclude 
agreements which are good for them and for the health of the 
ports.  They can and must give up the narcotic of government 
intervention and solve their own problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee members also expressed concern about the off-site 
worker provisions.  Debate centred around two fundamental rights. 
The first is the right to know.  In this case, the right of 
workers to know about unions and the right to bargain 
collectively are rights they have under the code.  Even if they 
are against joining a union they still have the right to know 
about organizing activities so they can make informed decisions 
for themselves.  The competing right is the right to privacy, the 
right to be free from what they might perceive to be harassment. 
Any reasonable interpretation of the way the provision is 
currently worded leads to the conclusion that both rights are 
well protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone the extra mile and have accepted the committee's 
recommendation in its second report.  It provides that the board 
may offer employees the option of refusing to give their name and 
address to the trade union representative if that is their wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that we live in an open society.  People have 
the right to communicate with each other.  They have a right to 
be informed.  With all the safeguards now proposed, I believe we 
now meet the test of providing both their right to privacy and 
their right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere was the scope of disagreement so wide among certain 
opposition members than on the issue of replacement workers.  The 
problem for consensus seeking was that their views were 
categorically in opposition to one another.  Some wanted to allow 
no replacement workers at all in the case of a strike or lockout. 
Others wanted no restrictions on their use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to deal with the question.  We carefully 
looked at concerns with the earlier wording in the previous 
version of the bill.  The provision now reflects the carefully 
crafted words of the Sims report.  To remind hon. members, the 
bill specifically prohibits the use of replacement workers for 
the demonstrative purpose of undermining a union's ability to 
represent its workers. 
That would constitute an unfair labour practice and will not be 
tolerated by the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet some members from both ends of the question remain totally 
unconvinced on the answer.  If the art of politics is about 
compromise then the art of labour relations is about balance and, 
just as important, the perception of balance.  Reasonable 
compromise and balance are what the current provisions represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard much in the debate at report stage about the 
certification provisions of the current code, the measures 
contained in the bill concerning remedial certification and the 
view expressed about them being undemocratic.  I must disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing undemocratic about union certification 
procedures under the Canada Labour Code which are similar to 
procedures in a number of provincial jurisdictions.  Majority 
support has always been and will remain the basis for union 
certification.  This is clearly stated in section 28 of the code 
and Bill C-19 does not amend that provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the question of mandatory votes, the Sims task force 
recommended that the board's authority to certify a union based 
on evidence of majority support should remain as should the 
board's current discretion to hold a representation vote in any 
case, and that is what Bill C-19 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have incorporated in the bill a provision similar to those in 
other jurisdictions, and that is remedial certification.  Its 
objective is really quite simple:  to change the conduct by those 
employers who would put a chill on organizing efforts, efforts 
which could intimidate employees from joining a union.  It allows 
employees the representation they would have achieved but for the 
employer's misconduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In commenting on this issue a University of Toronto professor of 
law told the standing committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate purpose of the provision—reflects a very 
fundamental legal principle, and that is no one should profit

is fast coming to a close.  Those who are subject to the Canada 
Labour Code do not want us to delay further.  In fact many 
witnesses appearing before the committee wanted fast action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most responsible observers, regardless of any particular 
concerns they may have about one clause or another, must conclude 
that Bill C-19 on balance meets the spirit and intent of the Sims 
task force, and by extension the very intentions of the 
stakeholders who played such a big role in determining the form 
of the legislation we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never agree to every last detail of every last clause 
and subclause.  However I think by any definition of the word we 
have in Bill C-19 struck a reasonable balance.  The time has come 
to put our words into action.

but on occasions like this one I have to ask myself just how 
democratic the House is.  Imposing time allocation on the bill at 
both report stage and third reading stage is simply not 
democratic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scheduling third reading on the shortest debating day of the 
week is a great example of a cheap shot.  I have so many speakers 
lined up for this debate that we could spend at least a day on 
it. I have not been recruiting.  People have been knocking on my 
door and sending notes over saying that they would certainly like 
to speak to the aspects of the bill.  This is our last shot at 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at how time allocation has been used in the 
House recently.  Parliament is about eight months old and time 
allocation has been imposed five times.  This bill had time 
allocation imposed on it the last time it came through the House 
known as Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess time allocation is getting to be the rule of thumb for a 
government that does not plan ahead.  The last time the bill came 
to the House there was an impending election.  I assume the 
government thought it had to get this off the order paper and 
over to the other place before the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the government has a slim majority.  It has a new 
mandate.  It has no intention of calling an election.  There is 
no possibility of this piece of legislation dying on the order 
paper over the summer, so what in the world is the panic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old expression that sums it up quite nicely and it 
goes something like this:  lack of planning on your part does not 
necessarily constitute a crisis on my part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government shutting down debate on a bill that would 
radically change labour relations without giving all members in 
the House an opportunity to participate in debate?  This is an 
important piece of legislation.  The government thought it was 
important enough as a matter of fact to make it the first item on 
the order paper of the 36th Parliament.  It was the very first 
piece of business listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation languished on the order paper for 
months.  It was November 6, a full eight weeks, before the 
minister actually introduced the bill in the House of Commons. I 
guess hon members got into the Christmas spirit early because the 
bill, which the minister described as important as any bill to be 
introduced in this session, was not brought forth for second 
reading until February 19, five months after it first appeared on 
the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is correct in his assessment that this is an 
important piece of legislation.  It is very likely the most 
important one that we will be dealing with this year.  That is 
precisely why many of my colleagues want to speak to the bill. 
They say that the bill will have a direct impact on labour 
relations and in their words it will strike a balance.  That is 
where we disagree with the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, after having the bill come before the House in 
the 35th parliament and run into all kinds of trouble in the 
other place, the government suddenly decided that it must ram the 
bill through before the summer break so that the Senate will have 
an opportunity to deal with it.  Of course we are coming up to a 
log jam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again if members would consider giving a division of time 
between myself and my colleague from Prince Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent to 
divide the time on the basis of 30 minutes to the hon. member and 
10 minutes to the hon. member for Prince Albert with no questions 
or comments?  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
House leader of the government.  I think there may be some other 
forces at work as far as opposition to the bill is concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked a question in the House about whether the ministers 
from British Columbia were feeling heat with regard to how their 
constituents felt about Bill C-19.  It was very apparent that the 
entire British Columbia caucus including the ministers had 
expressed concerns about the bill.  It is obvious they would like 
to get the bill through the House and out of sight before there 
is any more dissension in the ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that some of the Prime Minister's compliant 
backbenchers were questioning the impact the provisions of Bill 
C-19 would have on their constituents?  I really think that is 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having talked about the undemocratic aspect of time allocation, 
I will talk about some of the undemocratic aspects of the bill. 
This bill and its predecessor which died in the last parliament 
were based on recommendations of the Sims task force in “Seeking 
a Balance”.  Seeking a balance is a great approach to labour 
relations.  I do not think anybody in the House wants to see one 
side totally outweighed by the other side.  The scales in any 
negotiation should be more or less at a balance so that both 
parties have equal footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the bill to see if it attains a balance.  I begin 
with a little history.  The code has not been altered in any 
significant way for the last 25 years.  It was indeed an 
important piece of legislation and it is time to update it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are making changes that will be in effect for another 
quarter of a century, we had better make sure we get it right and 
that the balance is there.  If we are to open up this area only 
every quarter of a century we had better make sure we get things 
pretty well balanced right from the start.  From what I have seen 
the bill is neither fair nor balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities called for changes to the bill.  Government members 
are fond of saying that both labour and management have problems 
with the bill and therefore, if they both dislike it equally, it 
must be balanced.  That is rather weird logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would they say if both sides said that they agreed with the 
bill and think it is fair and balanced?  I suppose the Liberals 
would respond by saying that the bill had to go back to the 
drawing board.  This seems like a rather shortsighted approach to 
the whole problem because it fails to take into account the 
impact the bill will have on the national economy and on innocent 
third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal jurisdiction in labour matters is interprovincial and 
international in scope.  While less than three-quarters of a 
million Canadians work in industries covered by the labour code, 
federally regulated businesses are service oriented and involve 
the free movement of goods, services, capital and people across 
Canada.  Because of the unique nature of the federal system 
alternative sources are not readily available.  In a lot of cases 
they are simply not available at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operation of these industry sectors is vital to the daily 
functioning of the national economy.  We have seen that time and 
time again.  As recently as December we had a work stoppage at 
Canada Post that cost small and medium size business $240 million 
a day.  Over 10,000 people were laid off in mail dependent 
businesses.  Charities that rely on the generosity that emerges 
during the Christmas period saw their fundraising activities go 
flat.  The government eventually legislated everyone back to 
work, but after months of arbitration consensus a collective 
agreement has not been reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 will not protect innocent third parties that lose 
millions of dollars when government run monopolies cease to 
provide essential mail service. 
It has nothing to offer those workers at Canada Post who lost 
salary as a result of the disruption.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is missing a dispute settlement mechanism that would 
protect innocent third parties and the national economy from 
devastation when the services of a monopoly are withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Reform Party supports final offer selection 
arbitration or some other dispute settlement mechanism that would 
accomplish the same goals.  Our aim is not to tie the hands of 
labour and management but to give them the tools to resolve their 
differences. It is definitely not, as the parliamentary secretary 
suggested in her comments, to be the big brother who makes all 
the decisions, the government that makes all the decisions for 
management and labour.  Not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many times I have tried to explain the way 
this mechanism works in this House.  Later on I will endeavour to 
explain again.  I certainly hope that at some point the 
government will come to its senses and realize that this is the 
sort of thing that has to be done in order to protect innocent 
third parties and the economy of Canada in general, along with 
the jobs of people who work in all sorts of spin-off industries 
that rely on federally regulated businesses. Stable labour 
relations will promote investment and reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interests of labour, management, producers and 
processors that these disputes be resolved without parliamentary 
intervention.  I emphasize without parliamentary intervention. It 
is in the interest of all Canadians that we have a reliable 
access to essential services to keep employment within our 
borders and to establish and maintain our reputation worldwide as 
a reliable exporter of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned many times in this House, final offer 
selection arbitration does not favour one side or the other.  How 
does it work?  For the umpteenth time, if and only if the union 
and the employer cannot make an agreement by the conclusion of 
the contract, the union and employer would provide the minister 
with the name of the person they jointly recommend as an 
arbitrator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union and employer would be required to submit to the 
arbitrator a list of all the matters that they agreed upon at 
that point and a list of all the matters that were still in 
dispute. For disputed issues each party would be required to 
submit their final offer for settlement.  The arbitrator then 
selects either the final offer submitted by the trade union or 
the final offer submitted by the employer, that is, one or the 
other. There is no compromise position.  The arbitrator's 
decision would be binding on both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this government intervention?  No, this is not government 
intervention.  This is a last ditch effort that the parties must 
go to if they cannot come to an agreement by themselves.  We 
believe that a permanent and fair resolution process must be put 
in place, removed from the whims of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to work legislation has become too predictable and 
management and unions have come to count on it.  What does it 
solve?  We legislated the postal people back to work but they 
still do not have the contract settled. What does it resolve?  We 
got the mail moving, reluctantly I suppose in lots of cases, but 
we do not have the contract resolved.  How is that ever going to 
be resolved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be far better if we did that sort of thing up front 
rather than wait for a work stoppage that polarizes everybody? 
Everybody has an opinion on whether or not there should be a work 
stoppage at the post office or other essential services. Then 
they are still faced with the dilemma of having to settle this 
contract.  Sure the people are back to work but what has really 
been settled? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is time for permanent legislation that would 
provide both sides with predictable rules and a timetable by 
which to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risk to Canadian jobs should be minimized as well. Not only 
will a significant number of jobs be lost in the export sector if 
these disputes cannot be resolved, but jobs at the ports will be 
at severe risk when alternative means to ship goods are utilized. 
The use of more reliable U.S. west coast ports would result in a 
loss of cargo and a loss to British Columbia ports.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The costly interruption of government business should not be 
allowed to occur.  While there is a need for regulation by 
various levels of government, it is unnecessary to put emergency 
measures in place each time labour and management are unable to 
reach a satisfactory agreement.  Resolving the differences of the 
two groups can be achieved without interrupting the regular flow 
of government proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about ending the collective bargaining 
process but making it work better through final offer selection 
arbitration.  Every time back to work legislation is used, it 
usurps the collective bargaining process.  Final offer selection 
works best when it is not used at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cite the Manitoba case. On February 10 an hon. 
member from Winnipeg told the House that this sort of mechanism 
was used sparingly.  In fact the Manitoba relations board 
received only 97 applications in all the time that there was 
legislation in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those 97 applications, only seven were ever ruled on by a 
final offer selector or arbitrator. Four went to the union 
package and three were ruled in the favour of the company. In the 
vast majority, 72 cases, the application was withdrawn because 
the parties returned to the bargaining table and found a 
satisfactory resolution by a more conventional means. This is a 
perfect example of final offer selection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not like final offer selection, if it 
thinks that it has a bad connotation because it came from the 
Reform Party, which I suspect it does think that, then let it 
conjure up its own dispute settlement mechanism and call it 
whatever it wants. The government can call it the Liberal 
solution for all I care, as long as it works.  A lot of people in 
Canada depend on these services, not only those people who 
directly depend on the service but, as I said before, also those 
people in downstream jobs and spin-off economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any mechanism that causes both parties to work out an agreement 
through their normal negotiation process is a lot better than any 
legislation that puts an end to a contentious work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of including a dispute settlement mechanism in this 
bill, the drafters sought a solution to the problem at west coast 
ports.  They ignored the recommendation of the west coast ports 
inquiry and opted for a provision that was not considered by the 
Sims commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We definitely support the concept of farmers moving their grain 
to markets unimpeded by labour disputes beyond their control.  We 
think it is absolutely within the farmers' rights to be able to 
transport their product from the farm gate to the high seas. 
Maybe that is not an inherent right, but I believe that they 
should be supplied with the mechanisms to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before in this House when talking on agriculture 
bills, the problems of production are largely overcome, except 
for natural disasters which are caused by weather related 
problems.  The farming community has the technology, the 
expertise and the grain varieties to produce great crops if 
weather conditions prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The production of crops is not the biggest barrier to making a 
living on the farm.  Nowadays you have to pay attention to the 
marketing of those crops.  If those crops are not marketed 
properly, you simply are going to go backward in your farming 
operation. It is absolutely vital that when the farmers' crops 
are ready to be sold, and there is a willing seller and a willing 
buyer, that they are able to be transported as far as the high 
seas to get them to their customers.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sums up the fact that we believe farmers deserve a better 
deal than they are getting from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have the assurances that if the grain gets to the 
port, I said if, it will be loaded on the ships.  But there are a 
lot of unions between the farm gate and the port.  If there is a 
work disruption anywhere along there, the grain simply does not 
get to the port.  So what good is a mechanism that loads grain 
that is not in the port?  It is absolutely worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, if we were to talk to people in the alfalfa dehydrating 
business who are also farmers, chemicals, sulphur and potash 
exporters and lumber producers all stand to lose millions of 
dollars. They would say that and ask “Where are our assurances 
that we can move our product?  Our products are important too”. 
Certainly they all admit that grain is important.  Certainly they 
all admit that the work stoppages always seem to occur when there 
is grain to be shipped through the ports.  But other products are 
extremely important to the producers, to the people they employ 
and to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People on the other side would say yes, yes but the work 
stoppages always come when grain is moved, and grain has been 
used as the ace in the hole.  Now we are going to move grain. 
What now is going to become the ace in the hole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to find that petrochemical producers can put as 
much political pressure on the government as the grain farmers 
did?  Are we going to find that work stoppage somewhere in the 
transportation or at the ports is going to require parliament to 
reconvene and legislate people back to work because of a work 
stoppage in the transportation area?  It is altogether possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this bill actually improve anything?  I guess it improves 
things provided that grain continues to move to the port.  It is 
a small baby step forward but we are not content with baby steps. 
Why not make some real progress?  If this act is not going to be 
opened up for another 25 years, it is incumbent on us to do as 
much as we can in the time that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a little about replacement workers.  The 
provision on replacement workers could further impede the 
movement of goods and services in Canada.  The new Canada 
Industrial Relations Board created by this act will be able to 
deny employers the right to continue to operate, to earn a living 
by utilizing replacement workers or in some cases maybe even to 
reassign their own management employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did it ever occur to the powers that be that if we had a dispute 
settlement mechanism in place, something of the type about which 
I have been talking, there would be no need for replacement 
workers in federally regulated workplaces?  If the disputes could 
be settled without having to have these painful, polarizing, 
agonizing work stoppages, then there would be no need for 
replacement workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the replacement worker issue should be addressed. I 
hear my colleague from Winnipeg saying not to call them 
replacement workers, to call them scabs.  Some would say that a 
scab is something temporary while the healing process takes place 
underneath. I am not sure if that is exactly what my friend from 
Winnipeg is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is fair either that we should be allowing any 
group of people, particularly in this case the industrial 
relations board, to get into a position where they can certify a 
union without a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the parliamentary secretary explain that the basis for 
union formation is that it will be done where there is majority 
support.  That is all very well. 
I have no reason to distrust my colleague, the parliamentary 
secretary, but I would feel a lot better if those very thoughts 
of hers were codified, for instance, if we said in this bill 
something if we have indications that there may be the need, the 
want or the demand of the workers to form a union, the way to 
determine that is through a secret ballot vote. It would be 
exactly the way we are selected for this place, through a secret 
ballot vote.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives from the labour movement say they we do not want 
that because there could be intimidation.  I do not think there 
would be any more intimidation there than there is during a 
federal, provincial or municipal election. That is a tried and 
true process.  We have been using it here for over 125 years, 
based on the model used in Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting to note that Britain has gone to the 
secret ballot method. Even the Labour government that has taken 
over from the Thatcherites has seen fit not to change that part 
of the labour law.  I do not know what all the protest is about a 
secret ballot vote.  Perhaps some day that will be addressed in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very unfortunately we only have less than two and a half hours 
to debate in the entire day today, so I am sure that this will not 
get addressed.  But I would like very much to be in a position 
where I could question the government on that very aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about certifying the union without a majority.  Although 
the parliamentary secretary assures us this is not the intention 
of the bill, we have to look at recent history.  There is a case 
in Ontario where the people at a Wal-Mart store in Windsor voted 
151 to 43 against being certified by the union and had their 
wishes overturned by the Ontario labour relations board and had 
the union certified against the obvious wishes of the majority. 
There was a more than three to one majority and the Ontario 
labour relations board said “we think you people would have 
voted otherwise in different circumstances and therefore we are 
going to certify the union whether you want it or not”.  That is 
absolutely undemocratic at the best and totally asinine at the 
worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, as its predecessor Bill C-66, is a piece of 
legislation that the Reform Party simply cannot support. We 
believe firmly in the right of people to organize and to withdraw 
their labour if necessary. But when we are talking about the only 
game in town, as in the case of the post office, or the ports, or 
the railways it is not as though a corner store goes on strike. 
It is an inconvenience but it is not a catastrophe.  We can go to 
a different store, a store that is not in trouble with a work 
stoppage. But when the ports or the railway go on strike, we have 
no alternative at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the basis on which I base my remarks today.  I thank the 
House again for allowing me to share my time with my colleague 
from Saskatchewan.

shut down debate on this bill.  Their undemocratic action in 
imposing time allocation on such sweeping legislation reflects a 
complete abuse of their power and a contempt for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, however, I would like to concentrate on something else. I 
would like to emphasize that the bill guarantees only protection 
for the movement of grain products in the case of a strike or a 
lockout.  This is such an important issue in my riding.  This is 
provided for in subsection 87.7 of the bill which ensures that 
grain, once it reaches port, will be shipped out to its final 
destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am delighted to see that grain product movements are 
protected in these events, I have news for this government. Grain 
products are not the only agricultural products nor are they the 
only products subject to transportation and shipping which could 
be paralyzed in the event of a strike or a lockout. The 
transportation of such important commodities as pulp and paper, 
lumber and dairy products could also be paralyzed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it ironic that the government has declared grain 
transportation essential in this case so long as it is ready to 
leave the country, while the government does not see fit to 
declare the movement of grain from the farmer to the port as an 
essential service, as we have all seen with the problems that 
have come out of rail line abandonment.  This double standard is 
really puzzling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Saskatchewan the mining association is 
also concerned that only grain products will be guaranteed 
movement during a strike or a lockout.  What about its products? 
What will happen to mining products in the event of a strike or a 
lockout?  Has that question been addressed?  No. This has been 
completely ignored. The question that needs to be asked is why 
one and not the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such action is typical of this government.  We have seen it time 
and again, people divided for the sake of being divided.  We have 
seen this with the hepatitis C file dividing victims into before 
and after a certain date.  We have seen this with Bill C-68, the 
gun control bill, which divides rural and urban Canadians on a 
line that did not need to be drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By allowing only grain to be shipped out in such events could 
cause serious damage to the economy and to the country in terms 
of people getting along with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I illustrate this by pointing out that in 1996 the total value 
of cargo that went through the port of Vancouver was $30 billion 
and grain accounted for $4 billion of that total. What does that 
amount to?  It amounts to 15% grain and 85% for all other 
products.  What about the other $26 billion?  Do we just ignore 
it if we are faced with a strike?  It sounds like economic 
suicide for Canada or economic murder of unprotected sectors or 
individual businesses and their employees and shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important industry in my riding is the alfalfa 
dehydrating industry.  I would like to thank the people from the 
industry who came here from my riding of Prince Albert for being 
effective in communicating their concerns about this bill to the 
official opposition.  Obviously the government did not listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alfalfa dehydration industry represents about $100 million 
in exports.  In my riding this industry accounts for 
approximately two-thirds of Saskatchewan's output. What about it? 
Shall we just ignore a $100 million industry that forms an 
integral part of total farming?  I would think not. All products 
and commodities should be offered protection from arbitrary 
shipping disruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we start protecting the economy of this country. 
For this reason we proposed to extend this provision of 
protection.  This government, in its lack of wisdom, refuses such 
action.  In fact, the miserable level of protection afforded 
Canada's agricultural sector in this legislation is comparable to 
allowing Canadian Tire to continue selling barbeques in the face 
of a company-wide strike.  How much help would that be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 87.4 of this bill allows for the continuation of service 
in a strike or lockout if there is a danger of public health or 
safety, which is a good thing, but there is no provision to 
protect the national economy which affects the livelihood of all 
Canadians. 
We feel this is necessary since the national economy is the key 
factor in providing Canadians with a good standard of living 
essential to the nation's health and well-being.  Therefore it is 
not asking too much to want to see the national economy protected 
in a bill along with innocent third parties that could be 
affected by a strike or lockout.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know labour strikes rarely affect only the company that 
suffers the strike.  Some strikes cripple entire sectors of the 
economy.  For example, we can look at the 1994 west coast port 
strike in which the direct costs of the strike were estimated to 
be more than $125 million.  The indirect costs suffered by third 
parties is twice that.  It is estimated to be over $250 million. 
This is a significantly higher number and it is important that 
third parties and the national economy be protected. 
Unfortunately our government did not see things in that light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of communication and transportation infrastructures 
any disruption to these sectors would have devastating 
consequences for the Canadian economy.  A strike would not affect 
only our exports, it would have a dire impact on Canada's 
reputation throughout the world, possibly affecting future 
investors and clients interested in Canadian made products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this it will come as no surprise that the Reform 
Party is of the firm belief that the economy needs to be 
protected and that companies must always maintain the right to 
operate.  Furthermore, unionized employees need timely resolution 
of their concerns which is not ensured under the present 
legislation.  The right to operate means that a company faced 
with a strike has a right to hire replacement workers if they are 
available and willing to work, which is not always guaranteed. 
That is their right as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed in the government when I found that section 
94(2)2.1 of this bill prohibits the use of replacement workers if 
the Canadian Industrial Relations Board determines that their 
presence undermines the union.  It is our opinion that this puts 
too much power in the hands of the industrial relations board and 
undermines the rights of the employer since it is unfairly biased 
in favour of the union.  We find that unacceptable as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to see this bill amended so that in the 
event of another Canada Post strike such as the one we saw last 
year an arbitrator could be chosen by both the union and the 
employer to resolve the outstanding differences between the two 
parties.  The arbitrator's final decision would be binding on 
both parties.  That only makes good sense to the official 
opposition and to most right thinking Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the reasons I have mentioned we oppose Bill C-19 and we call 
on all hon. members prior to voting on the bill to seriously 
consider the consequences of Bill C-19 if it becomes law.  I am 
sure that if they do they will join with the official opposition 
in opposing this flawed and undemocratic legislation.

am very pleased with Monday's report describing the results of 
Ontario's consultation process on the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontarians clearly support this declaration.  This has been 
demonstrated by the responses received during the public 
consultation process.  The poll released at the same time shows 
that 87% of Ontarians support the Calgary declaration and 73% of 
Ontarians recognize the unique character of Quebec society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of the results of this vigorous poll and the many 
other positive results of polls across the country, the figures 
the Bloc keeps repeating on the Calgary declaration have lost a 
lot of meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly Canadians support the values of compassion, equality, 
tolerance and diversity expressed in the Calgary declaration. 
Canadians should be proud of this demonstration of support for 
one another.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hep C 
compensation meetings yesterday were, in my view, a farce.  The 
victims left those meetings feeling betrayed.  They felt betrayed 
because the health minister went to that meeting and sat meekly 
in the corner without a position.  He was seeking a consensus, 
while the victims wanted a position from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could this minister have gone to those meetings without a 
well researched, well thought out federal government position? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the meeting yesterday produced progress.  The member should know 
that although no final conclusion was reached, the ministers 
agreed that a working group would examine options which will 
enable us to do something meaningful for all those who suffer 
from hepatitis C as a result of the blood system.  That working 
group will get under way immediately.  It will work over the 
short term to present fully researched options to all ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to prefer a national approach to this issue.  That 
was the view of those around the table yesterday.  Unilateral 
action is not the answer.  We will continue to work in the public 
interest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hepatitis C issue has degenerated into face saving for the 
Liberals.  The Prime Minister is on record as saying that on his 
watch there will be no resignations, no backsliding and no face 
saving.  This has ended up saving the image of the Prime Minister 
rather than looking after the victims.  Is this not taking the 
politics of stubbornness to its newest low? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the House knows there was a consensus among all governments in 
late March.  Two governments rejected that consensus and went off 
in a different direction.  At yesterday's meeting that sort of 
unilateralism was deplored by the vast majority of Canadian 
governments.  Instead we renewed our commitment to finding a 
national approach to this issue.  A working group has been put in 
place over the short term to look at the options for a national 
approach.  That is the way governments can act most effectively 
in the interest of all those infected with hepatitis C through 
the blood system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Health may use this study group as a hiding tactic, 
but the victims will not let that happen.  They are willing to 
follow this minister and every Liberal this summer.  They are 
going to go to every parade.  They are going to go to every 
ribbon cutting.  They are going to go to every celebration.  The 
hepatitis C signs will be there.  They will not give up.  The 
opposition will not give up until the the victims of hepatitis C 
have fair and just compensation.  When will they get it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if it was not evident before now what this man is, we all see it 
for ourselves today.  He is the ambulance chaser of Canadian 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pathetic.  While ministers yesterday were upstairs 
working toward a solution, this man was in the lobby straining to 
get into the camera shot with the victims.  He is a disgrace.  He 
lowers the level of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who are committed to a real solution will continue 
to work toward it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will tell you about the commitment of the member for Macleod.  He 
has had to help people who have been in ambulances.  This 
minister may have seen them in court, but he has never in his 
life helped a person out of an ambulance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This health minister has failed dismally every step of the way. 
The file has been pried open despite his efforts to keep it 
closed.  Why does the minister not admit that he did not take a 
position into that meeting yesterday because he did not want the 
meeting to succeed?  The hepatitis C victims have been let down 
and this minister let them down by leading the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member has no idea what went on inside the meeting yesterday, 
so I will tell him.  Ministers sat around the table and examined 
the options available to governments to help those who contracted 
hepatitis C through the blood system.

cannot be trusted.  They have said that he has a duty to help 
those people in need and he has failed miserably.  He had a duty 
to bring a position to that meeting and he failed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has but one duty left.  Will he perform it?  Will he do his

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as a result of this government's leadership there are 22,000 
victims of hepatitis C who received an offer of compensation from 
all governments.  Where was the Reform Party last year?  Where 
was the Reform Party last winter when that work was going on?  It 
is this government which led that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday this government led the effort to pursue a national 
approach to this issue and we will work with governments, as we 
have in the past, until a solution is found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the hon. member that all governments are committed to

would have had something to show us yesterday.  He should admit 
his responsibility and be prepared to put up the money to

look at all our options together.

the hepatitis C issue, the health minister does not even know how

the head of the parade and show some compassion when the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government is committed to finding a way, with other

through the blood system.  Yesterday we established a working 
group that will examine all options which will enable us to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians know, and certainly those infected with

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
he very typically avoided the question again.  The health

C victims would not be worrying today about how they will care 
for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has stubbornly refused to show compassion so

very reasonable compensation and assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A protectionist American law restricts the hiring of foreign

if it were not for the government a year ago putting this item on

</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming to the member's question I can report from yesterday's

would still end universality of old age pensions in this country. 
Universality is a principle strongly supported the Canadian

<Question No. 65—<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What steps has the government taken to implement the 
recommendations contained in the Matter of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Special Review re: Sto:lo Fisheries Authority based on 
Documentation Available and Procedures Performed As at February 
28, 1995 and, specifically, what action is being taken with 
regard to Recommendations numbered 3.01, 3.02, 4.11, 4.12, 4.23, 
4.24, 4.28, 5.14, 5.16, 5.17, 5.18, 6.44, 6.45, 6.46 and 6.47? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
After the 1994 report “Special Review Re: Sto:lo Fisheries 
Authority”, significant changes were made to the operation of 
the Sto:lo Fisheries Authority, SFA, as it pertains to financial 
accountability. In the year following the review, all funds were 
provided to an independent administrator and only released in 
accordance with proper accounting procedures. Since then the 
financial control has been moved from the SFA to the financial 
arm of Sto:lo Nation. The fiscal accountability of Sto:lo Nation 
has been reviewed by DFO Finance, Pacific Region which is 
satisfied with the accounting processes in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years, DFO has been more involved in the 
financial aspects of the agreement. DFO staff have participated 
in the monetary aspects of the levy, referred to as the 
“Contribution Fishery” in the report, and excess salmon surplus 
to requirements, ESSR, fishery arrangements. Active management 
controls including the laying off of staff to avoid 
overexpenditures are now routine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific Recommendations: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.01 The quarterly Progress Reports submitted to DFO by the SFA 
are reportedly prepared internally by the SFA and are not 
reviewed by the external auditor prior to submission. Given the 
nature and extent of the issues raised through our review, there 
is an opportunity to increase the reliability and accuracy of the 
reports by having the auditor involved in the preparation and/or 
review of the progress reports. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quarterly reports are now prepared by the Sto:lo Nation's 
director of finance and his staff, not by Sto:lo fisheries 
authority staff, as was the case prior to the report. Given that 
the processes used are accepted by the external auditor and DFO 
Finance, Pacific Region, the participation of the auditor in the 
preparation of the quarterly reviews is not required. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.02 SFA apparently received two letters relating to accounting 
matters, dated February 7, 1994, and recommendations arising from 
audit, dated June 27, 1994, from Mr. Robert Nicklom of Goldfinch, 
Nicklom and Northcott, SFA's auditor for the fiscal year 1993-94. 
DFO reportedly did not receive copies of the auditor's management 
letters. As it appears that certain recommendations made by SFA's 
auditor have not been implemented, there is an opportunity for 
DFO to more proactively monitor SFA's management and operations 
by receiving such management letters. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the submission of the report, the subsequent 
implementation of the independent administrator for 1995 and 
procedures put in place since then, no management issues have 
been identified in the audit. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.11 SFA should carry out a complete evaluation of the financial 
controls regarding the contribution fishery. Controls that were 
in place should be documented and analysed in conjunction with 
SFA's auditor to assess the effect on the audit opinion for 
fiscal 1994-95. In particular, a reconciliation of the fish 
caught per the landing slips issued to the revenue recorded 
should be performed. The numerical continuity of the landing 
slips should also be reviewed. In addition, the controls 
regarding future contribution fisheries should be reviewed to 
ensure appropriate improvements are made. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No contribution fisheries were conducted in 1995 or 1996. In 
1997, DFO was highly involved in the design and implementation of 
the fishery. DFO's involvement included designing the bid 
package, opening the bids and selecting the highest bidder, and 
ensuring the funds were properly dealt with. The design of the 
fishery was such that numerical control of landing slips was not 
required. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.12 A complete analysis of a particular individual's 
transaction should be performed. The analysis should address such 
questions as: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a. Why was a deposit of $125,000 received when the invitation to bid 
indicated that a deposit of $150,000 was required? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b. Does the bidding process, the amended bid, the outstanding 
receivable and the accounting controls regarding the related 
revenue raise concerns regarding the management of the 
contribution fishery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c. Did the individual sell the fish to a third party and, if so, 
was he paid for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>d. What is the likelihood that the receivable from the 
individual will be collected? Should the receivable, or a portion 
thereof, from the individual be provided for as a doubtful or 
uncollectable account? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>e. What effect would the non-collection of the receivable from 
the individual have on the First Nations' and/or STC's 
performance under the agreement? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been discussion with Sto:lo Nation and Sto:lo 
fisheries on the involvement of the individual in this particular 
interaction. The total amount of the receivable monies from this 
transaction was deducted from the 1995 agreement amount DFO was 
to pay SFA. This left the Sto:lo Nation responsible for the 
outstanding amount, and this has had the effect of making the 
Sto:lo Nation more accountable for their practices. Further, the 
individual has not had any further involvement with projects of 
this nature. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.23 SFA should assess their requirements to pay GST and, as 
recommended by their auditor, should review the accounting 
treatment of GST paid. After determining the extent of refund 
available, a GST return and/or refund claim should be filed in 
accordance with the Excise Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.24 The DFO should consider the position they will take with 
respect to amending past progress reports to properly account for 
GST that may have been included as allowable costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST was applied for and received in the 1994 agreement. 
Since then GST has been applied for on an annual basis. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.28 SFA should review their policy with respect to accounting 
for capital assets particularly with respect to the treatment of 
disposals of capital assets. If necessary, progress reports 
should be revised for any accounting errors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accounting of capital assets including disposal is done in 
accordance with acceptable accounting procedures. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.14 Insurance coverage should be reviewed to ensure that SFA is 
only insuring boats to which they have title. Excess insurance 
should be canceled and inquiries should be made as to the 
possibility of a refund. In addition, the existence and possible 
disposal of any excess boats should be reviewed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insurance coverage is now only on vessels operated by the SFA. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.16 SFA should implement a system to monitor the personal use 
of cellular phones and vehicules. The level of use should be 
reviewed for any potential abuses. In addition, SFA should review 
the requirement, if any, to issue T4 slips for taxable benefits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Managers within Sto:lo Fisheries are now provided a budget to 
work within. One of their responsibilities is to ensure that 
equipment is operated in accordance with acceptable procedures, 
including limiting the personal use of equipment. There have been 
instances where managers have limited the use of equipment due to 
abuses. The costs are deemed, by AFS staff who review the 
reports, to be within an acceptable range. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.17 DFO should review their position with respect to SFA assets 
used for non-SFA business, such as travel to and from work. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO has reviewed the level of assets support including use for 
non-SFA business and has concluded this should be left to the 
discretion of the SFA managers who are accountable for their 
budgets. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.18 DFO should request the travel expense claim forms for 
honoraria described in the general ledger as relating to CA-104. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A flat rate is now paid for honoraria—$75.00 per half day or 
conference call or $150.00 per day plus mileage at government 
approved rates. The authorization for this payment is the minutes 
of meetings. Minutes are provided by the independent chairman of 
the planning committee. Given the controls that are already in 
place, it is not necessary for DFO to view travel expense claims. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.44 Generally the financial controls in place at SFA warrant 
improvement as various accounting errors appear to go undetected, 
notwithstanding the fact that SFA was apparently informed of the 
nature of many of the errors in February 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.45 We recommend taht a thorough review of financial controls 
take place with a view to detecting and preventing future errors 
from taking place. Controls currently in place such as 
inter-company and bank reconciliations do not appear to be 
performed on an accurate basis as evidence by the undetected 
errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.46 The involvement of the external auditor in the preparation 
of the progress reports may result in the earlier detection of 
accounting errors and a greater assurance level regarding the 
reliability of the progress reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.47 Additional training and education of in-house accounting 
personnel may also alleviate some of the problems that are 
currently being experienced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the accounting regime and reporting relationships have 
been changed significantly, these recommendations have been 
addressed. 
<Question No. 76—<B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of National Revenue explain what taxation 
guidelines apply to tobacco `sticks' in comparison to taxation 
guidelines of cigarettes? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Tobacco sticks are provided for in the federal Excise Act 
which was amended in 1991 to include the new rate of excise duty 
and the definition for tobacco sticks. At the time it was 
acknowledged that partially-made cigarettes, requiring some 
preparation prior to smoking, did not fit into any existing 
category. Tobacco sticks can only be made by a licensed tobacco 
manufacturer under the same regulatory requirements as 
cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, cigarettes and tobacco sticks attract both 
excise duties and excise taxes. On the total sale price of a 
carton of 200 cigarettes, excise duties represent $5.50, while on 
a carton of 200 tobacco sticks, excises duties represent $3.67. 
As a result of the increased taxes announced on February 13, 
1998, excise taxes on cigarettes and tobacco sticks vary from 
$2.25 to $5.35 for a carton of cigarettes and from $1.85 to $2.93 
for a carton of tobacco sticks, depending in which province the 
tobacco products are offered for sale. This situation is due to 
the fact that the federal excise tax rate is linked to the 
provincial tax rate for tobacco products. For example, in Quebec, 
a carton of 200 cigarettes would attract $7.75 in federal duties 
and taxes compared to $5.52 for 200 tobacco sticks. In Alberta 
the duty and tax is $10.85 on a carton of cigarettes and $6.60 on 
tobacco sticks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also indicated its intent to review the tax 
differential existing between the two products. 
<Question No. 89—<B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister responsible for Revenue Canada Customs list 
the total revenue for the PACE/CANPASS program at each of the 
British Columbia border crossings for 1996-97 and 1997-98? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> The total fees collected by Revenue Canada for the 
CANPASS/PACE lanes at Pacific Highway, Huntingdon, Boundary Bay 
and Douglas are $694,139.18 for the 1996-97 fiscal year and 
$729,269.98 for the 1997-98 fiscal year. All of these revenues are 
tabulated and summarized at the CANPASS processing center 
situated in Douglas. A breakdown of the revenues collected by 
individual border crossings in British Columbia is not 
available. 
<Question No. 90—<B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister responsible for Revenue Canada Customs, list 
the total cost of administering the PACE/CANPASS program at each 
of the British Columbia border crossings for 1996-97 and 1997-98? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> The administration cost for the CANPASS/PACE program at 
each of the British Columbia border crossings has been estimated 
at $219,000 per year for the CANPASS/PACE lanes at Pacific 
Highway, Huntingdon, and Boundary Bay, and $279,000 per year for 
the CANPASS/PACE lane at Douglas. To arrive at these figures the 
total cost for the program including the centralized processing 
of membership applications and the associated headquarters 
administrative costs were apportioned to the four sites. The 
estimated costs are the same for both the 1996-97 and 1997-98 
fiscal years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 accordingly became Bill C-19.  I think it should be put

as well as I can the position of the Bloc, which is opposed to 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It implements reforms to the industrial relations provisions of 
part I of the Canada Labour Code, to provide a framework for 
collective bargaining that enhances the ability of labour and 
management to frame their own agreements and allows workplace 
disputes to be resolved in a timely and cost effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highlights are as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the creation of a representational board, the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board, with appropriate powers to allow for 
the timely and cost effective administration of the regime;

unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary indicates the government's position and the scope of 
the issue.  More specifically, the bill is a major one that will 
be part of the Canada Labour Code once it is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a code, a regulated procedure that affects many Canadians. 
In fact, some 700,000 workers, or about 10% of the Canadian

115,000 workers in Quebec are included and thus covered by the 
code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It applies to very important areas of human activity in Canada 
and Quebec. It covers vast areas of endeavour: banking, 
international and interprovincial transportation, airports and 
air carriers, broadcasting and telecommunications, port 
operations and longshoring, grain handling. In addition, many 
crown corporations are covered by the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is a very important bill which affects a 
great many Canadians and Quebeckers in their daily lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with the matter at hand today, that is, part I of the 
Canada Labour Code regarding industrial relations, it is 
important to know that part II deals with occupational health 
and safety, and part III with labour standards in areas under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get where we are today, at third reading, large numbers of 
stakeholders first had to be consulted—the government deserves 
credit for that—and consultations have been under way since 
1995, which produced what we have before us now, regardless of 
what we make of it as Quebeckers in Canada: a document which is 
moving the issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is probably why our colleagues from the New Democratic 
Party supported this bill, which we, as Quebeckers, cannot 
support however as we consider, among other major reasons, that 
Quebec has a head start and should be leading the way instead of 
taking the Canadian lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations were held starting in 1995 and a report 
entitled “Seeking a Balance”, better known as the Sims report, 
after the chairperson, was released in 1996 or 1997. In fact, 
there has been public recognition of this report and some 
consensus was reached on it in Canadian society. It is clear 
from the general satisfaction, except for some concerns, at 
times quite serious, expressed by many witnesses that this 
report was well received. There are however serious concerns 
which we share in particular with regard to replacement workers 
or scabs, as they are commonly referred to, where no consensus 
was reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we feel this is an unfinished reform that made good 
sense at the start, but for which the necessary political 
courage was never displayed. This is what brings us to the 
negative assessment that we are making today. We are opposed to 
this legislation for a number of reasons and in spite of a 
seemingly positive attitude. Our reasons have to do with things 
that are in the bill, but also with things that are not in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the things that are included in the bill is the creation 
of the Canada Industrial Relations Board, which used to be 
called the Canada Labour Relations Board. Here, the minister is 
taking a leap he should not take, even though the board and the 
government are pleased to call the new body a “representational 
board”. Of course it is representative of employer and labour 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three union representatives and three management 
representatives on the board. However, the minister reserves the 
right to appoint board members, after consultation with the 
employer and labour organizations of his choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, in our opinion, goes against the alleged representational 
nature of the board to be established under this bill. The 
minister should appoint people selected by each of the two 
groups, that is the employer organizations and the labour 
organizations. Instead, the minister prefers to choose among the 
employer and labour organizations that he will have selected 
himself.

representative of these two groups, much to their discontent, 
particularly if the Minister of Labour decides to confuse things 
by appointing people who are not necessarily representative of 
the aspirations and concerns of either group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a flaw that is difficult to explain, given the general 
atmosphere that seemingly prevailed at the end of the exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does not appear, however, are these five groups of workers 
who made historic representations to no longer be included in 
the Canada Labour Code. I am thinking of the flour mill workers. 
Following a difficult strike at Ogilvie in Montreal, a topic to 
which we will shortly return, the CSN requested that, in future, 
anything to do with flour mills should come under provincial 
jurisdiction, because they wanted nothing more to do with this 
Canadian approach, which left people battered at the end of a 
labour dispute that went on for 16 weeks, if I remember 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are undoubtedly valid historic reasons, but they are no 
longer valid today, in the opinion of these folks.  What was 
acceptable in 1867 is no longer valid today and we question this 
desire on the part of the CSN, which wants to see its 
members—this is the primary reason and we will come back to this 
later—working in flour mills safe from the intervention of scabs. 
This is a big step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We condemn the government for not being more receptive to these 
representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are groups of workers, employees of the Government of 
Canada, who are complaining about the way they are treated, 
beginning with RCMP employees who, like those of the Public 
Service Alliance and the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service of Canada, have been making representations for a long 
time, with the support of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, unfortunately, and it was not very nice of the 
government to have done this, it agreed to allow some groups to 
appear before the committee for hours, with very interesting 
results. 
These people honestly believed in the committee process, which 
is there to hear the parties, but they were told in the end that 
the Bloc Quebecois amendments—flowing from these 
interventions and from our sympathy for these three groups of 
workers in the RCMP, the Public Service Alliance and the 
Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada—were 
out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the letter I received from the deputy principal 
clerk of the House a few months later. 
I will read it, so that the RCMP employees, the Public Service 
Alliance and the Professional Institute may know we are 
concerned about them, but the government has proceeded in such a 
way as to make it impossible to table the amendments for 
procedural reasons, so the entire debate concerning these people 
was declared out of order for the following reason, and here I 
quote Mr. Marc Bosc, the deputy principal clerk: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motions propose amendment of sections of the parent 
legislation which are not addressed in the bill—an amendment 
is not in order unless the section of the parent legislation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This refers to the Canada Labour Code as a whole. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—addressed by the amendment is specifically covered by a clause 
in the bill. 
We cannot, consequently—put your motions on the order paper. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to table the amendments.  They were rejected with this 
explanation provided very honourably by the deputy principal 
clerk. However, we regret this tactic by the government which 
let people devote time and energy to this instead of warning 
them “Don't waste your time.  As Bill C-19 stands, there is no 
question of it involving claims by the RCMP, PSAC or PIPS”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bit disappointing, since the problem raised by these 
groups is certainly not an invention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP is the only police force in Canada that cannot properly 
negotiate with its employer. Employees are represented by some 
kind of small shop union whose structure they themselves 
condemn. They cannot negotiate anything about their work 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years have gone by. They even submitted to the government a bill 
drafted by their own legal advisors, but the government decided 
to ignore it. What is most appalling is that these employees, 
who are part of the only non-unionized police force in Canada and 
are not entitled to any kind of collective bargaining, are 
subject to the arbitrary actions of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the management of the RCMP, the government is acting as 
judge and jury. This opens the door to some rather serious 
abuse, because the employees are dealt with on an individual 
basis, instead of as a group of workers recognized by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we deplore the fact that the government does not seem to 
be overly concerned about the situation. They should at least 
reply to these people, tell them to stop deluding themselves, 
that the government—at least the current government—will never 
grant them their wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation with the Public Service Alliance and the institute 
is just as serious. They dream of the day when they will no 
longer be subject to the Public Service Staff Relations Act, but 
will come under the Canada Labour Code. 
In reality, it would give them the opportunity to talk more 
decently with their employer, almost as an equal, as workers 
have managed to do after a great struggle in the private sector 
and in Quebec in the public sector where the unions have much 
more recognition on matters that are not unimportant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only have worked in big outfits, like the Government of 
Canada or the Government of Quebec, to know that talk of job 
security is not a trivial matter, especially when the employer 
is a partisan outfit known as the federal government.  The 
people opposite, the Liberals, are pretty strong on this point, 
and can be judgmental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that clearly today with the appointment of David Levine 
to head Montfort Hospital.  How far can racism be pushed? 
Imagine discovering that an employee of the federal public 
service had sovereignist leanings.  What danger lurks in this 
great Canadian democracy for such a person, given how they lynch 
a fine man, selected by a private company hired to find the best 
candidate.  This is a man highly respected for his political 
opinions, his background and his professional ability.  Look at 
the dirty deed being done with the support of those opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people in the Public Service Alliance demand the power 
to negotiate as equals and decently with their employer, they 
are perfectly right to do so, in particular on the subject of 
job security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole matter of technological change, which can 
land on the back of public servants, because there is no 
protection in this regard—we will come back to this—and the 
Canada Labour Code could have dealt with this, for private 
companies too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, public servants who are members of the Public Service 
Alliance cannot talk honestly about job classification or 
effectively about job descriptions, or of the appointment, 
promotion or transfer processes. 
These kind of things matter hugely when one works for a large 
body like the Public Service of Canada, with all the wheelings 
and dealings behind the scene one may have to contend with when 
there is no proper management framework and the employer can get 
away, as in this case, with being both judge and jury, employer 
and lawmaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This even goes as far as the right to arbitration. As far as we 
know, in the public service, arbitration decisions are final. No 
third party can step in to try to make things right. The right 
to grieve is affected as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the employer, the Government of Canada, treats 
its employees pretty much like a small non unionized business 
would, because there is basically no recourse to deal with 
abuse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we condemn this, and we deplore, in this instance, 
the fact that everything we just said was out of order to some 
extent, but the fact is that the government has chosen not to 
deal with this whole matter when it had a wonderful opportunity 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been completely insensitive to the central 
labour bodies' representations. I see this as a sign, a betrayal 
of the values the people on the other side supposedly stand for. 
I notice a number of very distinguished colleagues who are no 
doubt very sensitive to this kind of thing, like the situation 
of pregnant women working under conditions which may endanger 
their health and the health of their unborn child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, legitimate representations were made to the 
government, but once again it has been insensitive and failed to 
ensure that both it and private sector employers in Canada, who 
are covered by the Canada Labour Code, comply with similar 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see how this works in Quebec. It could be a source of 
ideas. In Quebec, the law provides for the protective 
re-assignment of pregnant women, to protect their health and the 
health of their baby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is missing from the bill, and because of such 
deficiencies we cannot support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole issue of technological changes which is 
very important in our changing economy, where the buzzwords are 
becoming scarier by the day, words like growth, productivity 
and contempt, and phrases like profit at all cost. 
I will come back later to the issue of contempt for the workers 
and their associations if I have the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological change is one of the dangers threatening workers 
because it is not curbed by the state. Yet, it should be the 
state's responsibility to ensure that the Government of Canada 
does not exclude its own employees and does not invite the 
private sector to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience has shown that businesses in the private sector that 
have exhibited good management, open-mindedness and respect for 
their employees and that have recognized the role of their 
employees in managing technological change have benefited from 
that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that it was asking too much of the Department of 
Labour's thinkers to address this issue, to include a provision 
so that workers and their associations would be invited to 
participate in managing technological change and to provide 
adequate authority for the protection of jobs and working 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very disappointing. Since things are moving so fast, had 
officials in the Department of Labour been more forward looking, 
we could also have talked about the merger phenomenon, which may 
be justifiable. Mergers are not easy to manage in terms of 
opinions, especially bank mergers, but they may be justifiable 
on a macro level because of foreign competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what is definitely unacceptable is that workers end up 
paying the price for these mergers because productivity and 
greed become such primary concerns that people get laid off. 
We will have to find other ways to improve efficiency, in order 
to be able to compete on the international market. To say that 
costs were lower this year because 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 or 10,000 
people were laid off—as was the case with some major 
corporations such as IBM and General Motors—is the easy 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is very wrong when one must have fired people over the 
last two or three years to be considered a good manager. We used 
to boast about job creation. Now, people are being laid off 
under the pretence of streamlining and improving effectiveness, 
productivity and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should wonder about growth. Anyone who ever heard Albert 
Jacquard talk on the issue of growth gets really worried about 
the evolution process. 
I am convinced that the hon. member, who really cares about the 
environment, is receptive to what I am saying. We must wonder 
about a concept such as growth. It might be negative growth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that natural resources are being systematically 
wasted, it might be appropriate to reflect, here and elsewhere, 
on where we are headed in terms of how we use our resources, and 
to urge other countries to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with technological changes and also with 
protecting jobs following mergers. These issues should be 
discussed in a broad debate, and we should make sure that jobs 
are not affected. Otherwise, profits and money become our only 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a major problem that we do not have in the Quebec 
legislation, but that exists in the Canadian legislation. I am 
referring to the fact that there is no clause on “automatic 
renewal”. 
This means, then, that when a collective agreement expires and 
negotiations start, what has already been acquired remains in 
place until there is a new collective agreement signed, so that 
a legal vacuum does not ensue, which could in certain cases lead 
to considerable abuse.  This is a significant shortcoming in 
this bill.  Once again, Quebec seems to be further advanced in 
this area.  Why not take a page from our book when it is 
something worthwhile? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area that is very worrisome is the business about the 
government and the minister giving themselves the right to 
intervene in the voting process for a strike or lockout.  It is 
very worrisome in that it is stated that the vote should be 
secret, which can be justified, and time limits are set for 
notice, 60 days for a strike, 72 hours for a lockout.   That 
part is highly questionable and we are opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having this time limit of 60 days hinders the strike process, 
because 60 days after the vote there must be a strike, even if 
negotiations are under way.  When the 60 days are up, another 
mandate must be sought, and we know how complicated this can be 
in a country that stretches from Newfoundland to British 
Columbia.  We are, therefore, not convinced this is wise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is still more worrisome is the entire matter of how the 
vote is held and how it can be invalidated.  This is not all 
that impressive, particularly coming from a Liberal federal 
government, when we are aware that in its own backyard, with the 
Canada Elections Act, all manner of abuses are permitted by the 
letter and spirit of the legislation, since we know that the 
returning officers in the ridings are still partisan 
appointments and that certain things have been done that are a 
direct attack on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how things are done in other provinces, but with 
the special polls and the postal voting, envelopes are traded 
back and forth in senior citizens homes. During the election 
campaign, I got a call from one of my constituents, who told me: 
“Mr. the incumbent, I just visited a friend of mine in a senior 
citizens home and I saw something that has me concerned. There 
was a man who took some people to the kitchen. He took out an 
envelope containing a ballot. Then, he put that envelope in 
another envelope.” That is how postal voting is done and it 
gives free rein to every shady and unscrupulous party organizer 
with no respect for the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be a good idea, but it is so poorly regulated and 
controlled that it will open the door to all kinds of abuse. 
Yet, these are the people who are lecturing the unions about 
scrupulously polling the workers to find out their wishes, when 
it is clearly stated that the vote can be invalidated.  It is a 
shame that these people would write such things in the bill. 
We are dead set against this kind of intrusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is quickly running out, I want to talk about one 
of the reasons why we are fundamentally opposed to this bill, 
and that is the whole issue of replacement workers, the possible 
hiring of scabs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we do not want to brag, but perhaps we could follow the 
example set by Quebec, which shows that it is better from a 
societal point of view to have antiscab legislation than to have 
people yielding to their instincts. It undermines the balance of 
power and badly hurts the unionized workers when their picket 
line is not respected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read, as I did at second reading, from an 
extraordinary letter that should give the folks at the 
Department of Labour food for thought.  It was written by the 
president of the CSN union at Ogilvie ADM following the strike. 
It takes courage to write as Claude Tremblay has done, and I am 
pleased to read this letter once again. 
The letter reads in part as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 110 workers I represent were more or less forced out on 
strike on June 16, 1994 after close to two years of unproductive 
negotiations with our new employer, the American giant— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important piece of information that should get 
all Canadians thinking.  I continue: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the American giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). After an 
attempt to force us to accept its collective agreement, ADM took 
advantage of a loophole in the Canada Labour Code to impose it 
on us effective December 10, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, legal precedents applying to the Canada Labour 
Relations Board allow an employer to unilaterally modify working 
conditions, once the right to strike or lockout is acquired, 
even though our previous collective agreement called for it to 
be in effect until renewed. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, this was alluded to earlier. 
That is what tacit, or automatic, renewal means. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these precedents provide—and the Canada Labour 
Code has nothing to say on the matter—that such clauses are 
illegal and do not prevent the employer from taking advantage of 
the legal vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this employer-imposed agreement did away with our seniority 
rights and the employer was threatening lay-offs that were not in 
order of seniority, we were forced to walk out in order to 
prevent the employer from doing this and also to force it to 
maintain what we had acquired over more than 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Powerful employers like ADM, and most of the employers subject 
to the Canada Labour Code, have plenty of power already without 
being given the additional power to impose their working 
conditions as soon as they are entitled to lock out workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a union, we believe that collective agreements should be 
maintained by law, at least until the right to strike is 
exercised. 
As well, the act ought to permit inclusion in a collective 
agreement of a clause allowing the working conditions it 
contains to remain in effect until renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act not only 
authorizes the use of strikebreakers, it encourages it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 
nearly 16 months of striking we managed to wring an ordinary 
collective agreement, ordinary within the context of Quebec, out 
of ADM. However, it was extraordinary compared to the American 
pattern of agreement ADM had forced on its employees in over 138 
collective agreements throughout its empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day in and day out, 
week in and week out, month in and month out, we endured subtle, 
underhanded and persistent violence. 
The violence of watching scabs stealing our rights, trucks 
entering and leaving full of wheat or flour, the CUM police 
arresting colleagues for nothing, security guards hired by ADM 
spying on us with cameras on public roads and up to our 
doorsteps, as if we were some sort of scum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part was 
discovering on our return to work that the scabs had botched our 
production so badly as to threaten the quality of Five Roses 
flour. This reputation for quality is surely the best guarantee 
of our jobs. 
The law, however, encourages short-sighted employers to threaten 
the survival of a business by allowing them to use unskilled 
workers, only to give them a psychological advantage against us 
in negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How was this useful to ADM if, in its back to 
work agreement, the company not only agreed to fire these scabs 
but also promised not to rehire them for the duration of the 
collective agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the Canada Labour Code not 
prohibit the hiring of scabs, but the employment office in 
Verdun— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concerns the federal government.

them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Two months after the end of a 15 month long strike, 29 of our 
members, those with the least seniority, were not called back to 
work. Yet, they too had fought for the seniority rules that 
eventually had those with more seniority called back to work. 
These guys all had between 12 and 26 years of seniority and good 
and loyal uninterrupted service. They had contributed to the UI

us that this is a system that clearly works against workers who 
democratically decide to fight for their rights, against 
powerful and faceless companies like ADM, which pocket more than 
US$5 million in net profits every year.

favour of prohibiting the use of scabs in the Canada Labour

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are definitely in favour of prohibiting the use of scabs in 
the Canada Labour Code, in order to send a very clear message to 
foreign employers like ADM. Their investments are welcome in 
Canada and Quebec, provided that they show a minimum of respect 
for our ways. And these rules cannot be easily broken, because 
the Government of Canada, supposedly the government of Canadian 
workers, will have given us the tools to resist if they want to 
challenge the consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who think that prohibiting the 
use of scabs changes the balance unfairly in favour of the 
unions, I say— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is still the union president talking, and I agree with what 
he says. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Have a look at things in Quebec and draw your own 
conclusions”. 
Workers do not enjoy being on strike. They exercise their right 
to strike only when they have no other choice, because it always 
ends up costing them a lot. 
In passing, if you can get yourself a worthwhile job when you 
are on strike, you let me know, particularly when unemployment 
seems forever high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of changing the balance in favour of 
the unions, prohibiting employers to use scabs brings the forces 
back into balance to a point that favours more reasonable 
negotiations where both employer and union work to quickly find 
a common ground, develop relations that will enable them to 
reconcile their divergent interests and find solutions that 
reflect their convergent interests. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite such a clearly expressed and courageous letter, one must 
conclude that the Canadian federal government was insensitive to 
such a view, although it encourages in-depth reflection on the 
past, present and future labour relations of Canadian and Quebec 
workers faced with globalization and a world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the federal government has caved in to the 
multinational lobby, and no doubt campaign bagmen as well, by 
adding the word “demonstrated” to the wording concerning scabs. 
It now reads “for the demonstrated purpose of undermining a 
trade union's representational capacity”.  This adjective adds 
to the burden of proof, because it is up to the labour union to 
prove that the hiring of scabs has undermined its 
representational capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What goes still further is the motion made by Jean Charest's 
people.  It is no doubt he who inspired Motion No. 27 of last 
week in which my hon. colleague for Madawaska—Restigouche 
moved—and I shall read it for the benefit of our viewers—a motion 
which dates no doubt from the time of Mr. Charest and does not 
sound promising for the workers of Quebec: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2.2) For greater certainty, an employer shall be deemed not to 
have undermined a trade union's representational capacity by 
reason only of the employer's use of the service of a person 
referred to in subsection (2.1). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents the pseudo-progressive Conservatives well, and no 
doubt also reflects the profound thoughts of a man like Jean 
Charest, who wants to be in control of the destinies of the 
people of Quebec before long. We have news for him, both on the 
constitutional front and on the labour relations front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lessons to be learned from the Canada Labour Code and 
its effect in Quebec. There are three types of workers in 
Quebec. We have non-unionized workers, which is unfortunate for 
them. Then we have unionized workers under the Quebec labour 
code who—and the code is very clear on this—cannot suffer the 
humiliation of being replaced by scabs if they decide to go on 
strike. Finally, we have the workers regulated by the Canada 
Labour Code, who can suffer the humiliation of being replaced by 
scabs who undermine the effect of a democratically called 
strike.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Things will be better in a free, sovereign and independent 
Quebec. The Quebec labour code will apply. It was originally 
passed in 1977, under the minister responsible at the time, 
Pierre-Marc Johnson. This was under a government led by a great 
democrat, René Lévesque. At the time, there was no consensus in 
Canada. That is the excuse we have been given, that there is no 
consensus in Canadian society. There was no consensus either at 
the time, but the Lévesque government and Minister Pierre-Marc 
Johnson demonstrated the political courage that was required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the impact of the antiscab provision over the past 
21 years? Conflicts are shorter and there is no longer any 
violence wherever the Quebec code applies. However, there is 
still violence where the Canada Labour Code applies, as we 
recently saw during the strike affecting the port of Quebec 
City. 
It was not until the pressure built up and the conflict got out 
of hand that the federal government intervened in an appropriate 
manner. Why? Because the Canada Labour Code still allows the use 
of scabs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses subject to the Quebec labour code can no longer use 
scabs, and Quebeckers and the National Assembly must be praised 
for passing such legislation. Let us hope that the House of 
Commons will wake up some day and that the government in office 
will have the political courage to support workers in such an 
important matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak at third reading, the final opportunity to talk 
about Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been an interesting process for me because as a rookie MP 
I have been able to watch the bill from the time it was tabled, 
through the various stages of debate, through some rocky times 
and through some very interesting manoeuvres in terms of some 
people with a will to try to stop the legislation.  They have 
thrown everything they could to grind it to a halt and to avoid 
this day actually happening where we are finally at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to question period we heard two very lengthy, long winded 
speeches that were very negative about Bill C-19.  They were very 
critical about the content.  They even went beyond the content 
and the actual amendments to the Canada Labour Code.  They seemed 
to challenge and attack the whole idea of a strong and healthy 
labour movement in Canada.  They seemed to have an underlying 
tone, almost a sinister undertone, to their comments and remarks 
that indicated to me they were not supportive of the idea of a 
free and active trade union movement in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret there is a group of people and organizations that do 
not see the value of the trade union movement as an integral 
aspect of democracy.  Even as we debated Bill C-19 the larger 
issue was not really the amendments to the Canada Labour Code. It 
was the pursuit of social and economic justice and labour's role 
in that pursuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally do not believe that any legislation will lead us 
toward social justice.  I do not think social justice can be 
achieved through parliamentary means.  I think that is the role 
of the labour movement, but we do need to create the legislative 
framework within which unions can flourish, prosper and do their 
job and help to distribute the wealth of a great nation to larger 
groups so that we can narrow that gap between rich and poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really what the last two years have been about as we 
have been spiriting Bill C-66 and now Bill C-19 through the 
process whether or not it has been stated overtly.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about the redistribution of wealth and the 
ability of unions to function, prosper and flourish in our 
community and in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments put forward by the Reform Party were very 
worrisome.  There is a point in law which states that a person 
can be presumed to have intended the probable consequences of his 
or her actions.  Thinking that through, it is kind of scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if Reformers really did think through the probable 
consequences of some of the amendments they were putting forward. 
If they had, what they would be advocating is limiting the 
ability of labour organizations to elevate the standards of wages 
and working conditions of the people they represent.  I think 
most Canadians would agree that is not a good thing, a valuable 
function or a valuable role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to some of the amendments put forward by the 
Reform Party, there was a familiar theme.  I almost felt that I 
was having déjà vu, that I had heard all of this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After going through committee stage and hearing speaker after 
speaker as they filibustered, and then coming to the report stage 
and listening to the same diatribe, the same tired, lame, old 
thoughts, it came to me where I had heard this before.  It was 
all contained in the right to work doctrine being pushed by the 
Fraser Institute.  It is yesterday's news.  It is a tired and 
outdated ideology that somehow the Reform Party has stumbled upon 
and thinks it has come up with a new idea in labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, the right to work means the right to work for 
less.  There are 21 states in the United States that are burdened 
with this right to work legislation.  The way we talk about the 
states in the United States now is that there are free states and 
there are right to work states.  The 21 right to work states are 
not free for workers.  There is no free collective bargaining 
because they have essentially outlawed it.  They have passed 
legislation that has stopped the ability of unions to do their 
job to elevate the standards of working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those right to work states all the social indicators about 
social well-being, wages, mortality rates, infant mortality rates 
and the amount spent on education per student are far below the 
national average.  In the right to work states they have managed 
to grind down the standard of living by eliminating the ability 
of unions to help keep the standard of living up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those are the consequences that the Reform Party has 
contemplated by its amendments, then I really wish it would 
reconsider them because what it is pushing is poison.  It is bad 
for working people, it is bad for the economy because consumers 
have less disposable income and it grinds the economy to a halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of our caucus is that fair wages benefit the whole 
community.  There is nothing wrong with the concept of workers 
earning fair wages and spending accordingly.  That is a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very frustrated and frankly tired of listening to the 
right wing Reformers pushing this particular brand of poison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen:</B>  Nobody listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Nobody really listens.  Some people do, 
unfortunately, in the west where I come from.  It is kind of 
frightening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole rise of the right wing is worrisome to working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were here the other night speaking to a private member's bill 
about the Mac-Paps, the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion.  I could 
not help but think there were parallels here.  We heard about 
that courageous bunch of people in the 1930s who went to Europe 
to fight fascism, to fight right wing extremism.  It took a lot 
of courage to do that.  The right wing extremism was born out of 
a period of economic recession, much like we saw with high 
interest rates and the slowing of the economy.  That kind of 
depression spawns right wing extremism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as it took a lot of courage for those people in the 1930s 
to go to Spain to fight fascism there, it also takes a lot of 
courage for people to stand now to fight right wing extremism in 
our own country.  I really saw a parallel there because there are 
people who think there is too much democracy in the world.  I 
keep hearing the word misused.  The right wing seems to have 
stumbled on the word democracy and finds that it likes it too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the people who are promoting the MAI, the actual people 
who are pushing the MAI, are saying that there is a surplus of 
democracy in the world today that is interfering with the free 
movement of capital and investment.  Is that not a frightening 
thing?  Some people actually believe there is a surplus of 
democracy.  This is the same right wing that would like to keep 
the labour movement down.  That is typical.  Right wing zealots 
always go after the trade unions first when they start to repress 
rights. 
They lock up the trade unionists.  They outlaw unions.  It is a 
real trend and a real theme.  It is a pattern that we see 
developing in the Reform Party.  It is interesting to watch, but 
it is also frightening to watch when we see these parallels.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we hear the Reform Party standing to defend 
the interests of capital.  It is a good thing that some of us are 
looking at legislation that will defend the rights of working 
people to move forward the advantage of working people.  That is 
exactly what Bill C-19 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good thing about Bill C-19, without commenting on the 
changes to the labour code that Bill C-19 will introduce, is the 
process that took place.  A spirit of co-operation resulted in 
what we know as Bill C-19.  It was almost an unprecedented 
consultation process where government, labour and management sat 
down in a tripartite fashion and decided on things that would 
make the system work better.  That is the kind of model we would 
like to see used in a number of other areas.  In countries that 
are moving forward socially as well as economically, that is what 
we see.  It is a truly tripartite model where business, labour 
and government sit down together to chart out the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extreme right wing wants to deny the existence of labour. It 
wants to keep labour away from the table.  It wants to stamp 
labour out.  That kind of adversarial attitude is what is going 
to hold us back as a nation.  The right wing might think it is 
progress. It is not progress.  It holds us back.  We all move 
forward when we move forward together.  We are not trying to wipe 
out the right wing, so it should not be trying to wipe out 
labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real contradictions about this whole debate has been 
the Reform Party trying to stall and block Bill C-19 when it 
claims to represent the interests of the prairie agricultural 
industry.  There are 130,000 prairie farmers who are dying to see 
Bill C-19 go through so they can be confident their grain 
shipments will not be interrupted at the ports.  What a 
contradiction.  These champions of the western agricultural 
industry are doing everything they can to stall, delay and block 
Bill C-19 when 130,000 farmers want it.  We do not only see an 
anti-worker sentiment, we see an anti-farmer sentiment.  It seems 
like a real contradiction to me.  I do not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was awkward to watch some of the debate at the committee 
stage because, frankly, the Reform Party was handicapped by its 
complete naivety about industrial relations.  We heard some 
things at committee stage that would make people roll their eyes. 
If people knew the level of debate that went on in Ottawa about 
this complicated issue they would be horrified.  They would be 
horrified because it was mean-spirited, it was narrow-minded, it 
was parochial and it was self-interested.  It did not have the 
interests of labour relations in Canada at heart.  It only 
considered the narrow, political self-interest of the very narrow 
population that it is serving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the bit of time I have left to talk about the four 
items that are most positive about Bill C-19 and why our caucus 
is proud to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the restructuring of the labour relations board into a 
truly representational board is one of the most important things 
that came out of the Sims task force, Bill C-66 and Bill C-19. 
It was something that all parties could agree on.  Labour had 
always complained.  It was always frustrated that there was a 
lack of consultation in the process of making appointments to the 
board.  With the new changes and the new Canada Industrial 
Relations Board we will see the representation which we felt was 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other changes which we think are very positive.  The 
single neutral chair will be able to hear certain cases to try to 
fix the backlog.  There is a terrible backlog, especially in 
applications for certification.  Some 90 applications for 
certification are currently pending.  We are hoping with the 
speedy passage of Bill C-19 that some of that backlog will be 
alleviated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are critical in one respect.  One of the recommendations that 
labour was making was that there should be consultation with 
labour and management when making appointments.  The actual bill 
says that there should be consultation with members who represent 
employees, not necessarily the legitimate labour union.  We are 
very concerned that some of the rat unions, the non-unions, for 
instance in western Canada, will claim they deserve to make 
appointments. 
I am referring to the Christian Labour Association of Canada and 
other employer-dominated unions that are not legitimate 
representatives of working people.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The General Workers Union, CLAC, all those unions are not real 
unions and they should not be consulted.  It should be the 
legitimate labour unions that are consulted because they 
represent the working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one place where we did part paths in terms of our support 
for this bill was with respect to replacement workers.  We do not 
believe that the replacement workers' clause is nearly strong 
enough.  We supported the amendment put forward by the member for 
Trois-Rivières to try to make that clause more powerful and 
actually prevent strikes and lockouts by banning replacement 
workers, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised that there was not more support from the other 
side of the House because in 1995 the House of Commons voted on a 
private member's bill, Bill C-317, introduced by a Bloc Quebecois 
MP which had very strong anti-scab provisions in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the bill was voted down, there were 104 MPs, 
including 49 from the government, who voted in favour of that 
bill.  We were hoping to see those same 49 people vote in favour 
of anti-scab provisions this time, but hope springs eternal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Unfortunately, some of them are no longer 
with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Some of them are no longer here.  I 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hold strongly to the view that true anti-scab legislation 
minimizes the number of days lost due to strikes and lockouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made this point before.  If industry is truly concerned 
about lost time and lost productivity, it is not strikes and 
lockouts they should be worried about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Manitoba we lose 50,000 days per year to 
strikes and lockouts, but we lose 550,000 days per year to 
injuries and accidents.  If they are serious about lost 
productivity and lost profits, it is not strikes and lockouts 
that are the problem, it is the carnage in the workplace that is 
the problem and that is easier to rectify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal of whining and bleating from Reform 
Party members that they do not like the idea of automatic 
certification.  They want a mandatory vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They think it is undemocratic to try to level the imbalance in 
power that exists between employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, if 50% plus one have signed the cards, the 
people have spoken.  To make them vote twice is undemocratic. 
How many times will they make them vote?  Until they get the 
answer they want?  Over and over and over again?  How democratic 
is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It sounds familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  You don't like that, so you shouldn't 
like this either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if there are 100% of the cards signed, the way they 
envision it there would still have to be a supervised vote.  It 
is fundamentally wrong.  It is unethical and it gives the 
employer another chance to use intimidation and coercion to try 
to tilt the scale in its favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, there is not enough substance and background in 
labour relations in the entire Reform caucus to present that 
argument with any real substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is put to bed now once and for all.  Bill C-19 recognizes the 
legitimacy of 50% plus one constituting a majority and we are 
glad of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successor rights are a very important aspect.  These things have 
been improved in Bill C-19 and we are very pleased to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the first task force chair described the following 
three beliefs that the Sims task force members shared as part of 
a vision statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, that the existing Canada Labour Code basically continues 
to serve its constituencies well.  Second, emphasizing stability, 
they said that pendulum like changes to the code are neither 
necessary nor desirable.  They are a bad thing.  Third, they said 
that consensus between the parties is the best basis for decision 
making on legislative change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to say that after the years of consultation since the 
Sims task force we have held true to those three founding 
principles.  We have managed to introduce changes that are 
meaningful and will serve the labour relations climate in this 
country very well for many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to give the speaker who just spoke an indefinite amount of 
time to continue.  I think he is probably doing us a lot of good.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 3 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-284, an act to amend the Criminal Records Act and the 
Canadian Human Rights Act (offences against children), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

approximately four minutes left to speak on this bill today as he

few minutes of comments later in this hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I understand that at the conclusion

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the House understand the situation and is it agreed that we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank all members present for allowing me to get 
this speech on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important private members' bill.  A tremendous 
amount of work has been done by my colleague in Calgary Centre on 
behalf of families, and on behalf of children.  He tries to seek 
legislative and other ways to protect that valued institution in 
our country.  I commend him for his efforts and I look forward to 
more in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-284 do that is so important? In general Bill 
C-284 would enable those responsible for children, in other words 
institutions like daycare centres, elementary schools and any 
institution or group that works with children to be more fully 
informed about decisions on whom they are hiring and to be able 
to do a criminal records check on them that has not been covered 
up by a ministerial pardon.  Specifically it allows for the 
limited disclosure of an individual's criminal record if the 
individual had been convicted of a sexual offence against a child 
and later applies for one of these positions of trust with 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, Bill C-284 would ensure that we can always do a 
criminal records check on a sexual offender.  We can ensure 
thereby that anyone holding a position of authority or trust for 
a child has had that record run against him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into why this is so necessary I would like to 
reaffirm again the importance of the family in Canadian society. 
The protection of vulnerable people in our society is a job that 
this parliament has an obligation to fulfill.  We have not done a 
glorious job of protecting families or protecting children.  In 
the ongoing debate on the Young Offenders Act and the future of 
the tax system to help people raise children, and on all those 
other issues, the government has not done a great job in 
fulfilling the requirements of families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 tries to plug one of the loopholes that has allowed a 
negative impact upon families and specifically upon children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the genesis of this.  It is not a nice story. 
It is a very tragic one.  It has to do with a story about Bobby 
Oatway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oatway's real name is Stevens and he has a criminal sexual 
record against children which spans back as far as 1965 and 
includes all kinds of things, buggery, bestiality, gross 
indecency and sexual assault.  He beat and raped his wife for 
eight years before she left him in 1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 he completed two-thirds of his latest 10 year sentence 
for sex crimes. He was serving three 10-year sentences 
concurrently in Mountain prison which was in my riding prior to 
the last election. He was granted statutory release in 1996 and 
his conditions last until 1999 which are monitoring conditions 
for this man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He chose to move to Prince George and then Toronto.  Everywhere 
he went neighbourhood protests in those cities caused him to move 
back to Mountain prison where he voluntarily reincarcerated 
himself because of those problems. Because he was in Mountain 
prison voluntarily he could ask prison officials to release him 
to a halfway house at any time. In other words, this could be 
done at any time without notice within three working days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that happened then he would automatically be sent to the 
Sumas correctional facility which is also in my riding. That 
means he would be released back into the community and no one 
would know. If Sumas centre did not want him or refused to take 
him, then there was nowhere else to let him loose and they would 
just open the doors and let him walk free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSC says they cannot notify the public if Oatway is released. 
They just do not have that authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of Bobby Oatway's presence in my community in this 
way and the circumstances surrounding his potential release, his 
former victims co-ordinated the gathering of a 26,000 name 
petition from across Canada.  It asks the government to focus 
more on the rights of the victims in legislation rather than on 
the convicted sex criminals or dangerous offenders who are at 
high risk to reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, 1996 as part of National Family Week, I tabled 
that 26,000 name petition in the House.  It is one of the victim 
focused approaches to crime prevention that the Reform Party has 
suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition specifically asked that the government amend the 
Criminal Code to prohibit for life all those convicted of sex 
offences against children from holding positions of trust or 
responsibility regarding children.  That is an easy thing to 
support on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this current parliament, my colleague from Calgary Centre 
tabled a very similar bill with some improvements I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the background of where my involvement in this bill came 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once criminals complete their sentence, any criminal can apply 
for a pardon.  A pardon allows people convicted of a criminal 
offence to have their criminal record sealed and effectively 
erased from public scrutiny and the public record. Therefore once 
a pardon is granted to a person, that person even though 
convicted of a criminal offence will not have that record 
disclosed or made accessible to anyone without prior approval of 
the Solicitor General of Canada which practically speaking is 
nearly an impossible process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible that individuals convicted of sexual crimes can 
be released from prison, granted a pardon and obtain a job or a 
position of authority regarding children. No one will know about 
it and there is no way to even check the records to see if that 
person has had a prior offence involving sexual crimes against 
children.  It is this kind of possibility that this bill would 
stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third party childcare givers would be given greater certainty 
over who they are hiring and who they are welcoming into 
everything from a boy scout group to a childcare facility.  They 
would have the possibility of checking on that person's criminal 
records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are our children at risk?  Is this kind of protection really 
needed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSC's own studies show that about one-third of all sex offenders 
are convicted of a new criminal offence after release. About one 
in ten are convicted of a new sex offence during the follow-up 
period, which is the probationary period that follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British studies indicate that both homosexual pedophiles and 
heterosexual pedophiles recommit crimes at an alarming rate.  So 
do our children need all the protection we can give them?  The 
answer of course is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 would reduce at least the risk of sexual offenders 
applying to agencies where they frequently use those facilities 
and opportunities as predators against children.  Those people 
who are hiring people to work in positions of authority deserve 
the right to do a criminal records check on anyone applying for a 
job. 
That is what Bill C-284 would do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the critics say to this proposal?  They say that perhaps 
it violates a criminal's rights, that he should have the right to 
absolute privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 does not propose that child sex offenders can never 
be pardoned.  It does not say that.  It does not propose that if 
one does commit a crime it should forever be on the public record 
and broadcast on television.  It does however propose the 
following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a limited disclosure of an individual's criminal 
record if the individual being already convicted of a sexual 
offence against a child later applies for a position of trust of 
working with children.  When he applies for that position whoever 
is doing the hiring should say “I will take your application. Be 
aware that I am going to do a criminal records check on you”—as 
they should anyway—“and if you are pardoned it will not wipe 
that record clean”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now you do not know. Once a pardon has taken place the 
records are sealed and even though you ask for that records check 
you cannot get that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be argued that Bill C-284 limits a criminal's rights 
ever so slightly.  However in light of the high recidivism rate 
among sexual offenders, I would argue that it is a warranted and 
justified limited restriction on a criminal's rights because we 
must put the rights of children and the rights of law-abiding 
citizens ahead of the rights of the criminal in this kind of a 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to protect innocent, vulnerable children is a stronger 
and more prominent right than the right of a criminal to have his 
records forever sealed and never available to be checked in any 
way whatsoever.  It is a stronger argument to protect children. 
It is a nobler argument to protect children and that is what this 
bill intends to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously whenever children are at risk we must do everything we 
can to protect them.  If we pass Bill C-284 and we do risk 
stubbing the rights of the Bobby Oatways of this world and 
forcing them to have their records available in a limited way to 
all those who might want to hire such a person unknowingly to 
work with children, then we may have to offend some of those 
rights in a small way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to emphasize the importance of 
families and children to Canadian society.  The House has the 
responsibility to protect the children who are most vulnerable, 
to build up the family and to look after the rights of those 
people to make sure they are not compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently our legal system places children at an unreasonable 
physical risk because a sexual offender who has received a pardon 
could be hired unknowingly by a childcare agency without having 
his past criminal records scrutinized.  This bill would eliminate 
that risk or at least drastically reduce it.  It would fulfil our 
obligation to put the rights of innocent people and innocent 
children ahead of the rights of the criminal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House adopts my hon. colleague's bill these questions 
will not have to be answered again or at least not as frequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a fundamental role to ensure the protection 
of its citizens.  This is particularly true for those who are 
innocent and most vulnerable, our children. 
Protecting children is the ultimate responsibility.  They must be 
allowed to grow up free from abuse and free from molestation.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what does one say to console parents who have had a child 
molested?  There is no answer that can be provided unless we take 
steps at this time to pass the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-one per cent of sex offenders released from federal 
correctional institutions commit another violation of some sort 
within three years.  Pedophiles are at greater risk than rapists. 
It is likely that pedophiles, especially those men who offend 
young boys, are at greater risk to reoffend sexually than are 
rapists.  As a matter of fact statistics show it is 19% to 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what does one say to parents after a child has been 
molested by someone who has already served time for a similar 
offence? Bill C-184 introduced by my colleague would provide 
measures so that employers and parents would know the past of the 
people they are hiring and thus provide protection to the most 
precious possessions they have, their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently when someone receives a pardon for summary or 
indictable offences there is no record accessible to the public 
that there was ever a criminal conviction or that pardon was ever 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, how would a parent or an employer feel knowing that the 
information was withheld from them when they hired someone who 
they did not know was a convicted pedophile? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is specific in its intent.  In order to protect our 
children from this type of element in society it is incumbent 
upon all members who sit in the House to make the right move to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, why is Bill C-284 so important not just to my party, not 
just to the parties opposite, but to every member of the House? 
The responsibility now falls upon them.  Essentially it sends a 
message.  If the House wants that message to go out all across 
Canada to our constituencies in every province, we are saying by 
passing the bill that the protection of our children is important 
and is the most paramount thing we could do at the present time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate today on Bill C-284 introduced 
by the member for Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at the bill we believe the purpose of its enactment 
is to provide for a specific instance where the public interest 
in a limited disclosure of the record of a conviction that has 
been pardoned supersedes the right to privacy of the pardoned 
person. The instance referred to is where the conviction was for 
a sexual offence against a child and the person convicted applied 
for a position of trust with respect to a child or children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disclosure would be made only to those with responsibility 
for the child or children who are considering the application. 
Unauthorized disclosure by them would be an offence as we 
understand the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Canadian Human Rights Act to provide 
that job requirement and hiring practice for child trust 
positions that discriminate against a person on the ground of a 
pardoned sexual offence against a child are not discriminatory 
practices giving rise to an offence under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses serious safety concerns for children in our 
communities.  The bill strikes a sufficient balance between the 
rights of the individual and the safety concerns of society.  We 
are in support of it.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides safeguards and limitations for the release of 
personal information regarding a person who has been pardoned. 
The bill ensures that information can only be requested by a 
prospective employer in relation to an employment application. In 
other words, it cannot be indiscriminately given out or requested 
from anyone.  There is a clear protocol for the release of 
information about the individual concerned and serious penalties 
for wrongful disclosure of the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures adequately protect individuals from the misuse of 
personal information of the limited group of individuals we are 
talking about this afternoon.  It is important, however, to 
recognize that when a pardon is granted it is recognition the 
offender has demonstrated real progress, restitution and 
rehabilitation and the powers the bill would bring into play are 
not exercised lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The release of any information about an individual by the state 
must be undertaken with the greatest of discretion and caution, 
and all appropriate safeguards must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One improvement to the bill with regard to privacy concerns 
would be a provision for the notification of the individual that 
a request has been made for the disclosure of the individual's 
criminal record and pardon.  This would give the individual the 
opportunity to withdraw an application for employment prior to 
the disclosure of the individual's personal information as 
opposed to being notified upon disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the bill addresses a very serious concern for the safety 
of our children, communities and society as a whole. The bill 
could prevent future tragedies in our communities.  If even one 
child can be spared it is worth pursuing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C-284, an act to amend 
the Criminal Records Act and the Canadian Human Rights Act 
(offences against children). 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals with a very important topic, the need to protect 
our children against sexual abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already taken the necessary actions to allow 
organizations and individuals occupying positions of trust and 
authority with respect to children to work with community police 
forces to investigate known sexual offenders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How have we done this?  During the summer of 1994 officials from 
the ministries of the solicitor general, justice and health 
conducted national consultations on the issue of whether Canada 
should establish a registry of child sex offenders.  Officials 
consulted with provincial and territorial officials, police 
agencies, volunteer agencies and non-governmental organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While participants in these consultations did not support the 
establishment of such a registry, they did support the 
enhancement of the existing Canadian Police Information Centre 
database to provide more and better information to police and 
organizations working with their local police agencies to help 
screen out sex offenders from positions of trust or authority 
over children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participants supported other federal measures that would 
directly assist child service organizations in developing 
policies to screen out sex offenders.  Accordingly in November 
1994 the Solicitor General of Canada announced enhancements to 
the CPIC.  These databanks now include data on all convicted sex 
offenders, prohibition orders and peace bonds relating to sex 
offenders, the age and the sex of the child victims of sexual 
abuse and fingerprint information on persons charged with high 
grade offences.  There is a system in place at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joint funding by the ministries of the solicitor general, 
justice and health was announced for a national education 
campaign to screen out sexual abusers.  An integral part of the 
campaign was the development of the screening manual by the 
Canadian Association of Volunteer Bureaux and Centres, now known 
as Volunteer Canada.  This manual includes a comprehensive 
national and provincial-territorial analysis of the social, 
legislative and policy context for the screening.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The education campaign has resulted in the development of a 
series of fact sheets and a video entitled “Duty of Care”, which 
were used to inform and educate the public, and made available 
in over 200 Canadian communities.  I am proud of this campaign's 
huge success, and we recently learned that it would be extended 
for another two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers and community organizations should have a formal 
screening policy covering interviews, reference checks, 
individual risk evaluations, training and supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-284 is commendable. However, the bill adds 
to the confusion in providing for the screening of sexual 
offenders by checking criminal records even after a pardon has 
been granted. There is also the issue of records being 
destroyed. In fact, they are sealed and kept separate at the 
Canadian Police Information Centre. If a pardoned offender is 
subsequently convicted of a summary offence, pardon is 
automatically revoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for investigation purposes, identifying information 
on pardoned criminals is made available as soon as fingerprints 
are submitted, and this without reopening the entire criminal 
record. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken significant and important measures to 
better protect children from sexual offenders.  Being a mother, I 
certainly want to make sure that is the case for my children and 
all Canadian children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior criminal justice officials are currently reviewing these 
measures to determine if more can be done.  It is very clear, 
however, that Bill C-284 does not do more to protect children. It 
sends the wrong message to parents and volunteer organizations 
that a criminal record check alone, including a check of pardoned 
records, will protect their children.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason this government does not support this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak about Bill C-284 
regarding amending the Criminal Records Act.  Before I get into 
the nuts and bolts of the act I will give a little background 
information to the whole system of pardoning in not the entire 
history of civilization but since ancient times, which perhaps 
only the member from Surrey North might remember considering the 
colour of his hair.  I think he is much more antiquated than I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ancient times apparently it was a monarch's privilege to 
distribute these pardons to anyone who had committed an atrocious 
act.  I am thinking of King Zeus.  He was a very compassionate 
person, much like Mr. Speaker sitting on the throne dispensing 
justice wisely and profoundly to all of us mere peons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I rush ahead to merry old England, which was not merry old 
England to tell the truth, when King Henry VIII was the monarch. 
He was not so compassionate in his distribution of justice to 
those who disagreed with him or who had the misfortune of 
marrying him; almost as unfortunate as some person having the 
misfortune of marrying the member for Calgary Southeast. 
However that is food for thought for another time.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go on to think about what kings we have in Canada who perhaps 
could distribute this justice.  The only king I can think of in 
Canada is the King of Kensington.  If anyone has been to 
Toronto's Kensington market on a Friday afternoon, I would think 
that the King of Kensington would most certainly be distributing 
justice and fairness and pardoning my sins if he could somehow 
prevent me from being at that market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much sooner appear at the Calabogie market as you 
perhaps, Mr. Speaker, might indulge in doing on Saturday, knowing 
full well that you happen to be travelling up to the great riding 
of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  The Calabogie flea market as 
you may or may not know, Mr. Speaker, as you very infrequently 
leave your humble abode on the beautiful shores of the Madawaska 
River, dispenses all sorts of goodies, the most common and famous 
of which would be the maple syrup.  If you desire to go to that 
market, Mr. Speaker, I am sure that somehow we could arrange that 
for you, not by a chauffeured limousine but by a horse and buggy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us rush on to the system of pardoning.  When I speak about 
pardoning I am talking— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I may be mistaken but I was under the impression that we were 
debating Bill C-284.  I have heard absolutely no reference to the 
bill in the last three and a half minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke was tying in pardons with the market 
in Calabogie.  I think we are about to hear now how that relates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am rushing on.  There 
was a lead up to Bill C-284. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about pardoning.  I have to bring a subject up 
because we have had some people—and I hate to say this being 
their federal member of parliament—of disrepute who on occasion 
have gone through the pardoning system, or have attempted to go 
through the pardoning system, or on occasion perhaps should have 
used or taken advantage of the system of pardoning as distributed 
by the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person was a man in Stonecliffe, Ontario by the name of Wild 
Willie Buckshot.  It is too bad that the hon. member from Souris 
is not here because as the story goes with this pardoning, he 
actually rode with the notorious outlaw Jesse James. This is a 
true story.  He said that Jesse James fell off his horse while 
robbing a bank and he went back and picked up Jesse James and 
rescued him.  For this very humane act he was charged under the 
Criminal Code with aiding and abetting a robbery.  He believed 
that he should have received a pardon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether or not he did get a pardon but the gist of 
the story is that Wild Willie Buckshot turned out to be a very 
respectable member of that community.  As a matter of fact he 
became known as one of the premier lumbermen in that area.  He 
happened to also have a chicken farm.  I do not know how they 
both relate but it is just to show the system of pardoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then had a former mayor of the city of Pembroke by the name 
of Angus A. Campbell who believed that he was wrongly done by 
because they put a bypass around the community of Petawawa.  It 
went through his farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member listens and pays strict attention he will see 
the end of where I am coming to in this pardoning system.  I 
understand this is a private members' bill and that I am at a 
luxury here to go about this in a roundabout way. On occasion 
many of the members speaking have been rather abrupt with it, 
giving all the nuances of this bill.  I am just taking a 
different cut on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak about the former mayor of the city of Pembroke, 
what he did was very appropriate.  He stood in the middle of 
Highway 17 with a shotgun and stopped all traffic on both sides 
of the king's highway. 
As a result of that there was a possibility that he would be 
charged.  He wanted an outlet into his property because it was 
hurting his place of business.

not think he would be.  I do not believe that he would.  Perhaps 
the members opposite would think so.  He became the 
vice-president of the Canadian Association of Mayors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had a lawyer called Maloney.  Members may be interested 
in this.  He was a criminal lawyer of note.  He went into the 
court system.  He had a person who had been charged.  In his 
presentation before the judge he clearly indicated to the judge 
that the person had not lied since he was rocked in a cradle. As 
a result of that the judge dispensed justice in the appropriate 
manner.  He pardoned his sins, if we want to look at it in that 
regard.  How this lawyer pulled this grandiose feat off was he 
rocked the person in a cradle in his chambers before he went into 
the court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that my time is running out and I want to 
get to the real point.  Apparently one in ten Canadians have a 
criminal record.  That would lead me to believe that, and perhaps 
I should not extrapolate from this, but the loyal opposition has 
60 members and perhaps six of them have a criminal record.  If 
they have done something of disrepute and want to be pardoned for 
that, they can appeal to the solicitor general.  I cannot see any 
problem in that if there is some justification to the pardoning 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we come to sexual offences concerning young children, the 
basis of my talk has been that we cannot take a broad brush and 
paint the entire society in a negative fashion because of things 
done in a repugnant manner by a small minority.  I believe Bill 
C-284 is going to address the concerns of the people who can take 
advantage of the pardoning system in a fair and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rest assured, Mr. Speaker, and hon. members opposite, that it 
will be the Liberal Party of Canada that will continue to look 
after and care for the benefits of all people irrespective of 
age, gender and nationality.  Goodness gracious, we will even 
look after members of the Conservative Party if they so desire.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today on Bill C-284 and speak 
in support of my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opening remarks were not going to concern what I have just 
heard across the floor of this House.  I would be remiss if I did 
not comment on the speeches which were just related to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look out as I have never done before in this House.  I am 
looking right at the camera asking Canadians who are watching 
today to put down the iron for a few minutes, put down those 
books, put down whatever it is they are doing for a minute and 
listen to what is going on in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had two speeches with a certain amount of humour in them 
on an issue which does not have any humour in it.  This bill is 
about protecting our children and our future, the future of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, I would say that 
this great Liberal compassion, this great idea that the Liberals 
are going to stand up for everyone has turned out in my 
experience since coming to this House in September, to be in 
essence a falsehood.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two examples.  We have been dealing with hepatitis C 
for some time.  Where is the compassion?  Where is the 
understanding?  Where is the government taking care of our 
people, the people in need? I look at our military people, the 
junior ranks, not the senior ranks. Where oh where is the 
compassion and understanding for them?  I will speak to the 
cameras again.  It is a sad commentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking with this bill is for support from all members 
of the House for one more tool to protect our children. We are 
not asking for the abuse of the rights of Canadian citizens. 
When criminals commit acts of violence, sexual abuse against 
children and so on, whether anybody likes it or not, the system 
is set up so that they do lose some of their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary to the justice minister was going on 
about the fact that some organization did not want a registry. 
They felt that the screening manual that was developed would be 
sufficient or a step in the right direction and I have to agree 
very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations have to use due diligence in determining who their 
employees are, whether or not they are capable of the job and 
whether or not they are a danger to the recipients of their 
service.  In this case it is children and their mothers and 
fathers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say yes, I agree with that screening manual.  I agree with all 
the education.  But why would anyone be opposed to having one 
more tool, a vital tool?  That tool would be the right to find 
out if someone has had a previous conviction record of sexual 
abuse against children.  If in fact they had been pardoned, that 
record could be opened up as it pertains to their record of 
sexual abuse against children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is that simple. There should be no reason why members 
on all sides, the Liberals, the NDP, the Conservatives, the Bloc, 
cannot support this bill.  It is a small step but it is a very 
important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying, as the parliamentary secretary tried to 
indicate, that we only believe this one item is what the whole 
world will rest on, that a check of the criminal record is 
sufficient to protect our children.  It is not.  However it 
definitely is one step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for just a minute about who commits these 
offences.  Certainly the term pedophiles has been mentioned. 
Obviously that term is used for a reason because it has to do 
with sexual offences against children.  I have heard different 
members, including members of my own party, talk about 31% of sex 
offenders released from prisons reviolate within three years and 
this kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent 30 years in the police force and I certainly did not 
spend all my time working on child abuse cases.  However for 
every time a criminal is caught for doing an act he or she has 
done—and let us not misunderstand the idea in that there are 
also female sex abusers of children—the fact is that an offender 
will normally commit many offences before he actually gets 
caught.  A lot of offenders go through a good part of their 
lifetime never getting caught for the offences they commit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of using 31% of sex offenders released from federal 
correctional institutions reviolating, that is understated.  When 
that person reviolates, he will only be charged for that one 
reviolation.  He will not be charged with all the ones for which 
there is no evidence or insufficient evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we are looking at here is being understated by 
people who use statistics to try to say there are only a few 
cases and it is not so bad. 
We only have to look at the milk cartons and all the police files 
that show missing child after missing child.  We know from the 
convictions of people who were caught for this that they commit 
multiple offences.  It is not the kind of crime where they do it 
once.  That is what is so serious about this.

parliamentarians we should take that step.  We can all support 
Bill C-284. It is right and there is no reason why we should not 
give our full support to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead today for the government which has a majority in the 
House and can control what goes on to at least have a free vote 
on this and let backbenchers say what they would like to see 
happen to this bill. I am sure a lot would support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come out strongly in favour of this bill.  It is 
definitely right for my grandchild's protection. I ask everyone 
to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry the member turned this into partisan politics 
when this is private members' hour because Bill C-284 is very 
important.  If he is seeking the support on this side of the 
House he should have spared us the shots against the government 
and the shots against the Liberals in suggesting that we have no 
compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed this is an important bill.  On this side of the House we 
do have free votes in Private Members' Business.  This is why we 
are here.  This is why we hear different points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say to the member for Calgary Centre that I think it 
is a very good bill.  He has introduced something that a chord 
that is of great concern to all of us. What is interesting to me 
is he actually touches on a much broader issue, privacy and 
criminality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation now where we can make the parallel between 
what is proposed by Bill C-284, the release of certain criminal 
record information in relation to people who have received 
pardons, and the Young Offenders Act.  Young offenders after 
being convicted have certain protections, certainly in family 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole issue of whether when a person is convicted of a 
serious criminal offence they should be entitled under any 
circumstances to privacy I think is a broader issue that deserves 
a lot of future debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally I am uncomfortable with some of the anti-crime stances 
the Reform Party takes.  Often they seem to be very extreme.  In 
this instance the member for Calgary Centre is proposing 
something the government should pay very careful attention to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the government proposed Bill C-55. That 
bill was related to the one we are talking about and the 
parliamentary secretary to solicitor general made reference to it 
in his speech. That bill addressed the problem of what to do 
about convicted and released sexual offenders to avoid them 
coming back to the environment in which they are tempted to act 
out another crime.  That bill proposed electronic monitoring.  It 
was to give judges the discretion to put electronic shackles on 
individuals without warrants, without charges even, so that when 
they came into the area of a playground or something like that a 
bell would go off via satellite and the police would come and 
pick them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is ever any question in this House that the debates we 
have on legislation can have an impact, the debates that Bill 
C-55 sparked and the criticism that came in this House as a 
result of the concept of putting electronic shackles on people 
before there had been any arrest or charge resulted in that bill 
being thrown out. 
In other words, in the last parliament a bill came forward from 
the justice department which in comparison to what has been 
proposed by the member for Calgary Centre was draconian.  What 
the member for Calgary Centre proposes does have merit.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is simply saying is that when a pardon is 
granted it should be a discretionary pardon in the sense that the 
solicitor general through the Criminal Records Act reserves the 
right to release the information of that record to certain groups 
and individuals who seek to know whether a person soliciting 
employment that involves responsibility with children has a 
previous conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not unreasonable.  This is actually much more reasonable 
than having some sort of device attached permanently to someone 
to prevent them from coming anywhere near children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem is simply that I am not sure we need the legislation 
of Bill C-284 to accomplish the mission the member for Calgary 
Centre is setting out to do.  I cannot pretend to be an expert on 
the Criminal Records Act but I have read all the previous 
speeches, including his, and it does seem the solicitor general 
already has latitude.  I agree with this legislation in 
principle, but rather than using legislation to accomplish what 
he is trying to do we could probably do it by regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partisan politics aside, this is where private members' hour 
becomes very important. The member for Calgary Centre has raised 
an issue that does concern us.  He suggests the direction the 
government may take and if we set aside partisan politics, if 
hon. members listened carefully to the speech of the 
parliamentary secretary for the justice department, they would 
have heard her say the government is interested in this.  The 
government is listening.  The government does care about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Calgary Centre has accomplished something 
very important.  He is touching on an issue that is much broader, 
privacy and criminality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate him on bringing this before the House and I think 
at the very least he has brought his message forward to all 
Liberals on this side and to the government.  This is an area 
where a fix can and should be made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect 
the opinions of all members in the House but it bothers me 
greatly when I see a member make a mockery almost of a serious 
and important piece of legislation.  I say that for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill C-284.  I commend 
the work of the member for Calgary Centre in tabling such an 
important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is important in that its focus is one of the highest 
priority, the protection of our children from abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservative estimates are that 1 in 3 girls is sexually abused 
before the age of 18 while 1 in 6 boys is sexually abused before 
the age of 16.  Even more frightening is that most abused and 
neglected children reportedly never come to the attention of 
authorities.  This is especially true in cases of sexually abused 
children since there may be no outward sign of physical, 
psychological or emotional harm.  Furthermore, sexually abused 
children are reluctant to report these crimes.  They feel intense 
shame, and secrecy is often the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these and other reasons we must focus our attention to 
combat child abuse at the preventive level.  It is a serious 
matter of public interest which Bill C-284, if passed, would help 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As outlined by previous speakers, this bill amends two existing 
statutes, the Criminal Records Act and the Canadian Human Rights 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Criminal Records Act would allow for 
limited disclosure of the criminal record of a person pardoned of 
a conviction for sexual offence against a child.  This disclosure 
would occur when the pardoned person applies for a position of 
trust over children.  The information would be provided to only 
those individuals with responsibility for children who are 
considering such an application. 
Any inappropriate disclosure of information by these individuals 
would be subject to criminal sanctions.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, these changes would give organizations that deal 
with children an additional tool to scrutinize potential 
employees and volunteers before they are placed in positions of 
trust.  Groups such as Scouts Canada, the Girl Guides and minor 
sports teams would have access to information that is extremely 
relevant to the selection process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who would object on the grounds of privacy rights for 
pardoned offenders, I suggest they examine the reality of sexual 
offenders.  Among criminal offenders, those convicted of sexual 
offences have one of the highest rates of recidivism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children are far too important to risk having repeat 
offenders enter into positions of authority and trust.  We must 
give child centred and youth centred organizations the tools to 
prevent future tragedies of child sexual abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad irony that we presently have a government that 
cracks down on law-abiding gun owners and leaves tens of 
thousands of hepatitis victims twisting in the wind yet 
nonetheless feels the rights of convicted child sex offenders 
should take precedence over child safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component of Bill C-284 amends the Canadian Human 
Rights Act that permits organizations to refuse to employ 
individuals in so-called child trust positions on the basis of 
persons having a pardoned sexual offence against a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is the next logical step in Bill C-284.  Once an 
organizations has access to relevant information it should be 
free to act on it without fear of reprisal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the view of those who believe that rehabilitation is a 
laudable goal.  I also believe that securing employment for 
offenders re-entering society is often critical to ensuring that 
they do not become repeat offenders.  This in turn helps protect 
public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to draw the line at allowing convicted sexual offenders, 
irrespective of whether they were pardoned, to secretly enter 
into positions of trust over children.  Canadians need peace of 
mind that organizations to which they entrust their children have 
taken all the precautions necessary to protect their safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 gives these organizations another weapon to fight 
child abuse.  This bill is a reasonable compromise between the 
rights of offenders and the rights of society, in particular our 
most important members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus I urge all 
members to vote in favour of this legislation.  Let us support 
our many volunteer driven organizations that deal with children. 
Let us support our families.  Let us support the safety of our 
children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure today to support my colleague for Calgary Centre on 
Bill C-284. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is based on an earlier bill, Bill C-382, produced by 
my colleague from Fraser Valley.  It died on the order paper at 
the close of the 35th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1996 the member tabled a 26,000 name petition which 
called for the changes similar to those this bill proposes. I am 
very pleased to see it here again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would amend the Criminal Code to prohibit for life all 
those convicted of sex offences against children from holding 
positions of trust and responsibility regarding children.  Surely 
we can all support that.  Thus far I have heard some positive 
comments from Liberals. I am trusting they will support the bill 
to see it through to the end and actually become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would enable those responsible for children to make 
fully informed decisions about who they hire.  Bill C-284 will 
give parents with children in third party care the assurance that 
those responsible for looking after their children have not 
abused this position of authority in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes to allow for the limited disclosure of an 
individual's criminal record if the individual has been convicted 
of a sexual offence against a child and later applies for a 
position of trust with respect to children. 
Such a disclosure will include an individual's criminal record 
for a previous sexual offence against a child or children even if 
they had served their sentence and had later received a pardon 
which had been removed on notice of conviction from the 
individual's criminal record.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very important aspect of the bill given that pardons 
have been fairly easy to obtain. Often those in the area of 
pedophilia are very difficult to cure and would not be subject to 
as much protection as those who have committed other kinds of 
offences under the Criminal Code. I emphasize this limited 
disclosure will only take effect when an individual applies for a 
position of trust with respect to a child or children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 does not propose that sex offences against children 
can never be pardoned.  The bill does not propose that if one 
makes a mistake such as this that it should be forever on one's 
record.  Rather, it proposes that if someone does sexually abuse 
children, that person could effectively be prevented from holding 
a position of authority with children again, as those responsible 
for children will be able to see that a job applicant has abused 
such a position in the past and thus they will be more judicious 
in their hiring practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this bill necessary?  It sends a message that the protection 
of our children is paramount.  We can look at some very high 
profile cases in this province in and around the London area. 
Others are ongoing as we speak like in Cornwall and places like 
that where tragic events have taken place.  Crimes against 
children have impacted the lives of hundreds of people in the 
community.  That is the focus of the bill.  It would ensure those 
involved in this kind of activity will be censured in their 
activities when it comes to looking after children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is necessary to address the procedural deficiencies 
in the way pardons are treated.  Currently when someone receives 
a pardon for a summary or indictable offence, no record is 
accessible by the public that there ever was a criminal 
conviction or that the pardon was ever granted.  A pardon for 
a summary offence is issued three years after one completes one's 
sentence.  One can apply to receive a pardon for an indictable 
offence five years after completing one's sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member, but the time for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the order paper.  I am happy to advise 
the hon. member that when the debate on this bill is resumed, he 
will have five minutes in which to complete his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.30 p.m., for all intents and purposes, this House 
stands adjourned until Monday, May 25, 1998 at 11 a.m., pursuant 
to Standing Orders 28(2) and 24(1).
