</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-304, an act to amend the Divorce Act 
(joint custody). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Crowfoot 
seconding this bill this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that I have introduced this bill a couple of times in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to ensure the courts grant custody of 
a child to both parents unless there exists evidence that to do 
so would not be in the best interests of the child.  Automatic 
joint custody could reduce the number of parents forced to go to 
court to gain access to their children, increase the likelihood 
of support payment compliance and reduce the likelihood of one 
parent denying the other's right to see the children.  Statistics 
from the U.S. indicate financial compliance increases in direct 
relation to access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent report of the Special Joint Committee on Child 
Custody and Access recommended that joint parenting be included 
in new legislation.  However, the justice minister has announced 
there would be no new legislation from her before 2001.  Children 
simply cannot wait that long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that members from all parties would support this 
important bill for the sake of the children.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-305, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(prohibiting certain offenders from changing their name). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from 
Dewdney—Alouette for seconding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the current revelation of Karla Homolka changing her name 
to another name and attempting to move to a community release 
facility, I am once again encouraged to resubmit this bill that 
was submitted some time ago under different concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern still remains the same.  Violent offenders are 
changing their names while in prison.  The consequences of that, 
from my research across the country, is that many people do not 
know these individuals once they are out of prison and living 
under other names.  Under new names, they are indeed committing 
more offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to consider this which speaks for itself.  There 
has to be some responsibility on our system of governance today 
to ensure that violent offenders are not changing their names and 
moving into our society subsequent to release or even on parole 
with a new driver's licence, new identification and continuing on 
with other crime sprees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill once passed will amend the 
Broadcasting Act to put an end to the practice of the CRTC 
directing that cable companies must provide specific channels in 
the range of 2 to 13 which causes constant disruption to people's 
cable ranges in the major cities.  It would end the political 
correctness once and for all and allow the cable companies to 
provide channels in that range based on market demand and viewer 
preference.

the nation and the House of Commons like no other private

</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic purpose of the bill is to allow members of community 
service groups a tax credit in respect of their annual membership 
dues.  I am thinking in terms of Lions Clubs, Rotary Clubs, 
Kinsmen Clubs, et cetera, that now face pressure because of 
government downloading from all federal, provincial and municipal

down in a lot of the service groups across the country because of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners say that whereas Canada is the most connected

telephones and telephone service, it is extraordinary that there 
are homes in southern Ontario today, specifically on Peterborough 
County Road 40, that do not have telephone service.

their behalf through relevant federal departments, the CRTC and

</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition deals with concerns about the old Bill C-41, 
the federal child support guidelines.  In it the petitioners note 
that this act severely restricts a non-custodial parent's ability 
to meet the responsibilities as a parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon parliament to amend the new federal child support 
guidelines to address their concerns.  They ask that provisions 
contained in the old Bill C-41 be repealed and replaced by an act 
that is more fair, equitable and sensible to parents and 
children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition deals with concerns about child 
pornography, specifically in British Columbia, and the fact that 
the B.C. Court of Appeal has struck down subsection 163(1)(4) of 
the criminal code that makes possession of child pornography a 
criminal offence and that the court decision is therefore placing 
children in British Columbia at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call upon parliament to take all necessary measures up to 
and including the use of the notwithstanding clause to ensure 
that possession of child pornography remains a serious criminal 
offence and that police forces be directed to give priority to 
enforcing this law for the protection of our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a petition to submit to the House from concerned citizens 
throughout my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that section 43 of the criminal code recognizes the 
primary role of parents in the raising and disciplining of their 
children and that the removal of section 43 of the criminal code 
would strengthen the role of bureaucrats while weakening the role 
of parents in determining what is in the best interest of 
children, and therefore would be a major and unjustified 
intrusion by the state into the realm of parental rights and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the petitioners request parliament to affirm the duty 
of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their 
own conscience and beliefs and to retain section 43 of the 
Criminal Code of Canada as it is currently worded.

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMPORTATION OF PLUTONIUM 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I have received a notice of motion under Standing 
Order 52 from the hon. member for Jonquière. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 52, I call on the House to hold an emergency 
debate on the importing of mixed oxide fuel, MOx, containing 
military plutonium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the government has unilaterally agreed to 
transport a small quantity of MOx from American and Russian 
nuclear arms for trials on its use as a fuel in Canadian nuclear 
reactors.  The government will thus act contrary to a unanimous 
recommendation by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
which rejected the idea of importing MOx. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the start, the Bloc Quebecois opposed the idea of 
importing plutonium and asked the ministers of foreign affairs 
and natural resources to drop the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ever thorny issue of residual waste management, the lack of 
cost effectiveness, the clear opposition by a growing number of 
citizens, resolutions by a number of municipalities preventing 
the passage of such a convoy through their territory and the 
risk of terrorism involved in the movement of this substance 
seriously reduce the credibility of the importation proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons and because the MOx could be transported 
as early as November 15, with the Russians' share potentially 
having already left the port of St. Petersburg, we think an 
emergency debate is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must justify its decision, which runs totally 
contrary to what the people want and what was recommended by the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, and allow 
parliamentarians to debate this question of importing plutonium, 
even before trials are permitted on Canadian soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I ask you to consider my request for an emergency 
debate favourably. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I read the hon. member's 
letter before entering the House and I have listened attentively

meet the specific requirements at the moment.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before we proceed to orders of the day, 
I will now deal with a question of privilege from the hon. member 
for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley that was brought before the 
House on October 14, 1999, with further interventions on October 
21 and 25, 1999.  The question of privilege concerned the 
activities and conduct of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service during the course of a lawsuit against the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all members who participated in this debate for their 
helpful contributions in this matter.  In particular, I would 
like to draw attention to the presentations made by the hon. 
government House leader, the opposition House leader, the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley and the hon. member for 
Kootenay—Columbia.  The many thorough submissions have helped 
the Chair In making this important and far-reaching decision. The 
Chair is also grateful for the accompanying material submitted by 
the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it might be useful at this time to acquaint everyone 
with the events that took place, which led to the raising of this 
question of privilege.  The hon. member benefited from the 
parliamentary privileges accorded to all members when she put 
certain questions in the House during question period on alleged 
spy activities by certain employees of CSIS.  Subsequent to this, 
the hon. member released related material outside the House of 
Commons that inadvertently contained the actual name of a former 
employee of CSIS.  I am sure all hon. members know that immunity 
accorded to members in the House does not exist when statements 
are made outside the House.  A civil lawsuit ensued and the case 
was subsequently settled out of court. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley in her 
presentation covered a great deal of ground in relation to this 
matter.  For the benefit of the entire House, I would like to 
quickly outline the grievances brought forth by the hon. member.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, she indicated that CSIS improperly collected information 
and then disclosed that information to a third party in clear 
violation of CSIS policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, she affirmed that CSIS took an active role in the 
preparation of a lawsuit against an opposition member of 
parliament, including having its legal counsel provide the 
plaintiff and the plaintiff's lawyer with advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, she contended that CSIS had misused its authority under 
the guise of the protection of national security and deliberately 
misled the court to frustrate her attempts to resolve the 
lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member argued that these actions on the part of CSIS 
constituted a deliberate effort by CSIS to intimidate her and 
prevent her from speaking freely in the House of Commons and from 
performing her role as official opposition critic.  She felt that 
the evidence provided was sufficient to find that there was a 
prima facie case of contempt of the House against the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service.  Erskine May suggests on page 143 
of the 20th edition that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be vain to attempt an enumeration of every act which 
might be construed into a contempt, the power to punish for 
contempt being in its nature discretionary...It may be stated 
generally that any act or omission which obstructs or impedes 
either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, 
or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House 
in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly 
or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a 
contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley stated 
that she would “provide prima facie evidence to the Chair that 
demonstrates how the conduct and activities of CSIS regarding 
this case form what she believes to be a new and disturbing 
method of intimidation of a member of parliament”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently what the Chair must decide, on the basis of the 
facts presented, is whether she has provided the necessary 
evidence to substantiate a prima facie claim of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by addressing the three points that relate to the 
actions of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.  The 
member stated that the plaintiff was in possession of documents 
improperly collected and supplied by CSIS.  The material included 
press clippings, press releases, radio transcripts and the like. 
She also indicated that certain items of this information were 
not asked for by the plaintiff but rather were given directly 
without any solicitation by CSIS to the plaintiff.  Before 
addressing the issue of the improper collection of these 
documents, I must first underline that the material alluded to 
was in the public domain and readily available to any member or 
private citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of whether the collection and disclosure of these 
documents was in contravention of the CSIS Act or internal 
policies of the agency is not for the Speaker to judge.  The 
member has also stated that CSIS purposely prolonged legal 
proceedings by providing misinformation in order to prevent the 
member from having the case heard in court and also deny her the 
right to raise concerns about the case for three and a half 
years.  Proven or unproven, such misconduct by CSIS is not for 
the Speaker or the House to decide.  It would be a matter for the 
judicial system to review or for the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee to investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member feels that specific sections of the CSIS Act have 
been breached by CSIS employees, then these matters can be dealt 
with through the complaints procedures established by parliament 
in the Canadian Security Intelligence Act.  As I understand it, 
the Security Intelligence Review Committee, or SIRC, was 
established in 1984 as an independent body to review the 
activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.  SIRC's 
second role is to investigate complaints from the public about 
any CSIS action.  Any person who has knowledge of inappropriate 
activities by CSIS can complain to SIRC. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Security Intelligence Review Committee has the 
power to initiate such an investigation without necessarily 
having received a formal complaint.  Given the fact that three 
of the five members of the committee are former 
parliamentarians, at the federal and provincial level, I have no 
doubt that they would take this matter up with special interest.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Security Intelligence Review Committee can investigate 
and report on the appropriateness of activities within and by 
CSIS, the question of whether such actions constituted an attempt 
to intimidate a member of this House, and are thus a contempt of 
the House, fall within the sole authority of the Speaker and are 
questions that I take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that what we have before us are allegations by an 
hon. member to the effect that her parliamentary privileges have 
been breached due to deliberate attempts by an outside agency to 
impede the member from performing her parliamentary duties. 
Precisely speaking, the hon. member protests that one of her 
basic privileges, “the freedom of speech”, has been breached by 
a deliberate effort of intimidation accomplished by CSIS through 
support to a court action by a plaintiff against the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any attempt to intimidate a member with a view to influencing 
his or her parliamentary conduct is a breach of privilege. 
Privilege is a fundamental principle of parliamentary law.  In 
the 22nd edition of May it is stated at page 65: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed 
by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High 
Court of Parliament, and by members of each House individually, 
without which they could not discharge their functions, and which 
exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position put forward by the hon. member for South 
Surrey—White Rock—Langley is to the effect that CSIS made an 
effort to intimidate her, thereby limiting her freedom of speech 
in the House, resulting in the hon. member being unable to 
perform her role as official opposition critic.  This, my 
colleagues, is a very serious charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no question as to the relevance and appropriateness 
of the principle invoked by the hon. member. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, as all hon. members know, the privilege of freedom of 
speech is so fundamental that this House could not discharge its 
constitutional functions without it.  Beauchesne's 6th edition, 
at page 22, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privilege of freedom of speech is both the least questioned 
and the most fundamental right of the member of parliament on 
the floor of the House and in committee. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, however, limits to parliamentary privilege.  Speaker 
Lamoureux in his April 29, 1971 ruling indicated that privilege 
sets hon. members apart from other citizens by giving them rights 
that the general public does not have.  In his ruling he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, parliamentary privilege does not go much beyond the 
right of free speech in the House of Commons and the right of a 
member to discharge his or her duties in the House as a member of 
the House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Jerome, when speaking on the limits of parliamentary 
privilege in his ruling of February 20, 1975, went in the same 
direction as Speaker Lamoureux.  He added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consequences of extending that definition of privilege to 
innumerable areas outside this chamber into which the work of an 
MP might carry him or her, and particularly to the great number 
of grievances he might or she might encounter in the course of 
that work, would run contrary to the basic concept of privilege. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if a member is subjected to threats and intimidation, 
he or she is clearly hindered in the fulfilment of the 
parliamentary duties for which he or she was elected.  As Joseph 
Maingot writes, in his book </I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada<I>, 
on page 235: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[—] not every action by an outside body that may influence the 
conduct of a member of parliament as such could now be regarded 
as a breach of privilege, even if it were calculated and 
intended to bring pressure on the member to take or to refrain 
from taking a particular course.  But any attempt by improper 
means to influence or obstruct a member in his parliamentary 
work may constitute contempt. 
What constitutes an improper means of interfering with members' 
parliamentary work is always a question depending on the facts 
of each case.  Finally, there must be some connection between 
the material alleged to contain the interference and the 
parliamentary proceeding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that must be answered is what constitutes 
proceedings in parliament.  Speaker Fraser, in his ruling of July 
18, 1988, defined proceedings of parliament in the following 
manner: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This phrase has never been exactly and completely defined by 
statute, by the courts of law, or by the House itself.  In its 
narrow sense the expression is used to denote the formal 
transaction of business in the House or in committee. 
Traditionally it covers both the asking of a question and the 
giving of a written notice of such question, and also includes 
everything said or done by a Member in the exercise of his or her 
functions as a Member of the House, either in the House or in any 
committee of the House in the transaction of parliamentary 
business. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have been somewhat lengthy in my remarks, my colleagues, 
but I thought that this is matter of such seriousness that it was 
incumbent upon me to clearly explain what constitutes privilege, 
contempt and proceedings in parliament.  It is my duty to 
determine whether the actions taken by CSIS can be seen to have 
had as their purpose to influence or obstruct the hon. member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley in her parliamentary work and 
within the context of a proceeding in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bluntly stated, the question is:  Was the support by CSIS of a 
former employee of CSIS intended to “chill” the hon. member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley from participating in question 
period, debate in the House or committees of the House?  Or, the 
question can be restated more generally as follows:  Did CSIS 
provide inappropriate support to a former employee of CSIS who 
was suing the hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley 
because she is a member of parliament and was a critic of the 
agency in a parliamentary proceeding?  If the answer to either of 
these questions is yes, then I must rule, in keeping with our 
practice, that a prima facie case of contempt has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reviewed the hon. member's presentation.  I have 
re-reviewed it and gone through it on at least four occasions—I 
want to underline that—and found that nothing she said would 
lead to an affirmative answer to these two questions.  I have 
also carefully assessed the submission by the hon. member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, including all of the 
complementary material which she made available, and I have not 
been able to conclude that the actions of CSIS, as reported by 
the hon. member, constitute a prima facie case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions by CSIS may indeed have prolonged the civil process, 
but the hon. member has not provided the Chair with sufficient 
grounds to warrant further action by the House at this time. 
Should new facts emerge or if the hon. member returns to the 
House with other substantive evidence, I would of course listen 
to her again, because, if proven, her allegation would be very 
disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing the matter to my attention 
and all hon. members for their patience while I looked into the 
details.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, this 
government has sabotaged Canadian democracy by pursuing a trade 
policy that gives excessive power to unelected and unaccountable 
international trade organizations and erodes the ability of 
Canada's elected representatives to act in the public interest; 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That therefore the government should not negotiate any 
further liberalization of trade or investment at the Seattle 
meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or the Free Trade 
Area of the Americas (FTAA) without first securing enforceable 
international rules on core labour standards, environmental 
protection, cultural diversity, the preservation of public health 
care and public education and, generally, the right of 
democratically-elected governments to act for the common good; 
and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government should seek to eliminate the investor- 
state dispute mechanism in Chapter 11 of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which gives foreign corporations the 
right to sue and intimidate Canadian governments as in the cases 
involving MMT and bulk water exports, and should refuse to 
include such a mechanism in any other trade agreement; and 
further 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government should take action to remedy its over-zealous 
and irresponsible pursuit of greater trade 
liberalisation, which has caused extreme hardship for Canadian

hotel in Seattle, a team of Canadian negotiators will sit down 
around a table to begin the next round of negotiations of the 
World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few Canadians know what is at stake in these negotiations and 
the Liberal government is not about to tell them.  Why?  Because 
what is at stake in Seattle is nothing less than our universal 
health care system, our public education, the future of our 
family farms, our cultural sovereignty and the environmental 
legacy that we leave for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the things that make us one of the world's great 
nations.  They shape and define us as Canadians, as a caring and 
compassionate society, as a vigorous economy and as a place of clean 
air to breathe and pure water to drink.

ordinary citizens see a threat and work together to stop it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO has been called a new economic constitution for the 
planet.  What it really is is a hostile corporate takeover.  It 
is a takeover of Canada's most important public services and 
programs by the world's largest corporations. The trade minister 
actually acknowledged this when he stated that under the WTO 
regime “the state has surrendered a large part of its 
jurisdiction to the market and now transnational actors are the 
ones controlling the key elements”. Canadians do not want this 
to happen.  They will not let this happen. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO represents a takeover by multinationals of the public 
programs and services so valued by Canadians.  It is 
unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long list of Canada's public policies, laws and programs have 
already fallen victim to trade disputes.  They include programs 
to support Canadian publishing, standards for toxic fuel 
additives, and funding for research and development in our high 
tech sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Saskatchewan and Manitoba farmers were here on 
Parliament Hill asking for help.  Instead of desperately needed 
help they got flim-flam, the now you see it, now you don't 
magical disappearing statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons that farmers need help is the trade 
negotiations of the 1980s.  While Canada sat at the world table 
working to dissolve subsidies, the United States was busy 
stepping up its export enhancement program and capturing key 
chunks of Canada's world market.  Meanwhile, the federal Liberal 
government slashed farmers' domestic support payments by 60%, 
three times the amount required by our WTO obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time in the upcoming WTO round, the trade negotiators are 
taking direct aim at our most valuable national asset, our 
universal public health system.  We know that an ageing 
population means increasing health care needs.  U.S. corporations 
see a rich market ripe for the taking with the help of the WTO. 
Canada's health care system and our ability to sustain it have 
been compromised again and again by corporate interests in our 
trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With every new trade agreement we have had a new trade bill that 
gives longer patent protection, for example to multinational drug 
giants.  The result is more profits for pharmaceutical companies 
and increasing drug costs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that the U.S. health care companies want this time? 
They want more privatization of our health services, majority 
foreign ownership of our health care facilities, access to and 
more competition in our health care market, and the right to bid 
on all our government contracts including those in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade minister says he wants to open up health care services 
to see whether Canadian providers can export to the world, but 
the real agenda is to expose Canada's health care to be scavenged 
for profit by the American health care industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade says he is prepared to open 
up our health services to American companies.  This will clearly 
mean the end of our public health system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care is not the only thing at risk.  The WTO also has 
its eye on our public education system.  What could this mean for 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign for profit educational institutions would be guaranteed 
the right to operate in Canada.  Governments could not require 
educational institutions to hire locally.  The requirements of 
the education professions and institutions could be subject to 
WTO review.  Any government subsidies, like student loans or 
grants, would have to be given to both public and private 
providers. This would mean the beginning of the end of Canada's 
public education system and we will not permit it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes in trade negotiations get higher every day.  The most 
recent attack was on Canada's auto pact, the underpinning of 
thousands of good Canadian jobs and the basis of much of our 
manufacturing sector for the past 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look what has happened to environmental initiatives under the 
new trading regime.  In every single case, the WTO has ruled in 
favour of corporate interests and against environmental and 
public health.

The government settled out of court, withdrew its legislation and 
paid $19.6 million in damages to Ethyl Corporation.  The big 
winners were U.S. corporate interests and the losers were 
Canadians concerned about our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now because of the government's failure to act, we face a 
similar risk with Canadian bulk water exports. New Democrats are 
leading the fight against the export of bulk water. While we 
managed to persuade the Liberal government to vote for our 
opposition day motion to legislate a ban on bulk water exports, 
no such thing has been done to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today my colleagues will speak in more detail about the threats 
to agriculture, to our health care, our cultural sovereignty, our 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear.  New Democrats support a rules based 
global economy.  We believe in rules, fair rules, because Canada 
is a trading nation, but we also believe we must regulate 
economic activity in the interests of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO ties the hands of democratic governments that wish to 
create legislation good for their citizens, legislation that 
might impede from time to time the profit making capacity of 
multinational corporations.

that we should surrender Canadian sovereignty and the public

multinational corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure everyone that today, in Seattle, and in the coming 
months whenever and wherever trade negotiations threaten to 
destroy the very things that define us as Canadians, New 
Democrats will be there.  We will be there fighting to protect 
the rights and interests of Canadians against the increasing

</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about her party being in favour of a rules based 
system.  Then she talked about corporations taking over.  Even a 
rules based system that we are talking about will give Canadian 
companies the opportunity to expand their businesses which in 
turn will be beneficial to the workers of the country.  Would the 
hon. member not agree that NAFTA as well as the WTO as of today 
have been beneficial to the working families of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is 
absolutely right when he indicates that the New Democratic Party 
very much favours rules based trading.  The issue is whether the 
rules are going to be enforcing the things that matter to us 
most. That is why, if the member reads the motion we have put 
forward, we have made it clear that we must secure in those rules 
enforceable ways to protect core labour standards, to protect our 
environment, to protect cultural diversity, to preserve public 
health care and public education and generally the right of 
democratically elected governments to act for the common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is important that we have rules which create fairness 
for Canadian corporations that want to and are able to compete in 
the international arena.  But let us not do it at the expense of 
workers, at the expense of our environment and at the expense of 
things that matter most to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to get clarification of one aspect of the hon. 
member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned MMT.  I missed the start and whether or not 
she mentioned the banning of MMT.  There is a common 
misconception with the public, which has unfortunately been 
advanced by groups like the Council for Canadians, that MMT was 
banned by the government.  That is not actually the case. By 
reviewing </I>Hansard<I> and the act, the record will show what 
happened.  The government banned the marketing and transportation 
of MMT.  There is a huge difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize because I did not hear the member's particular 
sentence, and I do not know whether she made that error in her 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record will show that at that time the Reform Party warned 
the government that banning the transportation and marketing of 
MMT would result in a NAFTA challenge.  We urged and begged the 
government to institute an independent health study of MMT to 
determine whether it was in fact harmful because all of the 
Health Canada documentation said that it was not. There was no 
justification for banning MMT on health grounds.  The only way we 
could see that it could be done would be to have an independent 
study that could then be used to justify if indeed it was 
unhealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member confirm that she understands that MMT itself 
was not banned, but it was its transportation and marketing, and 
that the government was foolish in not having an independent 
study to determine its health risks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is familiar 
with this case. I think he knows that MMT has been banned in the 
United States.  Considerable evidence has amassed that would 
indicate it is indeed a severe threat.  What we are talking about 
here is whether Canada is going to be able to protect the health 
of our own people and make decisions in the interests of our own 
future in terms of health, environment and all of those things 
that matter most to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of the situation he discussed are not nearly as 
important as the principle of whether Canada is going to have the 
democratic right and the freedom to protect our own interests and 
our own rights as we see them as a sovereign nation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will pick up on certain elements of the motion.  Members from 
the NDP caucus will be rising throughout the day to speak to 
various aspects of the motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with the first element of the motion.  It talks 
about the government having sabotaged Canadian democracy by 
pursuing a trade policy that gives excessive power to unelected 
and unaccountable international trade organizations and erodes 
the ability of Canada's elected representatives to act in the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader stated earlier, this is not a radical or debatable 
observation in many respects.  The Minister for International 
Trade himself has talked about the transfer of power from the 
state to the market.  To the extent that Canada is a 
democratically elected state, it is clearly a transfer from the 
democratic realm to the realm of the market, and the market as it 
is designed, created and regulated by the WTO, an organization 
which I would submit has very much been designed by and for the 
multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit to some of my colleagues who are to my left in 
the House of Commons but on my right ideologically that they too 
should be more concerned about this than they sometimes are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a conference about a month ago in Edmonton.  It was 
sponsored by a member from Edmonton and the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  They talked about the erosion 
of democracy.  They were very concerned about the transfer of 
power from parliament to the prime minister and from parliament 
to the courts and from parliament to various other places within 
Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said at that conference I will say here again today. 
People who are concerned about the erosion of democracy and the 
erosion of the power of parliament should also be concerned about 
the erosion of the power of parliament by virtue of the transfer 
of the powers of parliament to the marketplace through these 
various agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a debate that has been going on for some time.  I recall 
making speeches not unlike this one in 1987-88 when we were 
debating the free trade agreement, then NAFTA, then the 
institution of the WTO and the MAI.  Now we have the new round, 
the so-called millennium round, at the WTO and the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things are of a piece with a movement away from what 
the NDP regards as the proper exercise of democracy. Many of the 
things which traditionally were the object of political debate 
and parliamentary decision have been taken out of the hands of 
parliament and placed in the hands of trade bureaucrats or, for 
that matter, enshrined as policy in various trade agreements. The 
former things that we were able to debate and decide and on which 
governments were able to change their minds as we got new 
governments or as governments themselves changed their minds, are 
all things that are no longer possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we actually make a decision here in parliament about drug 
patent laws?  No, we cannot because that is settled by a trade 
agreement.  Can we make laws about having two price wheat or a 
two price energy system?  No, we cannot because that has been 
settled by the free trade agreement.  Can we have split-run 
magazines?  No, we cannot even debate that anymore because that 
has been decided by the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we have a national ban on the export of bulk water?  It 
appears that we cannot have that. When the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs was asked just yesterday whether he was going to bring in 
such a thing, he clearly did not make that commitment.  He said 
that he would bring in something that would have the effect of 
protecting Canada's water resources, but he did not say that he 
would bring in a national ban because the government itself knows 
that the nature of NAFTA is such that water is not exempt in the 
way it has claimed it is.  We are therefore at risk of not being 
able to prevent the bulk export of water if that is what we want 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of whether we should or should not in this 
case as in so many other cases.  It is a question of whether we 
can or cannot because of these particular agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the democratic question.  That is why we in the NDP want 
to put this debate about the WTO and about these trade agreements 
in the context of the ongoing debate about democracy.  One of the 
elements that is so significant in terms of eroding democracy is 
the chapter eleven investor state dispute mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend what little time I have left on that particular 
mechanism.  Here we see an ability on the part of foreign 
corporations, not domestic corporations or Canadian corporations 
that have to live within the law and whose only recourse is 
through the domestic courts, but foreign corporations, thanks to 
the chapter eleven mechanism, to have a mechanism at their 
disposal to harass and to intimidate the Canadian government in a 
way that would never have been conceivable in an earlier time. 
It was not even an element of the free trade agreement.  It only 
came in with NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the harassment and intimidation of the government 
with respect to the issue of MMT, which my leader talked about. 
We see it now with respect to the whole question of water and the 
action brought against the Canadian government by Sun Belt as a 
result of its inability to create a situation in which it can 
export bulk water from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would any government tolerate a mechanism that would give 
foreign corporations this kind of ability?  All of this is being 
done, as so much of what has been proposed in the MAI and now is 
being proposed at the WTO, in the name of creating new 
opportunities for Canadian companies and Canadian investors 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the Reform Party talked about Canadian companies. 
I do not take it as a given that whatever is good for any 
particular Canadian company is good for Canada.  I do not 
subscribe to that old American notion that what is good for GM is 
good for America or that what is good for any particular Canadian 
company is good for Canada.  What a lot of these companies want 
is to do business abroad, and there is nothing intrinsically evil 
about that.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that they should not be asking Canadians to give up 
their way of life, to give up the way we have organized our life 
together over the years, in order to create opportunities for 
them to make money abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being asked here is for Canadians to give up the kind of 
regulations that we have had over the years for foreign 
investment so that our Canadian investors can invest in other 
countries without similar kinds of regulation.  I do not think 
that is right.  I do not think that we should be asked to give up 
our ability to regulate foreign investment.  We see it coming in 
this next round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see it in the areas my leader has mentioned in terms of 
health care and education, because there are Canadian companies 
that want to market health care expertise abroad.  I am not 
against that, but I am against it if it means that in order for 
that to be possible we have to dismantle our public health care 
system, our medicare, and create opportunities for American or 
other foreign multinational health care corporations to be able 
to penetrate our public health care system and create more 
privatization and contracting out and eventually so erode the 
public dimension of our health care system that we end up with an 
Americanized or commercial health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the agenda.  Anybody who does not want to admit that is 
not levelling with the Canadian people.  That is where I hold the 
Liberal government responsible.  It is not willing to admit that 
this is the agenda of certain people with the WTO.  It is not 
willing to admit that it is not willing to stand up to that 
agenda.  We do not hear it.  Perhaps we will hear it later and 
that would be good news, but I am not holding my breath that the 
parliamentary secretary will get up in his place and say that the 
Canadian government is seeking a full, absolute and categorical 
carve out of public health care and education in this next round. 
That is not what the government has been saying.  It has not 
been saying that it is opposed to putting services on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just one little aspect of what we are concerned about. 
We are concerned about many other things, such as the fact that 
in agreement after agreement after agreement it is investors' 
rights which are protected.  It is investors' rights which are in 
force.  Investors, investors, investors.  What about workers? 
What about the environment?  What about democracy? What about all 
the other things that matter to people?  Well, that can wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have lofty statements by the minister about how he would 
like to humanize globalization.  He is going to humanize 
globalization over the next 50 years, but when it comes to 
investors they can have their rights this year. For us, that is a 
perverse moral hierarchy where the powerful get even more rights 
and the powerless get to wait and we are against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore like to move, seconded by the hon. member for 
Yukon, that the motion be amended by inserting the word 
“immediate” between the words “take” and “action”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona has put the chair in a difficult position. He 
is the seconder of the main motion and he has moved an amendment 
to that motion.  I do not believe it is proper for him to do 
that.  Accordingly, I am afraid I cannot take the amendment as 
proposed by the hon. member at this time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
hon. member for his comments, and particularly his leader earlier 
who finally made it clear to us that the New Democratic Party was 
in fact in favour of a rules based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I remember, after our consultations across Canada and the 
minority report that his party put into the report, it seemed to 
us that the New Democratic Party was not in favour of us at all 
being in Seattle.  It is good to hear today that the New 
Democratic Party is supporting the fact that we will be in 
Seattle standing up for Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion mentions some of the hardships Canadian 
farmers are experiencing, particularly farmers in western Canada. 
I remember going through the his party's policy during the last 
election and reading that it would have forced $17 billion in new 
spending upon Canadians if it had been elected.  However, out of 
$17 billion in new spending only $11 million would have gone to 
Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member explain why his party's policy during the last 
election was to give so little to Canadian farmers and today it 
puts forward this motion stating its concerns for Canadians in 
the agricultural industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct 
the false impression the member is trying to create on two 
fronts, the first one being on Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the member read very clearly the minority 
reports.  They are not all that long, perhaps two or three pages, 
but perhaps they tax the mental abilities of the parliamentary 
secretary.  In the report, we said very clearly that we are in 
favour of a global rules based trading regime but we are not in 
favour of the current model.  We are not in favour of the current 
assumptions and presuppositions that attend those negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made it very clear in the House yesterday that we are not in 
favour of a round of talks which includes investment or services. 
We think these should be taken off the table altogether.  Things 
like agriculture are already on the table and therefore there is 
work to be done in that area.  However, we are not in favour of 
adding new sectors to the domain of the WTO.  We are very clear 
about that. If that means not being at Seattle, then so be it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could go to Seattle.  It is not a question of 
geographic location.  It is not a question of whether there are 
Canadian government bodies in Seattle.  It is a question of what 
the government is doing there.  It could go there and say very 
clearly that it does not want a new round of talks on investment 
or on services or any round of talks on investment and services. 
If it was doing that we would say “go to Seattle”.  However, 
that is not what it is doing.  What it is going to do when it 
gets there is something that we find quite unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard this misrepresentation before, and I am not sure if 
it comes from deliberation or from ignorance, but there are many 
aspects of the NDP agricultural policy which if implemented would 
not have left Canadian farmers in the situation they are in now, 
particularly going back to the elimination of the Crow rate, the 
Crow benefit, the western grain transportation subsidy and many 
other supports that the Liberals have taken away from Canadian 
farmers over the objections of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member gets up and pulls some obscure fact, if indeed it is 
a fact or not just something that is being fed by the spin 
doctors on his own party side, and claims that this undermines 
our position, a position being taken right now in the context of 
new developments.  No one could have predicted exactly what would 
happen in 1999 with respect to commodity prices, drought in some 
parts of Saskatchewan, floods in some parts of Manitoba and 
various other things that have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, this is just a cheap shot and not the 
sort of thing one should spend any more time on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with the language 
which the hon. member used, I must have hit a chord with my 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite aware that the Government of Canada, 
prior to taking a position on Seattle in the next round of the 
WTO, held wide consultations across the country.  The hon. 
member, who was on the foreign affairs and international trade 
committee, knows that it was not the opinion of anyone else on 
that committee that we should not be at the WTO. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact all the other parties seemed to be quite happy that the 
report of the standing committee reflected very clearly what we 
were hearing from witnesses from coast to coast to coast.  The 
witnesses felt it was important for a country the size of Canada 
that has so much at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-two per cent of our GDP depends on international trade.  A 
country our size compared to the economic size of the United 
States, the European Union or Japan needs a rules based system 
under which to work.  If we had to go against these countries on 
a one to one basis, most times we would lose out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in our interests to belong to an organization of over some 
132 countries where we are able to draw on the support of other 
countries.  It is not this big giant economy of the Americans 
trying to beat up on Canada or other smaller countries; it is a 
group of countries that get together.  That is why it is 
important to be in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assume the hon. member knows, although we would not know 
it from his remarks, that Canada takes very seriously some of the 
concerns not only in agriculture, but concerns that were 
expressed by Canadians particularly with regard to transparency. 
The fact is that there has been concern out there across the 
country, and indeed in other countries, that the WTO is closed up 
and what it does always happens behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been the position of the Government of Canada.  It was 
made very forcefully by the present Minister for International 
Trade, the previous minister, and in fact the Prime Minister, in 
talking at the free trade area of the Americas.  It was said very 
clearly that it is in Canada's interests to make sure that 
international agreements, not only at the WTO but other 
agreements that we may sign, are open and transparent and that 
Canadians see what these organizations are doing.  It makes sure 
that the hon. member's party and those other groups which seem to 
want to tell the whole world how bad international trade is for 
Canada do not have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has nothing to hide.  That is why we felt it was 
important to go across the country to hear from Canadians what 
they felt about trade.  I think the hon. member would agree that 
most of the parties in the House, except the New Democratic 
Party, felt that that report reflected the views of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For at least 50 years, one of the most important roles on the 
world stage for Canada in the trade area has been to make sure 
that we have these sorts of agreements.  Our overall objective is 
to improve the quality of life of Canadians.  It is not, as the 
hon. member claims, to make sure that the corporate giants have 
more access to some of the economies around the world and to make 
sure that the corporate giants in other countries can come into 
Canada and rape this country of our economic development.  That 
is not the case.  I do not think that any government in this 
country, quite seriously, would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to make sure that we have enforceable rules, that 
the rules are enforced and that those within Canadian society who 
have an interest in all of the jobs that are created through 
international trade get an opportunity to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talk about jobs and international trade.  Listening to the 
hon. member's comments and the comments of the New Democratic 
Party, we would not know that international trade and investment 
create jobs in Canada.  We just have to look at the 1.7 million 
jobs that have been created in Canada since 1993.  We just have 
to look at the dramatic increase in Canada's exports to see a 
relationship between investing and exports and the creation of 
Canadian jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major consultations were made prior to responding. 
The hon. member knows that we will be responding in the House and 
it will be sent to committee on November 16 to put forward our 
position on Seattle.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member said, there is concern for these 
international agreements as precipitated by similar comments of 
his party and his leader.  There will be some 750 groups in 
Seattle. The hon. member said he would be there.  We want to make 
sure that members of the opposition are also there in order to 
see how these organizations work.  We want to make sure that they 
see firsthand that Canada is not only standing up for Canadian 
farmers, workers and industry, but it is also making sure that 
the whole world engages in what is called civil society.  Civil 
society is the groups of Canadians and all of society who are 
interested in these sorts of issues and international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the area of health and social services, the New Democratic 
Party says that all of a sudden we are going to lose our health 
care, or that we are going to lose our water.  It throws out 
these wild ideas that somehow the Government of Canada is not 
interested in the health care of Canadians or in preserving our 
national health care system.  How ludicrous.  What government 
would not be interested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the best health care system in the world.  For that 
party to suggest that the Government of Canada is willing to 
throw it away and to give it away is utter nonsense.  Certainly a 
member who has been in the House as long as the hon. member has 
been should know that.  We are committed to preserving our right 
to regulate in the area of health care and social services. 
There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also talked about labour and said that labour or 
Canadian jobs were going to be impacted by this decision and that 
we do not represent the interests of labour in these 
negotiations.  The hon. member knows that the International 
Labour Organization looks at these issues.  Canada is very active 
in this organization and in promoting labour rights and promoting 
some of the concerns people have about other countries not 
keeping up to the same standards as we do in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also encouraging and facilitating the development of 
voluntary labour codes by businesses in Canada and around the 
world.  We feel that Canada should be proud of some of the labour 
rules that we have made.  We want to export those around the 
world.  We want to make sure that other countries keep up to the 
same standards as we do.  In the area of labour, Canada is second 
to none in promoting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also talked about culture.  I want to assure the 
hon. member and all Canadians that we will build support in the 
preparatory process for the WTO for language in the declaration 
that would recognize the importance of promoting cultural 
diversity.  The hon. member should know that we have the support 
of Quebec and all of the other provinces in this.  We find this 
to be very important.  It is important for Canadians.  It is who 
we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our area of the world is beside a large neighbour, the United 
States of America.  It is certainly within our interests and it 
is something that has been promoted not only by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, but also by the Prime Minister who in the 
speech yesterday on the free trade area of the Americas, pointed 
out the importance of Canadian culture and of Canadians 
sustaining that culture and some of the risks in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone further.  We have gone to other countries.  We have 
gone to countries in Europe and a lot of smaller countries to 
bring together people who believe in the same cultural ideas that 
we do.  We have received an awful lot support. It will be high on 
our agenda when we go to Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying to all Canadians that this is an 
ongoing process.  We will continue to consult with Canadians and 
the provinces to make sure that their views are represented not 
only in Seattle, but in the negotiations that will go on in two, 
three or four years. 
It is in our interests to make sure that these negotiations are 
wrapped up in four years.  It is certainly in Canada's interests 
to make sure that all Canadians have a say within this system.

Speaker, first, I would like to thank the hon. member for the way 
in which he mesmerized his colleagues on this occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the ILO and he talked about the ILO promoting. 
That is the problem.  It promotes, it does not enforce.  We are 
talking about the discrepancy between a world in which only 
investors' rights are enforced and everybody else's rights are 
promoted. There is exhortation, there is promotion, there is 
encouragement, but there is no enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He kept assuring us that no government would ever do the kinds 
of things we are accusing the government of doing. Canadians have 
been assured before.  Canadians were assured by the Conservatives 
about all kinds of things about the FTA.  Those very people were 
assured themselves.  There is no credibility left here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we believe the hon. member when we have such a 
history of governments lying to people about the effect of these 
agreements?  Why does he believe now the things that he did not 
believe before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the only party that opposes these agreements and we are 
proud of it.  We think this is a paradigm for trading that is 
going to prove disastrous for the Canadian people and for that 
matter, the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is right 
when he says that Canada does put a priority on international 
labour.  The hon. member is right when he says that.  In fact, he 
should know that the Government of Canada is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Would the member stop misrepresenting 
what I was saying.  I never said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona has a point of order.  Perhaps we have heard 
it.  Perhaps the hon. parliamentary secretary will want to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should 
know, if he has been following these issues, that it is in the 
interests of all Canadians to make sure that international labour 
rules are followed. It is in the interests of all Canadians to 
make sure there is more co-operation between the World Trade 
Organization and the ILO.  That is something the Government of 
Canada has been promoting very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Government of Canada at the ILO has also been 
making sure, particularly in issues such as child labour, that 
there are international rules, that there are ways in which we 
can prevent that sort of action from happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a little confusing listening to the parliamentary 
secretary.  He was the member that railed probably harder than 
any single member in the House against the free trade agreement. 
He spent a career from 1988 to 1993 constantly on his feet 
fighting that issue. He swallowed himself whole on this issue if 
you listen to his speech.  I am wondering when this miraculous 
convergence took place.  I have sent out for some of his exact 
words on and his criticism of the free trade agreement, the NAFTA 
agreement and any other agreement which related to world trade, 
free trade and Canada's trading position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is when did this convergence take place? Was it 
immediately following the 1993 election?  Was it a gradual 
convergence, or as I stated earlier, did he simply swallow 
himself whole on the whole issue of free trade? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can understand the hon. 
member's confusion.  If the hon. member looked at exactly what I 
said during those times, I was against the free trade agreement 
that was being signed with the United States at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  It is the same one we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  I do not think anybody on this side ever 
came out and said that we were against freer trade. 
I will tell the member why.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Hold on.  The member had his chance. 
The hon. member should know that the problem with that deal was 
that dumping and countervail was still available to the United 
States, which would make it more difficult for Canadian companies 
to get in.  That is only one aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that when governments are looking at 
these issues they have to look at the impact they will have on 
Canadian jobs.  Because of what we did, getting rid of the $42 
billion deficit that we were left at the time, and also dealing 
with increasing and promoting international trade, we were able 
to create those jobs and make sure that Canadians were successful 
in the working of the agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is the parliamentary secretary's government that has not 
consulted Canadians on these trade issues.  We also have a 
problem with not consulting the provinces.  That is why we have a 
bulk water problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process the government has initiated is 
probably responsible for many of the myths we are hearing. Can 
the member talk about the consultation problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member would have been 
aware, had he sat in the committee, that the provinces which were 
there, particularly the New Democratic province of British 
Columbia, came forward with different views and opinions on what 
we said.  However, they said they were consulted very well by 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member went back to the records of the committee he would 
find that the Government of Canada consulted very widely with all 
the ministers of trade of all the provinces.  We find that to be 
a very important aspect— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time for questions and comments 
has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I start I want to ask my hon. colleague opposite to stop 
saying I am new to this portfolio.  I have been in this portfolio 
for almost eight months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure for me to rise to speak to the motion brought 
forward by my colleague from the NDP.  Frankly, I believe a 
debate on this issue is long overdue and I think Canadians feel 
the same way.  Canadians deserve to be informed about our 
international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes strongly that all sectors of 
Canadian society should be encouraged to participate and present 
their views on trade matters in a constructive manner.  That 
includes business representatives, labour, environmental and 
academic groups, as well as all other sectors of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that domestic consultations must be encouraged within 
all countries that are signatories to these agreements.  However, 
direct involvement of the so-called civil society, as encouraged 
by the FTAA civil society committee, is a cause for concern to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition feels that unelected, unaccountable 
organizations must channel their views through their national 
elected governments which are directly accountable to the voters. 
The provinces must be consulted where negotiations of a free 
trade agreement touches directly on provincial areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that failure by this government to consult the provinces 
in a meaningful way during the negotiations of the NAFTA have 
resulted in a situation where bulk water that is located entirely 
within provincial boundaries could come under the NAFTA rules in 
certain circumstances.  Now we have the government scrambling to 
create legislation that will address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, while setting national emission targets during the 
Kyoto protocol negotiations the federal government did not 
adequately consult the provinces, whose co-operation is essential 
in meeting Canada's commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that parliament must be consulted.  The final version 
of a treaty like the NAFTA or the FTA should be tabled in 
parliament for at least 30 sitting days before the government or 
any department takes action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that a special joint committee should be established to 
study treaties, review agreements and hold public hearings, 
including the provincial legislatures.  Then the treaty must be 
ratified by parliament in a free vote before it becomes binding 
on Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a trading nation.  Our present and future prosperity 
and growth are largely dependent on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just five years ago Canada exported 25% of its gross domestic 
product.  Today it is at 42%.  The vast majority of the 1.7 
million new jobs created since 1993 is the result of the increase 
in our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian exports to the United States increased 80% over the 
first five years of the NAFTA, rising from $151 billion in 1993 
to $271 billion in 1998.  It is important for us to remember that 
Canada is a relatively small trading nation.  Consequently we 
must seek consensus with other trading nations to ensure that 
Canadian companies are able to participate in the global economy 
in a fair and equitable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian exporters and investors need a rules based system that 
will guarantee a level playing field and give Canadian companies 
easier access to world markets.  I am pleased to note that even 
the NDP agrees with this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot turn back the clock.  Globalization is a reality and 
the impact on the Canadian way of life is real and beneficial. 
We cannot simply stop the process and pretend that the world is 
not changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that this is exactly what my colleagues from the 
NDP want to do.  This is why I simply cannot agree with the 
motion put forward today by my colleague from the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the new head of the World Trade 
Organization, Mike Moore, who has pointed out that poverty, not 
trade, is the enemy.  He said:  “Every WTO member government 
supports open trade because it leads to a higher living standard 
for working families”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to a recent study by the George Morris Centre which 
indicated that Canadian farmers will benefit greatly if this WTO 
round eliminates all tariff and non-tariff barriers in 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own members suggest that removing tariffs and 
other trade barriers could add $20 billion to $50 billion to the 
pockets of Canadian farmers, processors and exporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regretful that the NDP favours removing Canadians from the 
prosperity offered by globalization.  It is regretful that 
members of the NDP do not believe that Canadian entrepreneurs 
have the capacity or the ingenuity to compete on a global scale. 
It is sad that the NDP continues to use the “sky is falling” 
type of tactic when discussing free trade with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes that the WTO should concentrate 
on liberalizing trade around the world.  That in itself is an 
enormous task.  The WTO is simply not the appropriate forum to 
deal with important and complex issues like labour standards, 
environmental protection, culture and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO is a highly specialized body with a staff of trade 
experts who lack social policy experience.  Social activists 
should look at more appropriate bodies like the United Nations or 
the International Labour Organization to develop international 
rules on these types of issues, including enforcement rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly important to deal with issues like these. 
However, these important issues are not within the mandate of the 
WTO, nor would I argue they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude my comments today by simply reiterating 
the importance of free trade and Canada's participation within a 
rules based trading system.  Canada is a nation that depends a 
great deal on trade for its prosperity.  Therefore, it is up to 
the government of the day to ensure that Canadian companies are 
given a level playing field upon which to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis on our farms is a good example of the need for a 
level playing field and the effect of government inaction.  This 
is precisely what the WTO, the NAFTA and the FTAA provide.  It is 
difficult enough to deal with complex issues regarding the 
elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade without 
adding the complexity of social issues, as advocated by the NDP 
and our socially active international trade minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that in the case of the WTO there are 134 
countries involved, each with its own views and priorities. 
Forcing our views on them would be soundly rejected.  We do not 
want to earn the nickname of being the ugly Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I was referring 
to the hon. member as being relatively new to the portfolio, I 
was of course comparing it to the fact that he was not around 
during the time when all of the large public consultations took 
place with Canadians at the committee level.  The hon. member 
will know that the foreign affairs and international trade 
committee held a broad range of consultations across Canada to 
get people's views.  I appreciate that his party recognizes how 
important it is to consult Canadians on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these two speeches we have seen why the Government of 
Canada's balanced approach to this issue is so important.  The 
New Democratic Party wants to build walls around Canada.  It 
wants to make sure that we put up these barriers and that somehow 
Canada can create jobs and prosperity when we have a wall built 
around us.  Then we have the Reform Party, which would erase the 
49th parallel.  It is more interested in making sure that Canada 
is open for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should be aware of the importance that the 
Government of Canada puts on consulting Canadians.  He should 
also be aware that there is a role for the Government of Canada 
in making sure there is protection for certain things that 
Canadians see as being importantt— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am trying to allow time for two 
comments and I cannot allow any member to go on too long.  The 
hon. member for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind 
the hon. member that I did take part in those committee hearings. 
I travelled to Ontario and Quebec with that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary would like to simplify the situation 
by saying that the Reform Party would eliminate the 49th 
parallel.  That is absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we know that the Liberal Party does not have a policy. 
It always follows public opinion.   If public opinion shifts to 
that side, it will move to that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Reform Party is in agreement and would like 
consultations to take place with Canadians to ensure that there 
is a fair rule based system in the world.  However, that does not 
mean eliminating the 49th parallel, as the Liberals would like to 
say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member mentioned the issues of poverty and trade and the fact 
that the director general of the WTO said that poverty is the 
enemy, not trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that the increasing levels of poverty in the 
world and the growing gap between the rich and the poor, both 
within countries and between countries, is a direct result of the 
kind of trade liberalization that we have seen over the last 10 
to 15 years, and that in fact trade is the problem, or at least 
the current model of trade is the problem.  It is not a question 
of not trading.  Of course, we continue to be misrepresented in 
that respect, as if we want to build walls and all of the other 
things that the Conservatives used to say to the Liberals and the 
Liberals did not like, but now they have no qualms about saying 
them to other people.  It is not a question of building walls; it 
is a question of what kind of rules we are going to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the member said that the WTO is not the proper venue 
for dealing with a lot of these questions:  labour questions, 
environmental questions and social questions.  While that may be 
so, it is not the NDP position, I want to inform the hon. member, 
that these things have to be dealt with at the WTO.  What we are 
saying is that they have to be dealt with either at the WTO or at 
the ILO, or UNESCO, or whatever other international institution 
we might designate, but they have to be dealt with in an 
enforceable way before there is any further trade liberalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our position.  It is not that the WTO has to do these 
things, but— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Calgary East on a 
brief response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond 
to the hon. member's comments and then I will talk with him 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member pointed to the poverty issue and said, from what 
I understand, that trade liberalization has increased this gap. I 
absolutely differ with him on that point.  Trade liberalization 
has actually helped to remove poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say from the outset that we agree with some of the NDP's 
arguments. Like the NDP, we would like to see an environmental 
clause, a social clause, a labour clause and also a cultural 
exemption. However, we completely disagree with the motion where 
it says that Canada should not negotiate, that it should not be 
there without first securing enforceable international rules on 
core standards, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, such a proposal does not take into account past 
experience. I do not know if the NDP member was ever involved in 
a negotiation process, but I cannot figure why she would ask for 
the securing of enforceable international rules before 
negotiations are undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do understand why the effects of globalization, 
whether financial or commercial, would be raised before that 
meeting. That is understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is based on the 1997 report on human development, which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 10% of the world's population, the least developed 
countries now account for only 0.3% of world trade, or half as 
much as they did 20 years ago. 
Over half of all developing countries are ignored when it comes 
to direct foreign investments, with two thirds of such 
investments going to only eight developing countries. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the situation in 1997. It states further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In real terms, commodity prices are currently 45% lower than the 
average for the 1980s, and 10% lower than the lowest level ever 
recorded during the Great Depression of the 1930s, more 
precisely in 1932. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on. I will simply add this quote from the same 
report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the income share of the richest 20% and the poorest 20%, 
it has grown from 30 to 1 in 1960, to 78 to 1 in 1994. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While globalization offers major opportunities, it can also 
increase inequalities between rich and poor countries, and 
between rich and poor people within a country, including Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What means are available to those wishing to change this trend? 
Just international negotiation, with the backing of an informed 
public, and of equally informed groups equipped to defend their 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not be forgotten that the MAI, much criticized for 
having been negotiated among the rich countries only, was 
finally abandoned as an object of negotiation by the OECD, in 
response to lobbying.  Some of the lobby groups were from Quebec 
and from Canada.  Why?  Because what many of them wanted was to 
have the negotiations take place within the World Trade 
Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois feel that there must be a negotiation 
session. 
It must encompass a cultural exemption, along with promotion of 
cultural diversity, and inclusion of a social clause, an 
environmental clause and another one on the respect of human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We add, emphatically, that Quebec must speak for itself in this 
negotiation, in order to be in a position to staunchly defend 
its own interests.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This negotiation is an opportunity for 134 countries to get 
together, some of them poor countries, then the United States, 
with the European Union as a newly-formed counterbalance to them, 
and Canada, which is seeking to gain allies, and Japan as well. 
This will be an opportunity for them all to bring out their 
proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know right away that negotiations will require, among other 
things, that the U.S. modify its position somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hasten to add for my NDP colleagues that even the United 
States is beginning to take international pressures into 
consideration, especially since the failure of the MAI at the 
OECD. 
We learn on the Internet today that the United States made a 
proposal that would go even further than that of the European 
Union on the formation of a task force on the relationship 
between working conditions and trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This subject is of course taboo for many developing countries, 
which see it as a barrier.  This forum is where negotiations are 
taking place.  Consultations were held in Canada, and in Quebec 
as well.  But what we in the Bloc Quebecois are saying is that 
Quebec must speak for itself, parliamentarians must follow this 
closely, the process must be transparent, and parliamentarians 
must vote on this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This arises from the need to bend existing and general rules on 
the relationship of power among countries and within countries, 
between the poorest and the others.  Of course, Canada's and 
Quebec's growth must be maximized, but in doing so, we must take 
account of the rules we set here, which we want followed 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This negotiation must be accompanied by transparency.  Quebec 
must be present, and the public must be given as much 
information as possible so that we have agreements that give 
those most in need hope in the face of this accelerated 
globalization and its negative effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization, however, also represents an opportunity to 
develop a new solidarity. 
It is also an opportunity, as in the case of the MIA, to use new 
means of communication like the Internet, which has made it 
possible to secure the agreement of players from all continents 
who would otherwise not have been able to take part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this forum where negotiations take place is essential.  In 
each of these countries—and this will be done in 
Quebec—stakeholders will have to get going and support our 
demands and, at the same time, understand that, while the 
interdependence of countries may be vital to improving 
everyone's fortunes, without rules, and tribunals to apply them, 
it will always be the biggest and strongest countries that will 
carry the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fledgling WTO tribunal has, however, ruled in favour of 
small countries, against the United States for example.  And 
Canada and Quebec were also successful in defending cases of 
particular importance to us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be extremely pleased if the NDP were to tell us that, 
although its goal was to generate a debate, it too was going to 
take part in examining these negotiations, in demanding that 
they be transparent and that the interests of the most 
disadvantaged be represented.  But negotiations are essential, 
because otherwise Quebec and Canada and less developed countries 
may suffer.  All countries that rely on external trade need 
these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that Lionel Jospin, France's Prime Minister and a 
committed socialist, summarily dismissed those who advised 
against taking part in the WTO negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to the comments by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am an elected representative from Quebec.  This country's 
culture is very important to me and, as a Canadian MP 
representing a Quebec riding, my wish is to ensure that Canada's 
unique culture is protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member is not aware that the Government of 
Canada is really the one which has, on numerous occasions, 
demonstrated that it is in place precisely to ensure the 
protection of what is unique about Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of consultation, nevertheless.  We have 
consulted with the provinces and will continue to do so.  But 
when negotiations are involved, these are government to 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the Canadians and Quebecers in our audience that, 
in connection with the points raised by the hon. member relating 
to environment and culture, it is our duty to ensure that the 
Government of Canada protects all aspects of Canada's culture, 
throughout Canada, for ours is a unique country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a specific identity in the eyes of the world.  It is 
truly the duty of the Canadian government, a duty we accept, to 
continue to consult the provinces and to ensure that we have the 
best negotiations, precisely in order to protect Canadian 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the first point, that of 
cultural exemption, I would first like to say that, 
unfortunately, the committee report did not take up the cultural 
exemption again. The Bloc Quebecois pointed this out in its 
dissenting opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support looking for new means, for another venue to negotiate 
on culture. In the meantime, however, we believe strongly that 
the cultural exemption must be upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will pardon me if I think that if Quebec, which is 
vitally concerned, is simply giving effect to the international 
extension of its jurisdictions, as based on the Gérin-Lajoie 
doctrine and accepted in other places, it is strictly entitled 
to do so. We would point out as well that some countries permit 
the presence of provinces when international negotiations are 
taking place and they involve the international extension of 
their jurisdictions. 
So, we say that Quebec should be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other elements, if Quebec is involved in 
implementation, it must be included in the negotiations.  We saw 
what kind of problems can arise in other respects when Canada 
signs agreements, treaties and conventions that the provinces 
are to implement, but does so in their absence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking on behalf of the others, but I say that Quebec 
must be present and speak for itself.  This is the extension of 
the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine. It is the extension of our 
jurisdiction.

parliamentary secretary, given the arbitration to be done, we 
still believe that, on this particular issue of cultural 
exemption, Quebec should speak for itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to stand today on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to take part in the debate on the NDP supply 
motion on free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had been part of the debate and the discussions in 
1988-89 dealing with the Progressive Conservative position on 
free trade, the free trade agreement and the NAFTA agreement that 
came thereafter.  I congratulate the NDP because of its 
consistency.  It was obviously consistent in its position back in 
1988-89. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members were the fearmongers of the day.  They were 
isolationist and protectionists.  They wanted to build trade 
boundaries around the country back then.  They are consistent 
when they stand before us today in that they still deal with 
protectionist and isolationist issues.  They would like to see 
nothing better than Canada breaking all ties with trading 
partners, which obviously cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals on the other hand are not quite so fortunate in 
being consistent.  The parliamentary secretary must get whiplash 
in doing a 180° turn on the free trade and NAFTA issues when his 
party was vehemently opposed to any free trade agreements that 
were being negotiated back in 1988-89. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only say that Canadians are very fortunate that they had a 
government then which had vision and foresight.  If it were not 
for that government which stood in the House and fought for open 
markets, the $42 billion deficit the member continually speaks of 
would still be a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 42% GDP increase of which the parliamentary secretary spoke 
was a result of the free trade agreements.  That is what retired 
the deficit and not the Liberal policy which was put into place 
since then.  Quite frankly no positive policy has come from that 
bench since 1993.  I thank the parliamentary secretary for giving 
credit where credit is due to the Progressive Conservative Party 
and its development of free trade policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a bit about free trade.  I will just try to gloss 
over it and deal particularly with the agriculture, about which I 
do have a tendency of knowing a little more.  I will take my own 
constituency as a microcosm with respect to free trade.  The NDP, 
as I said earlier, would like to build boundaries and not see the 
open boundaries of the globalized market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  A fertilizer manufacturer in my 
constituency exports the majority of its production into the 
United States, our major trading partner.  Eighty per cent of 
what we produce in trade goes to the United States.  Let us make 
no mistake about that.  It is a marketplace of 300 million people 
and we are a marketplace of 30 million people.  We depend on the 
United States as our market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pharmaceutical company in my riding produces a drug called 
Premarin.  It is a global market but most of it is being produced in 
Canada and sold in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA agreement took tariffs and barriers off hogs.  Today a 
hog processing plant in Brandon, Manitoba, employs up to 2,000 
people.  The majority of its export market is in the United 
States and Asia.  NAFTA removed the tariff barrier, and that is 
why jobs have been created in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company in my area produces steel buildings which are sold in 
the United States.  Most of its production goes to the United 
States, creating jobs in my constituency and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another wonderful little company that works for 3M sends 90% of 
its product to Chicago and Los Angeles.  It has created 165 jobs 
in my riding and its product goes to the marketplace in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company just outside my riding produces french fries, not for 
our table, not for our market, but for Minneapolis.  It provides 
all of the french fries for McDonald's in Minneapolis, an open 
trading partner with an open trading border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP would like to stop that trade.  They would 
like to put up barriers.  We would not be in the position we are 
in today as Canadians with our own quality of life and standard 
of living if it were not for trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about faith in our labour force and our economy.  I 
do not have any fears about competing with the globe because I 
have faith in Canadians.  I have faith in our abilities. I have 
faith in our ability to capitalize.  I have faith in our ability 
to produce.  That is what trade is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can compete in the global market, but in order to compete in 
that marketplace we need a rules based system.  That is what we 
have with a rules based system.  We have it with NAFTA and our 
trading partners in Mexico and the United States.  We also have 
it with the WTO.  We as Canadians require rules based trading 
more so than our partners.  We have taken advantage of that rules 
based trading.  We must continue to exercise our negotiating 
skills at the WTO table.  I would suggest that not being at the 
WTO in Seattle at the end of this month would be the worse 
possible thing we could do for Canadians and for our standard of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This NDP motion speaks to enforcing labour standards, 
environmental protection, culture diversity, the preservation of 
health care and public education.  These areas are no more 
threatened today than they were 10 years ago because we have 
rules based trade agreements in place and a dispute mechanism 
that goes along with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that trade agreements and trade liberalization do 
not put at risk these aspects of Canadian social fabric or the 
ability of government in power to exert effective diplomatic 
negotiations with our trade allies.  Without question, Canada's 
diplomatic relations with our trading partners, and particularly 
with the U.S., have deteriorated under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have had the number of trade disputes we have had 
with the Americans had we been more effective at the diplomatic 
level.  Once again the current Liberal government could learn a 
lesson from the previous Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of scrapping chapter 11 of NAFTA would only do more 
harm than good to Canadian foreign investment.  Free trade has 
rules and it works both ways.  We are the major benefactor of 
those rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about agriculture.  Canada continues to enjoy a 
multibillion dollar trade surplus in this sector, with Canada 
being a net exporter of more than $2.5 billion annually, which 
was opened up by the NAFTA and the free trade agreements.  I find 
it baffling that the NDP is suggesting that we not pursue trade 
liberalization when farmers would be on Canada's list of 
endangered species if it were not for free trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade is vital to both the agricultural industry and 
international trade.  With the WTO negotiations beginning in 
November in Seattle, it is important for Canada as a free trading 
nation to set realistic goals as we go to the negotiating table. 
From what I have heard from the government they are not 
realistic.  I would go as far as to say that it is being terribly 
naive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party continues to believe in a 
comprehensive strategy required to ensure the Canadian interest 
in global agricultural trade is protected at the upcoming World 
Trade Organization talks.  The government must continue to adopt 
the principles of the previous Progressive Conservative 
government in the pursuit of free trade in the agricultural 
sector.  The government must push foreign governments to further 
reductions of export subsidies on agricultural products and the 
elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to pursuing an active and aggressive trade 
policy to secure new markets on behalf of Canadian agriculture. 
Changes in consumer preference involving the food industry and 
trade liberalization will affect the future of our industry.  We 
must ensure that there is open dialogue with both industry and 
consumers on how we should compete in international and domestic 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has told people time 
and time again that Canada's supply managed industries and STEs 
will not be touched at the upcoming WTO negotiations.  Yet in 
Washington this past year the standing committee on agriculture 
was told time and time again that supply management and state 
trading enterprises were number one and two on the American 
agenda.  I do not believe that the minister of agriculture or our 
trading negotiators have taken that into consideration.  They are 
going to the WTO in a very naive fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had other opportunities to give counsel to the 
parliamentary secretary and the government on how to handle trade 
because we were the ones who put free trade into place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a brief comment.  While I listened to the hon. 
member for Brandon—Souris I had a horrible flashback to the kind 
of comprehensive intellectual dishonesty that we saw during the 
time of the free trade debate in the House when the Progressive 
Conservative Party was in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not relate in the House to what people actually say? 
There is enough to debate and enough to disagree about in terms 
of what we actually say.  We say that we should get rid of the 
chapter 11 investor state dispute mechanism.  That is something 
to debate.  The member says he is for it and we are against it. 
We could debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did I ever say that NDP wants Canada to sever all its relations 
with its trading partners?  I talked about a rules based trading 
regime.  I talked about what rules we did not like, what rules we 
liked, and what rules we would like to see in place.  Did I ever 
say that it was NDP position to sever our relationships with all 
our trade partners?  This is the kind of garbage that is not 
worthy of this place.  Let us at least debate what each other 
said, instead of just making up stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in fact members of the 
NDP said that getting rid of chapter 11 would make our trade 
ability with our trade partners impossible.  That means that we 
would no longer be in an open globalized trading market.  That is 
not what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every $1 billion in trade in this country 15,000 jobs are 
created.  Most of the jobs I spoke of in my dissertation are 
unionized jobs.  They are jobs I am sure the member would love to 
see more of, but they come about because of open trade.  To get 
rid of chapter 11 would be to stop that and close the doors on 
that type of trade.  I am sure the member would agree that 15,000 
jobs for every $1 billion of trade is very important not only for 
him and his members but also for other Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
claims that somehow the Liberal government, the Government of 
Canada just picked up where the Tories left off on this issue. In 
fact we did not just pick up.  We had to deal first with a $42 
billion deficit.  We then had to set out a situation in trade, 
make new trading agreements and take the focus really away from 
just a focus on the United States that the previous government 
had with trade and take that focus around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Prime Minister, through his team Canada 
exercises, has been promoting international trade and Canada's 
interests around the world.  We felt it was important to get away 
from just focusing on the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had to deal with an economy at a time when jobs were 
being lost.  That is why we had to focus on not only the deficit 
and the debt but also on job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also stated that the government has not 
consulted with Canadians.  He should talk to the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture and all the different groups across 
Canada.  The Government of Canada did travel across the country 
and talked to many agricultural groups to make sure that the 
position we put forward in Seattle was a position that reflected 
the views of these groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the hon. member to talk to these groups 
because they are well aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform 
the parliamentary secretary that I have consulted with the 
majority of these groups, perhaps more than he and his government 
have, because there are a number of conflicting issues and 
positions being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me again speak to the $42 billion deficit.  I am sure the 
hon. member will agree that the reason the $42 billion deficit 
has been retired is because of the free trade agreements and 
certainly the open trade that was negotiated back prior to the 
1993 Liberal government taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about team Canada and looking at opening up trade.  I 
am sure the member realizes that 80% of what Canadians produce 
right now goes to the United States.  It is our major market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If team Canada has done such a wonderful job, I would ask the 
parliamentary secretary why we have not received more access to 
the EU market right now, which is a huge market?  The member and 
his government have certainly attempted to open up that market 
but have failed miserably.  I put that directly on his 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on our opposition day.  I will also be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject of the debate today is the World Trade Organization. 
I will present my views on how it affects the environment. The 
environment and the economy are very much tied together because 
without the environment there is no economy.  We cannot provide 
all our trade on the ships of the ocean.  We have to find land 
sometime and find our goods and services.  When we come upon 
these goods and services we find the land has a jurisdiction. The 
jurisdiction that we speak of today is this country, the 
sovereign state of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting Canadians is the driving force of being a member of 
parliament in the House of Commons:  protecting Canadians, 
protecting our interests, protecting our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the representation that we have in the House of 
Commons, Canadians en masse are aware that the environment has 
direct links to our health:  the cross border air pollution that 
pollutes our air, our rain and inevitably contaminates our water. 
The international toxic fallout throughout Canada's north is 
destroying the traditional culture and value of hunting and 
gathering.  The country foods, as they are termed, are all 
affected by this toxic fallout that is happening in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People around the globe realize that our environment and the 
ecosystem, our biosphere that supports our lives, is under 
tremendous stress.  Climate change and the increased storm 
severity and the damage that causes worldwide are a direct result 
of our economic activities in the world.  The invisible chemicals 
that are throughout the entire food chain, including the human 
species, are changing our hormones, our basic genetic structure 
and threatening our children's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade and borderless profit, this fad of making money 
regardless—and I want to stress regardless—is losing strength 
in the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that with the whole issue of the MAI where all peoples of 
the world had major objections to trade negotiations being done 
behind closed doors.  Once the negotiations were brought out to 
public forums the MAI was flushed down the toilet.  There goes 
the pollution cycle once again, so be careful where it lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens around the globe realize that there is a cost to making 
trade the first and foremost consideration over the protection of 
the environment that supports us.  This cost has to be tallied in 
the houses of government by the democratically elected people who 
make these decisions.  Trade is a major part of the governance of 
this country, but environmental responsibility and the health of 
our citizens are also major responsibilities.  These cannot be 
compromised for trade reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO process wishes to ensure free and unfettered trade 
happens worldwide.  This is backed up by a cesspool of rules and 
regulations.  The cesspool has reared its head when MMT and the 
water issue has come up.  These rules and regulations were 
blueprinted to support these interests of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens of Canada and other states of the world are naive to 
the small print.  When these regulations are enforced through the 
justice system and the international trade bodies, we find out 
that reality has hit the ground when we start seeing decisions 
being made against the will of duly elected governments. The 
essence of our opposition day motion is that we must not 
sacrifice ourselves for the sake of world trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a different vision of the future.  The legacy for 
our children in the next century and future generations is 
foremost.  Canadians can find danger where there is a lack of 
environmental protection in trade agreements with multinational 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent round of the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, where a duly elected House of Commons selected a committee 
on the environment, a bill was passed to strengthen environmental 
protections but was then thrown into cabinet behind closed doors 
and the industry lobby tore it to shreds.  That is a very 
undemocratic process but that is a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since free trade hit the country, lobbyists have made millions 
of dollars carrying legislation and advising on policy behind 
closed doors.  That is our job as members of parliament who 
represent Canadians.  This is where we must have an open public 
debate on where the country and the future of our children are 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MMT is a major issue.  I call on the Liberal government to be 
cautious.  The year 2000 is coming very quickly.  The whole issue 
of manganese and the effects it has on our health should be 
foremost in the review.  The health department and the health 
minister should look directly at this issue as a number one 
priority because of the inhalation of fuel additives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manganese was basically used to replace lead as an anti-knocking 
agent in fuel for automobile engines.  However, we have to face 
up to the fact that manganese does strange things. The United 
States has banned MMT en masse but in Canada, not only do we 
endorse MMT, so to speak, but we also pay and apologize to the 
Ethyl Corporation for stopping the interprovincial transportation 
of MMT.  Groups all over Canada are raising this issue but the 
Liberals, in making its $20 million cheque, has basically 
endorsed this product and went against public safety and public 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard about the issue of the precautionary 
principle from cabinet ministers and especially the environment 
minister.  The precautionary principle is a major principle of 
environmental and health protection in the country but it was 
thrown right out the door just to accommodate international 
trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The wish of Canadians is not to see third world conditions exist 
here where corporations make decisions which challenge us at 
every turn to protect ourselves and have our sovereign and 
democratic rights bent for the sake of profit.  The destruction 
of resources is happening on the planet as we know it.  A case in 
point is the Amazon forests which have been experiencing 
deforestation for the last few decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now raise in the House that the boreal forests in our own 
backyards are disappearing at a faster rate than the Brazilian 
forests.  Why is this happening?  It is to make more profit and 
to make more paper.  The whole issue of recycling and the issue 
of another round of WTO talks are also opening the door for 
further deforestation in the trading states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell all Canadians that we must protect our 
environment.  Let us protect the things that create the air that 
we breath:  the muskeg; the different trees such as the spruce, 
the jack pine and the poplar; these gifts that we have from our 
Creator that give us life.  If we are conscious of the cycle of 
life, let us not disrupt that for the sake of profit.  Let us put 
our health and our democracy ahead of world trade organizations 
that want profit, international trade and a borderless society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that there is a Canadian border and I am 
proud of the Canadian border.  I think the hon. member from the 
Conservative Party said that we were trying to raise this border 
to higher standards.  I welcome that view.  I think Canadians 
should stand proud of who we are are, protect our jurisdiction, 
protect the resources and the gifts that we have, but let us not 
give it away for the sake of profit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak in the House today in support of the 
opposition day motion from the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by quoting the first part of that motion because it 
really gets to the heart or the nub of the very important issue 
that we are debating today.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, this government has sabotaged 
Canadian democracy by pursuing a trade policy that gives 
excessive power to unelected and unaccountable international 
trade organizations and erodes the ability of Canada's elected 
representatives to act in the public interest; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that part of the motion really gets to the issue at 
hand.  I wonder how many Canadians are aware that in a few weeks 
there will be massive negotiations taking place in Seattle at the 
end of this month.  The Canadian government will be represented. 
It will be a closed door process.  The issues that will be on the 
table are our services and the understanding of what we are as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very frightening things about the upcoming talks at 
the World Trade Organization is that very few people are aware of 
what will actually take place and what will be negotiated away by 
the Canadian government, allegedly on behalf of the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even wonder whether Liberal members are aware of what will be 
negotiated.  We have seen a pattern with this government, and 
certainly with the Progressive Conservative government before it, 
to deal with international trade relations, trade rules and trade 
liberalization in a way that is so secretive that actually 
citizen groups and individual Canadians have had to fight tooth 
and nail to even get any sense of disclosure about what is going 
on and to demand of the government that there be some kind of 
transparent process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that just as we have seen in the past with the 
negotiations that took place in secret under the multilateral 
agreement on investments, we should today be very concerned about 
what is now about to take place by the Canadian government at the 
WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the issues that are before the WTO from the Canadian 
government's perspective? 
When we look at the issues that are on the table, alarm bells 
need to go off.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand that the WTO as an unelected, undemocratic 
government is putting together what is being called a new 
economic constitution for the planet.  This economic constitution 
has been written by and is almost exclusively for the benefit of 
the world's largest corporations. That is the issue here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear that the WTO aims to deregulate 
international trade.  It is bad enough that we are moving into a 
global economy where rules about the environment, social 
equality, social conditions and social programs are completely 
thrown out the window.  What is worse is that the upcoming talks 
at the WTO will further and pursue with vigour the agenda of 
deregulation and trade liberalization. The consequence of doing 
that is it will actually limit the capacity of our government and 
all elected governments to set public policy in the interests of 
citizens of whatever nation-state.  That is the danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that the Liberal government is so intent on 
keeping this process very secret and behind closed doors.  The 
Liberals do not want the Canadian people to know what is 
unfolding, just as they did not want the Canadian people to know 
what was unfolding with the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear. In today's world, multinational and 
transnational corporations control more than one-third of the 
world's productive assets.  We have arrived at the point where 
national and regional boundaries are almost meaningless. It is an 
environment where the role of the government has shifted from 
dealing with national issues to working at an international 
level.  The role of government has become one of serving a market 
ideology.  That is what we have arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask most Canadians what they want from their government, 
they would say that they want to make sure that their government 
is operating honestly and openly.  I think most Canadians would 
say that they want to make sure that there is a health care 
system that they can use, that there are good schools that their 
kids can go to, that there are adequate, safe and secure places 
to live and that they have a society that respects the 
environment. That is what most Canadians see as the role of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last decade we have seen a fundamental shift in the role 
of government.  It has gone from dealing with public policy on 
the basis of what is in the public interest and the public good 
to public policy that is devoted to serving the market ideology 
in the pursuit of a globalized economy where nation rights are 
given over to multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to the very heart of democracy and sovereignty 
for Canada.  It is about establishing who should make the 
decisions about our future.  Is it the people of Canada and our 
elected governments or is it multinational corporations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the Liberal government approach to the 
upcoming WTO meeting in Seattle shows where it is at.  It appears 
to be wholeheartedly in favour of embracing the agenda of the 
multinationals.  What is on the line?  I think there is more and 
more research that would give evidence to show that what is on 
the line is health care and our other social programs, the 
survival of family farms, our right to establish strong standards 
of environmental protection, our cultural institutions and now 
for the first time, our education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the education spokesperson for the NDP, I want to focus for a 
few minutes on education.  For the first time in the history of 
negotiations, Canada is allowing education to be put on the table 
at the upcoming WTO hearings.  The Liberal government has 
completely abandoned Canada's traditional view that there should 
be exemptions for education in international trade negotiations. 
This is a very serious and disturbing departure for Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the former trade minister said that Canada would seek 
to completely carve out health care and education under the MAI. 
Today apparently the position has changed.  Education is now 
apparently being dictated directly by the WTO secretariat on 
educational services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is moving us in a direction where students and education 
are treated as commodities, where students are nothing more than 
consumers.  The very core and accessibility of our educational 
services are being threatened. We have to be very concerned about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could mean, for example, that foreign for profit educational 
institutions would have a guaranteed right to operate in Canada. 
It could mean that governments could not require them to hire 
local educators.  It could mean that requirements of educational 
professionals and institutions would be subjected to WTO review. 
It could mean that government subsidies of any kind, including 
student loans and grants, would have to be given out on a 
non-discriminatory basis to public and private providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim that the risk to public education is very 
minimal and that only education supplied on a commercial basis 
will be impacted.  The WTO secretariat itself has pointed out 
that commercial basis has not even been defined. What is at issue 
here is that the separation between what is public and what is 
private becomes very unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion is very important.  We in the NDP have brought it 
forward because we want to alert the Canadian public as to what 
is unfolding on the upcoming WTO hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from Vancouver East in British Columbia. Massive organizing 
is going on among student organizations, groups like the Council 
of Canadians and the labour movement.  They are extremely 
concerned about these hearings.  They want to say to the 
government that placing the market ideology and the interests of 
transnational corporations above the interests of the people of 
Canada and what we should be doing as a democratically elected 
government is a very dangerous course and must be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative member said that we need rules based trade. 
The question is, for whom?  We need rules based on public 
interest and a common good, not deregulation based on the super 
profits of multinational corporations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
colleague, the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, was chastising the 
Conservative member for misrepresenting what he said.  However in 
the next breath, the New Democratic Party comes in and 
scaremongers, and brings up all these possibilities of issues 
that are somehow taking place at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to the hon. member that she misrepresents 
the Government of Canada in its position.  I will mention two 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that the Government of Canada was not interested 
in transparency, or in other words, of making sure that people 
know what is going on in either the MAI or the WTO negotiations. 
Had the hon. member been involved in the debate or the MAI study 
done by the trade subcommittee along with the WTO study, she 
would know that it was the Government of Canada that brought 
forward and put the MAI report on the table at the standing 
committee on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Government of Canada that was promoting knowledge of 
Canadians to battle exactly that, to battle fearmongering, to 
battle those that would try to paint this in areas that it is 
quite simply not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are simply negotiations to get better rules of trade so 
that we have better access to other countries and that the 
agreements we already have in place work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member, before she rises up and 
fearmongers, that she get out and talk to Canadians as did the 
standing committee and the Government of Canada. The Government 
of Canada found very clearly that it was Canadians who told us 
that beyond all the fearmongering, they found it important that 
there were rules under which they could trade. They said that if 
we are going to create jobs, we need a rules based trading system 
to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can state categorically that the NDP is the only federal 
political party that has consistently gone out with information 
about the MAI and the WTO. There were some parliamentary hearings 
on the MAI but I have to ask the question, why was that?  It was 
because the people of Canada and organizations who were involved 
in uncovering what the Liberal members were doing demanded that 
the Liberals actually come clean, put the issue on the table and 
have a public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was as a result of pressure from the Canadian public that the 
Liberals finally had to acquiesce and agree that they had to 
provide some information.  Exactly the same thing is taking place 
now at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, does the public know, because the Liberals have not 
disclosed it, that on the section on the importance of education 
even the WTO paper states that education can play a role in 
reducing inequality?  Do Canadians know that in the Canadian 
government paper any reference to this role of promoting equality 
is actually deleted?  It has actually gone further than the WTO 
position which is bad enough in and of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we say that there has been no disclosure and this is being 
done in secrecy, that is exactly the case. It is not 
fearmongering.  It is trying to get the information out to the 
Canadian public that the WTO agenda and what is unfolding there, 
and what the position of the Canadian government is, are 
extremely harmful to every notion we have on what it means to be 
Canadians. That is not fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says the Government of Canada's position on the 
education portion is that it has deleted that word. The hon. 
member should know that the Government of Canada has not put 
forward its position.  It will be putting forward its position on 
November 16.  I cannot understand what the hon. member could be 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how these rumours start.  That is how Canadians have 
been taken to the cleaners by groups that put out all this 
misinformation, and spread all these rumours that the Canadian 
government will be doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not quite sure what the hon. member was reading from. There 
might have been documentation put out by the department in order 
to extend this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is the Liberal 
Government of Canada that is taking the people of Canada to the 
cleaners on this and other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with interest that the member has not denied that 
Canada's position will be any deletion to the reference from the 
WTO that education serves as an instrument of promoting equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly there has been an admission that not only does the 
Canadian government's position mirror what the WTO has put 
forward, and we are taking the script from the bureaucrats in 
Geneva, but we are going beyond that.  The member has not been 
able to deny that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose the motion for the simple reason 
that it actually goes to the heart of a common misconception that 
borders on scaremongering, that international trade agreements by 
their very nature are undemocratic and that somehow by entering 
into these international trade agreements we are giving up our 
sovereignty and our right to act and legislate on behalf of the 
Canadian people, and in the best interests of the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us set the record straight.  The very fact that we enter 
into these agreements at all is an act of sovereignty in itself, 
a very important act of sovereignty.  We owe much of our 
prosperity and quality of life to free trade; in fact, 40% of our 
gross domestic product depends on it. We also see free trade not 
just as an end in itself, but as a means to an end, an end to 
provide a better quality of life for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also recognized that to reach our common 
goals we must engage all of society, not just the experts but 
also the non-governmental organizations and academics. 
In fact this very week the Americas business forum and also the 
free trade area of the Americas ministerial meeting was held in 
Toronto.  At the same time our government supported a civil 
society parallel forum which was held right there in Toronto to 
canvass the views of non-governmental organizations, to canvass 
the views of academics and to canvass the views of all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government sees that transparency is very, very important. I 
would like to use the example of what the government did to 
ensure that we went out to speak with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 and 1999 the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and its subcommittee on international trade 
conducted an examination of Canada's trade objectives and the 
forthcoming agenda at the WTO, and also looked at Canada's 
priority interests in the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee held a series of public hearings, first in Ottawa 
and thereafter across Canada, on the key aspects of Canadian 
international trade policy.  Why did we do so?  Because these 
hearings were coming at a time when all countries were facing 
some very crucial choices and decisions in the complex 
negotiating process that is being conducted multilaterally, both 
under the auspices of the WTO and in developing regional forums, 
such as the proposed free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In asking the committee to conduct public consultations, the 
then minister for international trade stated that there is a 
necessity to provide Canadians with more opportunity to have 
input into the position that the Government of Canada will take 
going into these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, at that time the minister stated in his opening 
presentation to the committee that international trade had become 
a local issue.  What happens as far away as the negotiating table 
has consequences that reach right down to the kitchen table and 
other domains of daily life.  As the trend deepens as a result of 
globalization, the making of trade policies cannot be left only 
to a few officials in back rooms, it needs to engage the whole of 
society and governments at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the role of the committee to encourage citizens in all 
parts of Canada to participate, to give us their best ideas and 
to follow the progress of the study in the coming weeks and 
months.  The final report submitted by the committee represented 
extensive hearings across Canada, containing the views of many 
Canadians and interested groups on a broad range of issues that 
will need to be addressed in our trade negotiations.  It is 
incumbent upon the government to respond to those views and the 
government will be tabling its response within the next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would commend to all members of the House the report of the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
entitled “Canada at the WTO:  Toward a Millennium Agenda”.  It 
is a comprehensive and helpful contribution of a parliamentary 
committee in defining the national trade interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the committee prepared a citizens' guide to the WTO 
and to the committee's June 1999 report.  This guide serves as a 
very useful tool, not just to inform and educate ourselves, but 
also Canadians.  We are transparent.  I would urge all Canadians, 
as well as hon. members opposite, to get a copy of the citizens' 
guide to the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians and all legislative committees are well placed 
to take on the responsibility of mediating and communicating 
between the executive branch of government and the various 
interest groups in an area of broad significance such as 
international trade policy at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back again to the hearings that we undertook, these were 
the most comprehensive cross-country hearings ever taken:  425 
committee appearances comprised of 88 industry associations, 26 
governments, 61 academics, researchers and professionals, 85 
civil society representatives and 64 individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was mindful of having the broadest possible and 
open public input on the main political choices that will govern 
the WTO millennium round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report is comprehensive in addressing Canada's general goals 
at the WTO as well as specific sectoral interests, particularly 
the difficult agricultural dimension where both Canadian export 
and supply interests are at play, and the tricky social dimension 
of labour and environmental standards, and the role of the WTO 
around those standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report developed a broad degree of consensus, 
notwithstanding some minority dissenting opinions.  We reached 
consensus on 39 recommendations.  The recommendations related to 
our negotiating interests at the WTO round, the implication of 
the WTO agreements, as well as improving the dispute settlement 
mechanism to ensure that the WTO can make a contribution to 
global governments and stability without detracting from its 
primary sphere of trade responsibility.  It is representative of 
what federal parliamentarians working together in a legislative 
committee can achieve in influencing the Canadian position 
leading into the WTO negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also recommends an ongoing role for parliament in 
examining the results of trade negotiations before entering into 
binding legal agreements and implementing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday in the House the subcommittee on international 
trade, trade disputes and investments, tabled its report on 
priorities as we enter the consultations on the free trade area 
of the Americas.  The report is entitled “Towards a Hemispheric 
Agreement in the Canadian Interest”; not in the multinational 
interest, but in the Canadian interest.  This week ministers met 
in Toronto to discuss the roles we should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember the importance of free trade to our economy. 
Every billion dollars in export amounts to 15,000 jobs.  Our 
annual export and import growth of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively, 
far outpaced our GDP growth.  Canada is the most trade oriented 
country in the G-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to look at investments.  There are stronger 
increases in both inward and outward flows of direct investment. 
In 1998 inflows to Canada were $22.9 billion, but Canadians 
invested a record $39.8 billion abroad.  Canada, as a medium 
power, benefits by a rules based world where might is not right. 
This is especially important to us as we live next door to the 
United States, our biggest trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian parliamentarians at all levels can play an important 
role in supporting the interests of Canadians by encouraging and 
promoting Canadian firms and exports and by assessing broad 
industrial and societal interests in recommending approaches to 
international trade policy as a new WTO round dawns.  Effective 
communication and co-operation on trade matters by federal and 
provincial parliamentarians may enhance the arrangements in place 
to ensure that provincial interests are fully integrated into the 
national trade agenda.  Support in international and 
interparliamentary trade representations will also enhance 
government efforts as we strive not only to help Canadian 
industry, which is comprised of small and medium size business, 
but to benefit all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague with whom I have worked on 
the committee.  She talked about the broad based consultation 
process which has taken place, in particular with respect to the 
free trade area of the Americas and the WTO.  She also mentioned 
that the FTAA report is out.  I would remind her that the 
official opposition has released a dissenting report which dwells 
on one of the major points, the consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The so-called civil society now has direct access to the talks, 
bypassing elected officials.  They should be consulting elected 
officials.  They should not have direct input into the talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have not really been consulted.  A meeting of the 
ministers does not mean consultation of the provinces.

treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have her thoughts on those points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
the official opposition for his question.  He talked about broad 
based public consultation.  This is the first time in the history 
of our trade negotiations that a parliamentary committee has 
travelled across Canada before the negotiations started to 
canvass Canadians on their priorities, interests and concerns for 
the upcoming WTO negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face the fact that the WTO is a brand new organization. 
It only came into existence in 1995 and it may not be perfect. We 
listened to those concerns, because we cannot make it better if 
we do not understand what the problems are.  That was the reason 
we went, and we will continue to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleague would look at the WTO report again he would 
see that there is a specific recommendation that there continue 
to be an ongoing role for parliamentarians to look at the impacts 
and the effects of trade agreements.  The process does not stop 
here.  It will be ongoing.  I hope that the member, who is now a 
member of the committee, will continue to be there to canvass 
societal interests across Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Parkdale—High Park on her excellent 
remarks with respect to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that it has been the most important vehicle for 
economic growth here in Canada in recent years.  She also said 
that it has been one of the most important vehicles for economic 
development and job creation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member whether she thinks that, without 
free trade, Canada would now be looking at a budgetary surplus. 
Had it not been for the efforts of our government a number of 
years ago, would there be a budgetary surplus today? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we must remember one very 
important thing, and I did say this, that this government used 
free trade not just as an end in itself, but as a means to an 
end; as a way to ensuring a better quality of life for all 
Canadians.  We do not just believe in unfettered trade and trade 
at any cost.  That is why we sought consultations across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, trade is important.  Forty per cent of our GDP depends on 
it.  That is one of the factors which makes this country a great 
place to live.  It is one of the reasons the government continues 
to work on job creation, ensuring that small and medium size 
businesses can export.  Also, the government plays a very 
important role in ensuring that those most affected by free trade 
are taken care of, that adjustments are made, and that we are 
there to ensure that wealth is properly distributed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary

satisfaction that I rise today to speak about something that, in 
my view, has served the Canadian public very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, I would simply like to respond to the 
earlier question from the Progressive Conservative member about 
the benefits of the free trade agreement put in place by the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  I would merely remind him that 
the Liberal Party was the first party in Canada to support free 
trade.  This goes all the way back to 1910 and 1911, to the time 
of Wilfrid Laurier. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what the Conservatives did was mentioned. I feel we 
should also emphasize the nice job done by the Liberals, who 
then formed the official opposition. They ensured that some 
adjustments were made regarding certain definitions in the 
agreement, so that the opening of our borders did become a 
laudable initiative and a desirable thing for all Canadians. 
Again, the Liberal team, my team, deserves to be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I would like to do two things: first, put into 
perspective the importance of international trade for Canada 
and, second, stress the efforts being made by the government to 
provide greater access to international markets for our 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on all day about the government's efforts, but I will 
focus on specific points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is the importance of international trade. As 
Minister Responsible for the Economic Development Agency of 
Canada for the regions of Quebec, I see on a daily basis that 
Canada's current economic growth is largely dependent on our 
businesses' ability to face foreign competition and to find a 
niche on international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some figures. Exports account for 40% of 
our GDP. This is the highest rate among G-7 countries. Moreover, 
the percentage of domestic production that relates to exports 
almost doubled over the past ten years. As for exports alone, in 
1998, they reached a record level of $367 billion. Based on the 
impressive numbers for 1999, we can already anticipate that the 
1998 level will be surpassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trade balance is undoubtedly a good indicator. In August, we 
had a trade surplus of $3.6 billion. This means that, after the 
first eight months of 1999, we had already exceeded the total 
figure for 1998. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers I just referred to are pretty much eloquent.  They 
show that international commerce is vital for Canada, vital for 
our exports.  We as a country profit from the global marketplace. 
We started talking about the global marketplace in theory decades 
ago, but we are actually facing a real situation. It is a real 
challenge for Canada as a country.  It is also a real challenge 
for our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we want to make sure that all corporations in 
Canada, of which we are proud, will be given all the necessary 
tools to be involved in and to join with all nations in the 
global marketplace.  At the end of the process we want to ensure 
that we have our share.  Having our share means that we will have 
economic growth on a national basis and very good quality job 
creation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important part of international economy and the 
global marketplace is foreign investment.  Foreign investment in 
our country brought us new technology, different knowledge, and 
the means to support the social safety net that has been in place 
in the country for decades. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we can see the importance of international trade here in 
Canada.  Given that our market is relatively small, the fact 
that borders are opening now, that tariff and non tariff 
barriers are disappearing, enormous opportunities are arising.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, especially since our government took 
office in 1993, has understood this fact and put certain 
measures in place to enable our businesses to seize every 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, one of the factors resulting in the government's support 
for business is, without a doubt and not often mentioned, our 
country's good financial health.  It is a matter of ensuring 
economic stability, economic growth and control over public 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This results in a respectable and low rate of inflation for us 
and respectable rates of interest, as compared with all of the 
other G-7 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, our businesses have a solid base nationally and a 
springboard for their first international venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second factor I would like to draw to the attention of the 
House today is the Team Canada phenomenon.  I think this is one 
of the finest means of international promotion any member of the 
G-7 has come up with in this era of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud that our government is the one that developed such an 
initiative, whose purpose is to ensure that all departments and 
agencies—22 in all—work together to help businesses on the 
international level, and work in partnership with all provinces 
and territories as well, and also with the private sector.  That 
is, of course, very important.  I need not review all the 
success stories of Team Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to draw attention to the important 
contribution of the Export Development Corporation in our 
international efforts.  This is a somewhat unique financial 
institution which allows us to open doors to a sizeable number 
of Canadian businesses in more than 200 countries. 
This is another well-known tool and one that is doing an 
excellent job, providing support to businesses in very specific 
and specialized areas.  These areas are vital to businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a fourth element: the changes we have made in 
recent years to our embassies and consulates.  Canada wanted to 
be far more aggressive on the international scene.  We wanted to 
really support our businesses.  This is why we have expanded our 
commercial sections abroad and have begun a process to expand 
the number of trade commissioners internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, a considerable number of actions have been 
undertaken in order to help businesses and especially to 
ultimately democratize exports and ensure they are also 
accessible to small and medium sized businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall close with the comment that, in partnership with a 
government with a great deal of vision, Canadian businesses will 
be able to conquer the export market and to bring to this 
country all the prosperity we deserve.

listened with great interest to my colleague talk about the 
government's record on free trade, but I would beg to differ.  He 
talked about team Canada.  I think team Canada's success is still 
under question, despite what the government says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the record on free trade.  The Liberals opposed 
NAFTA and when they were elected they agreed to it.  In the ITAR 
dispute which took place the government later recognized the 
impact on trade.  In the WTO agriculture is not a priority.  I do 
not even hear the government talking about agriculture.  The 
Minister for International Trade has only been talking about 
culture.  Perhaps the minister would like to address my comments.

brand new economy in the global marketplace of course it has to 
take place within a framework.  We all know that the framework 
set by all countries involved in the global economy is the World 
Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>WTO, which was previously GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, was established, as those who are very much aware of 
the situation know, a long time ago.  It is a long process but it 
is a long process that shows to the population and the world as a 
whole that when countries are working together they can establish 
rules and parameters which ensure that corporations are able to 
compete against each other and that there are rules which have to 
be respected and from which every country can benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as WTO is concerned, it is an ongoing process which will 
continue in Seattle shortly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
putting my question to the Minister of National Revenue, I would 
like to caution members of the public and of non-governmental 
organizations that the NDP is using this official opposition day 
on the subject of free trade agreements to do a bit of 
grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the public to look into the New Democratic Party's 
record of attendance at the many consultations that have been 
held and the many forums where it was given an opportunity to 
express its disagreement with the free trade agreements. NDP 
members were never there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue said that, in 1911, in the days 
of Wilfrid Laurier, the ruling Liberal Party was wonderful and 
supported free trade.  This former prime minister must have been 
turning in his grave in the 1980s.  It seems to me that, at the 
time, the Liberal Party's position on free trade was a lot less 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also seems to me that, on the GST and NAFTA, the Liberals 
have broken two promises.  With respect to environmental and 
social clauses, could the minister tell me whether his 
government maintained its 1993 position in the free trade 
agreements with Chile, Israel and the FTAA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, since time is short, I will 
say that I am sure that, even in the 1980s, when the free trade 
agreements were being discussed, Wilfrid Laurier could rest in 
peace, because my party has always been faithful to its original 
tenets, which were established by Wilfrid Laurier himself.  This 
goes back to 1910, 1911. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, what we did in the 1980s was to bring out various 
points of view in order to clarify the agreement.  Further 
clarification would have been needed to avoid certain problems 
of interpretation that we have today and that would not exist if 
people had listened to us in the 1980s. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague, who, as a general rule, is one member 
of the government who is rational.  We cannot change history.  I 
know very well that, in any case, excessive partisanship can 
become morbid and prevent us from seeing things as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here in the 1988 campaign, when all of Quebec was 
mobilized to get the agreement ratified.  We suffered the wrath 
of the Liberal Party at the time.  It was extremely difficult to 
campaign objectively then. Despite all, the results are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to tell us the economic effects of the 
free trade agreement since its signing, in terms of volume of 
export. I would also like to know what it has meant in terms of 
net annual revenue for the government. 
I do not think we consider globalization or a free trade 
philosophy often enough, but it produces results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my ten minute speech 
showed the benefits and the need to address globalization and 
the various export markets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there were enormous positive effects, a source of 
particular pride to us, since we also played a lead role in some 
of the free trade agreements signed by our government, with 
which hon. members are very familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also very important, in my opinion, is that when we took 
over the government in 1993, our economic sector was having a 
particularly hard time competing internationally, because the 
fiscal position of the country left something to be desired, as 
a result of the actions of the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We started by putting our fiscal house in order, which brought a 
breath of fresh air into private business, and prosperity is 
possible today because we have a responsible government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to have the opportunity, along with my colleagues, to reply 
on behalf of the official opposition to the NDP supply day 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit surprised at the way the NDP is attacking this 
problem, especially after the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade held extensive hearings last year 
across the country to garner information about what people's 
positions would be. I am surprised the NDP members have taken the 
approach to sort of roll up the sidewalks and put fences up 
around Canada as if to say “Stop the world, we want to get 
off”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could just as easily have come from the Clark Tories. We saw 
their main spokesman, David Orchard, taking the same kind of tack 
for the Conservative Party.  My understanding is that at a recent 
convention that was held in Winnipeg, a resolution was raised 
that would have free trade as one of the standing principles of 
the Clark Tory Party.  It was voted down, if members can believe 
that.  The party that voted for free trade in 1988 is now 
rejecting free trade under David Orchard and the Clark led 
Tories.  It will be interesting to hear how Tory members speak to 
this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Selkirk—Interlake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about free trade and where the whole concept of 
trade rules came from.  It is important to have a little history 
on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes back to the first world war.  Shortly after the first 
world war in the twenties, the United States became very 
protectionist, much like the NDP are suggesting for Canada today. 
The United States introduced the Smoot-Hawley tariffs.  Those 
tariffs eventually got to about 60%.  Naturally, its trading 
partners, the other countries around the world said that if they 
did not have access to the U.S. market, they did not have much 
choice but to put up their own tariffs. That started to happen 
and I suggest that was a main ingredient of the massive 
depression that hit in 1929, protectionism.  It has not served 
anybody very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through the thirties, the depression in Canada.  We know 
what happens when countries withdraw. The money supply gets tight 
and they protect their own markets.  There was basically no trade 
in the world.  We went through a very tough time. Then we went 
through the second world war. There was massive upheaval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the second world war it was recognized that we 
needed some international stability. A number of international 
institutions were put in place through agreement, such as the 
United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank 
and of course the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades in 
1948. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened as a result of the trade agreements is that we 
gradually came to have a liberalized set of rules to govern world 
trade in a number of commodities.  At the time Canada was 
proposing that we should also move to have agriculture included 
but there was not enough support around the world to let that 
happen. Agriculture was viewed as a special category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what has happened over the years.  International trade 
has prospered in the areas of industrial goods. Tariffs are only 
at about 4% or 5% around the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture was only brought under trade rules for the first 
time with the Uruguay round agreement in 1993.  It took seven 
years for the Uruguay round agreement to be achieved.  The 
backdrop to that Uruguay round agreement was massive trade wars 
in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go a little further down the road, the reason for the 
agreement was that countries like Canada, Australia and 
Argentina, the smaller economies, knew that they could not 
compete with the massive treasuries of trade blocs like the 
United States and the European Union.  They knew that if we were 
going to be exporting, and Canada is very much an exporting 
country with 40% of our GDP coming from exports, we were going to 
have to have some trade rules around that.  There was no 
agreement to make the same kinds of cuts to tariffs and subsidies 
that there were on industrial goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They knew there would have to be an adjustment period. That 
adjustment period was to take place in the six year time frame 
from 1994 to 2000 with a small adjustment, about a 15% reduction 
in tariffs and subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea was to build in another trade round in 2000. 
Agriculture would be a mandated negotiation.  We would try to cut 
these massive tariffs and subsidies we have around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That paints the picture of where we are at.  I have talked to a 
lot of farmers around Canada in the last several years.  They are 
saying that we need to have trade rules around agriculture to 
bring down subsidies and tariffs because we cannot compete with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the government needing to respond by putting subsidies in 
place because the European Union spent $70 billion on agriculture 
subsidies last year.  Essentially they are freezing us out of our 
market share by dumping their excess onto the world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, farmers are saying to us, “We need to have 
these rules.  Go to Seattle.  Go to the next trade round and 
negotiate tough.  We are not going to survive otherwise”. How 
does that compare with the NDP approach?  The NDP approach is to 
roll up the sidewalks and say, “Stop the world and let me off”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how that is playing in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar. 
Agriculture is hurting very desperately in Saskatchewan. I wonder 
how the NDP supply day motion to take us out of trade 
negotiations is playing in Saskatchewan.  The farmers want more 
trade liberalization so that we can compete on the basis of 
production, not on the basis of subsidies with trade blocs around 
the world.  I would suggest that the NDP is going to find out 
that it is not playing very well at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP are ignoring Sask Pool.  The member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona is here.  He was part of those hearings.  He 
sat in on some of them when Sask Pool said, “Yes, we need more 
trade liberalization.  We need it in agriculture”.  A number of 
farm organizations from Winnipeg, Saskatoon and different places 
were calling for the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Embattled farmers around western Canada in particular are 
looking for more trade liberalization so we can get on an equal 
playing field as we have with other countries in terms of 
industrial tariffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings into play the role of the Liberal government in the 
trade negotiations coming up in the next round.  It has taken a 
position that we are going to have a so-called balanced approach 
in agriculture, a balanced approach meaning we want access to all 
of the markets of all the other countries around the world based 
on their subsidies and tariffs, but we do not want to do the same 
thing here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is a credible position. We still have 
tariffs on some commodities in the range of 300%.  I suggest that 
those tariffs are going to be attacked in the next trade round, 
as they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the government is to take a credible position.  It 
is to create the economic climate that lets our companies do 
well.  We have to have some trade rules.  We have to trade.  We 
are a major exporting country and that is not going to change. We 
are 30 million people with all kinds of natural resources. The 
service sector is growing at a very high rate.  We need rules to 
work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has also said that it does not want any further 
negotiations on investment.  It makes me wonder.  Since the NDP 
provincial government went into power in B.C. in 1991, every 
subsequent year the amount of foreign and direct investment in 
British Columbia has dropped.  B.C. is now a basket case 
province.  I think the NDP is going to be thrown out of power 
there at the earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that people do not want to invest in B.C.  It is 
no wonder our mining companies are leaving that province in 
droves to go to places like Chile.  The investment climate is not 
as it should be to create the proper environment for people to 
invest. It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP also says that we should not talk about investment 
rules. I know the NDP was very much against the MAI.  I would 
suggest there needs to be some rules around investment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of direct foreign investment by Canadian companies 
and Canadians in general is now in excess of all the direct 
foreign investment in Canada.  There is something like $240 
billion of Canadian investment outside of Canada.  I suggest some 
of that is because of the poor economic climate in Canada in 
places like British Columbia, but there are other reasons. 
Companies also want to take advantage of opportunities in places 
like Chile and many other spots.  They are looking for some rules 
regarding expropriation to protect them in those kinds of 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really surprised with the NDP's approach.  I know that we 
and the NDP have a major difference in policy, but I am surprised 
that it would be so regressive in its approach, especially when 
farmers in a province like Saskatchewan are asking for trade 
liberalization.  Companies are asking for investment rules that 
would govern investment around the world. It is a very strange 
approach, one that we will definitely not be supporting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to correct a wrong impression that the hon. 
member has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he had listened to my remarks earlier, I made a distinction 
between agriculture and the whole question of investment and 
services.  I said that investment and services were new things 
that were being put on the WTO table in a way that they never 
have been before, but that agriculture has always been on the 
table at the GATT, as the member rightly recognized, and now at 
the WTO and that there was work to do with respect to 
agriculture.  I wish he would not say things about us that are 
not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we point out in the motion is that the government has gone 
a lot further than what the WTO actually requires and has put 
Canadian farmers in a very vulnerable position.  I wonder if he 
agrees with that analysis or not.  Perhaps he could address 
himself to something that the motion actually says, or that some 
New Democrat actually said as opposed to what he likes to imagine 
New Democrats have said.  We have never said that there is not 
more negotiation to go on with respect to agriculture.  We agree 
that there are problems that have to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are unequivocally stating, and what he can disagree with 
properly and honestly because we have said it, is that there 
should be no further trade liberalization of investment and 
services until such time as there are enforceable mechanisms with 
respect to core labour standards, environmental regulations, et 
cetera.  If he wants to disagree with that and attribute that 
position to us, fine.  But let us not have attributed to us 
things that we are not actually saying.  That is all I ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can only go by the 
actual motion that is before the House today.  The NDP opposition 
motion in paragraph 2 calls for the government not to negotiate 
any further liberalization of trade or investment at the Seattle 
meeting of the World Trade Organization.  It could not be any 
clearer than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the NDP's approach is a little bit like the 
Liberal approach, that we can have our cake and eat too.  It 
simply is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gather the NDP member would want us to go there on a very 
narrow agenda and negotiate on certain sections of agriculture, 
although that is not how it reads in the supply day motion. After 
what the member said, I do not think that is a very practical 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that other countries, like the trading blocs of Europe, 
have a vested interest in keeping their subsidies and tariffs in 
place.  If they were to come to those negotiations and they were 
only on agriculture, although I recognize that this is an 
approach that we could take, it would not be very helpful.  We 
are all politicians.  We know that it would be very tough for the 
European Union politicians to go home and say, “We negotiated on 
agriculture, but we are sorry, we lost”.  They have to have more 
on the table than just agriculture to satisfy their public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $70 billion in subsidies went into farmers' pockets in 
Europe last year, subsidies that are destroying our Canadian 
farmers.  Basically the whole European Union trade bloc is off 
limits to our exports.  Even worse than that, they overproduce as 
a result of these large subsidies.  They dump that 10% or 15% 
overproduction on the world markets and it kills our agricultural 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a difference in points of view on how that can be 
achieved.  I suggest it is through a larger trade round than the 
member suggested.

is a wide gap between what they think and what they write, and 
another equally wide between what they write and what they say.

this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague for this intervention because we were part 
of that same committee travelling across the country.  I was at 
all the hearings that were mandated and I heard farmers and farm 
groups say that they desperately needed trade liberalization in 
agriculture.  They could not go on.  When we do not have it we 
see what happens, that we have to get back into the subsidy 
business.  I think most farmers believe that is not the best 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were views pro and con at all those hearings on whether or 
not we should proceed, but I believe Canada has benefited 
greatly.  That can be demonstrated by the amount of trade that 
has taken place between ourselves and the United States, the 
enhanced trade since the free trade agreement of 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the Liberal Party finally did an about-face on free 
trade.  It has become newly converted supporters of it, which I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion brought before the 
House by the NDP caucus.  I will take its details on trade and 
various other issues and put them into the context of history so 
that New Democrats understood why the motion cannot be supported 
by virtually anyone in the House except dyed-in-the-wool 
socialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the history of trade around the world since 
recorded times, we see that the most prosperous countries ever to 
exist had gigantic trading patterns with their neighbours and 
countries other than themselves.  They did not only trade 
internally, hoping to become more prosperous and have better 
lives for their citizens as we see in this motion.  The Greeks 
and the Phoenicians relied on trade as do Japan, the U.S. and 
even Canada today.  The motion before us would in effect slam our 
borders shut until such time as we could dictate to the world 
what the trading patterns and the details of them should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer directly to the motion which starts off by saying in the 
first paragraph that this government has sabotaged Canadian 
democracy.  Does that make everyone feel good when trying to deal 
with trade issues and negotiate with partners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second paragraph says that the government should not 
negotiate any further liberalization of trade or investment, and 
it goes on to talk about the WTO and the FTA.  If that does not 
apply to agriculture, which is trade, I do not know what does. 
Probably the biggest complaint I have about the motion is that we 
should stop where we are, not move forward and not improve 
matters for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chief agriculture critic I will make a few more comments 
about agriculture than other trade issues.  As I have pointed 
out, New Democrats say to the world that either it does as they 
say on trade agreements or they will not help improve conditions 
for Canadian farmers or third world farmers through greater trade 
liberalization and negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last paragraph of the motion says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government should take action to remedy its overzealous 
and irresponsible pursuit of greater trade liberalization, which 
has caused extreme hardship for Canadian farmers—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the benefits of trade liberalization for 
Canadian farmers we know they are better off because of the 
greater number of exports.  Cattle is a great example, as are 
grains such as canola.  Everything is just that much better by 
having liberalized free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last paragraph of the motion the New Democrats are trying 
to say that Canadian farmers have hit upon a hard time.  They had 
better not be blaming trade liberalization for that.  They had 
better be blaming this government and the previous Conservative 
government and the signing of the trade treaty in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a start, but when they came home they totally destroyed 
domestic support programs for agriculture which farmers needed to 
compete on a level playing field with our neighbours to the south 
and Europeans.  They maintained their domestic support and we 
slashed ours and put our farmers into bankruptcy. That can only 
rest on the heads of the Liberals and the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the solution according to NDP members would be to stop 
everything and seal the border.  I am paraphrasing a bit because 
trade would continue, but in essence they want to stop everything 
and start to talk about getting their way and dictating to the 
world how things should be before Canada continues with the 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has been taking good actions and doing what it can in 
Ottawa.  We certainly have solutions to the farm crisis to which 
the NDP alludes.  In the short term domestic support has to be 
raised with the idea of keeping our farmers competitive with our 
trading partners who are distorting the market through their 
domestic subsidy practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the safety net programs have to be repaired or made current 
to meet today's conditions.  We have seen the failure of AIDA to 
address the primary needs of many full time producers on average 
farms.  The AIDA program has not served them.  This is not a 
fault of trade.  It is a fault of the current government which is 
more worried about the budget and what the voters think in 
non-farming areas than it is about farmers who are trying to feed 
the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One pillar of the Reform Party is that we must have free and 
fair trade abroad.  It is time, as I said, for the government to 
launch a concerted action to reduce and eventually eliminate 
foreign subsidies.  I know our negotiators will talk about it in 
the trade negotiations, but what would be the matter with the 
Prime Minister getting on plane, taking probably the agriculture 
and trade ministers with him, going to Europe to meet with the 
Europeans and telling them point blank that enough is enough and 
they will fight them to the end in this regard?  That never 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, as part of the solution to the hardship 
experienced by the farmers, could reduce the costs it imposes on 
farmers out west, in Ontario, in the maritimes and in B.C.  For 
instance, the four cent federal excise tax on every litre of fuel 
adds up to a lot of money.  Many of us still tend to think in 
terms of gallons.  If we multiply that by five it amounts to 20 
to 30 cents cents a gallon which farmers are paying.  A tractor 
running in a field burning up 20 gallons an hour soon runs up to 
a lot of money.  Our government could be taking action in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could help farmers if we would look at letting them do more 
value added.  We have the case of prairie pasta producers who are 
trying to pull themselves up by their bootstraps by further 
processing their durum wheat into pasta flour and products.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that the Canadian Wheat Board says that it is 
the controller on behalf of the federal Government of Canada of 
the wheat trade in the country and that farmers will either deal 
with the board or be thrown in jail, unless it happens to be 
Frank Hurley who gets a slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average farmer in Manitoba and Saskatchewan will go to jail 
under this government for selling his own wheat.  If it is the 
last thing I do before I leave this parliament, I guarantee that 
it will be a voluntary wheat board where a farmer has a choice as 
to whether or not he is in there participating and sharing in 
pooling the money he receives for his grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a minute about the movers of the motion, members 
of the NDP who aspire to be in government.  Certainly the 
Canadian public and voters do not intend to give them that 
opportunity.  To compare what the NDP has done in parliament with 
what the Reform Party has done, we only need to look at the 
Address in Reply to the Speech for the Throne.  The leader of the 
NDP said three little sentences on agriculture.  The leader of 
the opposition from the Reform Party said approximately five or 
six paragraphs with some real meat and some real understanding of 
agriculture in Canada.  That is the importance we place on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Standing Committee on Agriculture members of the Reform 
caucus presented motion after motion which initiated action and 
got inquiries going into the income crisis.  We have had supply 
day after supply day on agriculture, not on some phony trumped up 
motion on trade that sets out a manifesto for the NDP with which 
nobody else agrees.  I invite any questions that anyone might 
like to ask of me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed I 
would like to ask a question of my colleague from the Reform 
Party.  He said in his speech that any of the problems in terms 
of agriculture should rest on the heads of this government and 
the previous Conservative government.  I would like the hon. 
member to acknowledge that the Reform Party should share in some 
of the blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when members of the Reform Party arrived here in any 
significant numbers they said to the government that they opposed 
all government subsidies for agriculture and that everything 
should be based on market driven forces.  I submit to the hon. 
member from Manitoba that the situation is a result of these 
programs.  The finance minister over there put on his Cheshire 
cat grin and asked how much Reformers would like him to cut. 
Indeed the government has cut programs by about 60%, three times 
more than it was required to in 1993.  I would submit that was 
done because it wanted the deficit eliminated as fast as 
possible.  The Reform Party was sitting over here, the only party 
with official party status from English Canada at the time, and 
the government could not do it fast enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member stand in his place and agree that the 
Reform Party has contributed directly to the agricultural crisis 
that is happening right now in western Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Palliser is once again dead wrong on his interpretation of what 
he thinks he heard during the 1993 election.  Certainly the 
Reform Party never ever said that there would not be programs in 
place to keep the field level for international competition 
between our farmers and other farmers.  That misrepresentation is 
just the same as when the NDP goes around trying to say that the 
Reform Party will get rid of medicare or health care, that it 
will wreck health care and it will be gone forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all ran in the last election.  NDP members went around saying 
that kind of garbage and the voters sent back 60 Reformers and 18 
or 19 NDPers.  I do not think the interpretation of the Reform 
platform in the last election, or in the election of 1993, 
contributed in any what whatsoever to the Liberal government 
taking virtually all the domestic support away from the farmers 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the government is trying to replace it now on the same 
old ad hoc basis it has been using since the start of 
Confederation. 
When there is a problem it tries to figure out something in a 
hurry.  It comes up with details and criteria which do not work 
because it has not had time to put any thought into it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is saying “Mr. and Mrs. Voter, give us a chance and we 
will come up with the long term programs”.  We will make sure 
that Canada can compete with other countries around the world. We 
will free Canadians so they can do business without as much 
government interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite everyone to compare the NDP platform with what we 
have done here in Ottawa on behalf of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is way ahead in asking questions in the House on 
agriculture.  When I look at the opportunity to use supply day 
motions to discuss agriculture issues, Reform is way ahead. 
Which party was it that moved for an emergency debate on the 
grain handlers crisis?  It was Reform.  The Reform Party got the 
debate going, but then we learned that a settlement had been 
reached during the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of action we need in Ottawa.  Reformers take 
the bull by the horns and show all other opposition parties, 
including the NDP, what can be done in moving this country 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to take part in the debate on the NDP 
motion.  I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Perth—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the level of consultation that has 
been held between the Government of Canada and various groups, 
such as that which has become known as the civil society and many 
other non-governmental organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada prepares to head into multilateral trade negotiations 
and as it continues regional trade negotiations for the FTAA, the 
Government of Canada has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to 
seek the views of Canadians on the scope, content and process of 
these negotiations.  Indeed it has just completed the most 
comprehensive consultation ever undertaken on this topic in 
Canada.  We intend to continue this dialogue throughout the 
course of these trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before describing to the House the extent of these 
consultations, I would like to emphasize that, from an 
international perspective, Canada is on the cutting edge of 
public consultations where trade negotiations are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In international fora it is clear to other countries that we are 
very informed about the wide variety of views which exist in 
Canada concerning the international trade negotiating agenda and 
that we are being very aggressive in taking every opportunity to 
listen and respond to public concerns about this agenda.  I am 
proud to state that these consultations represent Canadian 
democracy in action, a democracy that is dynamic and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has pursued consultations in a wide 
variety of ways.  We have sought public submissions on trade 
policy issues through a Canada </I>Gazette<I> notice and opened a 
new trade negotiations website to provide information and papers 
on the trade agenda.  We are also using this site as a location 
for reporting on our consultations with Canadians.  This strategy 
has put us at the forefront of using new information technology 
to communicate with Canadians and we are extremely pleased to be 
deepening our connection with Canadians in this new medium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade asked the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade to undertake 
cross-country hearings to elicit public comments and views on 
trade issues.  The committee produced a very comprehensive and 
informative report.  The government will be formally tabling its 
response to the report on November 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also continued to consult with the business sector to 
identify our trading priorities.  This consultation is taking 
place through the sectoral advisory groups on international 
trade.  We are working very closely with the provinces in 
developing our trade negotiating positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very pleased that seven provincial trade ministers will 
accompany the Canadian government to the WTO ministerial meeting 
in December.  Furthermore, we have conducted 26 separate 
consultation sessions on the issues of government procurement, 
investment and competition policy.  These consultations, 
organized in close co-operation with provincial government trade 
representatives and senior trade commissioners in each region, 
attracted more than 300 participants across Canada from a total 
of 1,040 invitations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sessions met the government's objectives to build 
constructive links to and promote a dialogue with representatives 
of civil society on trade and investment related issues across 
Canada; to bring to the discussions a broad spectrum of 
stakeholders representing environmental, human rights and labour 
interests, as well as members of the business community; and to 
advance further substantive discussions with these stakeholders 
to ensure that Canadians' priorities and interests on these 
issues are reflected in the new round of WTO negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear from these consultations that there exist differing 
levels of expertise on trade and investment issues represented 
among stakeholders.  However, regardless of their level of 
knowledge, participants emphasized a need for continued, direct 
exchanges with expert stakeholders, and particularly with 
representatives of the federal government.  We are committed to 
providing this contact and to ensuring that the process whereby 
our negotiating position is developed is as transparent as it can 
possibly be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, in the next stage of our consultations leading up 
to the Seattle ministerial meeting the government will continue 
to work to expand productive working relationships with civil 
society stakeholders, develop focused and responsive public 
information and outreach activities to broaden these contacts, 
respond to the anticipated increase in stakeholder requests for 
information on the government's position on trade and investment, 
and lay the foundation for deeper and more strategic involvement 
of knowledgeable stakeholder groups that have the capacity and 
the credibility to champion federal consultation initiatives on 
trade and investment issues within their respective communities 
following Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effectiveness of our consultations with Canadians can be 
measured in terms of the enunciation of Canada's overall 
negotiating objectives and priorities.  We want to ensure that 
the lives of Canadians are improved through better access to 
global markets and through predictable and enforceable rules 
governing trade.  We also want to ensure that these rules help 
protect the fabric of Canadian society and fundamental Canadian 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the extensive and ongoing consultation process 
that I have just described contributes very positively to these 
overall negotiating objectives and priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to make a contribution to today's 
debate.  It is a significant event for us to talk about the 
success stories of the past, beginning with the team Canada visit 
to Japan, the benefits of the Chile-Canada free trade agreement 
and the objectives of Canada and other world trade members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the motion, it is apparent that hon. members 
opposite are prepared to turn back the clock in a world that has 
evidently left them far behind.  However, I must say that is not 
true for all members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Government of Canada has pursued greater 
trade liberalization.  Unlike that which the hon. members would 
have us believe, the government has been responsible and 
democratic in its pursuit of greater trade liberalization for the 
benefit of the overall Canadian economy and the agriculture and 
agri-food sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canada is a trading nation that relies on international 
trade to the extent of 40% of its gross domestic product.  Could 
we imagine what it would be like without that, or with half of 
that?  Canada is no longer a country comprised of hewers of wood 
and drawers of water.  The world has become smaller and we live 
in a global economy.  I say to hon. members, welcome to the 
future because the future is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall in the agriculture and agri-food sector farmers have 
adjusted to a constantly changing international market.  Their 
success is obvious when looking at our export numbers. 
Agriculture exports have risen from $13 billion to $22 billion 
over the past five years.  Even with the economic challenges of 
the past year, they were up slightly from 1997, which was a 
record year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade is important to the growth of the sector.  About half of 
the average Canadian farm gate income is the result of trade. 
That is why this government is committed to working on the 
international front to bring order and stability to the world 
marketplace and provide better access to world markets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the commodity market challenges, the outlook of Canada's 
agriculture and agri-food sector is positive.  The Canadian 
agriculture and agri-food industry has also met the evolving 
demand for specialized food products.  Our exports of value added 
goods and processed products are surging.  In fact they grew by 
almost 9% last year.  Processed goods mean processing plant 
investment and jobs, jobs which add to the sustainability of our 
rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should not just take my word for it.  The industry 
itself has a lot of confidence in its own capabilities on the 
world market.  Already Canada has about 3.3% of the world's 
agri-food trade, and the Canadian Agri-Food Marketing Council, or 
CAMC, which is made up of agriculture and agri-food industry 
representatives, has set a goal to increase that to 4% by the 
year 2005.  It has also set a target for increasing processed 
agricultural exports over and above bulk commodity exports.  By 
all current indications there is no reason to think this goal 
will not be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of opportunity out there.  The European Union, 
for instance, is the world's largest market for agri-food 
products.  Ten of the world's top 12 food retailers are based 
there.  I believe it is obvious why we have to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are trade distortions that exist among our trading 
partners, especial in the EU.  Achieving substantial reductions 
in these disparities is a key objective for Canadian producers 
and exporters.  That is why the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food will be aggressively seeking greater world markets 
abroad for our products at the World Trade Organization talks, 
which will be launched at a ministerial meeting in Seattle at the 
end of this month.  He will be pressing hard for reductions in 
domestic subsidies and the elimination of exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member has five minutes left, and 
five minutes of questions and comments.  However, I thought this 
would be a good time to split the speech.  You will be our first 
speaker when we return to debate after question period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
Remembrance Day we will pay tribute to the Canadians who fell in 
war throughout the century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we pause to remember, we would do well to recall that war 
affects not just those on the front lines but also those left at 
home to cope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second world war, for every Canadian in uniform there 
were 10 serving at home on the home front.  They worked the farms 
and factories.  They gave blood, collected scrap, planted victory 
gardens and bought victory bonds.  They suffered privations and 
rationing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout it all, they worried and prayed for their sons and 
daughters, husbands and wives waiting in fear for that dreaded 
telegram that would begin “We regret to inform you—”. It was 
a tremendous time of sacrifice but of great spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 11, we will remember those who sacrificed all so 
that we in this world would be rid of the forces of oppression 
and tyranny.  They would be proud of the nation that their 
children built and merely ask us to remember them still.  We 
pledge to do this forever.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I had the pleasure to 
attend a conference on trade corridors held in Niagara Falls. 
People came from across the continent to discuss ways Canada and 
the United States can more efficiently transport the $1.5 billion 
of goods that cross the border every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 70% of these goods travel by road, everyone acknowledged 
the need to upgrade the highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American government is pumping over $200 billion into its 
highway system over a six year period; that is 90% of the money 
it collects in fuel taxes. Contrast this to the federal Liberals 
who, despite collecting over $4.5 billion in fuel taxes a year, 
put only a pathetic $150 million back into Canada's roads; that 
is only 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade has been a major factor in Canada's economic recovery.  It 
is time the Liberals put some of that money back into roads 
instead of ripping off the taxpayers yet again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, over 1,000 transitional jobs fund grants were handed out 
by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one grant in all of Canada was put into a trust fund.  That 
one grant was handled improperly in order to help a failing 
company in the Prime Minister's riding.  It was given unusual 
treatment that ignored not just treasury board guidelines, but 
actually broke the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this grant in the Prime Minister's riding treated 
differently than all the other grants in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

approval process was undertaken in this regard. The department 
did the due diligence on the opportunity.  The stakeholders 
reviewed the information and recommended investment. No moneys 
flowed until the approval process was completed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the facts say otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The games that were played with transitional jobs fund money in 
the Prime Minister's riding border on the bizarre.  Millions of 
dollars were doled out to recipients with a track record of 
business failure, with shady pasts including criminal records, 
and with close business and political ties to the Prime Minister. 
Now add to that an illegal trust fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it in the Prime Minister's riding that all the rules and 
even the law get broken? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in administering the fund the department 
chose an inappropriate method.  It set up trust funds. In May of 
this year that inappropriateness was deemed to be true.  In June 
a directive was issued.  The trust funds were closed.  That has 
been done.  The trust funds have been closed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that must be a pretty recent development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone eventually got $1.19 million from the suspect trust 
fund.  That someone was Claude Gauthier who had already purchased 
land from the Prime Minister's golf course and donated $10,000 to 
the Prime Minister's election campaign.  Soon after the business 
now being run by Gauthier got the money, it laid off all but 62 
of the original 115 employees for a net job loss of 53 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this grant did not create jobs, was it simply a thank you 
to the Prime Minister's friend?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The approval process was done appropriately.  No moneys flowed 
until the approval process was complete.  The inappropriate 
management of funds was identified.  Directives were given to 
close the trust funds.  That has been completed.

us just go over this again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was only one job creation grant in the entire country that 
ended up in a trust fund.  That trust fund proved to be illegal. 
It happened in only one place.  That was in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  It benefited only one person.  That one person was 
Claude Gauthier, a man who bought $500,000 of the Prime 
Minister's golf course, who gave $10,000 to the Prime Minister's 
personal re-election campaign and went on to receive a $6 million 
CIDA government contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
this:  Will she now do the right thing and launch a full 
independent inquiry to see how this mess could have ever happened 
in the Prime Minister's riding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have done the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We followed the appropriate approval process.  When we 
discovered that the administrative method to manage the moneys 
was inappropriate, we closed the trust fund.  Most important, 
there are jobs in the riding.  People are working.  In a riding 
of extremely high unemployment, transitional job funds are there 
to help provide sustainable jobs for Canadians.  That is the 
important point here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the human resources minister told the House during 
question period that everything was fine, that there was no 
problem.  Fifteen minutes later she was outside talking to the 
media saying maybe there was a bit of a problem.  In fact, the 
trust fund was illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dozens of jobs were lost during this whole fiasco.  In the 
meantime, $1 million was spent, laundered through this trust 
fund, in order to give it to the only riding in the country, one 
riding in the entire country, the Prime Minister's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers deserve an answer.  When will they get an answer that 
satisfies them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing inappropriate was done in terms of the administration of 
the approval process.  It was done in an appropriate fashion. 
When we discovered that the choice of administrative management 
of the use of trust funds was inappropriate, we directed the 
department to close the trust fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important is that Canadians who very desperately needed 
jobs are working.  That is the point of this project.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET SURPLUS

<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance is congratulating himself on forecasting a 
surplus of $95 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given his cuts to health, education and income support, it is 
hard to understand what he is happy about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance admit that, if he were to return 
the $3.7 billion to the provinces, it would be a huge amount for 
them, while it is a small part of the surplus for the federal 
government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
made it very clear in my economic statement in London that the 
five year private sector forecasts were only projections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, yesterday I told the Bloc Quebecois 
leader that, last year, the federal government transferred $11.5 
billion strictly for health over a five year period.  At the 
same time, Quebec alone received $1.4 billion in equalization 
payments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
someone stole $44 from me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I hope we are not going to use the 
word “steal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> —and gave me back $11, what he has done is 
take $33 away from me.  This is exactly what the minister has 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than butting into provincial jurisdictions with new 
programs that are none of his business, would he not do better 
to give back to the provinces the money he took from them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> New programs, Mr. 
Speaker?  New programs like the infrastructure program, which 
was developed by our government in partnership with the 
provinces, and which the provinces wanted to have? New programs 
like Technology Partnerships Canada, under which 33% of the 
funding goes to Quebec? New programs like the Canadian 
Foundation for Innovation, which is funding all the research and 
development in Quebec universities and hospitals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are doing.

the Prime Minister is asking us to let him take advantage of a 
$95 billion surplus, the people are suffering because of rapidly 
deteriorating health systems and educational systems that are 
crying out for reinvestment of the money to which the Minister 
of Finance has been helping himself for the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Minister of Finance not commit to return to the 
provinces what has been cut from transfer payments, rather than 
getting ready to make new expenditures in areas that come under 
their jurisdiction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
give an example of transfer payments, since we became the 
government, for the Province of Quebec alone there have been in 
excess of $80 billion in transfer payments, that is equalization 
payments and the social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and above that, there have been $30 billion paid out in 
equalization payments since we took office.  That is real money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
the Minister of Finance is not saying is that he took away $33 
billion from the provinces' funding for education, health and 
social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking him whether he is aware of the havoc he has wrought 
in the schools, in the hospitals, in the poorest families?  Does 
he realize this?  If he does, is he not ashamed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
have just said, last year we transferred $11.5 billion over a 
five-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I am asking the hon. member is this: is the PQ 
government prepared to give back to the municipalities the money 
it has cut from them?

finally woke up to the farm crisis.  Who knows, the Liberals 
might wake up to farm crisis soon as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the government listened to Reform, cut our 
farmers loose and now expects them to compete against the 
European and U.S. treasuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government believe that a tiny fraction of the $1.3 
billion needed is anything but an affront to prairie farm 
families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is new money on top of $900 million that the federal 
government has put on the table this year.  That makes a total of 
close to $1.1 billion.  We are preoccupied; the minister is 
working very hard to find a solution.  We are looking at what 
will be the net income of these farmers at the end of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were numbers that came out in anticipation in July, but of 
course in July they did not know what was to be the crop.  By 
October they knew exactly and it has been a good crop.  Now 
everyone is filing their applications. The program will apply.  I 
hope that the program will be sufficient to meet the needs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister does not get it.  The government does not get it. 
What is needed is an immediate infusion of $1.3 billion to keep 
the family farm from dying. What does the government come up 
with?  Less than one-tenth of that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a patient who needs a transfusion, needs 10 units of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are absolutely not doing that.  On the contrary, I 
explained to the House a minute ago that it is $1.1 billion that 
the federal government put on the table this year, plus the 
contribution of 40% of that amount from the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an agreement that we have developed with the provinces to 
try to cope with this type of problem.  Now the farmers are 
making their applications.  They are being processed.  Those who 
qualify will receive the money as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very preoccupied but the reality is that we have to know 
all the facts.  Some of the requests were based on figures from 
July that had changed—

these very important millennium scholarships can be available to

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember last year being invited to a school in the early part

in that campaign, she had gotten to know him through the many 
stories told by her grandmother.  She said:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Until such time that I am able to so, I wonder, would someone

for its price paid for world peace with the blood of its young as 
100,000 moved forth at Vimy Ridge in 1917.  A majestic memorial 
defying real description stands on French soil to honour our 
soldiers' supreme effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dawn soon broke on the beaches of Normandy with the silhouette 
of total war painted across its horizon.  With 1,000 allied ships 
poised for action, D-Day had arrived in 1944.  The tranquil 
shores bore witness to an invasion force of allied might that 
struck a death blow to Nazi tyranny bringing about Europe's 
freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon a minute atom vaporized Hirohito's will for war.  The death 
clouds scarcely fade dissipating 100,000 souls as the Korean war 
loomed in the ominous shadow of nuclear might. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price tag of peace in this violent century has been war, and 
has been so very high with 110,000 Canadian war dead.  We must 
learn from the harsh truths of wars past so that we not repeat 
humanity's mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History records the poppy as a symbol of earthly life, until a 
day in Flanders, when from the fields of war, Lt. Col. John 
McCrae penned verse of remembrance for Canada's war dead.  He 
spoke for all who have faced their soul in the finality of the 
theatre of war, whether Korea, the gulf or the two world wars. He 
could well be speaking of all brave men who have soldiered the 
world for Canadian beliefs.  His words are carved on the walls of 
this House and are as enduring as the threat of future war: “If 
he break faith with us who die, we shall not sleep”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our honourable war veterans and remembered war dead, we 
pause today to give our respect.  We will not forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Europe at the 11th hour of the 11th day of November 1918, 
buglers announced the armistice along hundreds of kilometres of 
bloody and muddy trenches separating the two warring sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of men came up out of the muddy trenches, able to 
breathe fresh air at last without fearing that this might be 
their last breath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were then able to go home to their families with the 
satisfaction of a job well done.  Not only had they saved their 
homes and their freedom, but they were also convinced that they 
were responsible for putting an end to such butchery, by winning 
“the war to end all wars” as it was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions more, however, laid to rest under wooden crosses, did 
not get up and go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we honour both those who gave their lives and those who 
were prepared to give their lives to defend our values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alas, “the war to end all wars” was not to be the last after 
all, as we know.  We also honour today the children of those 
first soldiers, who shouldered their kit-bags and marched off to 
a second and even bloodier war 21 years after the first, to 
fight for their country and for freedom again threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget all those who fell in Korea, in the United 
Nations' struggle against yet another incarnation of tyranny, 
that two-headed hydra so known to our century. 
Finally, 55 years after the Second World War, it seems that we 
are finally thinking of another group. 
Let us gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the merchant 
seamen who, during four years, braved U-boat infested waters, 
risking their lives to bring weapons and ammunition to their 
comrades in arms to ensure the victory.

the air they breathe, but they were passed on by the sacrifices 
so many of their parents and grandparents paid for with their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with great honour and humility that I rise on behalf of the 
New Democratic Party to mark Remembrance Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 80 years ago from this coming Remembrance Day, the terrible 
guns of the first world war fell silent on the 11th hour of the 
11th day of the 11th month.  Unfortunately, that was the end to 
only one horrible chapter in a century that has been the most 
violent period in human history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this century in Canada alone, something like 1.5 million 
young Canadians have volunteered to serve in our military and 
merchant navy.  More than 116,000 gave their lives in World War 
I, World War II, Korea and in other conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking personally, I note with pride that both my father and 
my grandfather were among those volunteers, in the Royal Canadian 
Navy and the 1st Canadian Mounted Rifles respectively.  They were 
fortunate to be able to return to their families.  Others were 
not so fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with great respect and sadness, we recognize the ultimate 
sacrifice offered by those who were killed and the terrible pain 
of loss and separation suffered by their loved ones and friends 
who saw them no more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remembrance Day is marked to ensure we never forget those who 
gave their lives for all of us, those who survived but were 
willing to give their lives, and those who though they returned 
had already given the best years of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember those who were taken as prisoners of war and who 
suffered terribly.  As someone from Winnipeg, I am particularly 
mindful of those from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 
Winnipeg who were captured at Dieppe or those of the Winnipeg 
Grenadiers who were captured during the fall of Hong Kong. Every 
Canadian city has similar stories to tell, and sadly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, let all of us in the House hope that soon we will 
achieve complete justice for our merchant navy veterans.  Let all 
of us in the House find ways to finally recognize those Canadians 
who fought fascism in Spain.  Let all of us in the House, as 
Aboriginal Veterans Day approaches, remember the 7,000 aboriginal 
Canadians who served in two world wars and Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let all of us in the House give thanks on this day for the 
continuing service of so many veterans through their 
participation in the very important work and activities of the 
Royal Canadian Legion and other veteran's organizations.  We urge 
all Canadians to observe the two minute wave of silence being 
promoted by the Legion on November 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let all of us in the House also remember on this day those many 
Canadians who have served as peacekeepers and peacemakers in far 
off corners of the world.  They also put their lives on the line 
for peace and we hope they are the only kind of veterans we will 
ever have in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as a parent, I believe Remembrance Day must always be 
addressed to our youth and our future.  It is now their lives we 
need to protect through remembering war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything, let Remembrance Day give all of us more strength 
and vigour in working for peaceful and democratic solutions 
wherever humanly possible so that after a century, where not just 
military but civilian casualties have put the human race to 
shame, we can enter the new century with new hope for a peaceful 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to pay our 
respects to all of our men and women who, in World War I, World 
War II, Korea and through peacekeeping, have laid down their 
lives and have served to make this the most wonderful country in 
which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Thursday, November 11, all Canadians will be called upon to 
pause for not one minute but a two minute silence.  I trust that 
we will have a lot of our young people at the cenotaphs so that 
they will understand the sacrifices that were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Charlotte County and I were flown down to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The young scouts in that little town did a lot of research, 
along with the Royal Canadian Legion and the veterans 
association, to find all of the graves in Grand Manan that were 
there for the veterans. The scouts laid little Canadian flags. It 
was truly very moving. It was beautiful to see those young men 
and young girls as they stood and showed their respect for some 
of their relatives and others who were not related to them who 
had made the tremendous sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had the privilege along with some of my colleagues from 
both sides of the House to go to Dieppe, France.  I will never 
forget it.  We looked at the promenade and there was a Canadian 
flag at the top of every one of the buildings.  Children came up 
to us and pointed to the little Canada pins we were wearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will never forget the sacrifices that our people 
made for you and me and for everyone in the House.  We went into 
the harbour and I could not believe that our men and women had 
gone on boats into that harbour.  It was like a mountain on each 
side and there was nowhere for them to go.  Of course, Mr. 
Speaker, as you and I and everyone here knows, tremendous 
sacrifices were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I recognize these gentlemen who are in the gallery today, 
our merchant mariners.  I praise and thank God that they are 
finally recognized as the fourth arm of the armed forces, our 
army, navy, air force and merchant mariners.  They laid down 
their lives.  Many of them never came back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all my colleagues when we leave here this week to go back 
to our communities that we make sure all of our people understand 
that they must get out and show the respect, that they bow their 
heads and that they hold that two minute silence to show the 
respect that all of our veterans deserve in this wonderful 
country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall always remember them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is it irony that today we have our 
veterans, who I am going to introduce in just a minute, our 
merchant seamen and our artists and our writers, all in this 
House, the House of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to introduce the representatives of the various arms 
and some veterans and where they served.  At the end of it, we 
are going to stand as a House, indeed I hope as a nation, for two 
minutes of silence as was asked of us by many members of this 
House and by our own Canadian legion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I name these wonderful men and women, the veterans, the 
mariners and our artists, I want all of them at the end of these 
tributes today to join with us in Room 216 where we can meet them 
and spend some time with all of them together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of hon. members to the presence of the

stand.  I would ask my colleagues to withhold any applause until 
I have introduced everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a veteran with us from the first world war, Paul 
Métivier.  Paul, I hope you do not mind if I tell my colleagues 
that you are 99 years young.  Please remain standing if you can, 
sir.  If not, it is all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have with us Mr. Ken Cavers, a navy veteran of the 
second world war who served on North Atlantic convoy runs aboard 
corvettes, first HMCS </I>Hespeler<I> and later HMCS

almost four years as a prisoner of war; Mrs. Leena Jacques, who 
was a nursing sister in the second world war; Mr. Philip Jacques, 
who served with the Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders in 
the second world war and also served in Korea; Mr. Bert Harper, a 
CANLOAN officer during the second world war who served with the 
British forces in our name; Mr. Harold True, a veteran of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is a question I have asked the government House leader 
before but since I last asked him this question, there have been 
some developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that at one point the government was going to bring in 
legislation having to do with the regulation of reproductive 
technologies and that fell by the wayside.  Since then, 
particularly in recent weeks, we have seen developments with 
respect to the commercial sale of human eggs, et cetera.  I 
wonder whether this has now prompted the government to speed up 
its schedule and whether or not there is any legislation coming 
forward in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am not sure 
whether this is an appropriate question to be given to the 
government House leader but the government House leader may wish 
to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the best information I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am not exactly

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has a unified position that reflects the trade 
interests of the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector as a 
whole across all commodities and across all regions, which is 
hardly a very undemocratic system. 
It is very democratic.  This position will allow Canada to play a 
strong and active role in influencing the direction and eventual 
outcome of the important upcoming negotiations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the upcoming negotiations Canada and other countries will be 
looking to build on the WTO agreement in agriculture signed in 
1994.  We made real progress in the Uruguay round, bringing the 
world agriculture trade under a multilateral rules based system 
for the first time.  Canada has reaped the benefits.  The Uruguay 
round was a good start at decreasing distortions which 
characterized trade back in the 1980s, but much remains to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently our farmers are faced with some of the lowest 
commodity prices seen for a long time.  A worldwide problem of 
oversupply in some commodities has been aggravated by limited 
market access and prolonged by the persistent use of some export 
subsidies and trade distorting domestic support of some of our 
major trading partners, particularly the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has also responded to low world prices with 
increasingly large payments to its farmers, further widening the 
disparity between the amount of assistance provided by the U.S. 
and EU and the assistance provided by other countries.  It is not 
clear that these additional subsidies are helping U.S. farmers 
since there appears to be just as many concerns expressed by 
American farmers as there are with our farmers about low prices 
and low incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes our efforts at the international negotiating table 
all the more critical.  Taking a strong position at the WTO to 
lower subsidies and enforce the rules that are agreed to is one 
leg of our strategy to deal with the farm income situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's initial negotiating position gives Canada an 
authoritative agenda, endorsed by industry and provinces, to work 
to level the playing field internationally for Canadian producers 
and exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key component of this work is to have all agriculture export 
subsidies completely eliminated as quickly as possible.  We will 
also be calling for substantial reductions in domestic support 
programs that distort production and trade, and for an overall 
limit on domestic support of all kinds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be looking for improvements in market access, 
particularly for food products.  Food products are leading the 
surge in growth in world agriculture trade.  The Canadian 
industry has increased its emphasis on these new demands to 
capture new markets while preserving and enhancing existing 
markets in our traditional bulk exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will work to preserve our right to choose how to market 
our agricultural products.  This includes preserving our orderly 
marketing systems such as the Canadian Wheat Board and supply 
management for dairy and poultry products.  With this position 
Canada will play a strong and active role in influencing the 
direction and eventual outcome of these important World Trade 
Organization negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not alone in its position either.  There is much 
support internationally for the elimination of export subsidies. 
There has been much progress in bilateral negotiations with the 
United States for a more unified position.  The Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has been diligent in pushing the U.S. 
secretary of agriculture to pursue a course which will allow us 
to build on our common goals and best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 21 APEC countries as well as members of the Cairns group, 
which comprises 15 like minded agricultural exporting countries 
such as Australia, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina, have all 
agreed that we should seek the elimination of export subsidies 
which are so detrimental to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a leading player in Cairns and is working closely with 
other member countries to ensure that the WTO negotiations are 
launched quickly and cleanly so our common objectives can be met 
sooner rather than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture recently hosted a meeting of Quint, 
an informal group of ministers that includes Australia, Japan, 
the EU and the United States.  At that meeting earlier this fall 
all ministers agreed on the urgency of the WTO negotiations.  Our 
work with Cairns and Quint also allows us to pursue our goal of 
reducing and eliminating trade distorting subsidies on a variety 
of fronts and provides Canada with a greater influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has confidence in the ability of our 
producers to compete in a world marketplace.  As producers they 
have confidence in themselves.  We are laying the groundwork to 
ensure our trading partners enter the WTO negotiations with a 
commitment to a smooth launch, steadfast negotiations and 
meaningful results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the WTO negotiations proceed, the federal government will 
continue with the partnership approach that led to the 
development of a unified national negotiating position by 
ensuring that the industry and provinces are consulted closely 
throughout the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a team effort by the federal government, the provincial 
governments and industry as we seek greater access to more 
markets and a level playing field.  Increased access to world 
markets means new opportunities for Canadian producers and 
processors, Canadian skills, Canadian research, and Canadian 
innovation and technology. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, all day I 
have been listening to members of the Liberal Party say how 
wonderful free trade has been for the country, but I have not 
noticed the price of bread or milk, the price of clothes or the 
price of a vehicle go down.  Prices have not gone down.  They 
have gone up. The income of the average family has gone down. 
Wages have gone down.  Teenagers in Yukon earn less than what I 
earned 20 years ago at minimum wage jobs.  The minimum wage keeps 
people below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep hearing how good free trade is.  What free trade has 
meant is that agribusiness can buy its wheat from Argentina 
cheaper than it can from Canadians, so we push our farmers right 
under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the businesses that we are supposed to support so that 
they can invest in other countries, does that mean that Canadian 
workers will be lining up to go to work in Mexico for pennies a 
day?  Just what are these benefits?  As a person who has been at 
home with my family for 15 years before I came here, it was not 
easy to get by.  I earned less money as an adult than I did as a 
teenager with the changes under free trade.  Could the hon. 
member explain more clearly what are the benefits to the average 
family? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly it is very 
evident the growth in employment in Canada directly resulted 
because of our export industry seeking new fields and buyers and 
producing quality products.  We are at the highest level of 
employment in the history of Canada for the moment.  That is a 
celebration.  That is something that members of the New 
Democratic Party should salute once in a while instead of looking 
at the bare bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is so important in this kind of relationship 
is that we are doing it in a rules based operation with 
opportunities to grieve issues as they arise that do not comply 
with the rules based trading rules of the WTO.  There is a point 
where we may think we are being wronged.  We try to make use of 
that like any other member of the WTO.  It is rules based. 
Everyone who breaks the rules is called on to justify the 
rationale or accept the punishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good news story.  Implementing new programs is shied 
away from by people who are shy about getting in on the activity, 
but that is what is happening in the world.  We are in the game 
and we are in the game in a big way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to take part in this debate on the 
whole question of the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably, my remarks will focus on agriculture and all the 
possible repercussions of the WTO negotiations scheduled to 
begin late this month or early in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I became aware of the importance of international trade in April 
1998, when I took part in a meeting of the Cairns Group, which 
gave me a bit of an idea of where Canada stood. 
As members know, the Cairns Group is made up of about 15 
countries with a much more trade-oriented philosophy.  A great 
deal has been said about market access, but we seem to be 
forgetting fundamental things like the environment or social 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I attended the 10th meeting of the Inter-American 
Board of Agriculture.  Thirty-four countries from the three 
Americas were present at this meeting in Salvador, in the state 
of Bahia in Brazil.  Here again, I saw that the program under 
which countries would normally be starting negotiations was far 
from ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, we are seeing tensions developing between various 
growth poles in the world. 
For example, we were able to see firsthand that more and more 
Brazil is taking an aggressive approach and becoming an economic 
player that wants to impose its views on South American 
countries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, Brazil is a member of the Cairns Group. Its 
philosophy is also very trade-oriented and it tends to ignore 
major priorities in the context of WTO negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tension runs so high that, last week, WTO's ambassador in 
Geneva, Nestor Osorio, could not participate in the meetings 
held in Brazil because of problems with setting an agenda and 
getting WTO negotiations under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is currently as follows: The United States, Brazil 
and several North American countries are refusing to include the 
concept of multifunctionality proposed by the European Union. 
This is very embarrassing for the WTO ambassador, because 
negotiations are at an impasse. It is very difficult to set an 
agenda and to clearly indicate what issues will be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Canada's role in all this? What will it do? Canada 
should be a model, a unifier, or a moderator. We still do not 
know what its status will be. Yet, this is a unique opportunity 
for Canada to act as a leader in the integration of the three 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, two trade powers seem to be emerging, 
Brazil and the United States. However, Canada could readily play 
the role of moderator-facilitator, intervening with either the 
United States or Brazil to get them to understand the importance 
in the context of negotiation of having a grasp of all the 
concepts which could help advance the issue worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I shall touch on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or the 
Canada food police if members prefer, that wonderful propaganda 
agency, which guarantees to other countries that food is Canada 
Proof, while systematically refusing within the country to 
provide elected representatives with information on such 
important issues as genetically modified foods when asked. 
What is one's reaction supposed to be when one contacts the food 
agency and is told “Contact Access to Information and pay for 
it”.  That is why I call the agency the Canada food police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask questions on the agency here in the House, I can just 
hear the minister answering “Mr. Speaker, you know, this is an 
independent agency. I would not like to be accused by the 
government of interfering in the internal workings of an 
agency”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, MPs still have no answers, and the public has no 
answers.  The issue of food inspection control is so vital that, 
last week again, in Salvador and Brazil, there was much 
discussion of the whole issue of GMOs, which will be on the 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does Canada fit in all this?  Despite numerous speeches by 
my colleague from Louis-Hébert, there is no way of knowing. 
However, the recent throne speech gave me a few shivers.  There 
is a little sentence in it that indicates quite clearly where 
the Liberal government is headed, and I will read it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will protect the health of Canadians by 
strengthening Canada's food safety program, by taking further 
action on environment health issues, including the potential 
health risks presented by pesticides, and by modernizing overall 
health protection for a changing world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It means that the government is preparing 
to create a super agency to include health, environment and food 
issues. We will again have a hard time in this House getting 
information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protests are so strong that the government has decided to 
back up with the bill it introduced in the last session, Bill 
C-80. But we know its intentions. I am sure they will come back 
later one with a more biting offensive to impose Bill C-80 and 
the new agency on us in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the creation of this super agency mean?  It will house 
all the disciplines required to control information and will 
Canada, abroad, to show its “Canada approved” seal more, a seal 
that here will become “Ottawa controlled”. 
The government will not just be controlling the information 
coming from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, but all the 
information having to do with food, health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my speech, I intended to 
concentrate more on the issue of agriculture, which will be the 
focus of concerns when WTO negotiations begin, possibly in late 
November or early December, in Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the meeting, it should be noted, is to agree on 
an agenda and negotiations, which will then begin in earnest, 
and move to Geneva, where they may go on for months and months, 
if not years. The whole issue of trade will be up for 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers, all the stakeholders in the agricultural community, 
need to know, to be informed and, last March, with this in mind 
and with the help of the member for Louis-Hébert and the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, I organized a symposium to look at this 
whole issue and really inform people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was attended by 125 people. They all left better informed 
but, at the same time, more worried, because they can see that 
the Canadian government does not have the necessary leadership 
to defend them in WTO talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is better placed than Quebec to defend the interests of 
farmers?  As members know, Quebec is unique in Canada.  We have 
two completely different income security systems.  We have a 
broadly diversified agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if the government really wants to be consistent in all the 
partnership ideas that it has been promoting since the beginning 
of the session, it should give a seat to the Quebec government, 
so that Quebec's elected officials can closely follow WTO 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the Canadian government to ensure that other countries 
do their homework. As things stand, the Canadian government has 
fulfilled most of the commitments it made during the Uruguay 
Round of negotiations. However, countries such as the United 
States, the European Community and Japan have not yet fulfilled 
theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked here in this House that when the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Minister for International 
Trade travel to Seattle later this month they demand, before 
negotiations begin, that their trading partners do their 
homework and comply with the commitments they made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the situation is very distorted. Let us take a look. 
The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Bob 
Friesen, who was here this morning and who once again deplored 
the whole federal income security system, says that Ottawa went 
too far and that Canada reduced subsidies beyond what was 
expected of it. Mr. Friesen claims that Ottawa could do much 
more for farmers without violating trade agreements.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some figures. For each dollar received by Canadian 
farmers, their American and European counterparts receive $2.50, 
and this does not include the $8.6 billion in assistance that 
the United States just gave to American farmers. And Canada is 
going to agree to begin negotiations in spite of such an 
injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are more figures, which clearly demonstrate that the 
Canadian government is not standing up for our farmers. On the 
contrary, it has got down on its knees to please its trading 
partners. In 1998, the OECD estimated that total support 
provided by agricultural policies amounted to $140 U.S. per 
capita in Canada, compared to $360 U.S. in the United States and 
$380 U.S. in Europe. Again, one can see the distortion. 
One can see that Canada will arrive at the negotiation table and 
will be at a disadvantage, considering what it has already given 
up, unlike other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that the agriculture minister's argument about 
constraints imposed by the WTO does not hold. I should point out 
that following the GATT treaty signed in 1995—I have been 
referring to these signatures since the beginning—commitments 
were made by the various partners. In fact, it is during that 
meeting that the World Trade Organization was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, GATT members had to pledge to reduce their farm 
subsidies by 15%. Canada did so by giving only 50% of what it is 
allowed to give under international agreements. By contrast, the 
United States and Europe are giving 100% of what they are 
allowed to give. Again, these figures have a distorting effect 
on the current world market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers' plight in Canada and Quebec is not simply related 
to problems of subsidies.  It clearly shows the federal 
government's failure in its farm income support policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look together at the federal government's failure in the 
AIDA program.  The federal government is largely responsible for 
the present situation.  I know that the agriculture minister 
once again announced a program, earlier, but we do not know the 
terms of it, how it will be implemented or when it will take 
effect.  In the meantime, the farm crisis in the west continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of farm income, the current situation proves that 
AIDA does not work and cannot guarantee farmers a decent living 
standard.  The government cannot deny responsibility for the 
situation, and it contributes to maintaining the farm income 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said this morning, in December 1998, all parties pulled 
together to find a title for a report.  They talked about a farm 
crisis.  A crisis means specific and speedy action is necessary 
to help people.  Today, November 4, 1999, statistics continue to 
be bandied about, figures are being brought out to help people, 
but the situation is unresolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem comes from the fact that AIDA, as it stands 
today, denies benefits to a number of the producers it was 
intended to help originally.  As it now stands, the program will 
not be paying out in the next two years the $900 million the 
federal government had announced with great pomp last December. 
The government will not be able to keep its promises of 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to tell us 
how much of the $900 million has been used up.  What became of 
this money? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not want to be of more assistance to 
people in a time of crisis?  The problems with AIDA in its 
present form are many and show that the federal government does 
not really want to come to the assistance of those going through 
this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  We hear that the forms are very 
complicated, and so forth.  The answer I was given this morning 
contained a mountain of statistics. 
I would not have liked to have seen any farmers listening in at 
the agriculture committee meeting this morning. I think they 
would have gone away furious. Politicians would not have had 
much credibility with them, particularly those in the Liberal 
Party of Canada. We are told that administering a program is a 
hard task. Yet it was announced in December 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  At the time the federal government 
announced its program on December 12, 1998, the U.S. 
administration also announced a special emergency program for 
American farmers, bringing to over $5 billion the additional 
funding put into agriculture in 1998-1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite some delays, American farmers got their payments more 
promptly than their Canadian counterparts.  Here again, the 
technocracy and bureaucracy has put Quebec farmers in a position 
of weakness, less able to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time this government woke up to reality.  First of 
all, I will come back to a point I have already made: the 
federal government ought to accept the presence of 
representatives of the Government of Quebec because of their 
type of agricultural production. It is completely different from 
that of the rest of Canada.  That is the first point.  There are 
two completely different income security systems.  In some 
areas, we are more proactive.  We have a far more diversified 
agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian government has any desire to prove its 
willingness to become a reliable partner with Quebec, it must 
give Quebec a seat at the WTO meeting in Seattle, not only in 
Seattle, but throughout the negotiations, because we need to 
monitor what this government plans to do.  We need to know what 
is going to happen.  We need to be kept informed of the various 
stages to the negotiations, so as to ensure that the hard-won 
advances of Quebec agricultural producers are maintained.  As 
Bloc Quebecois MPs, my colleagues and I will defend Quebec to 
the very end.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the hon. member who just spoke would respond to a suggestion that 
Quebec, instead of being at WTO meetings in Seattle, might take 
the lead within Canada to reduce the trade barriers within the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that there is freer trade with Canada and the rest 
of the world than there is between the provinces within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member could turn his line to that and maybe Quebec 
could take a leading role in reducing trade barriers within our 
own country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand very well that 
there are difficulties between Quebec and the other provinces in 
Canada.  The government is not complying with the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it tries to accuse the Government of Quebec of being the 
bad player in this situation, I hope it carefully listened to or 
read the economic statement given yesterday by the Minister of 
Finance and the throne speech. There was talk of setting 
standards for mobility between provinces.  The government is 
still trying to establish national standards.  It is really 
having a hard time understanding the Quebec reality.

leadership.  It is up to the Liberal government to lead.  It is 
up to the Liberal government to realize that a Canadian 
Constitution exists and that each province has jurisdictions. 
It is up to the Liberal government to get out of jurisdictions 
belonging to Quebec and the other provinces and to do its job 
within its own jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will direct 
my remarks to the fourth paragraph of today's motion which reads 
in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government should take action to remedy its over-zealous 
and irresponsible pursuit of greater trade liberalization, which 
has caused extreme hardship for Canadian farmers, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opposition motion takes the extremely misguided position 
that trade is bad for Canadian farmers; that it has caused, in 
other words, extreme hardship for our producers.  It is that 
supposition that I would like to tackle during my time here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, trade, rather than creating an extreme hardship, is the 
very cornerstone on which Canada's agricultural economy and the 
nation's economy overall has developed and thrived. We have an 
agriculture industry in the country that generated some $95 
billion in domestic sales last year and over $22.5 billion in 
exports to markets around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a record export performance.  I might add that these 
sales were made in 1998, a year when financial markets were in 
chaos and commodity prices were driven down.  However, because of 
our access to markets around the globe, Canada's agrifood 
industry was able to actually improve on its export performance 
of 1997, which, incidentally, was also a record-breaking year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This export success obviously plays no small part in helping to 
build a strong agricultural industry, an industry that 
contributes more than 8% of the country's gross domestic product, 
an industry that provides jobs for nearly one in seven people, 
from the farmer in the field to the person in the processing 
plant, to the research scientist who is constantly looking for 
ways to improve our crops and develop new crops that the world 
will be glad to buy from us.  It is also the industry which 
provides jobs for over one-half of Canada's young people entering 
the workforce for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade is good for our agricultural industry.  We have a small 
population and we have a large agricultural output.  We must 
trade in order to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent analysis by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada indicates 
that for every billion dollar increase in agrifood exports, net 
cash income on the farm can be expected to rise somewhere between 
$250 million to $310 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues on the other side would argue that is not 
good enough.  They seem to think that agricultural trade is only 
good if the benefits to the producer are dollar for dollar.  In 
other words, a billion dollar increase in agricultural trade has 
to bring a billion dollars back to the primary producers or else 
we should just forget it and that we should forget trying to 
increase trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just silly.  It is silly because that billion dollar 
increase will lead to something like $250 million or more of 
additional money in farmers' pockets.  They can reinvest that 
money in their operations.  They can use it to buy a new combine 
or to upgrade and expand their barns.  When they do that, the 
benefits are passed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a livestock producer decides to expand his capacity, he 
puts money into the hands of the local farm equipment dealer and 
his veterinarian.  Maybe he will pay his grain-growing neighbour 
down the road to supply him with some additional feed.  Pretty 
soon everybody is feeling the effects all because of trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, beyond the primary producer level, the benefits of 
that $1 billion increase in trade go to other players in the 
agrifood system.  More and more of Canada's agrifood exports are 
value-added.  Farmers' bulk products are processed and prepared 
for the direct-to-consumer market, a highly valuable market. This 
means some of that $1 billion in exports goes to food 
manufacturers, processors and transporters who also create jobs 
and economic growth for our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of trade are very clear and that is why the federal 
government does all it can to expand our trade opportunities. 
Since Canada started liberalizing trade with its partners around 
the world, our exports have exploded.  In the last decade, as we 
have pursued freer trade with partners all over the globe, our 
exports to the world have more than doubled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In North America alone, our exports have nearly quadrupled in 
the last 10 years, with more than $13 billion worth of agrifood 
products going to Mexico and the United States last year.  If 
anyone thinks we would have made these kinds of gains without 
liberalization, they are dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to increase our exports to the emerging 
markets of the Asia-Pacific countries as well.  Now, because of 
what happened in some financial markets in the last year or so 
and because of some phenomenally good harvests around the world, 
I admit some of these Asian markets have dropped off a bit. 
However, we have made gains and we have a foothold in those 
markets now.  As they evolve, we will be able to take advantage 
of the foothold and build on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have made these gains without making efforts to 
liberalize trade.  We free up trade by working with our partners 
and various associations like the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Co-operation forum, APEC, or WTO, or NAFTA.  We build freer and 
fairer trade when we put more dollars into producers' products 
and into rural businesses at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of our efforts on the trade front, Canada has made 
progress in a number of areas over the last year or two.  We have 
worked with the European Union to get them to modify their grain 
import regime and reduce the duties on some grades of Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gained access to the Japanese market for our tomatoes by 
working with officials there to get them to reduce their 
extremely time consuming approval process which required that 
each and every tomato variety had to be tested separately for 
pest risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were successful in persuading Thai officials to reduce their 
tariffs on canola meal and alfalfa products earlier this year, 
opening a sizeable market for Canadian feed exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our efforts in Korea, the Korean government 
announced earlier this year that its applied tariff on canola 
would be reduced from 15% to 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Indonesia, agriculture tariffs were reduced to a maximum of 
5% on all food products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Philippines, sanitary import protocols were maintained or 
updated to ensure we had continued market access for Canadian 
pork, beef, poultry and other agricultural items like bovine 
embryos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada also gained access to the Vietnam market for grain and 
fertilizers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is trade progress that leads to a stronger agrifood 
industry here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, trade liberalization is not the cause of Canadian farmers' 
problems.  On the contrary, trade is the answer.  On average, 
across the country, about half of farm gate income comes from 
trade.  On the prairies, trade is responsible for the majority of 
producer income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should think for a moment about what would have happened 
to our prairie provinces if they had no international markets 
where they could sell their wheat and canola and beef.  They 
would not be better off.  Far from it.  It is international trade 
that sustains our agricultural regions and the Government of 
Canada is working to improve our trade opportunities all the 
time. We are doing it by mounting trade missions, by finding ways 
to build partnerships and alliances around the world and by 
working with like-minded countries to get better, fairer and more 
enforceable trade rules that will assist our producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to increase trade, not reduce it.  We are working with 
our producers, our processors and our counterparts in governments 
at other levels to ensure we reap the benefits.

to the member so he could just rattle off a bunch of things that 
have absolutely no impact on what is happening here in Canada 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a farm income crisis and this parliamentary secretary 
does not even seem to notice that.  He talks about farmers having 
money to buy combines.  They do not have money to put food on the 
table.  When he is going to wake up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the government going to wake up and address some real 
problems like input taxes that farmers are paying and by 
developing a real AIDA program where the money gets off the 
cabinet table and is delivered to farmers to help them out at 
this crucial time?  When is it going to fight high foreign 
subsidies by the Europeans and Americans that will have a real 
impact on farmers in our country?

have some silly accusations made by the Reform Party and now we 
have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just finished saying what international trade does for the 
prairie farmer and what kind of condition the prairie farmer 
would be in if we did not have trade and the member stands up and 
harps about high input taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of today, the federal government alone has put $1.1 billion 
into a native program.  Trade and assistance from the government 
when it is needed is what is keeping farmers on the farm. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest when the parliamentary secretary spoke 
about the benefits of trade and that trade was the answer. I 
agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then went on to state that trade brings economic benefits to 
the farmers and the sub-industries that feed the farmers. 
However, as he knows, there is a crisis in the agriculture 
industry.  Would it not be prudent for his government to reduce 
taxes, as we have been calling for, so that there is more income 
in the hands of farmers and the farm supporting industries?  We 
see this as a number one priority but the minister, in his 
economic statement, has totally neglected it.  Perhaps he can 
comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if what the hon. member and 
the previous speaker were saying about the prairie farmer not 
making any money is true, then to reduce taxes when they are not 
making any money would be very silly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he should be doing is talking to his provincial 
counterparts from the prairie provinces.  He should ask the 
provincial governments that have control over the taxation 
regime, which farmers are paying taxes to, to reduce those taxes.

listened carefully to the rambling remarks of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I attended the hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. Two prairie premiers came to testify 
that they needed money and that AIDA was no longer meeting their 
needs.  It is strange that the parliamentary secretary is 
telling us that everything is fine in Canada when these two 
premiers had quite the opposite to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very odd.  I have a question for the parliamentary 
secretary. 
How will he meet the growing expectations of Canadian taxpayers, 
who want the Canadian government to ensure that genetically 
modified foods are labelled?  I would like him to answer that 
question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about 
novels and novel foods in the same breath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture committee had hearings into genetically modified 
foods two years ago, long before it became the issue of the day. 
The hon. member should talk to her colleague about the 
contributions we have made to the government's position on 
genetically modified foods and on labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked to consumers, scientists and all the partners who 
were involved in biotechnology.  We are on a plane that will take 
us to either voluntary or compulsory food labelling.

opportunity to take part in this debate brought to us by the New 
Democratic Party, particularly as regards the reference to 
cultural diversity in the party leader's motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reaffirm to the House that the government sees Canada 
as a strong player in the world.  We also know that culture 
cannot be compromised as we work to create economic opportunities 
for Canadians throughout our trade policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the Prime Minister who just recently spoke 
about the government's commitment to the preservation of Canadian 
culture.  He said “We must work together to protect this 
diversity, recognizing that cultural goods and services are much 
more than mere commodities for sale.  They touch on something 
more fundamental and intangible, our identity”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can question the commitment of this government to the 
preservation and promotion of cultural diversity both at home and 
abroad.  As clearly stated in the Speech from the Throne, our 
diversity is a source of strength and creativity, making us 
modern and forward looking.  Given the importance that the 
government places on cultural diversity, we also indicated in the 
throne speech that we will work to develop a new approach 
internationally to support this diversity of cultural expression 
in countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House of Commons on October 20 the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage acknowledged the work of the Standing 
Committees on Canadian Heritage, Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade in developing a creative solution to preserve 
and promote global cultural diversity.  This solution is the 
creation of a new international instrument on cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committees developed a study based on the recommendation of 
the cultural industry's sectoral advisory group on international 
trade, better known as SAGIT.  I would like once again to 
reiterate this government's appreciation of the work of all of 
those involved in this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this instrument would be to set out clear rules 
allowing Canada and other countries to retain policies ensuring 
the promotion of their culture, while respecting the rules 
governing world trade, and giving cultural products access to 
export markets.  The agreement would also recognize the 
importance of cultural diversity in the social and economic 
development of a country, as well as for the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will have recourse to a whole range of tribunals to which 
it can turn for support in enforcing this instrument, including 
the international network on cultural policy, UNESCO, the World 
Trade Organization, the Francophonie, and our bilateral 
relations.  Until these discussions have taken place, we will 
continue to envisage all solutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new international instrument will evolve over time, building 
on the advice and consensus gained from ongoing dialogue, both 
here at home and abroad. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the preparation for these talks on the new international 
instrument, Canada will continue to insist, in all related 
international agreements, on maximum flexibility to achieve its 
cultural policy objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the WTO, we are working closely with members to 
build support for language in the declaration that will emerge 
from the Seattle ministerial meeting to recognize the importance 
of cultural diversity.  The Minister for International Trade has 
made it quite clear that this is a priority issue for Canada.  In 
upcoming trade negotiations we will secure our ability to design, 
implement and maintain policies that serve to strengthen our 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also intensifying the dialogue which the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has been championing over the past several 
years to raise the profile of cultural diversity as an important 
international policy issue.  Many governments have cultural 
policies aimed at preserving and promoting their cultural 
diversity.  These are the building blocks for further 
international co-operation which will ensure that culture is a 
key consideration on the international agenda. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been a leader at the international level in stressing 
the importance of cultural diversity. We will continue, with the 
support of provincial governments and the public, to take part 
in discussions on this issue, and specifically on the best way 
to ensure that countries can preserve the flexibility required 
to pursue their cultural policy objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 UNESCO intergovernmental conference on cultural 
policies for development held in Stockholm concluded that 
cultural goods and services are not like other traded goods and 
services.  Cultural diversity is an important condition for 
peaceful co-existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While globalization can enrich cultural relations between 
countries, it may also be detrimental to creative diversity and 
cultural pluralism.  Building on the Stockholm agenda the 
subsequent Ottawa international meeting on cultural policy in 
June 1998 established an international network of ministers of 
culture.  It also urged countries to consider how the principles 
of cultural diversity could further be integrated into key 
aspects of international relations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international network on cultural policy has responded to an 
international need to discuss cultural diversity and address the 
challenges that globalization poses for culture.  The network has 
grown from 19 initial ministers to the current membership of 37, 
representing a broad spectrum of countries and regions around the 
world.  I am sure the member opposite will recall that meeting of 
June 1998.  She was one of the participants in that meeting, 
which was held in Ottawa. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the concrete results of the second meeting of the culture 
ministers in Oaxaca, the ministers agreed to set up a liaison 
office to support the follow up and the work of the cultural 
diversity network. This office will be located in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, under the co-ordination of the contact group, 
interested countries have agreed to conduct specialized work on 
the theme of cultural diversity and globalization, with findings 
to be released at the network's next international meeting, in 
Greece, in September 2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The network that the government was key in developing will be 
central to the debate on the preservation of cultural diversity 
well into the next century.  Subsequent meetings will be held in 
Switzerland in 2001 and in South Africa in 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done important work to raise the profile of 
culture and the need for cultural diversity on the international 
agenda.  In fact, earlier this week the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage co-chaired an international meeting of ministers of 
culture at UNESCO with her counterpart from France.  The meeting 
reaffirmed the willingness to defend and promote cultural 
diversity.  Ministers recognize that promoting diversity and 
freedom of choice are keys to the future; elements recognized in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just an issue for governments.  That is why we are 
pleased to see this week's launching of the Coalition for 
Cultural Diversity, as well as the ongoing work of the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts.  We are committed to supporting their 
efforts, as are other governments of this country, to engage a 
broad range of civil society in the promotion of cultural 
diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also pleased to be working with our provinces, which 
recognize the importance of this challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have tried to strike a balance that allows us to 
participate fully in the global culture, while at the same time 
ensuring a space for Canadian cultural expression.  This goal has 
not changed.  We believe that the approach we have outlined will 
strike a balance between the benefits of international trade to 
Canada and the ability to pursue our cultural policy objectives 
and goals.  We will continue to work with all interested 
Canadians to achieve these important goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier today and yesterday, we are very proud to join 
the coalition for cultural diversity, which includes the vast 
majority of stakeholders in Canada's artistic and cultural 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This coalition, which was created in Quebec, will soon include 
most artistic groups, creators, those coming up with the 
vehicles we need to give voice to our history, capture the 
essence of who we are, our values, and so on. This is a mandate 
that the government readily accepts and intends to fulfil.

of our trading relations in light of the upcoming Seattle round

initiatives of the government surrounding proposals to expand the 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about how our culture is threatened by trade 
deals and how I see better ways to deal with protecting and 
promoting our culture in Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a dangerous trend in our cultural policies as they 
relate to trade in the last decade.  Cultural expression is not 
being viewed by this government, especially by the United States, 
in the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that culture is something to celebrate as an 
expression of creativity.  It is something which allows us to 
delight in each other.  It is something which helps us to 
understand where we come from. 
It is our stories, our history, our emotions, an expression of 
our joys and sadness.  It makes us think and it makes us wonder.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats believe that promoting culture is done by 
supporting and celebrating artistic achievements.  We know that 
protecting our culture is required in supporting the individual 
artists, in the companies which nurture them, in their struggles 
to show us and the world a glimpse of their special view of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly we have a government which deals with culture as a 
trade-off of film tax breaks against steel quotas, quantifying 
the values of having a domestic book publishing industry against 
the pressures of the corporate monoliths who want to sell our 
trees and water.  Culture is seen as a piece on the giant 
monopoly board of world trade by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply remember how the government failed to hold the line on 
culture last spring when it came to our magazine policy.  The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage used her best speech writers to 
come up with the careful words reflecting great ideas to protect 
and promote culture.  Then the deal went behind closed doors. 
What we saw was the sellout of culture and a trading away of 
principles.  The Americans got what they wanted.  The principle 
that our culture was a commodity was entrenched.  The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage was left with a brave face and the Minister for 
International Trade got a promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same dynamic is in place still around the current cabinet 
table.  We have a Minister of Canadian Heritage touring the world 
to garner international support for international cultural 
agreements.  At the same we have a new Minister for International 
Trade calling upon the business community to rally its support 
for a new FTAA, with no real protection for culture and, 
furthermore, a new FTAA which revives the odious concept of 
investor rights.  We know that if the chips are down the 
government cares more about the corporate view of culture than 
about supporting our precious creators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly address the concept of the current so-called 
cultural carve-out in the NAFTA.  What we have now is a sham. 
The NAFTA section on culture grants permission for the Americans 
to put any dollar value on our culture that they want and to 
punish us for protecting or promoting it.  That is what the 
current agreement does.  We saw that in the magazine debate. 
Simply put, we are allowed to protect culture as long as we 
remain contractually obliged to be punished for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can pretend that culture is not a commodity, and the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage does that, as long as the Americans are 
allowed to quantify it and crush us for having it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said nothing about changing this and nothing 
about culture in preparation of the WTO talks.  We are starting 
out going into Seattle and into the FTAA from a position of 
weakness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still have some hope, though, that our culture is actually 
quite a survivor, one which has survived almost by sheer force of 
will in the face of tough odds.  I can see this by looking at two 
very special communities in my constituency, the black 
communities of Cherrybrooke and the Prestons.  These communities 
have been living on the unforgiving rocky soil of Preston, dating 
back to the days when slaves were still sold on the Halifax 
piers, before most of the Scots arrived in Nova Scotia.  Yet they 
have overcome all odds, systemic discrimination, economic 
deprivation and the scorn of successive governments.  They have 
managed to maintain their unique black Canadian culture in their 
families, in their oral traditions and, mostly, in their 
churches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I attended the funeral of Rev. Donald Skier and felt 
the amazing music, heard the heartfelt stories and saw again how 
they are proud and unique, and they have survived.  They are an 
inspiration to me of how tough a cultural people we Canadians can 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation as a society not only to respect cultural 
survival but to promote and protect our unique cultures in a real 
and enforceable way.  As a country it is not good enough to 
scrape through.  Our current trade policy fails to promote and 
protect our unique cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are voices which have been trying to address this problem 
and I call upon the government to listen to them.  The recent 
report of the parliamentary committee on trade has shown that 
even a majority of Liberals on the committee see that the current 
trade regimes fail culture and we have to try another way.  The 
recent report of the cultural industry's sectoral advisory group 
on international trade presented the government with options for 
stepping outside of the current trade agreement and developing an 
international trading relationship for culture, standing outside 
the WTO and the NAFTA. 
This approach has been supported by the Canadian Conference of 
the Arts, a leading Canadian cultural organization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of having a stand alone international trading 
agreement on culture has significance in Canada and I support 
such an approach with conditions.  There is no point in our 
minister touring the globe and meeting with cultural policymakers 
unless there is an upfront commitment from Canada that we want 
culture to be really removed from the WTO and all regional trade 
agreements, not like we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we need a separate international agreement on 
culture because the current agreements are a failure.  We need a 
recommitment to domestic cultural policy.  These things can be 
done by the government.  The choice is there but the time is 
running out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that we have the premier performers in the 
country in the House today, now is the time for the government to 
commit to removing culture from the WTO and regional trade 
agreements.  Now is the time for our Prime Minister to guarantee 
to the artists in the country that the Canada Council and the 
CBC, the pillars of our cultural foundations, are not in danger 
of being swept away by the crush of international trade 
agreements.  Now is the time for this to happen.

presenting some of our most innovative cultural manifestations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last August I visited her riding when I was in Halifax for the 
national caucus meeting of the governing party.  There is a 
theatre on the water shore there.  My wife and I were fortunate 
enough to take in the last presentation of the newest Canadian

Halifax.  It had also been presented in Toronto.  I take this 
opportunity to congratulate all those associated with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gather that the CBC will be presenting it coast to coast at 
some point.  I encourage Canadians who have the opportunity of 
seeing it on CBC to do so.  It is quite dramatic and quite 
poignant, a very important piece of art. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member a very simple question.  I did say on 
behalf of the government that we accept the SAGIT recommendation. 
The government has taken that position.  Does the member not 
recognize that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his wonderful compliments on </I>Beatrice Chancy<I> which was 
indeed a work of art, one of the works of this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as I have the great unease that I have about what 
happened last May in the House surrounding Bill C-55, I have very 
little confidence that yes means yes, that a carve out means a 
carve out, and that a total cultural exemption means that.  I 
need to have proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not get it today in the House from the Prime Minister so I 
remain a sceptic.  I will remain such until it is proven

</I></B></P><P align=left>She spoke about the FTAA and the fact that in the FTAA there was 
no guarantee of a carve out or the fact that culture would be 
protected.  She must know that in these agreements traditionally 
Canada has taken a position that it will protect culture.  It has 
done that very strongly.  In these negotiations of the WTO, until 
such times as these issues are negotiated Canada still stands by 
the principle that it will maintain its right to legislate in the 
area of culture and it will protect its rights in culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was aware of the Prime 
Minister's speech and that was why I asked him today.  I was 
quite excited by what he had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to get clarification on whether he meant that the WTO 
and the NAFTA agreement would have no binding relationship to 
culture in the country any longer.  I did not get the answer to 
that.  I still remain unconvinced. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate.  I would like to pursue the 
fourth paragraph of the NDP opposition day motion on free trade. 
I will read into the record the entire paragraph because the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food concerned himself with the first half of it.  The 
entire paragraph states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take action to remedy its overzealous and 
irresponsible pursuit of greater trade liberalization, which has 
caused extreme hardship for Canadian farmers, whose domestic 
support payments have been slashed by 60%, three times what was 
actually required by Canada's international trading obligations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to define what I think is intended in that 
paragraph and to go over what has transpired in the past six 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed by 
Canada and by a number of other countries.  For the first time 
ever GATT dealt with agricultural issues.  I was not there but I 
believe I can indicate what the agreement was.  We do not have 
time to get into all the agricultural concerns right now, but let 
me say as a starting point that the signatories were to reduce by 
20% domestic support subsidies over the next five years.  That 
was the arrangement made and all the signatories to the GATT 
Uruguay round signed on to that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, also an important year, the government opposite came to 
power in October of that year.  As I noted earlier today in 
questions and comments, the Reform Party became the only 
opposition in English Canada with official party status in the 
House.  It had an entirely different agenda, which was to get rid 
of domestic support payments as fast as possible.  This fit very 
neatly with the decision of the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister to balance the books.  It was a very happy marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long and short of it is that instead of Canada reducing its 
domestic subsidies by 20% on agriculture over the five year 
period it was reduced and slashed by some 60%.  This has meant 
the elimination of the Crow benefit, the subsidy that predated 
Saskatchewan's entry into Confederation.  It actually came into 
force and effect in 1897.  With its elimination there was a loss 
each and every year on the prairies of some $600 million; $325 
million in the province of Saskatchewan alone.  Also freight 
rates for farmers shot up dramatically since the end of the Crow 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had the option of eliminating or phasing out the 
Crow over a number of years, but because it had a different 
domestic agenda of balancing the books as quickly as possible, it 
did it all in one fell swoop with a very modest payment going 
back to farmers and producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It now means in my constituency of Palliser for a farmer in 
Rouleau or Wilcox with three hopper cars filled with grain that 
33% of it goes to pay the freight alone.  It is no wonder farmers 
are going broke so fast on the prairies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Gifford, an international trade negotiator for the 
Government of Canada, told the Standing Committee on Agriculture 
and Agri-Food that Canada could put $2 billion back into domestic 
support payments tomorrow without fear of raising any concerns 
among our trading competitors.  That is how much we have reduced 
our domestic support payments in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they got instead was a modest little announcement today of 
some welcome assistance for AIDA.  The premiers of Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan were here a week ago today, along with the farm 
lobby, seeking $1.3 billion.  The announcement today says there 
is a further $170 million available for the agriculture disaster 
assistance program, barely 10% of what farmers in the two prairie 
provinces feel they need for their provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an interesting sentence in the minister's release 
wherein he says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presume the provinces will maintain the 60:40 cost sharing 
arrangement on total safety net expenditures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a rather large presumption for the minister of 
agriculture to make, especially for the Manitoba and Saskatchewan 
provinces because I do not think they will decide to enter into 
this 40% arrangement.  The AIDA program is so tainted in those 
two provinces that I think they will feel they can get a better 
return on their investment by doing something directly for their 
farmers themselves rather than entering into what they feel is a 
very flawed program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to our competitors, particularly those south of the 
border.  We have some concerns.  We are not only concerned about 
what has happened in the past, but now we need to be concerned 
about what will happen at the upcoming WTO in Seattle.  I note 
what Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, has been 
saying within the last month.  I will quote from a document where 
she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the Clinton administration is to eliminate all farm 
export subsidies, reducing sky high tariffs used by Canada and 
other countries to keep out U.S. imports and strengthen 
disciplines on state trading agencies such as the Canadian Wheat 
Board. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the goal of the United States.  I think it will find 
support from some other countries as well.  It does not like 
state trading agencies or enterprises and we do not agree.  The 
Canadian government has been very dogmatic in its comments that 
it will defend to the fullest the Canadian Wheat Board and supply 
management.  There is no question in my mind that the Americans 
have their guns trained on Canada, on the wheat board in 
particular, and on supply management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern in this regard is that our government's response is 
very timid and very pale.  It seems to be paralyzed with fear 
that anything we do in terms of trying to protect our primary 
producers, particularly in the prairies but elsewhere as well, 
will trigger retaliatory action by the Americans.  They are 
concerned that everything is in the green box in terms of making 
it palatable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1995 Canada's total for amber support, the 
yellow light, was only 15% of WTO spending while in the United 
States it was almost 27%.  In the European Union it was just in 
excess of 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must approach the next round of the WTO agricultural 
negotiations in a very cautious and thoughtful manner.  That is 
what paragraph 4 is all about in the motion before us.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new agreement which just continues the existing formula in 
reduction of protection and support without correcting the 
inequities in the current agreement will not necessarily be 
beneficial to Canadian farmers.  In fact, such an agreement will 
just exacerbate current inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would make the observation that Canada is so intent on making 
sure that the very tiny domestic support we have is in the green 
box and that our farmers in western Canada are turning purple as 
a result of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that you are giving me a signal, Mr. Speaker.  I did 
not realize the time had flown by so fast.  I do want to close my 
speech with a couple of predictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the Canadian Wheat Board and I have talked 
about supply management.  This is my prediction.  The next round 
of the WTO which starts later this month in Seattle will see the 
demise of the Canadian Wheat Board.  The Canadian government will 
fight it to the death, but at the end of the day the Americans 
will win and we will lose the Canadian Wheat Board. The next 
round of the WTO after this round will spell the demise of supply 
management.  I hope I am wrong but I do not think I will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there is a movie called </I>Eyes Wide Shut<I>.  That is 
how Canada went into the last round of agricultural trade.  I 
hope we go to Seattle with our eyes wide open. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member's comments.  Once again, as many of 
the speakers from the New Democratic Party did, he came out right 
at the end with wild accusations of what is going to happen.  All 
of a sudden we are going to go in there and get rid of the wheat 
board.  Then it is supply management that is going to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member must be aware that the Government of 
Canada consulted.  Prior to putting forward what I and most 
members on this side of the House and many on the other side 
consider to be a very strong position on agriculture going into 
Seattle, the government consulted widely with those in western 
Canada who are most concerned, particularly on the western 
Canadian side of agriculture.  It also met with agricultural 
groups throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should read some of the reports of the 
agricultural meetings where farmers from across the country came 
together to talk about a position for Seattle.  Then he would 
agree that the Government of Canada has almost mirrored what 
these farmers came up with.  In fact, the Government of Canada, 
before putting forward that position on agriculture, sought the 
advice of not only farming groups and communities, but also the 
agriculture ministers of all the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member makes wild accusations of what is going to 
happen, he must first understand that the position we are putting 
forward is very strongly supported within the agricultural 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also talked about the hardship in western Canada 
and that many farmers are having a difficult time.  I do want to 
make this one point because it is important. The hon. member 
should know that hardship is not totally a direct result of 
foreign export subsidies.  Many other factors have come into 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we can do for Seattle is to make sure that we take a strong 
position and that we maintain this to get rid of foreign export 
subsidies and to get rid of the domestic subsidies that other 
countries are using that inadvertently come back and hurt 
Canadian farmers.  Certainly the hon. member must be aware of the 
Canadian position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
and the opportunity to respond to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of my background is in labour management negotiations.  I 
have seen folks on both sides of the table come in with very 
strong, hard negotiating positions and then I have seen those 
positions collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern I have is how strong will the government be in 
defence of the Canadian Wheat Board given the political realities 
in western Canada. There are precious few members from the 
government benches who will be out there vociferously saying to 
the trade negotiators and others that we have to hold fast and 
tight on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I am concerned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite referred to it as a wild accusation but I 
called it a prediction.  What I am saying is that when push comes 
to shove, we will see how strong the resolve of the Canadian 
delegation is to preserve and protect the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I hope I am wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
interesting point. He tries to suggest that because we do not 
have a number of seats in western Canada that we are not going to 
stand up for the interests of western farmers.  That is totally 
ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are elected not only as members of parliament representing 
our constituents here but we are nation builders.  We are people 
who represent all of Canada.  As a person from a rural riding in 
southwestern Ontario that has a number of farmers, I can assure 
the hon. member that we on this side of the House speak for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if they were the nation 
builders the hon. member suggested they are, then they would 
surely come up with a program that would assist the farmers of 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba rather than the pathetic performance on 
AIDA that even as it has been announced today falls a day late 
and a dollar short. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Tobique—Mactaquac, Homelessness; the hon. member for Joliette, 
Employment Insurance.

<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise on this motion.  This motion really 
sets apart the ideology of the socialists and shows Canadians 
that they are living in the past.  They do not understand the 
importance of international trade and the relationships and hard 
work that our minister, our parliamentary secretary and our 
entire team will be undertaking when they attend the meeting in 
Seattle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out some of the anomalies, to be kind, that exist 
in the motion.  It states that we should not negotiate any 
further liberalization of trade or investment at the Seattle 
meeting of the WTO or the free trade area of the Americas without 
first securing enforceable international rules on core labour 
standards, environmental protection, cultural diversity, the 
preservation of public health care and public education.  Are 
those not the issues among others that we are going to Seattle to 
discuss?  Of course they are.  I almost find the motion 
contradictory.  It is saying not to negotiate any further trade 
deals until we get all of this in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do NDP members think that Canada can simply walk into a world 
trading organization and simply demand that it do this and to do 
that or we are going to take our ball and go home?  They shake 
their heads but that is clearly how they think negotiations 
should take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language is quite interesting.  The motion states that the 
government should take action to remedy its overzealous and 
irresponsible pursuit of greater trade liberalization.  What do 
they think? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  They don't think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  They don't think. In all honesty, what 
do they think has contributed to the dynamic growth in this 
country since the early 1990s, specifically since 1993? 
Globalization and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I hear the Tories chirping over there. 
I remember Brian Mulroney standing arm in arm with the president 
of the United States signing “When Irish Eyes are Smiling”. 
With a name like Mahoney far be it from me to take on an 
Irishman, but I should add that we were not prepared and will 
never be prepared to simply climb into bed with an elephant like 
the United States. 
That is why we need the Seattle negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Tories did under the former prime minister and 
it led to a $42 billion deficit.  What happened then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came into office in 1993.  I was not here.  I was elsewhere. 
But the government changed hands.  The Liberals came in and we 
negotiated a trade deal in Chile.  We negotiated trade deals in 
other parts of the Americas.  We negotiated trade deals in Asia. 
We sent team Canada to Japan and all over the world.  We showed 
Canadians and more important we showed the world that we are a 
nation of traders, going right back to the roots of aboriginal 
Canadians who were the first traders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port Credit is at the foot of Highway 10 in my constituency.  It 
is named that because the aboriginals used to trade, and nobody 
had any money in those days, so they would simply trade back and 
forth and barter for credit, for goods or that type of thing.  We 
are carrying on the tradition of the founders of this nation, the 
aboriginal Canadians, who were the first entrepreneurs and the 
first free traders in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite say that with the policies the government has 
put in place with regard to international trade, globalization, 
world trade organizations, FTA, Chile and all of the agreements, 
we are being overzealous.  I understand where they are coming 
from.  It is a lack of self-confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a problem that has been in the rank and file of the New 
Democratic Party since the days when my father was trying to get 
them to have a little more common sense about their policies and 
what they should be doing. He understood. I can remember Bill 
Mahoney saying to me that we have no problem with the NDP as long 
as it is not in government.  This was the leader of the United 
Steelworkers of America.  He said to leave them in opposition 
because they are not bad if they stand up and just chirp a bit 
and effect some social policy.  Give them credit where credit is 
due, but for goodness sake do not give them the reins of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof of the wisdom of those words came through in 1990 when 
the people of Ontario decided through a mistake of some kind to 
elect Bob Rae.  We all remember what happened.  A province that 
was firing on all engines went into the worst recession since the 
Great Depression.  A New Democratic Party premier intentionally 
decided to run $10 billion overdrafts.  Imagine.  It was almost 
as bad as Mulroney and the Tories.  Actually, they were a little 
worse.  Let me give the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way government financing works is that deficits get piled on 
top of the debt at the end of the fiscal year.  It is the same as 
a family that uses an overdraft to buy food and then piles the 
overdraft on top of the mortgage.  Eventually the mortgage 
outstrips the value of the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Rae and the New Democrats had a great celebration. Remember 
the fanfare when they came in?  Boy, they opened the doors to the 
world and it was going to be so wonderful.  They took the debt of 
the province in five years from $39 billion to well over $100 
billion.  That province is choked with the burden that was put on 
it with the myopic, single minded, narrow lack of vision led and 
funnelled by the New Democratic Party policies that are developed 
at their conferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the NDP get together, slap each other on the back and 
say “We are the social conscience of the world.  We know what is 
best for Canadians. We should never trust the people in the 
streets to actually do things on their own.  We have to do it all 
for them”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the New Democrat policy.  That is where the genesis of 
this resolution before us today comes from. The members of the 
New Democratic Party do not trust Canadians to be able to compete 
in the international global marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We do not trust Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  They do not trust Liberals because 
they have no confidence in themselves. Before we can trust 
anyone, we have to be able to look in the mirror and say “I 
trust that person in the mirror is going to do the right thing”. 
We have to be able to look at our children and say “I trust my 
sons and daughters to succeed in the world.  I trust them to work 
hard.  I trust Canadians”. That is not what I hear those members 
saying. They are so myopic. They are living in the 1950s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Berlin Wall has already fallen, but the NDP members want to 
build another one.  They want to build some kind of a socialist 
wall around this great country and tell Canadians that they know 
best what the rules are.  They are just going to walk into 
Seattle and say “You guys listen up.  We are from Canada and you 
are going to do it our way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sophisticated world we live in.  I think everyone will 
agree that the socialists have fallen all over the world.  There 
are the remnants, those who call themselves socialists or labour 
politicians like the prime minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, 
who we can hardly call a socialist.  I believe he has cut welfare 
rates faster than Mike the knife in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Saskatchewan was in this place last week.  I am 
not so sure that purebred New Democrats, if there is such a 
thing, would really call him a socialist.  He is a little more to 
the right of where some of them find themselves on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak to the issue of the World Trade Organization and 
why we are going to Seattle.  Unlike the NDP members who simply 
say that we should shut down any opportunities in the 
agricultural sector, we want to expand agricultural opportunities 
in export.  Why not find them other markets?  What a unique idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not worry, I am getting the Reform members.  I know they are 
feeling left out.  The members of the Reform Party are the 
extreme of this issue.  We have the closed-minded, myopic people 
on the left and then we have the Reform members who would take 
out some white-out or a big eraser and eliminate the 49th 
parallel.  They would say that the best way to deal with free 
trade is to become Americans.  That is their basic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it fascinating that we saw the Reform Party leader stand 
in this place over the last couple of days in some kind of a 
tirade about defending agriculture.  Let me share a couple of 
things that particular gentleman said. I do not want them to get 
too upset, but this is right out of </I>Hansard<I>.  This is not 
me interpreting something that the Leader of the Reform Party 
said.  I assume we all accept the validity of </I>Hansard<I>. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending more taxpayers' money is not the answer to any 
industry's problem. In contrast, Reformers continue to call for 
reduced federal expenditures. 
Reformers on the other hand call for a phased clear-cut reduction 
in the dependence of the agricultural sector on both levels of 
government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was said by the Leader of the Reform on May 10, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  What is his name? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member knows I cannot name him. 
The Speaker will rise and make me be quiet.  I am not finished 
yet, but I may come over and talk about those fellows in a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wonder when we see the Leader of the Opposition stand 
up and demand more money for farmers.  Our Deputy Prime Minister 
stood up, I think last Friday, and responded to a question from 
the agricultural critic. 
He said that he was astounded to hear the critic demanding more 
help for farmers.  By the way, today this government's Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food announced additional funding of $200 
million.  We are not ignoring the plight of the farmers in 
Saskatchewan or anywhere else in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They seem to be doing a complete about-face.  All of a sudden, 
they are pretending that somehow they are the champions of the 
farmers, that they are going to beat the government up and force 
it to give money out to subsidize farmers even though that was 
not what their policy stated.  However, that does not surprise me 
because quite often they will do and say things that do not fit 
within their policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  “Selective amnesia” my little short 
friend says.  I like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to Seattle in the hopes that we can negotiate 
liberalization in trade and protect the things that are important 
to Canadians.  We believe we have an opportunity in Seattle to 
expand marketplaces for the agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already leaders, and members opposite know this.  The NDP 
members may not be willing to admit it, but they know for a fact 
that we are already leaders in fields such as telemedicine and 
education services.  Our ability to expand clearly depends on our 
ability to negotiate in these marketplaces. We want to use these 
negotiations and we are not afraid to do that.  That is the 
fundamental difference.  We go in with some confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell members a story about a trip I took with the 
former minister for international trade, the hon. Sergio Marchi. 
He led a team Canada trade mission to San Francisco and I was 
honoured to be able to go.  It was with young entrepreneurs. We 
saw some things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many members get the opportunity to go to a 
movie but I certainly do not often get a chance.  However, I did 
see the IMAX technology when I was in San Francisco. The IMAX 
technology, which is a theatre in the round, is Canadian. It is 
spectacular technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were in Silicon Valley in a complex in San Jose where there 
were thousands of people coming and going and looking at all the 
exhibits.  Many of them were going in to watch the movie, </I>The 
Story of Everest<I>, about a group climbing Mount Everest.  It 
was the most incredible sensation I have ever experienced in a 
movie theatre.  It was in the round.  The thing that was wrong 
with it was that it should have had a little Canadian flag on the 
bottom.  IMAX is one of the most successful technologies and it 
is Canadian.  It was invented by Canadians in Canada and is 
exported around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that a bad thing?  Is that not what our future depends on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were then taken to a site visit of the Alameda Naval Air 
Base, which is right on the bay in the San Francisco Bay area. 
There is a huge area right at the edge of the ocean that was a 
landfill site.  It was far from sanitary.  It was a place where 
we had to sign a waver because there was live ammunition around. 
I said, “You mean we are really going there?  I am not sure I 
like this idea.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They took us out and showed us the technology being employed in 
San Francisco to clean up this toxic and extremely dangerous 
naval dump site.  Guess what?  The technology was from Waterloo, 
Ontario.  A Canadian company was the lead winner on the bid.  We 
are talking about a contract that was worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars to clean up and stop all of the leachate going into 
the ocean and to eventually make the naval base into a park. 
There were seven companies involved in this environmental clean 
up project and six of them were Canadian. 
The main one was a Canadian firm that had invented the 
technology.  The seventh one was a U.S. firm and its job was to 
truck things away.  What we are talking about is the ingenuity of 
Canadian firms in developing environmental technologies that can 
clean up some of the dirtiest messes and the biggest problems in 
all of the world and it is Canadian.

are of those Canadian industries that have invented new 
technologies, that have found ways to help internationally around 
the world and that are generating jobs.  All of the money comes 
back to Canada on that project and the men and women who are 
working on that project are Canadian men and women working with 
Canadian technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand.  Instead of saying “Oh, goodness, do not 
go to Seattle because they are going to beat you up, or if you 
are going to go here is the set of rules we want”, why not 
celebrate the success of Canadians around the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of facts for the New Democratic Party.  Two out 
of every three jobs in the country depend on trade.  Exports are 
more than 40% of our GDP, more than any other G-7 country. 
Imports give consumers a wider choice and access to the best 
products in the world.  In 1998, Canada exported $367 billion in 
goods and services and each billion dollar export sustains 11,000 
jobs.  Those are outstanding numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a nation of traders who can and will compete 
internationally around the world.  We will successfully negotiate 
and improve our position at the WTO talks in Seattle led by our 
minister and our team of professionals.  I have confidence in 
them and I have confidence in Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have seen a great demonstration here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member is new to this parliament.  I would like to 
turn back the clock a bit to when his party was in opposition. He 
talks about a free trading nation.  I do not know if I am getting 
sick to my stomach, but to hear a Liberal government talk about 
trade and free trade just does not sound right because it wanted 
to rip up the free trade agreement. It is just unbelievable what 
the hon. member has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple question for the member and after he has 
finished answering it maybe he could thank the Progressive 
Conservative government for the great job it did in bringing the 
free trade agreement to the floor.  Would we be in a surplus 
position today if it were not for the free trade agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we would not be in a 
surplus position today if it had not been for the wisdom of 
Canadians who threw that government out of office and put this 
government in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member does not need what he just tore up. I 
remember a certain prime minister tearing something up and we 
were not sure what it was.  I think what he tore up was the heart 
of this nation.  He left a $42 billion deficit which we have had 
to clean up.

though I am young, I remember that when the Liberals were in 
opposition from 1989 to 1992 they were against the GST.  They 
were also against any change to the unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when Doug Young said that it would be a disaster for 
the country if we ever changed the UI.  I also remember when the 
Liberal Party said the same thing about free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the Liberals who had the heart of the NDP but 
all of a sudden, the day after the election, they lost it.  Can 
they explain that to us?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have seen selective 
memories before.  This party has never been willing to climb into 
bed with an elephant who could roll over and crush it at a whim, 
unlike the Conservative Party.  Members of this party recognize 
that we have to have agreements all over the world; that free 
trade does not simply mean a deal between Brian and Ronnie, which 
is what it was; that free trade means that we have to liberalize 
trade and take the great technologies and the great talents of 
Canadians and export them around the world.  That is what this 
party believes.  That is what the government believes.  That is 
exactly what we are going to do in Seattle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech, and I 
would like to tell him about a number of experiences, which show 
that caution must be exercized in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago, Canada entered into an agreement on lumber 
exports with the United States. That agreement was reached at 
the expense of Quebec and of the four provinces that were forced 
to take part in the arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, both Canada's free trade lumber board, headed by Tembec's 
CEO, and Quebec's Association des industriels du bois de sciage 
want to go back to free trade, because it is an interesting 
option and they would rather get out of the existing agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Canadian government will choose that option and do so 
within a few weeks, so as to send a clear message to our 
industries with respect to future investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the NDP motion, I do not think that not being present at 
the table is the right approach. We understood a long time ago 
that Quebec must be present at international tables to 
effectively ensure that what is negotiated by the Canadian 
government does not adversely affect Quebec, since Ottawa's 
interests often differ from those of Quebec and other regions of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: Does the hon. member remember that the free 
trade agreement, which is very good for all of Canada, was 
achieved because Quebec's sovereignists supported the idea? 
Jacques Parizeau and Bernard Landry displayed true leadership, 
with the result that Quebec is now less and less dependent on 
the Canadian political space and gradually finding its niche in 
the North American economic environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should be open to ideas such as the 
pan-American dollar, which would help stabilize the economy and 
give an even greater push to our exports. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all have fits of 
common sense, including separatists.  It is interesting to me 
that a separatist would stand to say that they supported the 
attempts at free trade and the negotiations as a Canadian 
initiative.  It is unfortunate they would not recognize that all 
of the benefits that have been negotiated through globalization 
and freer trade around the world have benefited the province of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall during my days with the ministry of industry and trade 
in the province of Ontario travelling to various places in the 
world.  I invariably came across an office wherever I went that 
was the largest, most aggressive trade office representing any 
government that existed, whether it was Hong Kong or the United 
Kingdom.  That office would be the office of the province of 
Quebec.  They are very aggressive about negotiating trade.  They 
are indeed free traders.  For that philosophical understanding I 
congratulate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad they have to have that one plank in their party to 
rip the guts out of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask a question of the member for Mississauga West who thinks a 
farmer is a clerk behind a 7-Eleven counter.  I believe that is 
his definition.  I do not think he knows for sure where wheat 
comes from or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember campaigning in 1997 when the Liberal candidate did an 
excellent job of presenting the red book policies.  About 75% of 
my riding is made up of farmers.  It was unfortunate for the 
Liberal candidate, as he got 6% of the vote and I got about 80%. 
I am here and he is back home.  Throughout Saskatchewan I do not 
believe there are any rural Liberal MPs.  Those people have 
rejected the Liberal version of agricultural issues. 
In Alberta there is zero.  In British Columbia, zero.  They are 
not buying the policies.  A committee was sent out to the 
prairies to find out why more westerners are not supporting the 
Liberals.  The Liberals do not seem to get the message.  Western 
farmers are supporting Reform policies.  That is why we are here 
and our Liberal comrades are not.  They do not understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member explain to me, is it because Reform MPs are here 
representing western grain growers and farmers, with a few New 
Democrats, that the Prime Minister snubbed the farmers who came 
here the other day asking for help for a disastrous situation 
which the government is ignoring through its ridiculous AIDA 
program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know.  Two 
hundred million dollars was given at about 12.30 p.m. and by 5.20 
p.m. it is a ridiculous amount of money.  I find that difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member takes a little ribbing from time to time, 
but I know he is a sincere gentleman.  While he stands in this 
place and goes on about the politics of Saskatchewan, he knows 
full well that the issue of gun control was probably what sent 
him here.  As long as there are curtains on the back of the 
truck, somewhere to put the rifle, they will send the member to 
Ottawa. That is the issue.  It has nothing to do with support for 
the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers out west know darned well that we are attempting to 
address the problems they are facing and that it is a crisis. 
The member opposite cannot in all seriousness stand and try to 
pretend that he was sent here in some God-like fashion to protect 
the men and women on the farms.  It is a pill I am not prepared 
to swallow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we have a motion by the NDP. Members will agree is a very, very 
tough one.  There is reference to sabotage. It says that if 
there is no guarantee, we ought not to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard comments by just about everyone today, either here 
in the House or on television.  Among these was the last comment 
made by our Bloc Quebecois colleague.  He said that they had 
understood that the empty chair tactic does not work.  Quebec 
must be present for negotiation, to be sure that it is not dealt 
a bad hand by Canada.  Perhaps they ought to adopt the same 
attitude during negotiations within Canada. 
That might be a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, there must be openness to consultation with the 
provinces in order to ensure that indeed, when the time comes 
for the next round of negotiations, the position will suit the 
greatest possible number of Quebecers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before I continue, I must indicate that I am going 
to share my time with the member for Kings—Hants. I forgot to say 
that when I started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we also learned that our friends in the Liberal Party have 
discovered free trade.  I have never heard such passionate 
speeches about free trade from Liberals.  They are saying “We 
have always been for free trade, just not the Conservative brand 
of free trade”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember the 1993 election campaign. After the election, they 
said “You know, there are some technicalities to be changed”. 
We never really knew what, and whether it was really important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must remember that free trade, despite everything 
that was said on both sides, was no miracle solution, but is now 
a vital tool for a country.  It will not fix everything, 
however.  Today, we have to pay attention, with what the NDP is 
telling us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of the negotiations, a constructive and credible 
position is needed for the people of this country.  The 
government has a report by the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade.  The committee travelled, with 
some difficulty from time to time, and heard exceptional 
witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time came to write the recommendations, they were 
completely fudged. 
We hope that the response by the Minister for International 
Trade will improve the quality of the recommendations and the 
work done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of examples.  In cultural matters, I would 
like someone to show me where words such as “protection” and 
“cultural exemption” are to be found in the recommendations. 
They are not there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All they did was come up with a new instrument that was 
unanimously approved, supposedly, by the cultural sector.  There 
was no such unanimity.  They said that if we were really not 
capable of getting real protection, real cultural exemption, we 
should have a mechanism as strong as the WTO or we would have to 
protect our culture.  That was not a recommendation at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the government response to the recommendations will 
be much more credible.  The upcoming negotiations have changed. 
Five, ten or twenty years after signing a treaty or a contract, 
we realize that there are some good things and some not so good 
things we did not think about. 
It is not possible to think of everything, because society is 
evolving as well.  It is therefore normal that the major rounds 
of negotiation are occurring more frequently.  Before, they were 
few and far between.  Why is the cycle shortening?  Because 
things are changing more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Seattle negotiations are beginning.  We cannot rest on our 
laurels, but things are not desperate either.  The Progressive 
Conservative Party would approach things credibly.  It would not 
put up a wall or establish measures to block free trade.  Nor 
would it do as the Liberals are doing and claim to have 
rediscovered the true value of trade trade.  Credibility must be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that the Liberals opposed free trade, 
and not just when the Progressive Conservatives were in power. 
One of Sir Wilfrid Laurier's speeches was mentioned. Members 
will recall that Sir Wilfrid Laurier had decided to open up the 
country's borders. 
Why?  Because there was an economic boom in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada had just finished building a railroad, a financial 
ordeal, and it needed money, so that markets could be opened up 
for the new territories served, it needed the Americans' money, 
know-how, and enterprise here in Canada, especially in Quebec, to 
develop the country's economy.  So, Laurier was interested in 
free trade because he needed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Laurier came to power, Canada was in financial trouble. 
There was a lack of financial, human and technological resources 
with which to develop the country and there was definitely no 
market.  The government had just opened up a huge country, built 
a railroad through uninhabited lands, and there was no market. 
So yes, Laurier made the right decision to open up to his 
American neighbour.  He had no choice, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals did not always think this way, however.  When Mr. 
Trudeau was in power, what exactly was the Foreign Investment 
Review Agency all about?  It was one of the most protectionist 
measures Canada ever had.  It was not the work of the 
Conservatives, but of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Trudeau era, they created a review agency that 
prevented billions of dollars of investments from getting in or 
out of the country.  This limited the country's growth.  Thank 
heaven, changes were made when the Conservatives came along. 
Instead of the concept of screening—surrounding Canada with a 
kind of sieve instead of a wall—they moved to a far more positive 
term: Investment Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take care. 
The Liberals are not all that protectionist.  But when they are 
really hungry, when they really have the bit in their teeth they 
go as far as they can, sometimes too far, not only up to the 
edge of the precipice, but right over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left> It is all very fine 
to sign agreements with the United States, with Mexico, Israel, 
Chile, all of the Americas in fact, excluding or including 
Cuba—we are not sure which, because Cuba was not at Toronto, so 
we do not know the government's position on it—but we must take 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we see cases Canada has lost before the WTO and 
others it has won.  In Europe at the present time, if one were 
to speak with the French parliamentarians for example, one would 
be told “That beef with hormones, you know, we don't want any 
more of that—nor genetically modified organisms—nor asbestos”. 
That is the situation in Europe right now, the barriers are not 
tariff barriers but non-tariff barriers.  At the WTO, this is not 
sufficiently clear.  In the report, a number of witnesses 
emphasized that this matter must be addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently problems in international trade that have a 
direct effect on events in this country. We would like them 
addressed in a credible and proper way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not make free trade available to everyone, and say 
thank you very much.  With our experience, we should look 
nevertheless at the real effects.  Positive, yes, because the 
Liberals are quite happy to have had free trade. Without these 
new agreements, Canada would have been in an economic downturn 
for over three years under the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have had a recession, because the domestic market was 
in a slump. 
Foreign trade, however, was strong.  So it is all very well to 
run around saying that we are open to the world, but when we 
open the door of our house, we do not want people to go off with 
our furniture.  They are welcome to buy.  They can come in and 
leave as they wish, but they cannot go off with our furniture. 
So, we are saying we have to take care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend, I had occasion to meet Bill Phipps, when he was in 
my riding.  He is the moderator of the United Church of Canada. 
The member for Winnipeg—Transcona knows him very well, being a 
United Church minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I discussed trade with Mr. Phipps. Since becoming the moderator 
of the United Church, he has spoken of faith and the economy. 
He raises some very interesting issues; not necessarily miracle 
solutions from any one point of view, but issues that are worthy 
of discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the issue of the individual rights of 
Canadians is important, but the impact on other people living in 
a country with whom we have free trade relations should also be 
taken into consideration.  We are saying that free trade is 
important, as is being outward-looking.  Canada has always been 
an outward-looking nation. This has evolved through successive 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, through experience we have learned to look before we 
leap, as it were. 
New information is now available to us and we must do a proper

interest to what the hon. member was saying about the standing

how he felt he was handled unjustly in terms of putting 
recommendations forward which I think were very strong 
recommendations that the government is taking very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations go to the fundamental issues of trade in 
this country.  They draw on some of the issues, as the hon.

120 or 130 representations before the standing committee.  The 
hon. member knows the standing committee had 38 meetings and met 
with over 138 or 139 different groups.  Could the hon. member 
tell me how many of those 38 meetings he showed up to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the member spent more time in committee he would have known 
that the committee debated all the issues he talked about.  The 
rest of the committee members came together and discussed the 
issues.  The hon. member could have learned a lot about what 
Canadians were saying on this issue if he had shown up to the 
committee meetings where we drew on the recommendations rather 
than write a dissenting report stating that there was no debate 
in committee in this regard.

would so patronizing as to say that a member was or was not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it difficult that 
the hon. member would attack me in that way, given the fact that 
he only showed up to two of the 38 meetings and would— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The parliamentary secretary had his kick at the can in 
this debate.  I thought Your Honour would at least move to the 
other side of the House so that we could put our point of view 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I will repeat once 
again that if a member stands for questions and comments and 
represents the same party as the member who has just finished 
speaking, the Speaker will always recognize someone from across 
the aisle, or at least from another party.  As long as there is 
someone standing who represents another political party or 
opposition to the member's point of view, that person will be 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member not 
aware that prior to drafting these recommendations the standing 
committee met with some 138-odd representatives from across the 
country?  In fact it travelled to different parts of the country 
to seek the views of farmers and of people involved in the 
cultural industries.  The recommendations in the report reflect 
very clearly what the representations were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member claims that somehow I spoke out against free 
trade.  This party spoke out against the American-style free 
trade agreement that members of his government were bringing in 
at the time. We spoke out against the fact that we did not have 
the access into the American market that they were claiming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

with great pleasure that I rise today to debate the New Democrat 
opposition day motion.  It is a wonderful time to recognize the 
success of one of the most forward thinking and innovative 
policies to be introduced in the 20th century by any government 
in Canada, the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting for me to recognize today the Liberal position 
on this issue and how it is diametrically opposite to what the 
Liberal position was during the 1988 election. 
I often wonder what it would be like to be able to float through 
one's political life without being burdened under any of the 
impedimenta of values, principle and consistency on policies. 
That is exactly what the Liberals do on almost every issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing worse than their stealing our policies would be 
for them to implement their own, and that is what we are a little 
concerned about at this juncture.  They are starting to implement 
their own policies and we are a little afraid about the impact of 
them in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade agreement in Canada, liberalized trade, has been 
a winner for Canadians across the country.  The </I>Economist<I> 
magazine in its 1998 year preview said specifically that the 
ability of the Liberal Government of Canada to eliminate the 
deficit was based largely on the free trade agreement and on the 
GST, both of which were vociferously opposed by members opposite. 
However the fact is that the policies worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rise today to debate the opposition motion of the New 
Democratic Party on trade.  Unfortunately New Democratic Party 
members are confusing a number of issues relative to trade. There 
is within the New Democratic Party a belief that environmental 
issues and trade issues cannot co-exist comfortably.  I believe 
they can.  We may agree on the ends we want to achieve in terms 
of an environmentally sustainable and economically sustainable 
global economy, which can co-exist.  The ends are very similar, 
but the means to get there are quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good trade policy can mirror sound environmental policy.  The 
World Trade Organization recently came out with a paper that 
recognizes both the pitfalls of trade in terms of environmental 
policy and some of the strengths and opportunities.  There is a 
movement now for a world environmental organization which would 
mirror the World Trade Organization but would focus specifically 
on environmental issues.  I think that would be very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade as an economic vehicle helps improve the lot of all 
countries.  In fact it helps improve the lot of the poorest 
countries.  Let us look at what has happened in Mexico since the 
free trade agreement or the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
It has made significant advancements economically.  In terms of 
democratic reform and in terms of environmental reform there has 
been significant advancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wealthier countries and countries enjoying relative prosperity 
can better afford to have sound environmental policy.  Some of 
the worst environmental policies and disasters existed in closed 
economies before the end of the cold war in eastern Europe.  To 
somehow say that free market economies, trading economies and 
integrated economies somehow will lead to bad environmental 
policy is counterintuitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the environment is essentially and 
intrinsically a global issue.  Pollution does not stop at 
borders.  Nor does trade.  As a result these issues need to be 
dealt with globally.  Increasingly I think trade can be an 
extraordinarily successful lever in achieving a greater level of 
global commitment to environmental policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of labour standards is raised frequently.  Some point 
to trade as exacerbating the problem when the opportunities 
provided to some of the developing economies by trade will 
ultimately provide greater levels of economic opportunity and 
flexibility.  What happens in countries that take advantage of 
trade opportunities is that ultimately they prosper economically. 
Their economies become integrated, as do their political systems. 
Quite frequently the people enjoying better levels of economic 
success will ultimately see opportunities too and demand greater 
democratic reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue today is how we can best embrace trade opportunities 
to provide a greater commitment to environmental or labour 
policies.  It certainly is not by putting a relatively weak trade 
minister in the position of the ambassador to the WTO.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous ambassador to the WTO, John Weekes, was a 
professional.  He was exceptional and he served Canada very well. 
I would argue that with the appointment of the former minister of 
trade, Sergio Marchi, as the ambassador to the WTO we have gone 
from Weekes to weak.  My concern is that as we go into the next 
round of trade negotiations the global community is going to see 
an inherent weakness in our representative at the negotiating 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MMT legislation that people so often point to in 
demonstrating a weakness in chapter 11 of the NAFTA was in fact 
bad legislation.  The MMT legislation was poorly drafted and 
poorly designed.  Ultimately it was not a failure of chapter 11; 
it was a failure of bad legislation.  The environment minister 
responsible for introducing that legislation was Sergio Marchi. 
He went on to become minister of trade and is now representing 
our interests at the WTO.  In terms of our ability to be 
represented strongly at the next WTO rounds, Canadians should be 
very scared because the depth and breadth of knowledge and the 
understanding of trade issues by that individual is simply not 
sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, we are now paying copious quantities of quid to the 
previous ambassador to the WTO in his new role as consultant. 
Effectively we fired him as our ambassador to the WTO, but 
because the guy we hired, the former trade minister, cannot 
handle it, we ended up hiring the consultant company that the 
former ambassador works for.  Canadians are paying twice the 
money and getting, I would suggest, half the representation at 
the WTO.  That is the real issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, even when Liberals finally decide that free 
trade is a good idea, they do not know how to maximize Canada's 
opportunities in the global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that we recognize, if we are going to 
be successful in the new knowledge based global economy, that 
trade and technology go hand in hand. E-commerce is expected to 
grow to $1.3 trillion by 2002.  There are no borders with 
e-commerce.  With or without trade agreements, e-commerce will 
continue to grow.  The only levers that will have any impact on 
the ramifications of e-commerce and the increasingly 
interconnected knowledge based economy will be through trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to members of the New Democratic Party that we 
begin to accept, first, that we are in a global environment, 
second, that trade is going to continue to be an engine for 
growth and a vehicle to achieve greater prosperity for all 
citizens of the world and, third, that the free market system is 
the best vehicle to achieve that.  We should be working together 
to find out how we can maximize those opportunities within those 
parameters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to members of the New Democratic Party that the 
recent statement from the WTO, recognizing both the environmental 
pitfalls and strengths of trade and some of the alternatives to 
achieve better environmental policy in a global trading 
environment, would be a good place to start.  We are heading in 
the right direction and we look forward to their constructive 
involvement in that process.

<A NAME="LINK276">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-222, an act to establish the office of First Nations Ombudsman 
to investigate complaints relating to administrative and 
communication problems between members of First Nations 
communities and their First Nation and between First Nations, 
allegations of improper financial administration and allegations 
of electoral irregularities, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this private 
member's bill on behalf of thousands of grassroots natives from 
many reserves across our land who have, through their work 
throughout the last couple of years, proposed the idea of 
creating an ombudsman, someone to whom they can go with the 
difficulties they face on the reserves.  It gives me a great deal 
of pleasure, having worked with many of these people over an 
extended period of time, to present this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My involvement with Indian affairs began in December 1998 when I 
was named deputy Indian affairs critic.  At the same time, the 
Stoney Reserve in my riding was undergoing a forensic audit. 
This reserve has been a hot bed of allegations of financial 
mismanagement.  The audit uncovered enough evidence of criminal 
activity that 43 allegations of wrongdoing were turned over to 
the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately after word got out that I was responsible for 
accountability on the reserves I was literally bombarded by 
grassroots natives from all across Canada.  The files I received 
number in the hundreds, while well over 200 cases of 
mismanagement have been reported by the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travelled in Canada from reserve to reserve the stories 
were the same.  The chiefs and councils have mismanaged money, so 
there is no place to live and, in some cases, no clean water to 
drink.  The squalor, suicides and despair were absolutely 
sickening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I have had hundreds of cases brought to me 
concerning election irregularities.  The election practices were 
clearly flawed and corrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of problems goes on and on, but to be fair I must point 
out that not all reserves are this bad.  Many of them are very 
good.  However, unfortunately the majority of them fall into this 
category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we held accountability summits across Canada I met a lady by 
the name of Leona Freed from the Dakota Plains First Nation. 
Since we first met she has set up the First Nations 
Accountability Coalition which represents approximately 5,000 
grassroots people from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations Accountability Coalition wants grassroots 
aboriginal people in Canada to work together to ensure that their 
rights to equality, democracy and accountability are protected 
and enhanced.  They have tried to solve their problems by working 
with the department of Indian affairs, but in most cases the 
problems have simply not been recognized.  They feel their only 
recourse would be the appointment of a first nations ombudsman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations ombudsman would be similar to the auditor 
general in that he or she would serve as an impartial and 
independent investigating officer.  With this as the mandate, I 
had the legislative drafters create a bill to meet the grassroots 
objectives and that is what is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill was first introduced there have been a number of 
cases reported, as well as organizations and individuals who have 
recognized the same problems of lack of accountability on the 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is simply no point in mincing words.  In 1998 and 1999 the 
federal government will spend $6.3 billion on special programs 
for aboriginal people.  The total benefit for status Indians on 
reserves is estimated to be $19,903 per person.  While the amount 
spent is massive, there is often little in the way of 
accountability on how the funds are disbursed. 
Much of the money ends up in the hands of the wrong people, while 
poverty on aboriginal reserves remains the norm.  Mismanagement 
and fraud have become standard practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the most notorious examples follow.  At the Saulteaux 
Band in Saskatchewan, Chief Gabe Gopher's honorarium and travel 
expenses totalled $171,000.  In 1997 about $600,000 was spent on 
travel by chief and band council.  This band had accumulated a 
deficit of $1.2 million as of March 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example is that of the Poundmaker Band in 
Saskatchewan.  Chief Ted Antoine made some $200,000 in salary and 
benefits, while his brother Duane, a band councillor, pulled in 
salary and benefits of $149,000.  The total band population is 
only 1,000 people and the accumulated deficit of the band is $1.8 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Stoney Band in Alberta, where the chiefs and 
councillors received $1.4 million in salaries and benefits, 
ranging from about $65,000 to $160,000 per year.  The total band 
population is 3,300 people.  The unemployment rate on this 
reserve is 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Samson Cree Band in Alberta, the chief and 12 councillors 
are paid $1.5 million in salaries and benefits.  The total band 
population is about 5,000 people.  The unemployment rate is at 
85%, while 80% of the reserve is on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Tlaoquiaht Band in B.C., Chief Francis Frank's salary and 
benefits totalled $109,000 in 1997.  He resigned in December of 
that year.  There were only 500 to 600 people living on the 
reserve.  An auditor who was called in to look at the band books 
was unable to express an opinion on the financial statements due 
to inadequate record keeping with reserves, in particular with 
respect to expenditures and payroll.  Most of the reserve 
population is unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pay levels of chiefs and councils are incredible, given the 
horrific economic conditions and unemployment rates which exist 
on many reserves.  What it demonstrates is that often it is those 
who have the power who also get the lion's share of the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 30 years at least $60 billion has been spent by 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to 
create a myriad of programs exclusively for aboriginal people. 
What is the result of spending all this money?  One-third of 
aboriginals on reserves live in overcrowded conditions.  Over 50% 
of the aboriginal children live in poverty.  The infant mortality 
rate is twice as high for aboriginal children as for other 
children.  Alcoholism, suicide, illness and crime rates are three 
times higher than they are for the non-aboriginal population. 
About 25% of Canada's aboriginal bands are being run under 
remedial management plans, with the combined debt of bands being 
$139 million.  A department survey of 300 band councils found 
that the most common problem was lack of control and conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of these problems, what recourse is there for band 
members when chief and council squander their money?  The people 
have gone to the RCMP in many cases.  They have overcome the fear 
of reprisal.  That is what happens in a lot of cases.  If they 
cannot overcome that fear and bring some of this information 
forward, they have a tough time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have asked chief and council where the money has been 
spent.  Tony Pascal, a band member from Vancouver, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way I see it is Indian Affairs just calls natives who raise 
such issues liars.  They don't realize we are the people who live 
with and witness our allegations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A group from the Shuswap Band even tried to initiate an 
investigation into financial matters on their reserve with the 
RCMP's criminal investigation unit.  Xavier Eugene, a former 
chief of the Shuswap Band, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually thought we might succeed but as we went along we 
found out there are many blocks to our pathway.  Primarily these 
blocks were and are caused because of DIAND's antiquated policies 
regarding accountability of fiscal reporting.  They require very 
little documentation to satisfy band council's requirement as 
being accountable to the grassroots members of the bands.  The 
only prerequisite that DIAND has is that they must satisfy chiefs 
and council and not necessarily band membership.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous minister called for partnership.  Partnership is 
what is going to work.  The problem is that the people have been 
left out of the partnership.  The band council only audits what 
it chooses to audit and that seems to satisfy the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a forensic accountability study made of the books of 
a number of first nations.  They would corroborate Mr. Eugene's 
statement.  So much is not accounted for, but the department 
allows this to go on.  The bigger problem is that the band 
members have gotten hold of the books and there has been clear 
mismanagement of money.  They decided to go to the RCMP but that 
is where the investigation seems to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In correspondence between my colleague the member for Skeena and 
the commissioner of the RCMP, in not so many words the 
commissioner has stated that the all clear must be given by DIAND 
before an investigation can begin.  I have that in a letter from 
the commissioner.  Where does this leave grassroots aboriginals? 
Where are they supposed to go next?  If they cannot go to the 
police and get any results and if they cannot get any results 
from DIAND and if they cannot get any results from the chief and 
council, where do they go?  That is their question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution will solve that problem and provide an answer to 
their question.  It has been their hard work that has been 
approved by thousands and thousands of grassroots natives across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Liberal government would be interested in knowing 
that I have in my possession an authentic letter that is 
addressed to all concerned citizens of the Hollow Water band.  It 
is signed by the former and present elected leaders of the Hollow 
Water First Nation.  The letter reads: “We have been involved in 
illegal and corrupt acts in the finances and management of the 
Hollow Water band, Hollow Water Corporation, Housing Authority, 
Band Welfare and other affiliates”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a letter in writing signed by three chiefs in an 
apologetic manner about all the corruption.  This letter was 
taken to the RCMP, but absolutely nothing has been done. That 
letter was written in 1994.  The letter has been taken to the 
police and nothing has been done.  Even when the people admit to 
their crime nothing is done and today the band members suffer 
more than they ever have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited North Bay and was at a meeting for six hours.  I heard 
stories of nepotism, favouritism, the doling out of funds for 
things like housing and post-secondary education.  Some 
complaints were gut wrenching.

there is still no sewer line.

report about the suicides on the Hobeema reserve.  It begins with 
the story of Eric Johnson.  On the day he killed himself, Eric 
Johnson walked home along a deserted dirt road and hugged his 
mother at the kitchen table before he went to the basement to 
hang himself. He spoke what turned out to be his last words, “I 
love you, Mom”.  Eric was 12 years old.  A few days later he was 
buried in a cemetery down the road from his mother's home on the 
Samson Cree reserve, on the prairie south of Edmonton.  His 
mother put his teddy bear next to his white cross.

national average.  I have sat with mothers in tears on these 
reserves.  One mother has lost three sons to suicide because of 
the hopelessness and the helplessness that they feel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserve was a place of helplessness and hopelessness that he 
was unable to leave because of a history of dependence that was 
imposed on their people.  Not only do vested interests divert 
money that should be going to help the poor members of the 
reserve, but I also believe that they deliberately sabotage 
education, health and welfare programs, and economic development 
in order to keep the people uneducated, unwell and unemployed so 
that they can be dominated and controlled. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Reilly said that testimony from the reserve members had 
left no doubt that leaders had pursued a systematic but unspoken 
plan to break the reserve culture for their own benefit.  The 
judge said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the tribal council spoke of a proposed development 
plan that was opposed by one man (a chief) because he did not 
want to allow the opportunities for employment that it would 
create.  He testified at length as to the repression of Stoney 
people as a form of control, and said that tribal income is spent 
on social services, instead of economic development, as part of a 
deliberate policy of keeping people dependent so that they can be 
controlled.  He volunteered his theory that controls lead to the 
depression that leads to suicide. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deaths of these boys was due to a long history of 
mismanagement and the politics of self-interest that had created 
an atmosphere of despair and denied them the services and 
programs that were supposed to support them.  Judge Reilly's 
report noted that the number of drug and alcohol related deaths 
on the Stoney reserve was at least 10 times the Canadian national 
average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yolande Redcalf, yet another case of despair, came to me just 
two weeks ago.  Yolande Redcalf completed a 44 day hunger strike 
protesting the poverty and the housing shortage on her central 
Alberta reserve.  The hunger strike was due to the fact that she 
had to share a rundown house with 14 relatives.  She watched her 
diabetic aunt drive four kilometres each day to fetch drinking 
water that smelled like sewage.  She saw her people trudge along 
the same potholed gravel road that has been the reserve's main 
thoroughfare since it was built in 1944. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Redcalf said she ended her hunger strike after Sunchild band 
chief Harry Goodrunning promised that two new houses would be 
built on the reserve before winter.  I think the new minister had 
something to do with correcting this situation and I applaud him 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had some documents brought to me which list the social welfare 
payments on the Alexander reserve.  There were payments of made 
of $300, $400, $500 and $600.  Suddenly there was one for $8,000. 
Then there was another one for $9,000.  I asked the people who 
produced these documents why the payments were small, yet there 
were two that were very large. They produced two more documents. 
Both of the individuals had been dead for 13 years.  They 
produced their death certificates. My question was who was 
signing the cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went with the band members to the RCMP.  We delivered these 
documents in person.  The RCMP looked at them and said they 
looked very suspicious and that it should be investigated.  It 
was taken to the police in commercial crimes. Two months later 
they phoned back and said there would be no further 
investigation.  When I asked why, there was no answer.  One of 
the RCMP officers, who will remain unidentified, alluded to me 
that what went on in Ottawa was very strange because there was 
obvious evidence and somebody had said to drop the investigation, 
just drop it. 
That is very suspicious and I do not like the sound of that.

by the chiefs.  I have gone across the country and I can say, 
everybody is scared of chiefs and everybody is scared to deal 
with native issues, including our native politicians.  And I can 
also say, Canada is not a democratic country when our government 
will allow third world conditions to exist on our first nation

no need for a national accountability coalition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to begin by congratulating the member for his 
speech. As he knows, there have not been too many times I have 
risen in the House to say that.  The member deserves the respect 
of members of the House for the sincerity he has put forward in 
trying to address some of the very serious problems that exist on 
reserves across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too spent some time on reserves in my younger days with the 
department of lands and forests in Ontario.  I saw the poverty. I 
saw brand new schools being built and all the windows smashed out 
the very next day.  The lack of self-respect, the lack of 
self-esteem, the lack of jobs that existed in northern Ontario, 
not in western Canada, are still a problem in too many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often thought it is a real travesty that a nation as 
wealthy as Canada, blessed with its natural resources and 
financial capabilities, has a people within its boundaries who 
live life in what could only be described as third world 
conditions in many instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will probably not be surprised to know that I 
disagree with his solution to the issue.  I appreciate the fact 
that it is not his solution, that it has come from the 
grassroots.  I do not mind saying that I disagree with them in 
using this particular issue as a solution. Let me say why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a private member's bill in the Ontario legislature that 
would have abolished the office of the ombudsman in the province 
of Ontario.  The reason was that from the days when the 
ombudsman's office was created in our province, it grew from 
being a complaint or resolution mechanism to becoming a 
bureaucracy that was, and in Ontario still is, out of control. It 
became nothing more than a court of last resort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize it is different with the folks on the reserves the 
member is talking about, but there are similarities.  Once that 
is set up it becomes a no at this level and a no at that level 
but there is always the ombudsman.  It just becomes one further 
process in the bureaucratic jungle with which people have to 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument to eliminate the ombudsman's office in the province 
of Ontario was that elected representatives were the ombudsmen. 
We should be the ones to raise issues.  To suggest that the 
ministry is not accountable to parliament is simply not a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may not like the action and there may be things that 
need to be done to improve it, but I would have thought in all 
honesty that at the end of the member's speech, for which I did 
congratulate him, he would have said that therefore he supports 
the Nisga'a treaty, as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about a long term solution?  This is not an overnight quick 
fix, the setting up an office and appointing an ombudsman.  There 
would be great criticism about how such a person gets appointed 
or who it is.  There will be accusations of partisanship.  All 
that will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we should be working with our first nations 
to develop programs around self-government and partnership, and I 
believe the ministry and the minister are doing it.  They may 
want to establish an ombudsman.  I appreciate it may not be going 
fast enough, but Nisga'a is a clear example, whether the member 
likes the fine print or the details, of a self-government treaty 
that it is totally beyond my comprehension.  I do not understand 
why the Reform Party opposes something like ensconcing democratic 
principles in a first nation that has been debating the issue for 
over 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to fight the Nisga'a battle.  It seems the Reform 
continues to do that.  However I want to talk about the 
ministry's attempt to work with first nations leaders and develop 
self-government principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with self-government where the members of the band 
actually elect the council and elect the chief?  If an individual 
is not being accountable to his constituents then there must be 
mechanisms to deal with it.  The member has talked about people 
making six figure salaries when most of the members of the band 
are on some kind of social assistance.  That is not acceptable. I 
agree with him and I think we should do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the auditor general and the public accounts 
system.  He is empowered to go in and investigate.  If there are 
criminal acts and wrongdoing, the RCMP is also empowered. It is 
unacceptable for anyone to stand in this place and say an RCMP 
officer who shall remain nameless told him or her about a 
criminal activity and then said to forget about it.  That is 
unacceptable.  That is not the role of the police.  If it 
happened, it should not have happened.  It should have been 
reported to his superior.  There should not be any attempt to 
withhold an individual's identity or name when that kind of issue 
comes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that self-government will ultimately bring 
self-esteem, not perhaps as quickly as members of the Reform 
Party would like.  They like to think that at the snap of a 
finger they can solve all these problems.  Self-government will 
bring self-esteem.  Self-government will bring democracy to the 
reserves.  We owe a debt as a nation, recognizing that for years 
we have treated our first nations, our aboriginal people, in an 
unacceptable and disgusting manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  For 130 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I do not care for how many years.  It 
is not an acceptable solution.  If the position of ombudsman is 
created, it should be created by the reserves.  We talk about the 
programs being introduced on reserves. Something like 83% of the 
programs were administered in a paternalistic fashion by the 
ministry in years gone by, dating back to the fifties when it was 
all just handouts and doing it the government's way. 
Some 83% of the programs have been transferred to local 
communities and an additional 7% have been transferred to the 
provinces.  This is making huge strides in a heretofore very 
difficult, very paternalistic, very government dominated process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are constantly yelling about the fact that we should 
slash government and cut funding.  Their policies would decimate 
the funding of that ministry, the assistance to aboriginal 
communities.  It is difficult to understand how they suddenly 
think an ombudsman will come cheap.  It cost tens of millions of 
dollars in my home province, and I am sure that was the case in 
other provinces.  My colleague tells me the office of the 
ombudsman in Newfoundland has been abolished.  That is not the 
way to solve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt his sincerity or the fact that the member spent 
an enormous amount of time this summer travelling and talking to 
the men and women whom he has identified in this place.  However 
there is a better way.  There is a democratic way to work within 
government.  It is not easy because we are dealing with human 
beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members of the Reform Party to take an inward look 
at their own policies, to take a look at the fact that we have 
just signed an historic treaty in British Columbia which protects 
the rights of every Canadian.  It passes on our constitutional 
rights to the Nisga'a band yet they continue to oppose it for 
reasons that are totally unclear to the vast majority of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may have his heart in the right place, but I am 
afraid his head is a bit off when it comes to finding a solution. 
It should be self-government.  It should be working with the 
tribes to help them develop their own programs and their own 
self-esteem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a bit 
perplexed as I take part in this debate today to speak to Bill 
C-222, an act to establish the office of First Nations Ombudsman 
to investigate complaints relating to administrative and 
communication problems between members of First Nations 
communities and their First Nation and between First Nations, 
allegations of improper financial administration and allegations 
of electoral irregularities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used the word perplexed because I wonder about the need for 
such a bill. 
Bill C-222 proposes to first nations a totally useless structure, 
a structure they have not asked for and, moreover, one that 
duplicates processes already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget management by band councils has been the focus of the 
efforts and energy expended by both the Department of Indian 
Affairs and native communities, particularly over the last two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of efficient, standard accountability regimes 
is a new challenge that is in line with the recommendations of 
the Erasmus-Dussault commission concerning the need for 
communities to have access to the necessary tools for sound 
fiscal management.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Administrative problems do exist, but they have more to do with 
the fact that these are new agreements than it does with 
defective or inadequate management. Financial transfers to 
reserves are new, and we are experiencing problems now because 
we are undergoing a transition phase, which is quite normal, and 
not because of poor management. It is obvious that, with time 
and experience, the existing relationships will only get better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Answers that emerge from the local communities themselves are 
far better than those that are brought in by people from the 
outside, well intentioned as they can be. 
The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and 
the first nations can find solutions, and these should come from 
within those organizations. It is the key to success. Nobody 
should come in from the outside and tell people “This is your 
problem, and here is how you are going to solve it”. It would be 
paternalistic and arrogant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having an ombudsman who would tell the first nations how to deal 
with problems between and within them would be a little bit like 
trying to settle squabbles in a school yard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing here with kindergarten kids, but with people 
who have been looking at achieving self-government for a very 
long time. We should not impose on them an ombudsman to solve 
all their problems. We should support them as they move toward 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from being naive, we do not believe that everything is fine, 
but I would say that we are optimistic and mostly we believe in 
the capability of the first nations to efficiently manage their 
finances, as long as they are given the means to do so. This is 
the goal of the negotiations currently underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, with the co-operation of the native people, the governments 
are trying to set up round tables to discuss ways to develop 
standards relating to financial administration, internal 
control, public accounts and auditing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that these round tables are more useful than an 
ombudsman would be, because the constructive solutions put 
forward are in sync with the values of the first nations, as 
well as with the legislation and guidelines of the various 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian chartered accountants took part in the development of 
the many administrative agreements signed by the stakeholders 
and the federal government. These chartered accountants provided 
and are still providing some advice. They came up with relevant 
and dynamic solutions and are providing band councils the 
support they need to carry out the administrative duties related 
to the management of their financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the allegations of electoral irregularities, the 
information we have leads us to believe that more specific rules 
are needed to ensure that the complaints are received and 
processed appropriately. Here again, an ombudsman would be 
useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what disturbs me the most is not the presence or absence of 
an ombudsman responsible for looking into administrative or 
electoral difficulties among first nations, but rather the 
conviction that seems to be behind this bill.  It is a false 
one, based on the assumption that there are major problems. 
This is incorrect.  There are no major problems.  This is a 
period of adjustment and there is certainly room for 
improvement, but the situation is not disastrous, nor will it 
become so, because it is changing for the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the progress report by the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development and the Canadian Polar 
Commission for the period ending March 31, 1999, the number of 
financial statements by first nations on which there was a 
favourable opinion by an independent auditor has risen from 57% 
to 81% since 1985. 
Is this not an improvement?  Does such progress not deserve to 
be highlighted?

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the time to make the machinery more unwieldy by 
adding something to it unnecessarily.  What we need to do 
instead is to support the first nations in their progress toward 
self-government and independence.  Bill C-222 attacks band council 
administrative procedures head on, and by that very fact attacks 
their administrative ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Petit Robert defines an ombudsman as “a person responsible 
for defending the rights of the citizen against the public 
administration”.  This is a noble and laudable function, but one 
that is pointless in the situation we are concerned with here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ombudsman would not be the right answer here. 
The right answer is to continue along the path on which the 
first nations and the department are already engaged.  They must 
continue to work to improve the administration and monitoring of 
financial transfers and must set stringent rules for handling 
any allegations of wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-222 is therefore, for all the reasons I have given, 
totally pointless.  As well, it demonstrates a somewhat 
paternalistic attitude, one which has no place in the new 
relationships we must forge with the aboriginal nations in order 
to reinforce their capacity for good self-government.  This is 
why the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against Bill C-222.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I share the 
very deep worry and concern of my hon. colleague from Wild Rose 
about the plight of first nations people and his desire to go to 
accountability as a way of making sure that wealth is distributed 
and passed to those who need it.  We are talking about a 
desperate need in these circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem I have is with the method, which is appointing a 
ombudsman who would be accountable to the department itself. If 
we look at our own government, we can see example after example 
of a lack of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a military ombudsman who, a year after his 
appointment, still lacks a mandate.  We have a military that 
cannot be trusted to investigate itself.  We have a headline that 
says that an air force captain alerted the defence minister's 
office of impropriety but nothing was done about it.  Another 
headline says that the top military is not accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is department after department.  We have the immigration 
department that is barely accountable to parliament and even to 
its own minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have MPs who cannot crack Canada's tight-lipped spy chief. We 
had a situation this morning about concerns around CSIS and the 
accessibility we have to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example was even in the smallest detail as an MP phoning 
and requesting some information from a minister and being told 
that it was confidential.  My assistant had heard this particular 
paper being given in public just barely a week before and we were 
told that it was confidential.  So he went to his home address 
and phoned for the information and it was sent out to him because 
the request did not come from an MP's office. That is the kind of 
accountability we hold ourselves to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another headline says that Ottawa gets around access to 
information requests and that the government sets a dismal 
example of accountability.  Members of the foreign service have 
tried to bring forth information about misspending and 
inappropriate spending of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a private members' bill that would hold first 
nations people to a level of accountability that we are not even 
willing to hold to ourselves.  We had the Krever inquiry that led 
to untold suffering and death.  Was there any single person ever 
held accountable?  No.  We had the Somalia inquiry shut down and 
nobody was held accountable.  We have rapes and harassment in the 
military and nobody is accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is proposed is that we impose on first nations people 
another attachment to the Indian Act or another piece of the 
department, when obviously our departments are not capable of 
investigating themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It's the ombudsman's responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  But the ombudsman, if I understand it 
properly, would be responsible to the minister.  The appointment 
would be political and would go through the committee.  I am 
saying that the bureaucracy would be interested in sustaining 
itself rather than looking at the true needs of first nations 
people.  I think those needs can be addressed through 
self-government, by getting rid of the Indian Act and its very 
odious imposition on their lives and by giving them the chance to 
set up governments that work and systems that are accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my colleague from Wild Rose used many examples.  I have 
an example of democracy and the spirit of first nations people 
where there was serious conflict within one band in the Yukon. 
There was a coalition for democracy that fought long and hard 
because they did not agree with what they believed to be actions 
that were, in some instances, what they considered to be corrupt. 
They fought as a group of people, as a democracy, and they made 
changes democratically and got new people elected.  They have a 
very strong band council and they are negotiating their land 
claims.  It was not easy but they did it among themselves, they 
did it with pride and they did it with integrity.  They made 
changes for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we could be responsible for, and should be, is to make sure 
that every band has the capacity to do that and not be squashed 
from above and held in positions of dependence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read  the condemnation by the Alberta judge of both the 
department and the bands very closely.  I think we have a lot to 
learn from what he said.  I hope the department of Indian affairs 
paid close attention.

establish the office of first nations ombudsman to investigate 
complaints relating to administrative, financial and electoral 
irregularities by members of first nations communities in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all read and heard about the issue of interfering in first 
nations' affairs in Canada, and about how first nation members 
never got the $4 billion that was supposed to be transferred to 
them for their well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that some people think there is interference in 
the affairs of all first nations. This is not true. In my riding 
of Madawaska—Restigouche, the Hill River First Nation is very 
dynamic and productive, and its economic growth is absolutely 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that the idea of an ombudsman is not a good 
one, on the contrary. This suggestion has a lot of merit. A 
number of institutions often rely on this kind of service to 
file complaints. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, I know all of us have had occasions 
where we have either advised constituents of the presence of an 
ombudsman office or been a last resort when a constituent feels 
that an ombudsman has still not responded satisfactorily to the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ombudsman offices in government and business with 
many, if not all, provincial governments providing the service to 
consumers. 
Other institutions, such as Canada Post Corporation, the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation and a number of financial institutions 
like the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, offer this service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel the establishment of a similar office for first nations 
would be an effective and useful means of addressing concerns of 
aboriginal people, whether it be matters resulting from alleged 
unfair election practices or financial or administrative 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people have expressed their frustration with the lack 
of options available to them when they question the procedures or 
process of the band chief and council. An independent ombudsman 
office would provide a possible solution and be in a position to 
access information that could respond to the complaints. 
Furthermore, it would allow aboriginal people to air their 
grievances when they feel they have been ignored by the chief and 
council and are unwilling to discuss it in a more public format. 
Under this bill, any member of a first nation community could use 
the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ombudsman would be appointed for a term of five years under 
the provisions of the bill, with the governor in council making 
the appointment on the recommendation of the minister.  First 
nations would be involved in the process by making 
representations to the committee that would then report to the 
minister. It is important to ensure the impartiality of the 
ombudsman and this process would distance the first nations from 
the appointment of the ombudsman.  Otherwise, the effectiveness 
and objectiveness of the office could be jeopardized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On first nations where there have been questions about legality 
of election processes or suspicions of inappropriate use of band 
funds, there is currently little opportunity for aboriginal 
people to lodge a complaint except with the chief and council who 
are often implicated in the allegation.  Obviously this is not an 
ideal situation and does little to alleviate the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only other course of action available is to complain to the 
minister or to members of parliament, particularly those in this 
critic area or in whose constituency the aboriginal people 
reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a fiduciary responsibility to 
aboriginal people and is obligated to work on behalf of 
aboriginal people to protect their rights. This is a 
responsibility that is sometimes misunderstood and occasionally 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would acknowledge that first nations people also have 
to rely on themselves, their organizations and elected bodies to 
protect their rights and access to services.  Instead of having 
to outline their complaint to the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, they would have an independent ombudsman 
office that would address their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the input of first nations, this process has the potential 
to help first nations people assume greater responsibility and 
accountability for their actions.  In some cases, band members 
are not able to access information that would prove their 
allegations, something the bill would address.  Under the 
proposed bill, an ombudsman would have the power and authority to 
access such records.  At the same time, it would be at the 
discretion of the ombudsman as to what constitutes reasonable 
grounds for an investigation and whether accessing such records 
would be justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I feel the bill has a lot of merit. 
Misunderstanding and discord can often be resolved if a process 
is in place to address these concerns.  I feel the establishment 
of an ombudsman office is one solution that could help first 
nations better serve their communities and in the long term 
provide better service and more transparency and accountability. 
These are objectives that all governments and institutions strive 
to achieve and with varying degrees of success.  It is always a 
good idea to explore new options and possibilities for 
improvement.  I think the bill has made a worthy proposal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate my friend and neighbour, the hon. member for 
Whitby—Ajax, on her appointment as the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Labour.  I look forward to having many 
vigorous debates with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I express my profound disappointment with the 
government's malicious neglect of what has become Canada's 
national homeless crisis.  In particular, I want to voice my 
absolute horror that the member from Moncton, who in the past did 
so much for impoverished Canadians and showed so much promise 
when she was appointed minister responsible for homelessness back 
in March, would turn out to be such a train wreck as a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 25 she promised to have a strategy in place with new 
money to help the homeless within 30 days.  It has now been 224 
days and there is no money or plan in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in March she vowed in the House that “every child in 
Canada will have a safe bed to sleep in”.  Here we are eight 
months later and most places in Canada have already had their 
first snowfall, and the minister has done nothing to prevent 
thousands of homeless children from spending another winter 
freezing on the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring her government passed Bill C-66 which will divert 
$200 million from social housing programs, after cutting $55 
million from CMHC's social housing budget last year.  The 
minister opposed many of her own Liberal colleagues and voted 
down Bill S-11 which would have prohibited poverty as a legal 
grounds of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June she refused to meet with Lifeline Centre, an Ottawa 
organization seeking help to set up a new and innovative facility 
to assist homeless men who are addicted survivors of trauma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer when the city of Toronto asked the federal 
government for emergency assistance to provide short term shelter 
for the city's homeless, the Liberals offered the use of the Fort 
York Armoury and then sent the city a bill for $250,000.  It is 
sad to note that the Liberals made a hefty profit on the backs of 
Toronto's homeless.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims she has been working day and night seven 
days a week to come up with a plan for the homeless.  Yet the 
week the throne speech was delivered and other parliamentarians 
were coming back to work the minister was jetting off to Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May the minister hired 18 new bureaucrats at a cost of over 
$1 million to taxpayers in salaries, benefits and office space. 
Her new million dollar staff includes three new correspondence 
assistants even though as Minister of Labour she already had six 
letter writers and six new program assistants even though she has 
no programs to administer as the homeless minister.  Instead of 
putting up a shiny new office that million dollars could have 
provided emergency shelter for 30,000 homeless Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was given the mandate to find a solution for 
Canada's homeless.  She made a lot of promises to a lot of people 
but now she is backing away from her commitments.  She has 
recently been quoted as saying that she cannot do anything but 
pass along a few ideas to cabinet and hope that something gets 
done.  The minister now says that it is not her job to produce a 
strategy, that it is not her job to find new— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member but his time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague opposite for 
his kind words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour has been fighting poverty and abuse for 
31 years.  It has been her life's work.  In March the Prime 
Minister asked her to continue her fight by co-ordinating the 
activities of the Government of Canada related to homelessness. 
The Minister of Labour has made this assignment a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To assist the minister with the co-ordination of a response to 
homelessness, Human Resources Development Canada established a 
national secretariat on homelessness.  The secretariat staff of 
16 in total have been reassigned.  They are on loan from other 
Government of Canada departments.  They were chosen because of 
their expertise in homeless related issues such as housing, 
health and community capacity building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretariat is currently compiling the comments the minister 
heard from the community activists, the homeless themselves and 
the countless frontline workers across Canada.  In addition, 
these borrowed staffers are referencing and summarizing the 
information contained in the many excellent reports that have 
been prepared by municipalities and community based task forces. 
This material will help the minister in preparing her 
recommendations for her colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear that the Minister of Labour did not promise 
to have solutions within 30 days of her appointment.  When she 
addressed the conference in Toronto she asked participants to 
judge her not in two days but in two years.  The only promise the 
minister made at that conference was a promise to meet with the 
mayor of Toronto, and she has fulfilled that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no quick fixes for homelessness.  Communities, the 
private sector, municipalities and provinces must all be part of 
the solution.  The Liberal government is committed to addressing 
the plight of the homeless.  We have heard this from the Minister 
of Labour, in the Speech from the Throne and the fiscal update. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working to address the issues through various programs 
including youth at risk and the aboriginal jobs program at HRDC 
in addition to the recently augmented RRAP.  The government will 
continue to work with all sectors, private and non-profit, and 
with other levels of government, to meet the immediate needs of 
the homeless people in Canada for the winter.  We remain 
determined to address and to sort out the root causes of 
homelessness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, 
October 27, I put a question to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development in order to find out whether she thought it 
reasonable to cut employment insurance benefits to an individual 
because that person had no means of transport to get about 
easily, according to an official of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, visibly ignorant of the facts, said that my 
statements were unfounded accusations.  She said, and I quote: 
“The accusations made by the hon. member are false”.  Those are 
her words.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed to the minister that I table a copy of a letter I had 
received from a taxpayer in my riding illustrating the 
situation.  But the government opposed this because, apparently, 
it is government practice to not be too informed of the reality 
of matters.  They do not want to know too much of the truth. 
They just said my allegations were false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the letter I could have tabled in the House—I could not do so 
because a Liberal member objected—a taxpayer in my riding was 
told the following: 
<UL>
<p align=right></B>October 19, 1999 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to inform you that we cannot pay you benefits effective 
October 18, 1999.  You have no means of transportation and are 
thus prevented from accepting employment.  For this reason, you 
have failed to prove your availability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was told as well: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you do not agree with this decision, which is based on the 
Employment Insurance Act, you have the right to appeal within 30 
days. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the pressure the minister is putting on her officials to 
harass the unemployed increasingly, we end up with this sort of 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the reaction of an employee under heavy pressure from 
the department, when faced with an unemployed worker?  It is to 
try to save the government as much money as possible, not to 
help the individual who is without resources and lacks the means 
to make a case before a labour tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the claimant is told to appeal if he or she is not 
happy.  People without resources are being asked to go the extra 
step of justifying benefits, when they are entitled to them 
because they have paid their premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate how ridiculous this is, we are talking about a 
65-year old woman.  She has been told that she has no means of 
transportation.  In a city with public transit, this is a bit 
much. 
The woman in question had stated that she usually went on foot 
to look for work, and had done so until the age of 65.  Until 
that age, she had been able to find work by using the public 
transit system, taking her bicycle, or walking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, she was told that, since she had no means of 
transportation, she was no longer available for work.  Are we to 
conclude that all unemployed workers without their own cars have 
no means of transportation and that, as a result, they no longer 
qualify for employment insurance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the question I wished to ask and I hope that this time I 
will receive an answer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me assure the hon. member that the 
department treats clients with fairness, understanding and 
compassion.  That is why Human Resources Development Canada is 
known as the people department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary purpose of employment insurance is to compensate 
workers in case of involuntary unemployment.  However, as the 
hon. member knows, every person who is claiming regular benefits 
must prove availability for work.  This is a longstanding 
condition of the EI legislation.  Each case is assessed 
individually and all circumstances are examined and considered in 
a compassionate manner.  At the same time, the government has an 
obligation to Canadian taxpayers to protect the integrity of the 
EI fund.  We have in place a number of control measures which 
ensure that public funds are protected.  We have as well a series 
of appeal procedures if a person is unhappy with a particular 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have quotas.  We have reasonable performance 
expectations for our investigation and control program as a way 
of measuring results.  Again, they are not quotas.  We allocate 
our resources according to workload, as does any other 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may be interested to know that other governments 
also have similar expectations for their social programs.  For 
1996-97 the Quebec government set a target of $100 million for 
its verification of social assistance cases.  It surpassed that 
target and recouped $112 million.  For 1996-97 the Quebec 
government set a target of $58 million for its in-depth 
investigation of social assistance cases. 
It surpassed that target and recouped $112 million.  For 1996-97 
the Quebec government set out a target of $58 million for its 
in-depth investigation of social assistance cases.  It surpassed 
that target and recouped nearly $68 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the hon. member will undoubtedly appreciate that as the 
people department, it is our intention to ensure that claimants 
receive their full entitlement to benefits and nothing less.  I 
would suggest if he is not happy with a particular decision at a 
particular level that perhaps he look further into the appeal 
route. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]
