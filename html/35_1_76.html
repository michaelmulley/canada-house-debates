	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, straddling 
the 200 nautical mile limit there is a fish stock which is of great 
importance to the existence and well-being of many coastal 
communities in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Designed to avoid crisis in the fisheries, the law of the sea 
affirms the responsibility of all nations to co-operate in 
conserving and managing fish in the high seas. It is in the 
interests of Canadians that the Government of Canada ratify the 
law of the sea convention.
<P>
	Canada should join the other 60 nations in the sustainable 
management of fish and bring destructive overfishing to an end. 
I call on the Government of Canada to ratify the law of the sea in 
1994.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, National Access Awareness Week is an excellent 
opportunity to remind this House of the extraordinary 
performance of our disabled athletes at the last Winter Olympics 
for the disabled.
<P>
	Unfortunately, their outstanding achievements did not receive 
the attention they deserved. In fact, the nine medals won by 
Canada were mentioned only in a 30-minute television

being asked to debate these bills at second reading.

	This is an obvious abuse of power. The Liberal red ink book 
speaks of the integrity of Parliament. Surely assimilating over

<P>
	This is a far cry from the apocalyptic scenario described by

cause of instability in Canada is the Liberal government's 
failure to cope with the deficit and unemployment.
<P>
	While Quebec's credit rating has been maintained, Ontario's

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALFORUMONHEALTH">NATIONAL FORUM ON HEALTH</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Criticized by the provinces that refuse to be excluded from the 
National Forum on Health considering that they are the ones 
primarily responsible for health-care organization, the Prime 
Minister confirmed yesterday that the National Forum on Health 
would be postponed. This postponement, which comes on the 
heels of the delay in social program reform, was explained by 
the fact the Prime Minister wished to examine the situation of 
the provinces.
<P>
	As chairman of the National Forum on Health, will the Prime 
Minister commit to seeking the direct participation of the 
provinces, as equal partners of the federal government, as 
requested by Quebec and New Brunswick among others?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a national forum in which we want stakeholders to 
participate in order to determine what exactly the long term 
goals are for the people of Canada in the area of health. We are 
presently consulting with the provinces, but we do not want this 
forum to turn into a federal-provincial squabble. There is a 
health ministers' meeting scheduled, to deal with day-to-day 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4695"> 4695 </A></B>
<P>
problems. We do want the provinces to participate, but above 
all, we want all other stakeholders who want to make their views 
known to participate in the forum. This conference must  not be 
confused with the meeting of federal and provincial health 
ministers, who get together on a regular basis.
<P>
	Five provinces made recommendations in anticipation of 
their participation. The Minister of Health said she had 
approved some of these proposals. The provinces then 
submitted more proposals, which we are currently examining. 
But the fact remains that this process cannot replace the health 
ministers' meeting.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand that the federal government is 
refusing to clearly authorize the formal and direct participation 
of the provinces in the forum to avoid having to debate publicly 
with them the consequences of its decision to withdraw from 
free, accessible and universal health care?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Absolutely 
not, Mr. Speaker, because there is a clear and unequivocal 
commitment on the part of this government to free and universal 
health care across the country. More and more -and even the 
provinces recognize this- Canadians want this health system 
which is the envy of the Americans and others to be maintained.
<P>
	We spend 9 per cent of our gross national product on health 
care, as compared to 14 per cent in the United States. We want to 
make sure that the objectives of this system, which has been 
working well but has developed a number of problems like any 
other system after a few years of operation, are maintained in the 
interest of all Canadians.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr.

himself look good by imposing national standards on the 
provinces, while his government is reducing its contribution to 
health care, which puts the provinces in an impossible situation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we did not reduce our funding at all. No cuts in transfers to the 
provinces were made in the Minister of Health's budget.

that we are going to maintain transfer payments at the level they

one, an odious, hidden tax that goes directly against the

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance: Does he confirm 
his government's intention to implement a GST that would be 
even worse than the first one and that could apply to currently

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Earlier this week the Prime Minister acknowledged that 
increasing uncertainty caused by the debate over Quebec 
sovereignty was hurting the Canadian economy. At the same 
time the study released by the C. D. Howe Institute points to 
growing uncertainty about the government's ability to hit its 
deficit targets, which also hurts the economy.
<P>
	The C. D. Howe study says the government would have to 
make further spending reductions of $7.2 billion just to restore 
confidence in its current deficit projections.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4696"> 4696 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the minister accept the C. D. Howe study analysis and 
is he actively searching for an additional $7.2 billion in 
spending cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Develop-ment-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the study referred to by 
the leader of the Reform Party was one of four articles in a 
document that by and large was very good.
<P>
	The objectives set out in the article by Mr. Richards are 
certainly objectives we share.
<P>
	Unfortunately when Mr. Richards did his study he did not take 
into account the measures that we did in the February 22 budget 
and as a result his study is based on a set of numbers which are 
no longer valid.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Two big sources of uncertainty are driving interest rates up, 
undermining confidence in the dollar and shaking investor 
confidence. One is uncertainty about excessive deficits. The 
other is uncertainty about Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister says that little can be done in the short 
term to control uncertainty over Quebec, but surely more can be 
done to control uncertainty over the deficit. It is the controllable 
factor.
<P>
	Does the finance minister agree that the growing uncertainty 
over Quebec now gives him an added reason for coming to his 
colleagues and coming to the House and demanding stronger 
action on the deficit and the debt? Is he prepared to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Develop- 
ment-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have made it very clear, as has 
the Prime Minister, that as a government we take our deficit 
targets very seriously. We are prepared to take whatever action 
is required in order to hit them. That is the commitment of the 
Prime Minister; it is the commitment of the government and it is 
a commitment on which the House can rely.
<P>
	What adds to the uncertainty is the fact that over the last 10 
years governments have not hit their targets. We think it is very 
important that a government hits its targets, and we are going to 
hit our target.
<P>
	I certainly share the view of the leader of the Reform Party 
that the country's excessive indebtedness weighs heavily on it 
and is a cause of some uncertainty. I also share the view of the 
Prime Minister that the irresponsible statements made by 
certain members of the Bloc Quebecois and the leader of the 
Parti Quebecois are doing a great deal to damage our ability to 
create jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we do not disagree with the fact that one of the government's 
problems is created by the uncertainty generated by the 
sovereignist option. I suggest that one of the government's 
bigger problems-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The separatist option.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> One of the government's bigger problems, Mr. 
Speaker, is that it does not really have a strong mandate from the 
public to cut the deficit to the extent that it should be cut. The 
government did not seek that mandate in the 1993 election. It 
downplayed the seriousness of the deficit and now it is paying 
the price.
<P>
	Do not the growing uncertainty and the need to address it 
more seriously give the minister an additional basis now to go 
out and rally public support for deficit fighting? In other words, 
is there not now an opportunity to go out and get the public 
support he did not get during the election to tackle the deficit in

throughout the election campaign that our interim goal was a 
deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP within three years and that our 
ultimate goal was to eliminate it. That is what we said to the 
Canadian people and that is what we are going to do.
<P>
	At the same time we also made it very clear, unlike the 
Reform Party, that we understood the economy is complex and 
there are many ways to approach the objectives. Cutting 
government expenditures is not the only way. Nor is it a way that 
will do it on its own.
<P>
	What must be done if we are going to eliminate the deficit is to 
put Canadians back to work, and that is what we are going to do.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday we received conflicting economic signals: interest 
rates are up; GDP growth is up. Does the minister agree that 
higher interest rates due to Quebec uncertainty threaten to choke 
any economic recovery? How does the minister intend to 
respond to this circumstance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Develop- 
ment-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the very strong numbers that the 
member mentions for the month of March occurred during a 
period of rising interest rates. At the same time, as the member 
knows, the recovery began when interest rates were in fact 
higher than they are at this stage.
<P>
	I think it is very clear that the recovery in Canada is 
sufficiently well anchored that in most areas of the economy, 
certainly those that are creating jobs like goods production, the 
high interest rates have not yet begun to stifle the recovery.
<P>
	In terms of the uncertainty that has been created by statements 
made by certain people who are pursuing an unpalatable 
political option, there is no doubt in my mind that those 
statements are destroying jobs.
<P>
	I think that one should appeal to all political leaders to desist 
from the kinds of things that are taking food out of the mouths of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate the minister's answer. It is very true there are 
statements that are affecting our economy and potential growth. 
This was supported by senior economists from Wood Gundy and 
Patty Croft as of yesterday's statement which was very clearly 
stated.
<P>
	Higher interest rates are seen to be there because of the 
separatist discussion that is going on. It is threatening the 
government's 3 per cent deficit reduction targets. I believe that 
is happening.
<P>
	Are the minister and the government prepared to bring about 
additional expenditure reductions for adjustments to the budget 
to meet their target and to assure us that they will?

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Amnesty International yesterday condemned the 
Canadian government's attitude to human rights violations in 
China. Amnesty says: ``Canada's public silence is interpreted by 
Chinese government officials as recognition that they were 
justified in crushing the democratic opposition in 1989''. 
Arbitrary detentions and trials are thought to be the norm and 
cases of mistreatment and torture are regularly reported. In 1993 
alone more than 1,400 prisoners were summarily executed.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if we are to understand that, for the 
sake of commercial interests, Canada has chosen to close its 
eyes on the thousands of Chinese still languishing in jail, a few 
days from the sad fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square 
massacre?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this government's policy has always been clear: we deplore 
regimes that do not respect people's freedom.
<P>
	We have told the Chinese government this at every 
opportunity. However, there is no international boycott of 
China. All countries in the world do business with China. We 
believe that the best way to open that society is to open it to the 
world. After trading extensively with Western countries, the 
Chinese themselves will recognize that Western values for the 
protection of human rights are the best. That is the best way to 
proceed, because if China is completely isolated and cut off, 
there will be more and more abuse.
<P>
	We believe that the method used by this government of 
condemning those people for what they do but continuing to do 
business with them, as all countries in the world do, and to offer 
them North American, Canadian or European technology is the 
best way to bring them to accept western values. Completely 
isolating them is not the way to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr.

whenever I met representatives of the Chinese government, I 
always raised the problem. I did so in Seattle and I talked about 
it to the press then and I will do the same thing.
<P>
	However, it is quite clear that the best solution for the western 
world is to open China to western values and in that way the 
Chinese will have no choice; as happened in the Soviet Union, 
when people became aware of what was happening in the west, 
the Berlin wall fell. The same thing will happen in China.

<P>
	The minister had ample time since the question was put to 
him to make the necessary inquiries. My question is as follows: 
Does he still maintain that medication was given to only 12 
people before they were deported, while his own senior officials 
admit to 20 such incidents?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. It is very crucial to keep in mind that no immigration 
officials administer or are permitted to administer medical 
assistance or prescribe any medicine for those who are being 
removed or deported.
<P>
	The only individuals who are permitted to do that, to 
recommend it, and to implement it are medical practitioners.
<P>
	In the particular case of the woman the member raises, it was a 
medical practitioner and for medical reasons that administered 
medical attention, not immigration officials.
<P>
	Second, at the time that this issue came to the fore 
approximately 9,000 individuals were removed from Canada 
last year.
<P>
	I asked my officials to give me an approximate number very 
quickly so that I could respond to the member and the officials 
told me that 12 of the 9,000 individuals who were removed 
necessitated some medical attention on the advice and 
recommendation of medical practitioners and not immigration 
officials.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
information differs. Considering how serious this issue is and 
since the minister has admitted that 12 people received such 
treatment, will the minister commit to holding an independent 
inquiry, as required under international agreements, to shed 
light on possibly illegal behaviour on the part of immigration 
officers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I am not going to have an 
inquiry for something that this member throws very loosely 
across the floor. If he has information that anyone has 
perpetrated illegal acts then he has the duty and the obligation as 
a member of Parliament to provide me with that information.
<P>
	Second, under no circumstances does any medical application 
get administered to any individual routinely for removals. When 
I put in perspective the 9,000 who were removed, approximately 
12 last year received some medical application. It was on the 
recommendation of doctors for individuals who for the most 
part were on medicine or had an ailment or a disease of some sort 
in order to take precautions during the flight.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, apparently 
the municipalities are not lining up for this funding under the 
infrastructure program. There must be something wrong with 
the program.
<P>
	Will the government now reverse its decision to add $2 billion 
to the national debt for a program that is not working?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for that supplementary question because 
it gives me an opportunity to say that there is in fact very good 
takeup of the funds. We have now reached the billion dollar 
mark of the $6 billion program.
<P>
	We well knew when we entered into this program and with the 
province of Ontario established September 30 as the deadline 
for the initial round of applications that not all would be taken 
up in the initial round. It is a two-year program and we fully 
expect there will be further allocations. We are committed to 
providing the funds for 416. The member for Leeds-Grenville 
in the House has had a lot to do ensuring that much needed 
project gets going.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport and has to do with the 
request that the Minister of Transport has received from the 
United Transportation Union concerning the alarming number 
of derailments that have taken place lately. The minister will 
have received a letter from the UTU on that matter.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	In light of its concern and the concern expressed by a railway 
carman about changing practices with respect to maintenance 
and inspection of rolling stock, I wonder if he could tell us what 
his response will be to this request.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member brings a question of great interest to people 
who work on the railways, people who travel on the railways, 
people who ship goods on the railways. We have been through an 
extremely difficult winter.
<P>
	The incidents that have occurred have been investigated, as 
the member would know, under the legislative and statutory 
requirements. We expect to respond to it. Both railways have 
indicated their very deep concerns about the number of incidents 
that did occur.
<P>
	I will make sure, in response to the member's request as well 
as representations made by the unions and others, that we look 
very carefully at the matter because it is of very serious 
importance to anyone who understands what has taken place 
through this very rigorous winter.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It seems we are going to have a rather full 
afternoon. I have two questions of privilege which I will hear 
now.

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege.
<P>
	It is obvious that a first draft of a report to the finance 
committee was leaked to the media. This leaking of a report 
which had not been considered as of that moment by the 
committee is a contempt toward the members of that committee 
who have worked so hard for four months, holding over 60 
sessions, hearing witnesses and deliberating.
<P>
	This is a contempt to Parliament because if documents of this 
nature cannot be respected, our Parliament cannot function in a 
fair and equitable way for all members. I would ask that 
whatever possible be done to get rid of this deliberate leaking of 
documents in contempt of committees and in contempt of 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before going any further into the question of 
privilege that the hon. member raises, perhaps it would be more 
in keeping with the practice that we have had so far if the finance 
committee were to look into the matter and report to the House 
itself.
<P>
	This ruling was made earlier by Speaker Jerome, and if the 
hon. member would take that under advisement the Chair will 
continue discussions with the hon. member.
<P>
	I have a second question of privilege.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order of which I have given notice to you and to the 
parties in the House.
<P>
	It has to do with the fact that we in the New Democratic Party 
have not been recognized as a party in the House since the 
beginning of this Parliament. In doing so I am fully aware that 
certain decisions relating to our current lack of party status were 
taken before you were elected as Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	I am therefore making these arguments with no intention 
whatsoever of pointing a finger at the Chair or at anyone else for 
that matter. The fact that we have been seated in the House as if 
we were independent members is a good example of what I 
mean. The seating plan took shape before you were elected as 
our Speaker, but it is only the most concrete symbol of the whole 
situation that I want to call into question today.
<P>
	I have not raised this earlier because I thought it was 
appropriate for the House to become acquainted with itself after 
the unprecedented upheaval of the last election. This place 
operates not only on the basis of written rules but also on the 
authority of a large body of conventions which come from 
parliamentary practice. I thought it best to wait until the many 
new members had an opportunity to become familiar with the 
importance of conventions in the makeup of our day to day 
parliamentary constitution.
<P>
	However, with respect to the issue I wish to raise today, the 
real conventions of this place and the conventional wisdom are 
not always the same. The recent conventional wisdom has been 
that the 12-member threshold for party status is a hard and fast 
rule understood in an unambiguous way by all concerned.
<P>
	My point today is that the question of party status has in fact 
been governed by unwritten convention and practice and that the 
only thing that is hard and fast is the question of which parties 
qualify for certain moneys. I begin by making it absolutely clear 
that what I am seeking is not a change in those sections of the 
Parliament of Canada Act which pertain to money, but a 
recognition that that statute applies only to money and that all 
else is a matter of convention, practice and the discretion of the 
Speaker as the Chair seeks to fulfil its historic role as the 
protector of the House itself and the minorities therein.
<P>
	There are no unambiguous definitions of parties in 
legislation, in the standing orders or in the procedural 
authorities, and yet parties are essential to the efficient 
operation of the House. Their officers, leaders, House leaders 
and whips try to facilitate what all of us do here as we discharge 
our public responsibilities.
<P>
	Parties present themselves to the House as parties and are not 
created or disposed of by the House itself. Our membership in 
our respective parties is a matter between ourselves, our fellow 
caucus colleagues, our extraparliamentary organizations and 
ultimately our electors. We can leave our parties or be asked to 
leave our parties. We can create new parties, merge two parties 
into one, as did the Progressives and the Conservatives, or 
change the name of our parties as we in the New Democratic 
Party did.
<P>
	The tradition of this place has been for the Speaker to accept 
the party affiliation that the parties and the members report to 
him or her. Yet since the beginning of this Parliament the Chair 
has not accepted the party affiliation that we in the New 
Democratic Party clearly possess.
<P>
	The only possible precedent for this is the way in which the 
Bloc Quebecois was treated in the last Parliament. All other 
precedents, including the way the one Reform member was 
treated prior to the formation of the Bloc, points to the injustice 
and inappropriateness of the way the NDP is now being treated.
<P>
	I would ask members to listen to my argument before they 
judge it. The authority for not treating us as a party has 
apparently been the Parliament of Canada Act which since 1963 
has set out a threshold of 12 members for parties whose officers 
are granted special allowances and subsequently for parties 
whose members may sit on the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
	My point today is first to show that the wording of the 
Parliament of Canada Act does not empower or require the Chair 
to withhold recognition from parties with fewer than 12 
members in spite of the conventional wisdom. Second, I am 
asking the Chair to follow the established practice of 
recognizing such parties in the House.
<P>
	Let us then look at the wording in the Parliament of Canada 
Act. The words in section 62 read that the officers of ``a party 
that has a recognized membership of 12 or more persons in the 
House'' shall receive a variety of allowances. It does not say that 
a party must have 12 members to be a recognized party and 
clearly assumes that parties with fewer than 12 members are 
indeed parties.
<P>
	In section 50 caucuses that do ``not have a recognized 
membership of 12'' are not entitled to have representatives on 
the Board of Internal Economy but are clearly to be construed as 
still being caucuses.
<P>
	These clauses are worded in such a way that the question of 
other forms of recognition is at worst left open. At best the 
wording of the statute seems to imply that party as a concept is 
something independent of numbers and that 12 is the number of 
seats an already recognized party must have in order to qualify 
for money but not for recognition as such. Recognition of parties 
with fewer than 12 members is already implicit in the wording of 
the statute itself. If the Parliament of Canada Act says anything 
about official party status then it confirms rather than denies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4704"> 4704 </A></B>
<P>
that party status itself is distinct from the financial provisions of 
the act.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	There being no clear and precise legal definition of party 
status, we may ask how the financial provisions of the 
Parliament of Canada Act came to be confused with the 
acceptance of party status in the House.
<P>
	Shortly after the passage of the 12-member threshold 
amendments in 1963, the Ralliement Créditiste divided 
themselves from the Social Credit Party which was left with 
only 11 members. In the ensuing debates about the new seating 
arrangements, the new 12-member threshold was loosely 
applied to questions of parliamentary practice as the House 
sought to deal with the fact that two parties had been created out 
of one, a situation quite unlike the one in which the NDP now 
finds itself.
<P>
	Indeed, in the last Parliament the 12-member threshold was 
also used to deal with the formation of the Bloc out of defectors 
from the Liberal and Conservative parties, another situation 
totally different from that of the NDP in this Parliament.
<P>
	John C. Courtney, a political scientist who published a paper 
on party recognition in March 1978 in a volume of the <I>Canadian 
Journal of Political Science</I>, explained the development of the 
misreading of the 12-member threshold very effectively:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Technically the 12-member threshold in the 1963 act and parliamentary 
procedure had nothing to do with one another, yet the timing of the events was 
virtually certain to produce a combination that would lead to the injection of the 
phrase ``recognized membership of 12 or more persons in the House of 
Commons'' into future debates over regulations and statutes dealing with 
political parties. The term, indeed more specifically the number, would 
gradually assume an authenticity of its own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The view that the 12-member threshold constitutes a hard and 
fast rule in law about party status in this House is in fact an 
illusion. However, in an illustration of the old maximum that 
hard cases make bad law, misapplications designed to deal with 
divided and/or new parties are now side swiping the NDP in the 
absence of an appropriate will to discern the difference between 
some previous situations and the situation we find ourselves in 
at the moment.
<P>
	A more reliable legislative authority for determining party 
status can be found in the Canada Elections Act. In sections 24 
through 42 of that act, it is clear that parties lose party status not 
when they fall below the 12-member threshold but only when 
they fail to file certain documents or when they fail to officially 
nominate candidates in at least 50 constituencies 30 days before 
polling day.
<P>
	Even though there is no question that the New Democratic 
Party is now a registered party under that act, in the House we 
are treated as if we were independents, no differently than some 
other members who do not belong to a party registered under the 
Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	To this point, informal arguments against the way we are 
being treated are often met with the argument that real 
independents could make a similar claim, that it is a primarily a 
question of degree and that a line has to be drawn somewhere. If 
the Canada Elections Act were taken into account this argument 
would hold even less water than it does now if that were 
possible.
<P>
	There is therefore no legal authority, either in the Parliament 
of Canada Act-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have given the hon. member a great deal of 
latitude in putting forth his point of order and, if I might 
comment, it is very well researched. I was wondering perhaps if 
the hon. member could now move to summarize on this 
particular point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie</B> Mr. Speaker, I would hope you and the House 
would realize that this argument takes some time to make. I will 
move as quickly as I can to the conclusion of my argument. 
However it is not something that we do every day here and I 
would like my argument to be heard, if that is possible. I will try 
to move as quickly as I can.
<P>
	There is no legal authority, either in the Parliament of Canada 
Act or in the Canada Elections Act, for withholding recognition 
from us.
<P>
	Past Speakers have not, moreover, applied the 12-member 
threshold to questions of party recognition. I would now like to 
direct your attention, Mr. Speaker, to a number of the relevant 
precedents which is perfectly in order with what a good point of 
order should be like, arguing from precedent.
<P>
	The first and most relevant precedent is the party status 
accorded to the CCF after the 1958 election. Electing eight 
members to the House the CCF was then in a very similar 
position to that of the NDP in this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	In 1958 the CCF continued to enjoy its full rights as an 
opposition party. CCF members were seated as a party in the 
House and were treated as a party in debate and during Question 
Period. The party leader was treated as a party leader in debate 
on the speech from the throne, being recognized immediately 
after Mr. Pearson and Mr. Diefenbaker. CCF members also sat as 
full members on committees.
<P>
	After the 1963 introduction of the 12-member threshold, 
Speakers regularly interpreted the act as one that granted certain 
financial benefits to parties with more than 12 members. 
However that did not take away any other rights of parties that 
had fewer than 12 members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4705"> 4705 </A></B>
<P>
	On February 18, 1966 for instance, Speaker Lamoureux 
allowed representatives of the Social Credit Party and the 
Ralliement Créditiste to respond to ministerial statements 
under what is now Standing Order 33(1), even though they had 
only five and nine members respectively. He argued that he did 
not see how the standing order concerning the right of 
opposition parties to respond to ministers' statements could be 
``interpreted in light of the amendment to the Parliament of 
Canada Act'', <I>Hansard</I>, February 18, 1966, page 1435.
<P>
	The force of the tradition of protecting the rights and status of 
small parties can be seen again in the treatment of the Social 
Credit Party after the 1974 election. With only 11 members the 
Social Credit Party once again fell below the legal threshold of 
12 members required in order to receive financial benefits. The 
Board of Internal Economy nonetheless granted the Social 
Credit Party $50,000 for research purposes at its meeting of 
October 22, 1974, a meeting attended by the present Prime 
Minister and by Mr. Mitchell Sharp.
<P>
	I am raising this point not to ask for similar financial benefits, 
but to illustrate how previous Parliaments have protected the 
rights of small parties so assiduously that they sometimes have 
ignored the 12-member threshold on financial matters.
<P>
	In 1979 in a Parliament in which I myself participated the 
Social Credit Party sent only five members to the House. A 
striking committee did not include a member from the Social 
Credit Party although they did sit in the front row of the House, 
right down in that corner.
<P>
	There was a motion by the Social Credit member that his party 
should have a representative on the striking committee. In the 
ensuing debate on October 9, 1979, it was made clear by the 
Conservative government and Liberal opposition that what was 
at stake was not only the particular issue of the membership of 
the striking committee but also the party status of the Social 
Credit caucus.
<P>
	When the Social Credit motion failed, Speaker Jerome at first 
decided that the motion obliged him not to grant the Social 
Credit members party status. On October 10 he did not 
recognize their leader in the debate on the speech from the 
throne. His ruling can be found on page 69 of <I>Hansard</I> for 
October 11, 1979.
<P>
	The next month Mr. Speaker, your predecessor, Speaker 
Jerome, revised his position and took into account the important 
responsibility of the Chair to protect minorities in the House. In 
debate on an opposition no confidence motion on November 6, 
1979, Speaker Jerome recognized the leader of the Social Credit 
in debate immediately after the other opposition party leaders. 
He gave an eloquent justification for his decision from which I 
would like to quote. It is an important piece of evidence because 
it qualifies the original ruling of October 11 published in the 
edition of Speaker Jerome's rulings.
<P>
	I quote: ``We ought to be clear at the outset that it is not a 
transgression of propriety to mention the name of the political 
party of the members who are involved; it is the Social Credit 
Party of Canada. Its members are members of this House of 
Commons and their leader is the hon. member for Beauce. Those 
are the realities. The vote''-on the striking committee 
motion-``under no circumstances, may I say, can be taken to 
pass out of existence a political party, nor can it be taken to 
render as independent members the group which has been 
recognized as a party and which has in fact been seated together 
as a political party. The Social Credit Party exists as a political 
party and the five members exist as members of that party under 
their leader''.
<P>
	He went on to say that even though the House had expressed 
itself on the question of the membership of the striking 
committee, he had certain responsibilities as Speaker.
<P>
	Again, I quote Speaker Jerome: ``It seems to me that the 
responsibility of the Chair and the responsibility of the House of 
Commons is to protect whatever rights minorities do enjoy and 
therefore it seems to me that I must conclude what it is that the 
members of the Social Credit Party are entitled to-.I think that 
what those members are entitled to respects the fact that they are 
members of a political party so long as it does not give them an 
advantage that they would not otherwise enjoy as five members 
and secondly so long as it does not deprive other members of 
their right to participate in some way''. <I>Hansard</I>, November 6, 
1979, pages 1008-9.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	This is the approach to the question of party status I am asking 
you to take toward myself and my colleagues in the New 
Democratic Party in the House. We are asking you to recognize 
us as a party in the House just as previous Speakers have 
recognized small parties in the past.
<P>
	One result of previous Speakers' recognition of small parties 
can be seen in the seating plans of past Parliaments. I would like 
to table some of these past seating plans for your consideration. 
I submit these for your consideration because they show that 
parties with fewer than 12 members have indeed been 
designated as parties and seated as parties with representation 
on the front benches.
<P>
	I draw your attention in particular to the seating plan dated 
April 1989 where even only one member, the member for Beaver 
River, was designated as a member of the Reform Party. As I 
mentioned earlier however, this designation of the member for 
Beaver River disappeared with the advent of the Bloc and the 
decision not to treat it as a party. Currently the nine NDP 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4706"> 4706 </A></B>
<P>
members in the House are afforded no such appropriate 
nomenclature in the seating plan of this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will recognize that he has 
had every latitude. I have had indications that other members 
will want to participate in this point of order. I would ask the 
hon. member to wrap up now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will wrap up. However, if I might 
be so bold as to say on my point of order, if I am being irrelevant 
or I am not speaking to the point, but I believe that I am-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The Chair in no way indicates that the 
point of order is irrelevant. The Chair has heard a great many of 
the very relevant arguments the hon. member has put forward. 
The Chair at this point would ask again respectfully, that the 
hon. member come to a conclusion. Then we can have other 
views on this point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will indeed come to a conclusion.
<P>
	The weight of almost all the evidence in both law and 
convention therefore comes down in support of our claim to be 
recognized in this House as the party that we clearly are. The 
only precedent that breaks the pattern is the treatment of the 
Bloc in the last Parliament.
<P>
	At this point I do not wish to open the question of whether a 
party that forms between elections as a result of defections from 
existing parties should enjoy the same status as a party of 
members who sought election under their party banner. I do not 
want to enter into that debate.
<P>
	What I do want to argue is that your ruling on party status 
should be based on a clear reading of the law and on the 
overwhelming number of precedents in support of our claim to 
party status, not on a single problematic precedent that itself 
broke with all precedent.
<P>
	I will say what we are asking for so that you are absolutely 
clear of what I am on my feet about.
<P>
	We ask first that the seating arrangements be adjusted to seat 
us as a party with proper precedence given to our leader as a 
leader and as a Privy Councillor, and that the published seating 
plan identify us as New Democrats, as is already the case in 
<I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	We ask that we be treated as an opposition party during 
question period where at present we are recognized only very 
rarely, systematically denied supplementaries and always 
relegated to the last question.
<P>
	I would point out that in the last Parliament the leader of the 
Bloc was regularly recognized at about two-thirds of the way 
through question period. I direct your attention to <I>Hansard</I> of 
1993 for February 11 and 25, March 9 and 24 and May 4. 
Therefore, it is clear that the leader of the New Democratic Party 
has been treated in an unprecedented manner and that due 
consideration should be given to changing the way our leader 
has been treated since the opening of this Parliament.
<P>
	My final point, for guidance on this matter let us return to Mr. 
Jerome's ruling of November 6, 1979. He said regarding the 
rights of small parties: ``Participation in question period is their 
right, the same as any group of five members. It is not difficult 
to calculate mathematically what five members are entitled to as 
a proportion of the membership of the other parties''. <I>Hansard</I>, 
page 1009.
<P>
	If we apply Mr. Jerome's arithmetic to the situation in this 
Parliament, NDP members comprise 8 per cent of the opposition 
members and are therefore entitled to roughly 8 per cent of the 
opposition questions. By my calculations in a typical week there 
are some 125 questions and supplementaries posed by 
opposition members of which we should be entitled to 10. In 
practice you typically recognize us for only two questions per 
week. Occasionally you have not recognized us at all, as in the 
week beginning April 11 and only once have you recognized us 
for as many as four questions.
<P>
	We therefore ask that we get the number of questions due to a 
party of nine members, that our leader be recognized after the 
leader of the Reform Party, that we be allowed supplementaries, 
and that we not always be relegated to the last question.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, we ask that in general we be treated as a party under 
the Standing Orders and that you work with our caucus officers 
in the customary ways to facilitate the operations of the House. 
My party colleagues and I are asking only that we not be 
discriminated against simply because we did not meet an 
arbitrary threshold of dubious relevance that has not even 
customarily been applied by previous Speakers to procedures in 
the House, against which there is ample parliamentary 
precedent for alternative approaches.
<P>
	We have every confidence that you will see the merit in our 
case and we look forward to the results of your review of this 
question. We are not asking you to rule on this in a hurry, Mr. 
Speaker. However we certainly hope that by the time Parliament 
resumes its business in the fall after the summer recess that 
some changes will have been made along the lines which I have 
suggested in this point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The point of order is indeed a very important 
one. That is one of the reasons the Chair gave every latitude to 
hear all of the arguments.
<P>
	Are there other interventions? The hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was impressed with the very able argument of the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Transcona on this important point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4707"> 4707 </A></B>
<P>
	I was also amazed because my recollection is that during the 
last election campaign, one of the pitches the New Democratic 
Party put to the Canadian public was that they should vote NDP 
in order that they could have 12 seats in Parliament and 
therefore be recognized as a party, because if they did not get 
those votes and did not get those seats then somehow Canada 
was going to suffer terribly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> It is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> It is not. The hon. member says it is but of 
course it is not. It is doing better than it was. I think that is in 
large measure because there are fewer New Democrats in the 
House, but I do not want to get into that. It is irrelevant to the 
issue.
<P>
	The fact is there are fewer members of the New Democratic 
Party here today. The hon. member has raised a point about the 
representation of the party in the House. Some of those points, 
Mr. Speaker, are ones you will want to consider when you review 
the arguments put forward by the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona.
<P>
	Many of the rulings he has mentioned are accurate citations. 
However, I think he has ignored, perhaps deliberately, some of 
the rulings of Mr. Speaker Fraser on this issue in the last eight or 
nine years. They have significantly altered the thinking in 
respect of the application of the Parliament of Canada Act to the 
Standing Orders of the House.
<P>
	I refer Your Honour to the decisions of the Speakers under 
Standing Order 33, which as Your Honour recalls allows for 
ministers to make statements in the House on Statements by 
Ministers and for the opposition parties to respond to them. The 
question of who constitutes an opposition party for the purposes 
of Standing Order 33 has led to the use of the Parliament of 
Canada Act as the criteria for making that decision.
<P>
	I note that when this very argument took place in the last 
Parliament the New Democratic Party fully supported the 
position taken at that time by the government, by the opposition 
and by the New Democratic Party as the third party. The position 
was that one required 12 seats in the House in order to have the 
right to make a reply to a statement under Statements by 
Ministers. That effectively excluded the Bloc Quebecois at that 
time from participating under Standing Order 33.
<P>
	I would feel much more sympathetic toward the position of 
the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona had he and his 
colleagues taken a different position in the last Parliament, but 
of course they did not. They may have been wrong at the time; 
we all might have been wrong. I invite Your Honour in 
considering the matter to review the authorities at that time.
<P>
	I also think it fair to bear in mind in looking at this that the 
hon. member says he is not asking for money. He is not asking 
that the Parliament of Canada Act's financial provisions be 
applied to his party. I agree with him.
<P>
	I recall when his colleague, the hon. member for Kamloops, 
shortly after the election said he was going to put a pitch for 
money in the House there was a howl of outrage from the 
Canadian populace. The hon. member for Sherbrooke made the 
same kind of suggestion, that he should have money for his party 
and the outrage in the Canadian public was palpable. I received 
many letters on the subject expressing extreme disagreement 
with the thought of giving money to these other parties when 
they had been properly thrashed by the electorate for the poor 
service they had rendered Canadians in the previous Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I sympathize with Canadians in their judgment. I agreed with 
Canadians in their judgment and I, for one, was not prepared to 
give that additional money. Therefore I am pleased that he has 
not done that today.
<P>
	On the other hand, he has raised some points that the Chair 
ought to consider. They are ones, considering the equities of the 
situation, that ought to be reviewed very carefully. I invite the 
Chair to take into consideration everything that the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Transcona said and render a decision to the House 
that will be fair and equitable as between all the members, based 
on his submission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a request similar to this one was made at the beginning 
of the session by the member for Sherbrooke, on behalf of 
himself and his colleague, therefore on behalf of the entire 
caucus of the former Conservative Party. At the time, the 
Speaker refused to recognize the Conservative Party.
<P>
	Therefore, this subject has been debated. At the time, I 
pointed out that the arguments raised by the Conservatives, and 
again today by the NDP, were raised three years ago by the Bloc 
Quebecois. The Speaker of the day had ruled that these 
arguments were not valid enough to formally recognize the 
Bloc. We have since come to agree with the Speaker's ruling. I 
have considered all the arguments put forward by my colleague 
and I believe that the rule of 12 continues to apply, except under 
certain circumstances.
<P>
	Most of these circumstances arise when there is a minority 
government in the House. Such was the case in 1979, 1963 and 
1957 when the parties agreed to recognize a party without 12 
members. For reasons that are fairly obvious, the Clark 
government may have needed the support of the Ralliement 
créditiste. Moreover, we saw what happened when they later 
withdrew their support. Therefore, in some specific instances, 
primarily when there is a minority government, official status 
will be granted to a party that does not have the required number 
of sitting members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4708"> 4708 </A></B>
<P>
	It has also been argued that the same rules should not apply 
to parties who did not field candidates during the election, as 
was the case with the Bloc at the time. One of the examples 
given by my colleague was the Ralliement des créditistes, a 
party formed in 1963. Need members be reminded that this 
party did not exist at the time of the election? Then, the party 
was known as the Social Credit Party and it was headed by Mr. 
Thompson. A split developed within the ranks and Mr. Caouette 
founded the Ralliement des créditistes, a party which had not 
formally existed at the time of the election, a situation similar 
to that of the Bloc. Yet, the government of the day recognized 
the Ralliement des créditistes precisely because it was a 
minority government. The situation was quite different when 
the Bloc came into being. However, the Ralliement was no more 
a party at the time of the election than the Bloc was.
<P>
	Therefore, the precedent exists for granting official status to a 
new party, although it was not considered when the Bloc 
requested such status. However, with respect to my colleague's 
question concerning the seating arrangement in the House, I will 
concede that the Bloc members were allowed to sit next to one 
another, pursuant to an agreement between all independent 
members. As I recall, we had reached an agreement with the 
Reform member and the two independents, Mr. Kindy and Mr. 
Knowlan. If there is agreement among the independents, I see no 
reason why the NDP members cannot sit next to each other. 
Provided, of course, there is agreement.
<P>
	As regards identification, I think the hon. member is right. 
The Bloc's name appeared in <I>Hansard</I> and during the televised 
debates. I do not know if it is the case now for the NDP, but it was 
for us. I think this could be done for them. We did not get that 
recognition at the beginning. We raised the issue in various more 
or less pleasant ways and, it the end, we succeeded in having the 
name of our party appear on TV and in <I>Hansard</I>. I think we could 
apply that decision to grant the same privilege, with respect to 
the number of questions per week.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I am rather surprised to hear that Lucien Bouchard, the leader 
of the Bloc, was allowed to ask many questions. In fact, the 
figures show that, on average, he asked one and a half question 
per week. Whether that question had a major impact is a totally 
different issue which has nothing to do with the number of 
questions itself but, rather, with their quality. Again, the figures 
show that, on average, Mr. Bouchard asked 1.5 question per 
week, which is about what the NDP is allowed. I might add that 
those questions are always the last ones of the day, at about two 
minutes before three o'clock. In this regard, also, there is no 
change, compared to what the Bloc experienced.
<P>
	These are the comments I wanted to make to help you make a 
decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be reasonably brief.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona for 
giving notice of his point of order. I would like to make a few 
comments on it, though first of all I would like to quote from 
<I>Hansard</I> of November 27, 1990, when a similar point of order 
was being discussed. At that time Ian Waddell, the New 
Democratic Party member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, argued 
in the House with regard to the Bloc Quebecois saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not a party. It does not have 12 people. Those are the rules. They should 
stop whining. The House has been very liberal to them and I find it shocking when 
they get up and whine, bitch and complain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With regard to participation in question period and in 
members' statements, the House has been very generous with 
independent members and the Chair has been very generous, 
considering that very likely the New Democratic caucus has the 
poorest attendance record in the House.
<P>
	I would like to get to some of the arguments that the member 
made with regard to having official party status. In 1974 the 
Ralliement Créditiste brought 11 members to the House of 
Commons. Despite their having less than 12 members all 
privileges which come with party recognition were given to 
them except for the extra stipend given to the leaders of the 
parties, other than the Prime Minister and the Leader of the 
Opposition, with at least 12 members.
<P>
	In October 1979 Prime Minister Clark was in the process of 
setting up his new government. He put forward the names for 
composition of the striking committee and moved approval by 
the House. Initially one issue raised for decision by the House 
was whether the Ralliement Créditiste with six members should 
be represented on the striking committee. Mr. Clark moved 
approval of the committee with no Créditiste. Mr. Roy of the 
Créditiste put forward an amendment to the motion to include a 
Créditiste.
<P>
	Mr. MacEachen, House leader for the Liberals, raised the 
following additional issues for consideration: first, whether the 
group would enjoy the status, particularly the leader of that 
group, equivalent in standing to that of the Leader of the 
Opposition, who was Mr. Trudeau, and the leader of the New 
Democratic Party; second, whether they would have full status 
of other parties in respect of the question period; and, third, 
whether they would have full status of other parties in respect of 
statements on motions in response to ministerial statements.
<P>
	Additionally, Mr. Knowles, the House leader for the New 
Democratic Party, who is now a member at the table, reiterated 
some of the above arguments and added a fourth issue for 
consideration. He stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it has come to be thought that 12 members were required for party 
status, we overstepped it when the party had only 11 members last time.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4709"> 4709 </A></B>
<P>
	He was referring to 1974. He further stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can a party that has used a name in election come here and claim all of the 
advantages that go with party status regardless of how small it is?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is from <I>Debates</I>, October 9, 1979, page 13.
<P>
	Mr. Knowles, Mr. MacEachen and others argued to the 
Speaker against party status for a party with less than 12 
members in the House. The outcome of this deliberation and the 
decision of the House rendered by recorded division was nay. 
The Speaker twice refused to overturn the decision of the House 
on appeal from the Creditiste even when attention was called to 
the popular vote which the Ralliement Créditiste received. That 
is in House of Commons Debates, October 10, 1979.
<P>
	Other issues are that the stipend which is given to leaders of 
parties with at least 12 members, excluding the Prime Minister 
and Leader of the Opposition, is covered by the Parliament of 
Canada Act which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to each member of the House of Commons, other than the Prime Minister 
or the member occupying the position of Leader of the Opposition in the House 
of Commons, who is a leader of a party that has a recognized membership of 12 
or more persons in the House-</BLOCKQUOTE>
This can only be changed by a legislative amendment, not by a 
ruling of the Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	A final issue connected with recognition of parties in the 
House has to do with research funding. The requirement that 
parties must have at least 12 members can be waived by the 
Board of Internal Economy which includes three opposition 
members.
<P>
	My conclusion is that if the House were to grant recognition 
of the New Democrats or the Progressive Conservatives as 
parties in the House they should first address the precedents 
against recognizing parties with fewer than 12 members, 
including the 1979 precedent.
<P>
	It should be noted that in addition to Messrs. Clark, 
MacEachen and Knowles, that Messrs. Chrétien, Axworthy, 
Gray, Kilgour, MacLaren, Masse and others voted nay to the 
amendment. Further, it should be noted that the Speaker at that 
time refused to overturn the decision on appeal since the House 
had raised these issues and put them to a vote.
<P>
	Therefore a decision of any of the issues given should be 
given careful consideration by the Speaker of the 35th 
Parliament. The independent members in the House should not 
be given recognition beyond what should be accorded by any 
individual member unless the House agrees to give such 
recognition.
<P>
	In brief summation, the recourse of the members of the New 
Democratic Party is to appeal to the House for changes in the 
legislation whereby they would be recognized. We believe it 
should not be an appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, to make a ruling on 
this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The case has been well put today and well 
documented. The Chair thanks all hon. members who have taken 
the time to advise the Chair. I have heard from all parties in the 
House, including interventions made by the independents.
<P>
	I will undertake to review the entire transcript of today, look 
at all of the precedents mentioned and come back to the House 
with some recommendations on the matter.
<P>
	The Chair feels this is not a new issue to Parliament. I feel that 
the arguments have been very well made. I believe that I have 
received enough information at this point on which to at least 
base the beginnings of my own studies to come back to this 
House with a decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUSINESSOFTHEHOUSE">BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this point of order addresses another matter entirely.
<P>
	Citation 317 of Beauchesne's sixth edition states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Points of order are questions raised with the view of calling attention to 
any departure from the Standing Orders or the customary modes of proceeding 
in debate or in the conduct of legislative business-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to address my comments to the conduct of 
legislative business.
<P>
	In a statement last Thursday, the government House leader 
indicated that the business for today would be Bill C-18, the 
Electoral Boundaries Redistribution Act. Instead we were 
advised at the House leader's meeting yesterday that we would 
be debating Bill C-34, an act respect Yukon self-government.
<P>
	Although Bill C-34 was put on notice on May 25, it was not 
introduced until yesterday.
<P>
	There is a concern here. How can the government expect the 
House to properly conduct legislative business when it does not 
even give members 24 hours to review the legislation before it is 
debated in the House?
<P>
	Every Canadian will recognize that aboriginal 
self-government is an important national issue and deserves 
proper attention. The Reform Party has shown a willingness to 
co-operate with the government. We would ask you, Mr. 
Speaker, to use all powers and influence at your disposal to 
move the government toward conduct of legislated business that 
permits the members of the House to effectively fulfil their 
mandate as elected representatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4710"> 4710 </A></B>
<P>
	Standing Order 1 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by other Order of the House, 
procedural questions shall be decided by the Speaker or Chairman, whose 
decisions shall be based on the usage, forms, customs and precedents of the 
House of Commons of Canada and on parliamentary tradition in Canada and 
other jurisdictions-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We would ask that you consider this standing order when 
making your ruling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster has raised a point 
which I submit is not a point of order.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The government is entitled to call whatever business it wishes 
on any given day with or without notice other than notice that 
has to be given at six o'clock to prepare the documents. It can be 
changed at the last minute, right up until the time it is called. 
That has been the invariable practice in this House.
<P>
	I recognize that the hon. member is new to this place. Had he 
been in the last House, he would know that it was quite common 
for the government to call business without proper notice, with 
very limited notice and frequently to change the business 
overnight, having announced one day what it would be to change 
it for the next day. We were in a constant state of flux trying to 
know what kind of business we conducted.
<P>
	The problem is that the hon. member and the members of the 
opposition have been spoiled in this House because the 
government has been so careful in giving extensive notice in 
almost every case of the business it is calling.
<P>
	Unfortunately today the government was not in a position to 
proceed with Bill C-18. It is proceeding instead with Bill C-34. 
I admit that it was only introduced yesterday, but it is not a 
complex matter. It is thick but it is not complex. The Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development will soon give a 
speech that will elucidate every nook and cranny of the bill, and 
I invite the hon. member to remain for that speech.
<P>
	There is no point of order here.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask all hon. members to refer to 
Chapter VI of the standing orders at page 23:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>40.(1) All items standing on the Orders of the Day, except Government 
Orders, shall be taken up according to the precedence assigned to each on the 
Order Paper.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Government Orders shall be called and considered in such sequence as the 
government determines.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore I would rule that there is no point of order in this 
case.
<P>
	I would like to make a ruling.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLC-216-SPEAKER'SRULING">BILL C-216-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> During Private Members' Business on 
Wednesday, May 11, 1994, the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur raised a point of order concerning 
Standing Order 73 and Bill C-216, standing under his name on 
the Order Paper. At that time I stated that the terms of the 
standing order are unambiguous. It reads in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Immediately after the reading of the Order of the Day for the second reading of 
any public bill, a Minister of the Crown may propose a motion that the said bill be 
forthwith referred to a standing, special or legislative committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly, the prerogatives of Standing Order 73 are for 
ministers of the Crown. For this reason, backbenchers cannot 
exercise them. Therefore the Chair cannot accept the hon. 
member's argument.
<P>
	The hon. member raised a very interesting point by drawing a 
parallel between Standing Orders 68 and 73, definitely 
suggesting that an amendment to Standing Order 73 could give 
backbenchers the same prerogatives as the minister.
<P>
	The Chair has taken this matter under advisement and is now 
ready to make a ruling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that having looked at the text of 
Standing Order 73 and examined its context, the Chair has no 
doubt that the ministerial prerogative it grants applies only to 
government public bills. While I must concede that the phrase 
``any public bill'' might lead to ambiguity, the Chair could not 
accept as appropriate the application of Standing Order 73 by a 
minister with reference to a private members' bill. In my view 
such an approach would have the practical effect of 
transforming a private members' initiative into an item of 
government business and so violate the spirit that underlies our 
standing orders and our practice, namely, the absolute 
separation of government business and private members' 
business.
<P>
	However the suggestion of redrafting Standing Order 73 to 
grant to the sponsor of a private member's bill the same 
prerogatives with regard to that bill that a minister of the crown 
enjoys with regard to a government bill seems to merit further 
consideration. It would, as I see it, offer a means for making an 
item votable that would create an alternative to the existing 
procedure, an alternative which many members might welcome. 
I would therefore suggest with respect that, under the terms of 
this ongoing mandate to study House operations and procedure 
and notably, its existing responsibilities vis-à-vis Private 
Members' Business, the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs take this matter under consideration.

	I wish to thank the hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur 
for raising the subject and thus reminding the House of the 
obligation which all members have to ensure that their rights are 
maintained, while taking an innovative attitude to the evolution 
of these rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not certain whether this is a 
point of order or not but I stand as a duly elected member of the 
House of Commons to ask for your guidance with respect to the 
previous point of order on which I had wished to speak.
<P>
	I understand you ruled that there would be no more speakers 
on it. However it is my sense, being a duly elected member of the 
House of Commons from the constituency of 
Regina-Lumsden, on a matter of a point of order that is 
important to my constituents and to me and to others in Canada, 
that I should be allowed to express the insights I have on the 
issue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Is the hon. member referring to the point 
of order presented by the member for Winnipeg Transcona?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That being the case, the Chair had heard very 
lengthy arguments about that particular point of order. The 
Chair made the ruling on the basis that the Chair felt it had heard 
enough argument to base at least an indication that the Chair 
would look into this matter further.
<P>
	That is why I made that ruling. With all respect to the hon. 
member I am sure that he will recognize that at one point there is 
enough debate on a particular point of order for the Chair to 
make that kind of a declaration. I would ask that the hon. 
member to respect this decision.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have two petitions, both from constituents in my riding.
<P>
	In the first one petitioners are asking the government to 
maintain the present exemption on the excise portion of ethanol 
for a decade, 10 years, to allow this industry to establish itself.
<P>
	We think the ethanol industry certainly in eastern Ontario 
would make a great contribution to the farm industry.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
second petition is from citizens in my riding from places like 
Brockville, Maitland, Spencerville and Prescott petitioning 
against the importation and sale of killer cards. They applaud in 
this petition the action already taken by the Minister of National 
Revenue in announcing that his officials would seize shipments 
at the border.
<P>
	One paragraph describes it quite well. It says: `` We abhor 
crimes of violence against persons and we believe that killer 
trading cards offer nothing positive for children or adults to 
admire or emulate but rather contribute to violence''.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am pleased to present this 
petition on behalf of my constituents in Calgary Northeast who 
wish to draw the following to the attention of members in this 
House.
<P>
	Whereas the majority of Canadians are law-abiding citizens 
who respect the law, whereas the majority of Canadians respect 
the sanctity of human life, and whereas the majority of 
Canadians believe that physicians in Canada should be working 
to save lives and not to end them, therefore the petitioners state 
first, that Parliament ensure that the present provisions of the 
Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be  
enforced vigorously; and, second, that parliament make no 
changes in the law which would sanction or allow the aiding and 
abetting of suicide or active or passive euthanasia.
<P>

the efforts of those who hold such significant values and desire 
to see these values upheld.

Standing Order 36 I am asked to table yet another petition along 
with four or five others that have already been tabled from 
various individuals throughout the country who enjoy the great 
facilities that we have in Banff National Park in my riding.
<P>
	The petition reads that the stop work order at Sunshine Village 
in order to initiate yet another environmental study is an 
unnecessary cost to taxpayers. Numerous studies and public 
forums have already been held and expansion was approved by 
both Liberal and Conservative governments during the past 16 
years. Therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to allow 
the expansion at Sunshine Village as previously agreed to 
without further cost to taxpayers for repetitive environmental 
studies.

	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is with great honour that I rise today to present this petition 
asking the government to reform the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	This petition which calls for tougher laws for today's youth 
who commit violent crimes was started in my riding a couple of 
months ago by Jennifer Schuller and Tammy Carvalho, two 
grade 10 students at Mount Boucherie senior secondary school 
in Kelowna, B.C.
<P>
	Jennifer and Tammy had become so fed up with the way the 
justice system dealt with their own age group that they took it 
upon themselves to start a petition to ask their elected 
representatives to fix the problem.
<P>
	As their MP I am more than proud to convey their feelings to 
this House and to the Minister of Justice. Jennifer and Tammy 
feel as I do, that by making the Young Offenders Act tougher on 
youths who commit violent crime it will instil a feeling of 
greater responsibility for one's own actions in our young people.
<P>
	Jennifer, Tammy and I believe that reforming the act is only 
part of the solution. We as communities, we in our homes and in 
our families and in our schools must work together to create an 
environment in which our young people do not feel the need to 
act out in a violent manner. We have the responsibility to teach 
our young people that they have to be prepared to accept the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4713"> 4713 </A></B>

consequences of their actions. We cannot expect government to 
solve this problem alone.

Tammy show to the country, through the House, their intent and 
feeling.

also rise under Standing Order 36 to present a petition to the 
House from a number of citizens in the riding of 
Haldimand-Norfolk, in fact a number of grandparents in the 
riding of Haldimand-Norfolk, who would call upon the 
government to do something with the laws regarding 
grandparent access to grandchildren when there is difficulty 
between the grandparents and their own children.

	They say that in no case may a father or mother without 
serious cause place obstacles between the child and the

what is the total number of these contracts, the amount of each contract and their

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> This document provides a general 
overview of the contracting carried out by the former Supply 
and Services Canada (SSC) over a five-year period ending 
February 28, 1994. It can only be used authoritatively to show 
the number of contracts awarded, negotiated and signed in any 
given fiscal year.
<P>
	The statistics provided cannot properly be used to identify the 
effects of federal contracting in generating economic activity 
within Canada for the following reasons:
<P>
	The statistics in this report do not cover all goods and services 
purchased by the Government of Canada. SSC procures an 
estimated 55 per cent of the total goods and services bought by 
the federal government.
<P>
	The threshold of purchasing authority for indivudual 
departments was increased to $2,500 during FY 1991-92. The 
report for fiscal year 1991-92 and 1992-93 indicates less 
contracting activity than previous years as contracting 
information is retained by each department.
<P>
	SSC contracting documents list the total value of any given 
contract. Large multi-year contracts will appear within the 
statistics for the fiscal year when the contract was signed.
<P>
	SSC statistics reflect the organizational structures for 
payment used by Canadian suppliers. This is particularly true in 
those categories of goods and services which are regular, 
ongoing requirements for government. For example, for the 
purpose of billing, all federal purchases of ESSO products are 
processed through an address in Nepean, Ontario. Within SSC's 
data, all ESSO sales, regardless of where they occur in Canada, 
will be registered as having occurred in Nepean, Ontario, 
because that is ESSO's point of mailing. The reality is that fuel 
is neither refined in Nepean, nor does the oil originate from 
Ontario, nor are all ESSO products purchased in Ontario.
<P>
	Because SSC's statistical base is purely designed to reflect 
levels of contracting activity-the signing and recording of 
contract documents-extreme caution should be used in 
attempting to ascribe precision or authority to this data for any 
other purpose.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONFIRSTNATIONSSELF-GOVERNMENTACT">YUKON FIRST NATIONS SELF-GOVERNMENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that Bill C-34, an act respecting 
self-government for First Nations in the Yukon Territory, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of Bill 
C-34, the Yukon First Nations self-government act, and to urge 
the speedy passage of this important and historic piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	This act, together with the Yukon land claim settlement act 
which is also before the House, will usher in a whole new era of 
stability and opportunity for the Yukon Territory. It will provide 
Yukon First Nations with the power to govern their own affairs 
to a degree not heretofore possible. It will strengthen relations 
between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Yukoners and it will 
create an atmosphere of certainty which will encourage 
investment, development and jobs in the territory.
<P>
	For these reasons this legislation has the strong support of not 
only the Yukon First Nations but of all sectors of Yukon society. 
The council of Yukon Indians was one of the very first 
aboriginal groups to request claims negotiations following the 
decision of the then Liberal government to settle land claims in 
areas where no previous treaties or agreements were in force. 
That was more than 20 years ago and the road to claims 
settlement and self-government has been a long and sometimes 
arduous one.
<P>
	In 1986 the decision was taken to incorporate 
self-government into the negotiating process. Yukon is the first 
to come forward in Canada with both claims and 
self-government agreements. This has made the negotiations 
more complex, but in the long run I believe it will prove 
beneficial to settle both the land claim and self-government 
issues as a package so that we can begin to move ahead quickly 
on all points.
<P>
	With this legislation we are on the verge of bringing to reality 
the hopes and dreams that had been nurtured by Yukon First 
Nations for more than two decades. In scope and complexity this 
is the most ambitious self-government arrangement negotiated 
to date. The legislation is unique in a number of respects. It is 
the only self-government legislation to apply to First Nations 
representing seven different aboriginal language groups in 14 
communities. It is the only one that covers all the First Nations 
within a single province or territory.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4716"> 4716 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the terms of an umbrella final agreement signed last 
year by the federal and territorial governments and the council 
for Yukon Indians the government is committed to negotiate 
individual self-government agreements with each of the 14 
individual First Nations. In fact, four of these First Nations 
signed self-government agreements at that time. These were 
Champagne and the Aishihik First Nation, the First Nation of 
Na-cho-ny'a'k-dun, the Teslin Tlingit Council and the Vuntut 
Gwich'in First Nation.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Self-government for these First Nations which cover about 36 
per cent of the total Yukon aboriginal population will take effect 
immediately with the passage of this legislation.
<P>
	The government is currently engaged in active negotiations 
with an additional five First Nations. I am optimistic that 
several of these will be completed by the end of this year. I hope 
that the government will also commence self-government 
negotiations with at least some of the last five First Nations later 
this year.
<P>
	Overall, we expect to have completed self-government 
agreements with all 14 First Nations within five years.
<P>
	Before reviewing some of the main features of this 
legislation, I would like to make clear to the House exactly what 
we mean by self-government in the context of this bill.
<P>
	These agreements were negotiated under the previous 
government's community based self-government policy. They 
make no reference to the inherent right of self-government and 
they will not receive constitutional protection as treaty rights 
under section 35 of the Constitution Act upon passage of this 
bill.
<P>
	I have indicated to the council for Yukon Indians, however, 
that I will consider this matter very seriously and once I and my 
colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, have finished our 
consultation on the implementation of the inherent right we will 
be reporting to cabinet and back to the council of Yukon Indians.
<P>
	The principles embodied in the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms and the Constitution of Canada as a whole will 
continue to apply. First Nation constitutions will also provide 
protections for the rights and freedoms of First Nation citizens.
<P>
	Although the council for Yukon Indians has long held that 
Yukon First Nations have an inherent right of self-government 
and have lobbied long and hard to see it recognized, it was their 
strongly expressed wish that we proceed quickly with this 
legislation rather than delay the legislation pending the outcome 
of the inherent right of self-government.
<P>
	I believe this was a wise decision on their part. By proceeding 
now on the basis of the current policy they will begin to reap the 
benefits of self-government at the earliest possible date.
<P>
	At the same time, the agreement provides that the Yukon First 
Nations will in no way be precluded from benefiting from any 
rights or entitlements that might arise from the discussions I am 
carrying out at present with the aboriginal, provincial and 
territorial leaders on the implementation of the inherent right of 
self-government.
<P>
	I would also like to comment at this time on the very 
constructive role played by the territorial government in these 
negotiations. They were tripartite negotiations throughout and 
indeed much of the work of implementing self-government will 
involve interface, co-operation and compromise between the 
First Nations and the Yukon government.
<P>
	The territorial government has been very supportive 
throughout this process and the Yukon legislature has already 
passed self-government legislation which will come into effect 
as soon as this act is proclaimed.
<P>
	Turning to the main points of the bill, one of the most 
important features is that it establishes First Nations as a legal 
entity with the power to enter contracts, to acquire land and to 
form corporations. This is a very important step in empowering 
the First Nations to manage their affairs and to plan and carry 
out their economic and social development.
<P>
	The Indian Act will not apply to the First Nations or their 
citizens or settlement land with five exceptions. First, the Indian 
Act will apply for the purpose of  determining which Yukon First 
Nation citizens are Indians within the meaning of the Indian Act.
<P>
	Second, the Indian Act will continue to apply to reserves 
outside Yukon held for the use and benefit of a Yukon First 
Nation predecessor band. There are four such reserves held for 
two Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	Third, the application of the Indian Act to reserves in Yukon is 
subject to negotiation.
<P>
	Fourth, the minister's authority under the Indian Act to 
administer individual Indian money, which the minister 
currently holds, will continue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4717"> 4717 </A></B>
<P>
	Fifth, section 87 of the Indian Act which provides for a tax 
exemption for Indians will cease to apply to all Yukon First 
Nations and Yukon Indian people three years after the 
legislation comes into force. The First Nations will have the 
legislative power to enact laws. Yukon self-government 
legislation grants law making power in four main areas. These 
include laws relating to internal management and the 
administration of certain rights and benefits received under the 
land claims agreement.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	They also include laws of a local or private nature which 
apply on settlement lands, laws relating primarily to the 
provision of programs and services to First Nation citizens, and 
laws relating to the First Nation power to tax interest and 
settlement land and other methods of direct taxation of First 
Nation citizens on settlement land.
<P>
	By agreement these taxation powers will not be exercised for 
at least three years unless the First Nation and government agree 
otherwise. The First Nation power to tax does not limit the 
federal government power to tax. What this means is that the 
First Nation as a government will negotiate with the 
governments of Canada and Yukon to ensure co-ordination of 
First Nation tax laws within the existing system.
<P>
	In the long run this taxation power will enable First Nation 
governments to use taxation of its citizens and of use of their 
settlement lands as a revenue source for providing local 
programs and services which the First Nation governments 
deem necessary for its citizens.
<P>
	While federal law of general application will continue to 
remain paramount unless inconsistent with the bill, the land 
claims bill, and the related agreements the law making powers 
granted to the First Nations will further strengthen control over 
their own affairs.
<P>
	Each First Nation will have a constitution. These 
constitutions will provide for a number of things, including 
recognition and protection of the rights and freedoms of First 
Nation citizens.
<P>
	The constitutions will also spell out how the validity of First 
Nation laws may be challenged, how financial accountability to 
the people will be assured, and how First Nation governing 
bodies will be established. These constitutions will provide the 
basic guarantees that the  First Nations will be governed 
democratically and responsibly.
<P>
	The First Nations shall also have law making powers with 
respect to the administration of justice. However, the legislation 
suspends this power until the year 2000 unless an agreement is 
reached between the Yukon and federal governments and First 
Nations on how the First Nation may exercise its power to make 
laws in relationship to the administration of justice.
<P>
	All parties are legally obliged to enter negotiations toward 
this goal. In the meantime, First Nations will not exercise this 
power. I am hopeful an agreement can be reached long before the 
year 2000.
<P>
	In the interim First Nations will have a limited power to 
establish penalties for violation of First Nation laws. Offences 
under the Yukon First Nation law will be prosecuted in Yukon 
courts and will be treated as an offence under the Territorial 
Summary Convictions Act.
<P>
	The administration of justice is an area that has in the past 
caused much friction between aboriginal Canadians and society 
at large. Hopefully Yukon self-government agreements will 
lead to a regime in which the maximum responsibility possible 
will be handled by each First Nation within the framework of 
Canada's constitution.
<P>
	The self-government agreements call for the transfer of many 
programs and services now being provided by the federal or 
territorial governments directly to the First Nations. First 
Nations will advise the government in each year of their 
priorities and plans for such transfers.
<P>
	Government policy will neither be to rush this process nor to 
retard it but to respond promptly to the wishes of First Nations. 
The pace must be set by the First Nations in accordance with 
their perception of their capabilities, their priorities, and their 
aspirations.
<P>
	In this regard I foresee a substantial downsizing of my 
department in Yukon over the next several years as all 14 First 
Nations implement self-government. The downsizing will be in 
the order of 75 per cent of the staff with the remaining 25 per 
cent kept in place to fulfil federal responsibilities and 
obligations set out in the self-government agreements.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the agreement and the legislation propose a new and 
much improved set of financial arrangements than those we 
have had in the past with First Nations. These will be modelled 
on the current and successful five-year financial transfer 
agreements that now exist between the federal and territorial 
governments.
<P>
	The financial transfer agreements will be the primary funding 
instrument between Canada and the Yukon First Nations and 
will be the mechanism for flowing current levels of band 
funding toward the cost of operating self-government, funding 
for current government programs that are taken over by the First 
Nations and funding related to the land claim implementation.
<P>
	The new financial regime will allow First Nations to engage 
in longer range planning with a greater degree of certainty and to 
establish their own priorities against a certain fiscal stability.
<P>
	Since taking on this portfolio last year I have met with many 
Yukoners and received many more letters from all sectors of 
Yukon society; aboriginal leaders, business leaders, religious 
leaders and politicians from all parties. All are urging the 
speedy introduction and passage of this bill, as well as Bill 
C-33. I have been particularly impressed by the emerging 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4718"> 4718 </A></B>
<P>
consensus and the depth of desire not only for passage but 
speedy passage of both bills.
<P>
	They recognize the importance of resolving the question of 
land claims and self-government to the future development of 
the territory.
<P>
	They recognize the potential benefit of those agreements to 
the future well-being of the Yukon First Nation who make up 
one quarter of the territory's people.
<P>
	They recognize that the certainty embodied in these pieces of 
legislation can only encourage more investment and 
development in Yukon to the benefit of all its citizens.
<P>
	Yukon needs economic growth if it is to provide hope and 
meaningful employment for its young and growing population. 
More than half of Yukon's aboriginal population is under   
24 years of age.
<P>
	In recent years there has been a marked improvement in the 
education and training opportunities available to First Nations. 
All of this means little unless there are jobs to be had in a 
growing economy. Yukon needs investment and it needs 
resource development, industrial diversification, strengthened 
infrastucture and service industry enhancement.
<P>
	I am convinced that this self-government agreement, together 
with the land claim settlement, will give a very real stimulus to 
the investment and growth that Yukon needs and for the creation 
of jobs.
<P>
	The government has made it clear that improving the quality 
of life of Canada's aboriginal people is a major concern and 
priority. The document <I>Creating Opportunity</I> expressed it this 
way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The priority of a Liberal government will be to assist aboriginal communities 
in their efforts to address the obstacles to their development and help them 
marshal the human and physical resources necessary to build and sustain 
vibrant communities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This legislation will provide new hope and opportunity for 
Yukon's First Nations and will go to the very heart of that 
commitment. The bill is clearly deserving of our support.
<P>
	On a more personal note and in closing, it is unfortunate that I 
cannot mention that above us in this assembly are people who 
have been working most of their adult lives toward this day. 
There are times in this portfolio, not often, that you walk away 
with a great  sense of satisfaction that hope has been provided. 
These people from the CYI who have been here all week and out 
in front of the House of Commons yesterday were saying to each 
other: ``We have been waiting 20 years''. I cannot imagine 
working 20 years on one piece of legislation but they have and 
they have worked hard.
<P>
	One stretch I was at went on for five solid days. That is the 
kind of commitment we saw in the last few months of drafting 
the agreements. With Canadians like these there is a lot of hope 
for our country, that they have that commitment to their own 
people and to Canada. They are to be commended.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not mention in closing the help of the 
hon. member for Yukon. I received some excellent briefings 
from that member. When all the paper was piling up and I was 
not sure exactly what was happening underground, I would 
speak to her and she would tell me the way it was. I really 
appreciated that.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I urge all members to give the legislation speedy 
consideration and passage so our fellow Canadians in Yukon can 
begin to enjoy the new life that they have hoped for and worked 
so hard to obtain for two decades. This day is here and they are to 
be commended.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak today on Bill C-34. In response to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs, who mentioned that he finds some 
days very satisfying, I will confide that I found the last 24 hours 
extremely dissatisfying and very arduous. First reading took 
place yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, so you can imagine my 
surprise when, in the afternoon, a pile of documents, one foot 
high, appeared on my desk for me to read before today's debate 
on these two bills. We are dissatisfied because we worked well 
into the night and are exhausted.
<P>
	Fortunately, we were basically already in favour of 
self-government. If we took the trouble to review these 
documents as thoroughly and as humanly possible under the 
circumstances, it is because we had in mind these people in the 
Yukon who have been waiting for so long to see this matter of 
great concern to them finally settled.
<P>
	Consequently, we did our utmost. We may have missed a few 
things, but for our part, we are in favour of Bill C-34.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to salute all those who 
dropped by my office during the week. On Monday night, we 
received a delegation from Yukon. I immediately cleared up an 
unfortunate misunderstanding, and I would like to do the same 
here now.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois never intended to delay the presentation 
of this bill. As you know, there has been a problem with the 
translation of the maps, but my party decided that it would not 
oppose the first reading. We mentioned that to these people from 
Yukon, because  rumours had been going around in the north and 
in Yukon to the effect that we would oppose this bill at first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4719"> 4719 </A></B>
<P>
reading, on the basis of the Official Languages Act, which was 
not true, of course, and that is why I take this opportunity today 
to set matters straight.
<P>
	As I said before, the Bloc Quebecois already has a position on 
self-government. We support self-government. To define the 
concept of self-government, we have the choice of several 
dictionaries. For my part, I referred to the <I>Petit Larousse</I>.
<P>
	Self-government is defined as ``government of a group by the 
action of its own members, independently from a central 
power''. As for government, is it defined as ``the right, function 
or power of governing, of running a country''.
<P>
	An agreement on self-government means that the central 
power, the Crown in this case, agrees to relinquish a certain 
number of areas of responsibility to this group, to effectively 
enable it to assume responsibility for itself and decide its own 
future. That is no different by the way, from the traditional 
claims of Quebec which in fact wants a little more than 
self-government, namely complete sovereignty.
<P>
	I have to mention in passing the similarity between the two 
situations. As I said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois has always been 
in favour of self-government for native peoples and it 
demonstrates its support today by supporting Bill C-34.
<P>
	The agreement was negotiated under the existing policy 
concerning self-government. This means that government 
commitments with respect to self-government for the nations 
concerned are not governed by the provisions of clause 35. They 
are not considered as part of a modern treaty. There is no 
protection under the Constitution, contrary to what we will see 
later in the case of Bill C-33. This must be made very clear from 
the start. Protection under the Constitution cannot be guaranteed 
today by tabling these agreements.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	About self-government, it should be pointed out that more 
than one definition must be examined more closely. Finally, 
self-government is exercised to some extent at the discretion of 
both sides. Advocating self-government is one thing, but this 
does not mean that there is a standard pattern that fits any 
situation for all bands and all first nations.
<P>
	Based on certain claims, depending upon the willingness of 
the various nations, some areas of responsibility can be 
transferred quickly and others not so quickly, while others yet 
would not be transferred not at all. It is rather difficult, when 
discussing self-government for first nations, to say: ``Here is a 
complete, comprehensive and definitive profile of 
self-government''. It will take shape as these kinds of 
agreements develop and it can vary from band to another.
<P>
	So far, four first nations in the Yukon Territory have entered 
into agreements on both lands claims-these are covered by Bill 
C-33-and self-government.
<P>
	These are the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, the First 
Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, the Teslin Tlingit Council and the 
Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation.
<P>
	That still leaves about 10 nations. The minister said that, 
during the year, we may indeed conclude and ratify agreements 
with five other nations. I think the fact that we may complete 
these negotiations within five years is a good sign and that it is 
the first step these nations must take to get rid of the Indian Act 
trusteeship although in fact-as I will explain later-they can 
opt for continued coverage under this act. I will explain some of 
its provisions a little later.
<P>
	However, a number of preconditions are attached to 
self-government. As I pointed out a few minutes ago, the First 
Nations increasingly want to face themselves from the Indian 
Act trusteeship but they are a little afraid of what will replace it. 
I think a bill such as the one before us today shows that the 
Indian Act could be replaced with agreements enabling 
members of the First Nations to take control of their own 
destiny.
<P>
	As a precondition, the First Nations must be willing to get rid 
of this trusteeship and to take control of their own future. The 
House of Commons, which has jurisdiction over this, must also 
recognize that this trusteeship must end and gradually give the 
First Nations the opportunity to take control of their own 
destiny. The will must also come from the House of Commons.
<P>
	Last but not least among the preconditions-also the most 
important in my opinion-is mutual respect. This mutual 
respect is sometimes difficult to achieve. The agreements may 
not have been as difficult to negotiate, but this respect must still 
be maintained and cultivated on a day-to-day basis. We must 
mention it whenever such bills are tabled because the public 
often feels uncomfortable toward Natives and vice versa. I think 
that if we want to spread the beneficial effects of these 
agreements, we must achieve mutual respect. That is not always 
easy.
<P>
	As we know, our vision of democracy as we experience it here 
today is not necessarily that favoured by the First Nations. They 
are not too familiar with the concept of delegated voting. Does 
that mean that their vision of democracy is not as valid as ours? I 
do not think so. It is just a little different and we must respect it.
<P>
	We have a common law system and a civil law system based 
on property rights to land among other things. We are not used to 
letting our neighbours move their trees 15 or 20 feet onto our 
lands without saying anything.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We must understand that, from the natives' point of view, the 
land does not belong to them; they belong to the land. So the way 
they see things is somewhat different and often very different 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4720"> 4720 </A></B>
<P>
from our view. I think that for  future agreements like those 
before us today, this respect will have to be cultivated, and I 
assure you that I will be there to try to instill this respect.
<P>
	Turning now to the presentation and the bill, if I look at what 
is in the agreements, the ability of these nations to make laws in 
the Yukon is being recognized. The things I noted which are 
major for me are that once they have to administer their affairs 
and pay for them-we realize in the bill and we agree-these 
people should run their own affairs more and more. If money is 
granted to them in the form of transfers or new royalties, we 
must also accept that they can enact legislation saying how they 
want to administer their affairs. That is how it is in the bills, and 
it is important that this be pointed out.
<P>
	Also, still in a spirit of respect for native cultures, we realize 
that some programs will now allow a certain spiritual or 
religious influence in the way they run their affairs and the way 
they make their own future; for them, beliefs and cultural 
practices are extremely important and we will let their main 
programs be imbued with this culture.
<P>
	There may also be legislation on native languages. From the 
representations made to my office this week, I gather that there 
are six or seven aboriginal languages in the Yukon and the 
common language in which they communicate most often is 
English, would you believe it. Later, my conclusion will 
emphasize the fact that the two cultures complement each other 
well, and I think that the opportunity now given to them to 
legislate in their own language in Yukon is a step in the right 
direction. Here, a parallel can be made with the Quebec 
government, which has some power to legislate on language 
issues to protect culture. Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois 
fully supports this approach.
<P>
	Medical care, health care and social services. This is a very 
holistic approach, as well as a feature of native culture. They try 
to prevent disease instead of trying to cure it, and even the 
treatments they apply are different from ours. Thus, they will be 
able to follow their cultural and traditional ways as regards 
medical care, health care and social services.
<P>
	Training programs and tools. Again, I want to establish a 
parallel with Quebec. They are lucky to be able to enact 
legislation on training. Giving that possibility to these people 
will enable them to train their manpower according to the needs 
of their economic development, both traditional and modern. 
Unfortunately, Quebec still does not have that opportunity and, 
frankly, I envy them in that respect.
<P>
	Education programs and services are also a major component 
of what we are prepared to give back to these people. It would be 
important for them to put in place an education system which 
would really transcend their traditional values. In that respect, 
we are pleased with the part of the agreement which allows 
native peoples to take charge of their education programs and 
services.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	There will also be the possibility of enacting legislation 
related to local or private interests. There are provisions in the 
agreement and in the bill which are somewhat similar to what 
was provided in Bill C-16, the Sahtu legislation. The object was 
to find a happy balance between modern and traditional values. I 
think that goal was reached with the conclusion of this 
agreement.
<P>
	Among other things, these people are given back the 
responsibility for protecting natural resources. Traditional 
activities such as picking, trapping, hunting and fishing, which 
they have been doing for centuries, are recognized. We are 
telling them ``go ahead, its yours, its your territory''. Because of 
their closeness to nature and the Earth, these people have 
eloquently shown that they do not need complex legislation. 
Through their culture, they have learned to respect nature when 
they hunt and fish. They are not the type of people who would 
fish out lakes and then have nothing left. They do not need 
specific laws on this: it is part of their culture.
<P>
	Again, I must make another parallel with Quebec. There are 
provisions regulating signage, including billboards. I envy 
them. This is somewhat like Quebec's law 101. I hope that the 
Supreme Court of Canada will not periodically challenge the 
fact that they can post notices in a language understood by their 
people, and that they will not be required to include some 
English on their signs. Once again, I envy their authority to 
enact laws of a local or private nature, laws concerning signage, 
for instance.
<P>
	They will also be able to issue various permits, which will 
also be useful in the case of construction projects. I will not 
enumerate every single case, but it is clear they will have a great 
deal of latitude in many areas. This is very good for them, and I 
am delighted. Regarding construction regulations, they seem to 
have their own approach to labour relations. I repeat, I do not 
expect a lot of legislation on the subject. These people usually 
have a great appreciation for fairness, so I do not imagine there 
will be many labour problems in the construction industry in the 
Yukon.
<P>
	They will have jurisdiction over transportation and vehicle 
use, which makes sense. Regulating and prohibiting alcohol 
consumption are a major problem, and I think this point was 
made before. It is a major problem that affects society, but 
especially societies with tremendous social problems, and one 
realizes these are often connected with the problems created by 
alcohol consumption. The fact that they intend to deal with this 
issue through their own social and health services may be a 
completely different approach. So there is a connection between 
health and social services and how they intend to use legislation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4721"> 4721 </A></B>
<P>
to regulate or prohibit alcohol consumption. This being a crucial 
problem, I agree they should be given the opportunity to deal 
with it themselves.
<P>
	The same applies to public safety. As far as protecting the 
environment is concerned, I think I gave a good description of 
the situation. Because of their attachment to land and water, it is 
important for them to be able to deal with these issues. I think 
they can teach us a thing or two about protecting the 
environment and the great respect they have for their Mother the 
Earth, as they often say. I think it is entirely appropriate to give 
them back their jurisdiction over the environment.
<P>
	There will also be legislation to regulate or prohibit firearms. 
We must realize that, because of modern hunting techniques, the 
number of firearms in circulation in Yukon, as in many parts of 
the north, is considerable. It makes perfect sense for them to be 
able to regulate possession of firearms.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Here again, I have every confidence that the possession of 
firearms will be regulated so that the focus is on possession for 
the purposes of daily survival, rather than for the purpose of 
committing crimes. I have no doubt whatsoever that this will be 
the intent of the regulations.
<P>
	The bill also provides for laws of general application. I noted 
in the agreement that a separate agreement could be negotiated 
to resolve the problem of inconsistencies arising between catch 
all laws. If I understand the terms of the agreement correctly, 
further negotiations will take place in the near future once this 
legislation has been in effect to determine if indeed there are 
some inconsistencies between these legislative texts. There will 
have to be some discussion on points of agreement and the 
necessary changes will have to be made. I felt it was important 
to take note of this provision in the bill and in the agreement.
<P>
	In other words, we are not making any final decisions here 
today. There is nothing to stop us from re-opening the debate at 
some later date. If we disagree on certain issues, we have to find 
a way to talk about it and if inconsistencies arise, then we will 
have a mechanism with which to try and smooth out any 
irritants.
<P>
	Regarding the administration of justice, once again, we are 
prepared to allow them considerable latitude. In the agreement, 
this issue is even the focus of a separate sub-chapter. We realize 
that there are many problems involving the justice system and 
here again, the problem is one of culture. We realize that it is 
difficult to get the First Nations to understand our notion of 
justice.
<P>
	I think that even more respect will have to be shown for First 
Nations to ensure they have their own justice system, with all 
this can entail. Again, if problems do arise, I think we will just 
have to get together and see how we can work things out.
<P>
	But I think it is becoming increasingly difficult to apply the 
White justice system in its entirety in the Yukon Territory or in 
the northern territories. It is inappropriate. I think that more 
respect must be shown for the value systems of these nations, 
and their justice system. And this agreement will give them an 
opportunity to implement them.
<P>
	Concerning taxation, there are also very interesting 
provisions in this agreement, from what I have seen. I was 
pleasantly surprised for the First Nations to notice, for example, 
the possibility of taxation for localities, as well as the 
possibility to collect property taxes and to operate a taxation 
system with legislative powers in taxation matters.
<P>
	I would say that for once, we are allowing them to free 
themselves from this guardianship, the dependence created by 
the Indians Act. And if we can manage to make our transfers 
match their capacity to break away and develop their economy, I 
think that will be great. The possibility also exists for transfers 
to continue, since nothing in here says that these have to stop 
because we give them taxation powers.
<P>
	I think that a transition period is necessary and the bill leaves 
an opening so that transfers will continue, and if these people 
succeed in developing their economy, of course, then I think that 
transfers from the crown should be reduced accordingly.
<P>
	In conclusion, from having looked at the agreement, although 
I was up until three or four o'clock in the morning-I did not 
really keep track of the time-I realize that it is a step in the 
right direction for the people in the Far North and the Yukon. I 
even ask the ten other First Nations to speed up the discussion. I 
think that it is really a step in the direction of getting rid of this 
trusteeship. We are telling them: ``The white man's law that 
applied to you need no longer apply now. You are being given 
jurisdiction and being allowed to develop your economy. Go 
ahead. We will even help you to do it. We will respect your 
traditional values, we accept that you are still a little reluctant to 
take the route of modern economic development. We will give 
you a hand with it''.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	All this to say that I am happy for the four Yukon nations 
which have signed these agreements. I hope to see, in the near 
future, all 14 Yukon nations reach such agreements.
<P>
	These people must be congratulated for their tenacity. They 
must be congratulated for their democratic consultation process. 
As you know, when negotiations last for 20 years, those who 
were involved in the process two decades ago have now become 
what they call elders. These elders use their wisdom to help 
those who now sit at the negotiating table.
<P>
	Another feature of the native culture is the fact that those who 
negotiated are happy for themselves of course, but their main 
source of contentment is to enable their  children and grandchil-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4722"> 4722 </A></B>
<P>
dren to take charge of their own destiny. This must be pointed 
out and emphasized.
<P>
	These people have worked very hard and the elders of the 
time, as well as today's negotiators, can now see the results of 
their efforts. I think this may be an example to follow for all 
First Nations in Canada. As I said, these people negotiated with 
determination, but they also did it in a peaceful way and this is 
important.
<P>
	At times, negotiations broke down. As well, there are issues 
on which no agreement was reached. Negotiating is not a perfect 
solution. The two sides are never completely satisfied. 
However, this exercise was conducted peacefully. It led to an 
agreement on self-government and a bill to confirm it. As well, 
the elders are happy for future generations. This is typical of the 
native culture and it is an example which we should follow.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will certainly 
support Bill C-34.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, today the House has been asked to debate Bill 
C-34, a bill regarding self-government for aboriginal peoples in 
Yukon. The bill apparently affects serious issues such as land, 
moneys, language, rights and freedoms, perhaps even 
constitutional matters.
<P>
	Reform members have been most co-operative in dealing 
with government legislation proposed in the House. We have 
had regular consultations with the government and a great 
rapport has been built up between our caucus and the 
government with regard to the handling of legislation. We often 
disagree on the content of the legislation but we are very happy 
to debate the issues in this House. However, we would like to 
debate them from a position of knowledge.
<P>
	We have some real concerns about Bill C-34. The bill was 
placed on the Order Paper for one week before the government 
finally introduced it yesterday. Members of the Reform Party, 
knowing the complexity of this issue as I mentioned earlier, 
contacted the minister's office last week to see if they could be 
briefed on the intent of the legislation in order to adequately 
prepare for the debate. I suggest that this was a fair request but it 
was a request that was denied.
<P>
	Finally my colleagues received the departmental briefing 
only this morning, the very day of the debate. Also, we had less 
than 24 hours to review this legislation. As my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc mentioned, he was up until three or four o'clock in 
the morning trying to wade through all of the material.
<P>
	Probably one of the reasons it has become so complicated is 
that Bill C-34 is directly connected to Bill C-33. While I have 
not yet been able to see it, my colleagues tell me that Bill C-33 
is nine or ten inches thick. It requires some time to review and to 
understand  the complications and the factors involved with its 
relationship to Bill C-34, the bill we are debating today.
<P>
	The Reform Party refuses to take part in this type of debate 
when it is not properly prepared, through no fault of its own. The 
government has not been able to properly manage its legislative 
agenda. It is in the position where all of the bills are in 
committee, on notice, or have not yet been introduced. 
Furthermore, it was indicated to our caucus that we would be 
debating Bill C-18 today, a bill which we have studied at great 
length and are prepared to discuss.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It is with much regret after having stated these facts that we 
feel we cannot contribute in the most meaningful way at this 
time on this bill. We do not want to be a part of the government's 
ineptitude. With much respect for the House and wanting to 
maintain quality debate, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House do now adjourn.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending the voluntary firemen's tax exemption from $500 to 
$1,000 in order to account for inflation and recognize the value of their services 
to the community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, within the wording of this motion, 
somehow something missed my recognition. What it says in the 
wording of the motion is: ``amending the voluntary firemen's 
tax exemption''. As we all know, across rural Canada we no 
longer have only firemen. We also have many firewomen across 
the country. It is a generic word.
<P>
	I want to bring to the attention of all hon. members that many 
of our fire brigades now include women and they provide a very 
responsible and important role within those fire organizations.
<P>
	It is my pleasure today to stand and to talk about Motion No. 
193. This motion, although deemed not votable by the House 
management subcommittee, recommends that the government 
consider the advisability of amending the voluntary firemen's 
tax exemption from $500 to $1,000 which I think puts it into the 
context of inflation and speaks very well to the services that 
these firefighters provide to our rural communities.
<P>
	There is no question in the minds of anyone in the House 
about the exceptional work done by volunteer firefighters. My 
motion tries to pay special attention and tribute to these men and 
women in recognition of their dedication and selfless service to 
their communities.
<P>
	Volunteer firefighters serve communities with very little 
compensation. Generally they are given honorariums that cover 
out of pocket expenses incurred while dealing with fires and 
assorted emergencies and in dealing with training sessions. I am 
confident that there is no one in the House who will disagree 
with me that this remuneration is worth every penny they get.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act exempts the first $500 of allowances 
received by these volunteer firefighters, but in 1980 that was 
increased. It used to be $300 and it was increased to $500 in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4724"> 4724 </A></B>
<P>
1980 to recognize the growth of  inflation at that time. Since 
1980 it has stayed exactly the same as it is today.
<P>
	Over the last 14 years annual inflation rates have increased as 
many of us know. In fact, most of this honorarium now is subject 
to tax. Unfortunately this effectively takes the expense 
reimbursements away from the firefighter.
<P>
	In my opinion this is mostly unfair and that is why I brought 
forward this motion again this session. I brought this forward in 
the last House. Unfortunately at that time it was not a votable 
motion. It was talked out by the government members who used 
to be on this side of the House. There are one or two of them on 
the other side of the House now.
<P>
	Volunteer firefighters provide an invaluable and vital service 
to our communities and form a solid protection base under 
which rural communities exist within this country. Not only do 
volunteer firefighters provide a service to rural communities, 
that is where they are mostly seen, but also to urban areas, as 
members know, where we have a number of volunteer 
firefighters.
<P>
	There are almost 76,000 volunteer firefighters across the 
country. It is a significant number of people who have dedicated 
their time and service to their country and have really proved to 
Canadians what volunteerism is all about.
<P>
	These volunteers spend many hours in training and on the 
upkeep of their fire stations, the care and maintenance of their 
fire equipment, all without any remuneration. They drive their 
privately owned vehicles in response to emergency alarms. 
Their privately owned vehicles are also used to travel many 
miles to deal with training sessions. Many of these people spend 
a number of hours throughout the week in specific training 
sessions to help them in doing their job.
<P>
	Frequently volunteer fire departments are the only service 
organization in a number of communities across this country. 
They are the ones out there helping our children in distress, the 
ones out there on the roads dealing with the messy situation at a 
traffic accident which many of us would rather not see.
<P>
	These are the people behind the scenes whom we do not see. 
They are in the face of these tragic situations, dealing with them. 
They are the ones raising money for community halls and 
community centres. They are the ones in small towns across this 
country who are the backbone of volunteer work in these 
communities.
<P>
	They are the people who really keep these communities going. 
They can be found taking all sorts of other roles within 
communities such as organizing hockey and baseball teams, 
community garage sales and fund raising for many important 
community events.
<P>
	It would hardly seem right when it is remembered that in 
many volunteer fire departments the practice is to pool those 
moneys received from this disbursement of a lot of their hard 
work and labour. A lot of times this pooled money is put back 
into the firehall.
<P>
	As members know, in many rural areas money is not available 
to provide some of the needed equipment. A lot of time the 
reimbursements they get for some of their own expenses go back 
into these community halls, into their equipment and uniforms. 
Basically our rural firefighters and our volunteer firefighters are 
paying for the service that they provide to our communities. 
Obviously these men and women are dedicated volunteers as has 
been stated and they take great pride in their communities. I 
believe it is only right and proper for the government to 
recognize this contribution and that is why I brought this motion 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Let me stress once again that these men and women, these 
very proud Canadians, are giving freely of their time and energy 
and have put their lives on the line for many Canadians.
<P>
	I had the opportunity of going into a fire with some of my 
local volunteer firefighters. There are 13 in my area. They took 
me into a burning house all packed up in a training exercise. 
They showed me what it was like, what their lives were like, on 
many occasions. I was scared. It was a very scary, very tough 
situation, and it really gave me a good sense of where these 
people are coming from on a daily basis.
<P>
	I do not feel that they have been recognized at all for this 
service and I am not suggesting in any way that these people 
want special recognition. In fact, a lot of them would wonder 
why I am up here trying to give them more money because most 
of them in the earlier years did not even use up their full 
compensation. It is an important thing. As a House we should 
recognize it, for recognition is long overdue.
<P>
	We have seen the effects in the recessionary years across this 
country. More and more communities are turning to volunteer 
firefighters to provide these essential services. As I said, the 
money is not there and how much would it cost Canada if we had 
to pay firefighters instead of relying on the generosity of 
volunteers?
<P>
	There can be few people in this country who do not know, who 
have not been directly affected by these volunteer firefighters. 
More now than ever we need to strengthen and expand the forces 
to fill the gaps that are occurring because of the lack of services 
provided because of the downturn in the economy.
<P>
	I put it to this House that the costs involved in providing this 
increase are small compared with the savings made in terms of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4725"> 4725 </A></B>
<P>
human lives as well as dollars. I suggest that this House would 
save greatly by voting this increase to volunteer firefighters.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, this motion unfortunately like many 
motions across the House because of the archaic nature of our 
Private Members' Hour is not votable and I know that is a 
problem for a lot of members across this House. In this debate 
today I hope at least that members in this House will recognize 
the important role that volunteer firefighters provide to our 
communities.
<P>
	I hope that all Canadians who are listening to this today will 
give a pat on the back to their local firefighters.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today I welcome the opportunity to speak to the hon. 
member's motion to raise the voluntary firemen's tax exemption 
from $500 to $1,000.
<P>
	I would like to start by commending the hon. member for his 
motion, since it also gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the 
work done by these people and to say they are useful members of 
our society, and I think that is a message we can send them from 
this House.
<P>
	The hon. member said twice that because of the standing 
orders, his motion was not votable. I do not know whether the 
hon. member could ask for unanimous consent, but if he did, I 
am sure he would obtain unanimous consent for the House to 
vote immediately on this motion. I do not know whether the hon. 
member is listening.
<P>
	Raising the voluntary firemen's tax exemption from $500 to 
$1,000 would be an opportunity for members of this House to 
give tangible recognition of the social commitment and 
dedication of all voluntary firefighters in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	I think the average person does not quite realize how 
important voluntary firefighters are to our communities. They 
are voluntary, because considering the compensation they 
receive would hardly justify considering them otherwise. And as 
such, they should not have to pay income tax on the pittance they 
earn by serving the community.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	They are not permanent workers, since their main occupation 
is not as firefighters; they earn their living doing something 
else. However, they are on call and must leave everything 
behind to respond to distress calls. Moreover, volunteer 
firefighters must use their own vehicle to get to the emergency 
situations which they must face. These men and women, because 
there are indeed men and women in this service, must carry 
pagers with them so that they can be reached day and night. They 
must also attend different courses and conferences, as the hon. 
member mentioned earlier.
<P>
	It is important to note that the tax exemption has not been 
changed since 1980. At that time, it went from $300 to $500 to 
account for inflation; some people thought that the $300 amount 
was not fair any more and should be amended to $500. That 
calculation has not been done since 1980. I think that, today, we 
could make exactly the same calculation and come up with the 
amount of $1,000 as proposed in this motion.
<P>
	Since 1980, while inflation has been considerably increasing 
every year, volunteer firefighters have been paying more taxes 
on a service they voluntarily provide to their communities. 
Consequently, it would be normal to increase the tax exemption 
according to the standard of living in our society. Also, it is 
important to keep in mind the abilities, both physical and 
academic, that such a job requires. Generally, volunteer 
firefighters have attended all the basic first-aid courses: St. 
John's Ambulance, Red Cross, CPR and others. This is quite 
something for a job you do only on a voluntary basis.
<P>
	We should also point out, and this is very important, that 
volunteer firefighters help municipalities to provide a service 
they could probably not afford otherwise. It is a fact that in the 
rural municipalities that cannot afford a professional 
firefighting brigade, the role of volunteer firefighters is vital. 
The safety of millions of people is in their hands.
<P>
	Without them there would be a multimillion dollar void which 
would have to be filled with our taxes. I believe the hon. member 
mentioned that point in his speech. If we do not raise this 
exemption, if we do not acknowledge in some way the work of 
these dedicated men and women, and if they stop being 
volunteer firefighters, municipalities and taxpayers will have to 
pay dearly to get a similar service. So, why not raise this 
exemption again? This would send a tremendous message to 
these men and women who put their lives on the line to save 
others.
<P>
	On a social and community level, how many times have I seen 
volunteer firefighters take part in fundraising campaigns, either 
for the MIRA foundation, the United Way, or shelters for abused 
women or drug addicts? How many times have volunteer fire 
departments joined civil defence teams to assist communities 
ravaged by floods, tornadoes or other environmental disasters?
<P>
	In my riding of Berthier-Montcalm, I saw the volunteer fire 
department at work, fighting against floods along the St. 
Lawrence and cleaning up after a tornado hit Maskinongé. They 
do a terrific job. Public security is in good hands. On the 
national level, the tragic fire at the tire depot in Saint-Amable, 
in the Montreal area, highlighted the remarkable role played by 
these men and women who are much more than volunteer 
firefighters. They got involved after the fire to make sure that 
the neighbour-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4726"> 4726 </A></B>
<P>
ing population suffered as little as possible from the damage to 
the environment and got all the help they needed.
<P>
	I believe that such events opened the eyes of many. One must 
realize that these volunteers have to leave their jobs, their 
homes, and their families to go and help the community when it 
is threatened. I call upon the government to vote in favour of this 
motion- it will not be a direct vote, but through this House, the 
government should get the message-to increase this tax 
exemption from $500 to $1,000 without delay. Together, we 
must send our heartfelt thanks to all the volunteers who are 
dedicated to public security across Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Volunteer firefighters are too often forgotten by the 
government and the population as a whole. Today we have an 
opportunity to thank them by supporting the motion. As elected 
representatives, we feel secure because of them and we must 
support the motion.
<P>
	As for me, I thank the 994 volunteer firefighters in50 different municipalities in my riding. I want to show them my 
entire support in this motion and I will see to it that the 
government adopts it as fast as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to praise the motion placed before the House 
today by the hon. member for Haldimand-Norfolk. I share 
totally his views about the great job done by volunteer 
firefighters. They are a dedicated, hard-working group of 
people to whom all of us owe a great debt.
<P>
	In my riding of Capilano-Howe Sound several communities 
rely heavily on the work of volunteers. In Squamish, 55 
volunteers complement a core of six full time firefighters. 
Pemberton and Lions Bay rely entirely on 20 volunteers for their 
protection from fire.
<P>
	In the beautiful resort community of Whistler, 11 
professionals rely on the help of 36 volunteers. I feel 
particularly close to this group because I have attended their 
annual ball. These people not only know how to have fun, they 
also show their dedication to public welfare by using the 
occasion to raise substantial funds for charity. I feel closer also 
to these Whistler firefighters because I have seen them in action 
when they took care of a chimney fire in the house of one of my 
neighbours. Hearing the roar of such a fire in the stillness of a 
snowy winter evening is an unforgettable experience. Seeing 
their professionalism in dealing with this inferno has made me 
an eternal fan of theirs.
<P>
	I would also like to tell you, Madam Speaker, that Whistler is 
a very dry and hot place in the summer. Trees and bushes grow 
between the many wooden houses. I have often descended into 
the valley on the chair lift and was very uneasy thinking about 
the scene before me, how easily a small fire could spread 
through the community, leaping from house to house through 
the low brush, fanned by the famous Squamish winds. The 
property damage would be in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars. There would be great risks for people and animals. 
However I find myself reassured by the knowledge that  the 
large contingent of very competent firefighters is there, quickly 
and at all times, to deal with any small fire before it erupts into a 
major conflagration.
<P>
	At any rate, I hope that they will forever be able to maintain 
the enviable record they have established during the 30-year 
history of the Whistler community. No fire has ever gone out of 
control.
<P>
	The professional and volunteer firefighters in my riding can 
be counted on, not just to fight fires, but to provide valuable 
services in all kinds of other emergencies. Just a couple of weeks 
ago they had to use the jaws of life to free from a car a severely 
injured motorist and two others. Their efforts came too late for 
the two who died in the accident.
<P>
	The Whistler firefighters are superbly skilled in their task. 
Last year they won first place in a provincial competition testing 
their rescue skills. They are about to enter this competition 
again and I wish them the best of luck.
<P>
	I support the idea that the federal government should make a 
solid contribution to the well-being of these dedicated people. 
They save citizens local taxes which would have to be raised if 
they were to be replaced by professionals.
<P>
	Therefore It seems very fitting that the private member's 
motion being discussed should urge the government to raise the 
amount of fees which are freed from taxation. However, given 
the government's current financial conditions, members must be 
very vigilant not to add to the deficit. In this spirit, I therefore 
suggest that the proposal be modified to make it less costly. I 
propose that the government raise the allowance annually by the 
increase in the consumer price index, using the $500 limit in 
1980 as a base. In my view this approach would be fair and I am 
sure that it would be acceptable as such to the volunteer 
firefighters who make such great contributions to public 
welfare.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The sentiments which I have expressed are not just mine. 
They are also shared by my hon. colleagues from the Reform 
caucus, in particular those representing the following ridings: 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley; Kindersley-Lloydminster; 
Fraser Valley East; Kootenay East; Nanaimo-Cowichan; 
Okanagan-Shuswap; Macleod; Saanich-Gulf Islands;

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have been listening quite closely to the comments 
of the various members of the three parties. I gather there is 
some support for the motion.
<P>
	I wonder if we could have unanimous consent to approve the

motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this motion be votable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Could I have some 
precision on the motion. Are you suggesting that we stop the 
debate now or do you want debate to go on?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> I know it is a little unusual, but with 
unanimous consent we can do that because we do have some 
speakers who want to continue speaking. I would ask for 
unanimous consent that the motion be votable at the end of the 
hour.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to 
speak to this motion which, I think, is very important to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to start by commending the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk for all the work he has done on this very 
important issue. It is not the first time he has raised this issue in 
the House. I remember very clearly having worked with him on 
this issue in the last parliamentary session. It is very 
encouraging to see someone who does not forget the issues he 
considers important. I commend the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk for his tenacity and his dedication. I am 
proud to rise today in support of this motion.
<P>
	I had written in my notes that I was disappointed that the 
motion was not votable but I see that this has been changed with 
the unanimous consent of the House. I am very proud and very 
happy to say that the motion is now votable. I thank the hon. 
members, my colleagues. I urge all hon. members to maintain a 
spirit of co-operation in this House.
<P>
	This motion is in keeping with the government's policy of 
restoring integrity and equity to the political system. The 
government looked at the issue of student loans and at other 
things and set out to ensure that the loan values honestly reflect 
the cost of post-secondary studies. The time has come to apply 
this equity principle to volunteer firefighters.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Volunteer firefighters do exceptional work. The dedication 
they bring to their communities is very important. They 
encourage volunteerism in our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very pleased to be able to speak this evening on this 
issue. I am also pleased that the member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk has brought it to the House once again. 
His motion asks that the voluntary firefighter's tax exemption 
be raised from $500 to $1,000 to make it more meaningful in the 
context of inflation and the valuable service these volunteers 
provide to their communities. Such a move is in keeping with 
the government's policy of restoring integrity and especially 
equity to the fiscal system.
<P>
	The government has looked at the issue of student loans and 
set out to ensure that the value of the loans honestly reflects the 
cost of studying. If I can compare the volunteer firemen with the 
students, they are doing a service to the community and it is 
costing them money. Therefore, we should have some type of 
equity built into the system. I believe this motion does that.
<P>
	We have heard the member from the Reform Party and the 
member from the Bloc Quebecois speak about the firefighters in 
their regions. I suspect their thoughts would be unanimous right 
across Canada, that these firefighters do exceptional work in 
their communities. These are volunteers. They do work that 
goes far beyond the call of duty. They even encourage the spirit 
of volunteerism.
<P>
	In this day and age everyone is out for the almighty dollar and 
we see limited numbers of people getting involved in their 
communities. A lot of them are becoming armchair activists. 
These firefighters are the people out on the front line and it is 
our responsibility to make sure that we, not necessarily reward 
them financially every time they do something, but put justice in 
the system so it is not costing them to be a volunteer. I would 
suspect that should go for other groups as well.
<P>
	The firefighters in my area, and I am sure other members will 
be speaking about their firefighters, are no different from those 
in other areas. They are all well trained. They are on duty24 hours a day, basically on call on weekends, at night, in the 
middle of storms when we are home asleep or comfortable 
reading the newspaper or pursuing our favourite pastime, 
watching the parliamentary channel. These people are well 
trained in first aid, CPR and emergency operations.
<P>
	Their work is pleasant in certain circumstances, but quite 
often it is not. They are on the scene of emergencies. They are on 
the scene at fires and car accidents. Quite often these scenes 
bother them, but someone has to do the job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4728"> 4728 </A></B>
<P>
	They help young people in distress. I know the volunteer 
firefighters in my area are always involved with educational 
programs and fire prevention. They are helpful. They are in 
malls. In fact just last weekend we were in the mall in my 
hometown. I had my son with me. We were walking along and 
who do we see but a number of firemen giving out pamphlets 
to the parents and the children were receiving balloons. They 
were giving out safety advice to the parents on how to protect 
their children in crowds, how to keep better rapport with the 
children. That is beyond the call of duty. These are volunteers. 
They not only teach children about fire safety, they teach 
parents how to be safe with their children.
<P>
	Quite often they raise money for community events. They 
raise money for charities. They raise money for their own 
uniforms quite often. They raise money for equipment that the 
community cannot afford such as the jaws of life. It is usually 
the firefighters who hold bingos and some even have auxiliaries 
that help out. They hold bingos, sell tickets and have door to 
door campaigns. They are always involved with this type of 
activity.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Often the only remuneration these men and women receive is 
some type of honorarium to cover the out of pocket expenses 
incurred while dealing with fires and assorted emergencies or 
attending training sessions.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act exempts from taxation the first $500 of 
allowances received by volunteer firefighters. Since 1980 this 
level has remained constant at $500. As a result of this constant 
$500 level the government is now penalizing a lot of these 
volunteers. Because of inflation it is costing them more money 
to be volunteer firefighters than if they stayed home and did 
nothing.
<P>
	Our volunteer firefighters are now paying for the service they 
actually provide to the community. This is over and above the 
time and effort they have already donated. If we were to add up 
all of the hours, we would never be able to afford these 
firefighters as full time workers. Nor could we ever afford 
volunteers in other sectors if we had to pay them. Therefore, it is 
only fair that the government increase this exemption from$500 to $1,000.
<P>
	These volunteers no doubt have saved communities right 
across this country millions of dollars. The cost of this measure 
is well below the savings generated by these volunteers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The expenses incurred by the voluntary firefighters often 
exceed this tax exemption of $500. The cost of gasoline, car 
insurance, clothing and dry cleaning, for example, has become 
prohibitive. So, it would be in the interests of voluntary 
firefighters to increase the tax exemption.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion I congratulate the member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk. As I mentioned before he presented this 
motion in the last Parliament. I congratulate him for his tenacity 
and his devotion to this cause. I support this motion and I hope 
all members will see fit to support it when the time comes.
<P>
	As the member for Restigouche-Chaleur, I would like to 
thank all the volunteers in my region.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to salute and thank the voluntary firefighters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure for me this evening to speak on this important 
private member's motion. I congratulate the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk for his hard work and diligence in the 
preparation of this motion and for his dedication to the volunteer 
firefighters who put their lives on the line every time they are 
called out.
<P>
	The member has been working for a long time to get this 
motion passed in this House. I am confident all members will 
see the benefits of this motion and will call on the government to 
consider amending the volunteer firefighter's tax exemption 
from $500 to $1,000.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act currently exempts $500 from taxation. 
This had been increased from $300 to $500 in the 1980 taxation 
year. Looking at inflation since that time based on 14 years it is 
certainly due time we recognize the firefighters for their efforts 
and the kind of work they do for their communities.
<P>
	This is not the first time this motion has been presented. In 
one form or another it has been brought into this House on other 
occasions. This topic was discussed even as far back as 1982 and 
again in 1983. In 1989 the member for Haldimand-Norfolk 
reintroduced the motion.
<P>
	I trust the next time we speak on this issue we will be passing 
the motion into law and finally giving volunteer firefighters the 
increased level of tax exemption they deserve. I saw the spirit 
and goodwill which can prevail in this House this evening in 
allowing this motion to become a votable one. I applaud 
members opposite and on this side as well for their diligence in 
doing this.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	In the past members who opposed similar motions were 
worried about pitting one volunteer group against another. This 
is not the case in this evening's debate. All the motion says is 
that it is time to give proper recognition to our firefighters, 
recognition in the form of increased tax exemptions. This is not 
a question of developing a new exemption, but recognition of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4729"> 4729 </A></B>
<P>
the fact that the current exemption is not sufficient because of 
the effects of inflation over the past 14 years.
<P>
	All across the country thousands of brave men and women, 
volunteer firefighters, offer their services to fire departments, 
fire associations and auxiliaries. Even in larger communities 
volunteer firefighters are heavily relied upon by full time 
firefighting forces. Without volunteer firefighters full time 
departments would not be able to provide the level of protection 
and service needed by communities.
<P>
	I would like to read into the record the names of some of the 
departments and auxiliaries I represent as the MP for 
Huron-Bruce. I think of the towns of Zurich, my own home 
town where I have family members serving on that fire 
department, Wingham, Kincardine, Lucknow, Southhampton, 
Seaforth, Exeter, Hensall, and Bayfield. For those who do not 
know my riding there are places such as Dashwood and Huron 
Park which would be pleased to be recognized as also having 
volunteer fire departments.
<P>
	I look forward to this coming Saturday when I will have 
breakfast with firefighters from the Brucefield Fire Department. 
I also had the pleasure of serving as one of the board members of 
the Bayfield volunteer fire department during my many years in 
municipal politics.
<P>
	I congratulate all the firefighters of Huron-Bruce for the 
exceptional job they have done for us all these years. These 
brave men and women provide an invaluable service to the 
people of their communities. They literally have the lives of 
their friends, families, and neighbours in their hands every time 
they are called out. They serve their communities with honour, 
dignity and pride. It is for this reason we must acknowledge 
their importance and allow them exemptions of $1,000 in 
recognition of their important duties to their community.
<P>
	The hon. member for Haldimand-Norfolk has better 
knowledge than some on the importance and value of volunteer 
firefighters. I can think of no better example of the dedication 
and bravery of volunteer firefighters than the Hagersville tire 
fire. That fire was deliberately set and took the time of many 
firefighters for many days. The extremely dangerous and 
volatile situation forced hundreds of families to be evacuated 
from their homes.
<P>
	Who came to the rescue and became the first line of defence 
for the people in that area? Of course it was the volunteer 
firefighters of the local communities. They were outgunned by 
the fire but they persevered. After many long days, sleepless 
nights and personal sacrifice and hardship, they were able with 
some help to defeat the fire.
<P>
	This is a great example of the dedication and professionalism 
of volunteer firefighters. Most of the time these individuals are 
ordinary people: farmers in our communities, store owners, 
plumbers, electricians, and so on. Once they are called upon to 
put on their hats and boots they become the protectors of their 
communities.
<P>
	Often when called these men and women are docked pay from 
their wages so they can serve their communities. I would like to 
recognize the employers who in many cases continue to pay the 
wages of their employees when they are out fighting fires for 
their communities or doing those other services normally 
attributed to fire departments.
<P>
	In addition to the financial cost, they experience personal 
sacrifice in terms of loss of time with their families and physical 
and mental strain. I am sure many of us tonight can relate to an 
incident where family members were called away from an 
important family occasion because of a fire or because of an 
emergency within the community.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Volunteer firefighters do not just protect their communities, 
they also volunteer their time and resources to charitable causes 
and community events. As the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk has already mentioned, these men and 
women volunteer for everything from supporting and organizing 
minor hockey and softball to raising money for the needy and 
organizing holiday events and celebrations.
<P>
	They are an integral part of their community. After all, what 
we are really talking about is a sense of responsibility of 
community and volunteerism. In today's world of financial 
hardships, increases in violent crime and deterioration of family 
values, we are relying more and more on the help, protection and 
generosity of others.
<P>
	I am sure that every member has in the past and will continue 
in the future to volunteer in some capacity to some worthwhile 
charity or cause. In every community across this vast country 
volunteers are lending a helping hand to many different people 
and worthwhile causes. The elderly, the young, the 
disadvantaged and the disabled all rely on a growing group of 
generous people for support.
<P>
	We must do everything we can to encourage these types of 
actions and therefore when it comes to giving some tax breaks to 
a group of people who protect their communities, I fully support 
this initiative and feel its passage is long overdue.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would once again like to commend my 
colleague from Haldimand-Norfolk for being persistent in 
giving the volunteer firefighters of Canada the recognition and 
support they deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak today on the motion presented 
by my colleague from Haldimand-Norfolk.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4730"> 4730 </A></B>
<P>
	The motion recommends that the government amend the 
voluntary firefighter's tax exemption from $500 to $1,000 in 
order to account for inflation and recognize the value of their 
services to the community. Most Canadians probably do not 
recognize the importance of our volunteer firefighters and I 
would like to look at some of the stats.
<P>
	Nationally there are 76,000 volunteer firefighters. Over65 per cent or 17,000 of the 26,000 firefighters in Ontario alone 
are volunteers. Ninety-five per cent of the province's 653 fire 
departments are staffed in whole or in part by them.
<P>
	The legislative reference to this motion is section 6(1) of the 
Income Tax Act. This section exempts the first $500 from 
taxation of allowances received by the firefighter. Raising the 
level or threshold is not a new idea. In the 1980 fiscal year the 
amount was increased from $300 to $500 as was previously 
stated and there have been no increases since 1980 despite 
substantial increases in inflation and the cost of living.
<P>
	There are really two issues here: first, to update the tax 
provision which is outdated and no longer representative of 
today's buying power; second, the issue of fairness in providing 
recognition to those thousands of volunteers. Clearly without 
volunteers many communities would not have fire protection.
<P>
	This is not an exaggeration but a recognition that many rural 
communities simply do not have the financial resources to pay 
for full time firefighters. Even with volunteers many 
communities in my riding are still dependent on shared services 
with their neighbouring municipalities. I would like to take a 
couple of minutes to give members a personal position on this.
<P>
	In the late 1960s we had a fire on our farm. We have a poultry 
farm. It was a three storey building, 21,000 square feet, and it 
caught on fire. It is dead centre on our farm. We had a century 
old farmhouse. There was a drive-in shed and two more barns on 
the other side.
<P>
	The heat was so intense it broke every window on one side of 
the farmhouse. There was a 2,000 litre propane tank in front of 
the barn. The firefighters helped us that night to move that tank 
away. There would have been a huge hole in the ground had that 
not been done. They could not save the barn, but they saved the 
house, the drive-in shed and the two other barns. A lot of it was 
in jeopardy of their own lives.
<P>
	What would the cost be of increasing the exemption? I believe 
this point was raised earlier by another speaker. The cost of full 
utilization of the new exemption is estimated to be $38 million. 
This is a lot of money and yet what volunteer firefighters 
provide our communities offsets this lost revenue. Without 
these volunteers a community would either have to forgo fire 
protection or hire a full time force at a staggering price, a lot 
more than what I have just mentioned. The resulting increases in 
municipal taxes necessary would be prohibitive.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Let us move on beyond dollars and take a closer look at these 
people in our community. These volunteers are busy people who 
hold down full time jobs and yet have time to devote to their 
community. I know that every Thursday evening in many of the 
towns and villages in my riding firefighters hold drill practices. 
Often they will go on training sessions held in different parts of 
the provinces at their own expense.
<P>
	A volunteer force is a term used to distinguish it from a paid 
or professional force. These are terms I do not like to use 
because there is nothing unprofessional about these volunteer 
firefighters. Beyond firefighting they are called upon to perform 
a host of other duties. They are trained in CPR, first aid, 
highway accident rescues and other emergencies.
<P>
	Regarding highway accident rescues, it could be a father 
heading out to an accident in which his own son or daughter 
could be involved. That is a great emotional point.
<P>
	One emergency in particular that comes to mind in my riding 
is the tornado touchdown both in Grand Valley and the 
Orangeville areas. This week marks its grizzly anniversary.
<P>
	Beyond these duties firefighters selflessly devote their time 
to parades, fire safety awareness campaigns, sponsorship of 
local causes and fundraising events to help sustain their service. 
Not only do they do their own work for nothing but they also 
have to go out and raise money for their own fire department. 
Almost all of this is done at their own personal expense in terms 
of time and money.
<P>
	I believe that this motion is significant in that it provides 
recognition by this House of the work our volunteer firefighters 
do and I am thankful for the opportunity to speak in support of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise on this motion and to commend my colleague 
from Haldimand-Norfolk in his initiative.
<P>
	There is no question that increasing the deduction from$500 to $1,000 for volunteer firefighters is long overdue.
<P>
	In my capacity as local councillor I have had exposure to both 
professional and volunteer firefighters. In my community the 
quality of life would not be the same if it did not have volunteer 
firefighters. In a rural community it would be impossible to have 
a professional firefighter force.
<P>
	When we talk about volunteer firefighters we are talking 
about volunteerism at its best. There is a real melting pot, what 
the community is about, and there are people who respond at all 
hours of the night, leaving their jobs to do so. There is no 
question that their employers are to be commended as well. I 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4731"> 4731 </A></B>
<P>
really hope that at some point we do something to recognize 
firefighters in general.
<P>
	I have attended far too many funerals involving firefighters. I 
recall part of the firefighter's prayer: ``God, if it is your will that 
in the line of duty to save a child or a life I give my life, then I 
ask that you take care of my children and my wife''. That kind of 
selfless devotion to duty and devotion to our fellow human 
beings is to be commended and recognized. I believe that this 
issue should be redressed and redressed now.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I too compliment the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk on this initiative. There is nothing greater 
than a good volunteer fire department in the community. We all 
hope that we never need it, but that when it is needed it is there.
<P>
	When I was first elected to a municipal council in my home 
township, I was appointed chairman of the local fire committee 
and public works committee. We started a very good fire 
department made up of a group of people who wanted to work 
for their community, who had been doing some work in it but 
had no equipment with which to work. We ended up giving them 
some equipment.
<P>
	Over the years, they like those in many other rural 
communities have built up their resources and firefighting 
equipment. They have taken special courses, visited schools to 
talk about fires and how to prevent them, and have gone into 
homes to make inspections.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Haldimand-Norfolk knows, these 
are not just everyday citizens out there fighting fires. They are 
indeed professionals in their own way. They deserve our credit. 
They deserve to have the volunteer firefighter's tax exemption 
as recommended by the hon. member for Haldimand-Norfolk.
<P>
	The hon. member for Restigouche-Chaleur mentioned the 
jaws of life. What could be more important in today's robust and 
rapidly moving world with the highway traffic and railway 
traffic, particularly if it runs through the middle of a built up 
community, than to have the jaws of life on those highways and 
roads in order to save people's lives. Our firefighters are very, 
very well trained to operate the jaws of life.
<P>
	They carry out all these dedicated tasks together in their home 
community, but it goes far beyond that because they work with 
fire departments in neighbouring communities. Within a matter 
of a very short time a number of these departments can come 
together to fight a large regional fire.
<P>
	I believe that rural Canada, our small villages and towns, are 
very well served by volunteer firefighters. I think they deserve 
the attention of this House. They deserve the consideration of 
this House for a greater tax exemption. It costs them a lot of 
money for clothing that is ruined and that does not come 
cheaply.
<P>
	We are not asking much for them. The hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk probably knows many of these people. It 
is nothing for them to have to buy new clothing after a fire. They 
have to buy protective clothing as well which costs a lot of 
money.
<P>
	Fire departments do raise money on their own. It is a 
co-operative thing for them to do. There is a good rapport 
among those firefighters and their families. They do fundraising 
and it is up to our communities to support them because they are 
there to support us in time of need.
<P>
	It is very important too that all Canadians, including 
volunteers, realize that if it were not for volunteers in every 
walk and every area of life such as recreation and firefighting, 
there would be many qualities of life that we would not have in 
rural Canada today and indeed in larger communities as well.
<P>
	Let us not just talk here in terms of rhetoric in the House of 
Commons about giving a tax deduction to volunteer firefighters. 
I think we should mean business on this because these people are 
a very important part of every small community in this country.
<P>
	If we did not have volunteer firefighters to support and to look 
after people at times of grass fires, bush fires, brush fires, house 
fires, barn fires and road accidents, as has been mentioned it 
would cost this nation and individual taxpayers a lot more 
money than it is costing today under our volunteer firefighters 
program.
<P>
	Let us give these people every good turn that we can and say 
thank you to them by giving them a tax exemption.
<P>
	Once more I compliment the hon. member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk and other members in the House who have 
spoken today on behalf of the volunteer firefighters across 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired.
<P>
	It being 6.42 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.42 p.m.)
