today marks the 900th anniversary of the Order of St. John 
founded in the 11th century with the establishment of a hospital 
for Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First aid became an integral part of the work of the order in 
England during the France-Prussian war in 1870.  The humanitarian 
work of the British branch of the St. John Ambulance spread to 
Canada in 1882-83 when first aid classes were organized in Quebec 
City and Kingston. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all recognize the importance of the St. John Ambulance 
in providing first aid training to Canadians therefore enhancing 
their ability to save other lives and to improve the quality of 
those lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thank them for their dedication and for their spirit of 
volunteerism.  May they continue to serve us long.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, during the 11th century, pilgrims to the Holy Land could 
find treatment in a hospital run by Benedictine monks in 
Jerusalem.  In the year 1099, the Order of St. John from which 
the modern St. John Ambulance grew was eventually formed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 900 years of age, St. John Ambulance is the oldest voluntary 
health and welfare organization in the world. In Canada there are 
now over 25,000 volunteers, including over 12,000 uniformed 
brigade members who donate 2 million hours each year to community 
service and treat approximately 20,000 casualties, all free of 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 7,000 first aid instructors teach over 800,000 Canadians 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we celebrate and congratulate the accomplishments of St. 
John Ambulance for its public service.  On this 900th birthday, 
we wish it success as it goes into the new millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Tong Sun Louie, who has died in Vancouver at the age of 102, was 
born in Canton and emigrated to Canada 90 years ago, establishing 
himself as a prominent Vancouver businessman and philanthropist 
and a founder of the Chinese Benevolent Association. His family 
includes university professors, medical practitioners, 
accountants and financial advisers, all leaders of the 
Chinese-Canadian community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chinese-Canadian community in Vancouver encompasses a wide 
diversity in language and culture, places of origin within China, 
and actual years lived in Canada.  Tong Sun Louie's long life 
reaches back to the historical origins of British Columbia, and 
he may certainly be considered among the early founding fathers 
of that province.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, St. John 
Ambulance is celebrating 900 years of community service.  The 
white cross of the Order of St. John was first seen in the 
Middle Ages, and has since become a symbol of devotion and 
support, both in times of peace and in times of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its inception, St. John Ambulance has saved millions of 
lives, and an equal number have been saved as a result of its 
training, prevention and consciousness-raising efforts aimed at 
the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, close to 800,000 people in Canada and Quebec receive 
St. John Ambulance training. 
In other words, millions of people could some day save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all seen this great humanitarian organization in action, 
as we are familiar with its trained first-aiders, therapeutic

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the NDP and in the context of National Volunteer 
Week, I rise to pay tribute to St. John Ambulance, one of the 
oldest charity and volunteer organizations in the world.  St. 
John Ambulance is celebrating its 900th anniversary, a landmark 
in history that is unmatched by any other charity organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Order of St. John, from which St. John Ambulance grew, dates

</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP gives thanks for the 25,000 volunteers and youth members

the well-being of communities in every part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first aid training, the first aid treatments offered at 
large public gatherings and other services provided by St. John 
Ambulance make Canada a safer place for Canadians to work and 
play.  Each year over 800,000 are instructed in first aid and 
over 200,000 Canadians are treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also take this opportunity to personally recognize two 
constituents of mine, Mr. Dan Trochim, who recently received the 
Serving Brother Award for his St. John Ambulance work, and Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 1882 
the St. John Ambulance Association took root in Canada.  Over the 
years, this ever-vigilant community service group has grown to 
become a large family with volunteers numbering 25,000 
nationwide. 
In 1099, the Order of St. John, an order of Benedictine monks, 
ran a hospital in Jerusalem caring for those in need.  From this 
history comes our modern St. John Ambulance Association and 
Brigade.  After nine centuries of helping others, the St. John 
Ambulance Association has become the oldest charitable and 
humanitarian organization in the world.  They are committed to 
enabling Canadians to improve their health, safety and quality of 
life by providing training and community service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the PC Party of Canada, I would like to thank Mr. 
David Johnston, Chancellor of the St. John Ambulance Association 
of Canada, the workers and the volunteers, and I wish them all a

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is Organ Donation Awareness Week and tomorrow is National 
Organ Discussion Day.  As a member of the Standing Committee on 
Health, I have had the opportunity to learn a great deal about 
organ and tissue donation in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year in Canada, approximately 1,500 people die who could be 
potential donors, yet only 400 individuals actually donate. These 
statistics are startling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Kitchener Centre companies such as the Mutual Group and 
organizations such as the Kidney Foundation regularly work to 
raise awareness about donation and transplantation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the word is spreading about the importance of organ 
donation, more needs to be done.  In 1996 a Mutual Group survey 
showed 54% of Canadians did not know if their family members 
wished to donate their organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be able to participate in the Kidney 
Foundation's Celebration of Life event tomorrow.  This event will 
not only help raise awareness, but honour local recipients and 
donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to participate in this 
meaningful week and raise awareness on this important matter.

<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is National Organ Donor Awareness Week.  This is a time when 
we remember the role organ donors play in many people's lives. In 
Canada today over 3,000 people are waiting for life-giving organ 
transplants.  Canada has one of the lowest donation rates in the 
world.  This has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most cases the saving of another life through a donation 
means that someone else took the time to think of others and 
acted in the most generous way possible.  They literally gave 
themselves for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible that my own daughter will be in need of a kidney 
transplant in the future.  At that point my wife and I will be 
eternally thankful to the donor for they will be able to give her 
what we are not able to give.  The gift of a kidney would be to 
her the gift of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow I will be introducing my private member's bill, the 
awarding of the organ donation medal act.  This bill will 
posthumously recognize the supreme gift that is a given to others 
in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for the support of all members of the House in order 
to ensure that organ donors are suitably recognized through this 
bill.

city budget chief.  Margaret was one of the first voices speaking 
to the issue of domestic violence in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Margaret was invested with the Order of Canada in 1983.  In 1985 
she established a fund for Liberal women seeking provincial 
election.

called them, continuing her social work.

devotion to social justice in our community was known by all.

beside a dumpster.  The bag contained a million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just think about it, Mr. Speaker, you are out walking your dog

the result of yesterday afternoon's vote in the House is clear: 
the Prime Minister does not care about parliamentary approval 
for sending troops to Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How else to explain his scorn for democracy, when in 1991, he 
considered it vital to hold a vote in parliament before Canada 
participated in the gulf war?  Just how important is democracy 
to the Prime Minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one explanation, perhaps.  It comes from an interview 
the Prime Minister gave to a German newspaper early in the year. 
He said, and I quote “The good thing about our system in Canada 
is that, with a majority, the government just has to keep the 
members of its own party in line”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister missed a fine opportunity to obtain a strong 
consensus from all the parties in this House.  He could have 
strengthened his international position and honoured the demands 
he made himself in 1991.

lack of respect for democracy and for parliament all indicate 
that power is more important than democracy in this country.

think it is important for Canadians to know what the position of

Washington meeting.  The Prime Minister said yesterday “If 
everyone agrees, I will not be the only one not to agree”.  What 
on earth does that mean?  It sounds like the Prime Minister is 
sitting on the fence.  He is going to Washington to represent 
Canada and Canadians do not know what his position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister tell the House exactly what Canada's

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the position of Canada is very clear.  We are supporting 
and we are part of NATO because it is very important to stop the 
murdering, the raping and the cleansing that is going on in 
Kosovo.  We are part of a team of 19 countries which have decided 
that the best way to handle the problem at this moment is to have 
air strikes.  That is exactly what is going on.  The air strikes 
will continue for some time.  If someday we are confronted with 
the necessity to send ground troops, we will do so with the 
others.  I said that yesterday.  We will not be the ones to not 
be members of the team. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the issue will go before the committee in Washington in two or 
three days.  Now there is an opportunity for the Prime Minister 
to call a vote on the issue.  With a clear mandate from 
parliament the Prime Minister would be able to represent Canada's 
position with confidence.  As it sits right now, no one knows 
what his position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has two days left.  Will the Prime Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are not confronted with the problem at this moment. 
We are in the phase of air strikes.  If the opposition wanted to 
have a vote on that, a motion was introduced last Tuesday by 
them.  They could have put the question to the House.  They were 
not interested.  The Bloc was not interested on Monday either.

To date there has not been a penny go out to the farmers in

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The 
minister knows that hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees 
inside Kosovo lack basic food, water and shelter.  NATO's only 
bankrupt strategy is to keep bombing, possibly for months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concrete strategy is Canada pushing in NATO to meet the 
desperate humanitarian needs of these refugees, or does Canada 
simply support Tony Blair's statement that they will just have to

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that the position we have taken all

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

of the United States about its $6 billion cost, I think it is 
fair to note what our costs are.  Of course they are far more 
modest. Since June of last year when we first put our CF-18s into 
Aviano, Italy, the total cost to this date is $32.4 million. 
Since the air campaign began some 28 days ago, it is 
approximately $11.9 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the auditor general issued another scathing report on 
the minister of Indian affairs and it is virtually a carbon copy 
of the one issued in 1996.  The auditor general says that her 
department is woefully inadequate when it comes to 
accountability.  Allegations of wrongdoing and misuse of band 
funds are not followed up on and resolved.  In fact, the auditor 
general confirms that matters have gotten worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister deny that she and her incompetent

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member gives me the opportunity to reconfirm to this

system in my department.  In fact, that is why about a year ago I 
issued national guidelines on allegations management. In every

are trained to deal with the variety of allegations that we would 
receive from first nations—

my question is for the Minister for International Trade and has 
to do with the NAFTA meetings taking place later this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Minister for International Trade why 
Canada is not seeking either to entirely get rid of the investor 
state dispute settlement mechanism or to significantly modify it 
by actually amending the agreement.   Why do we read that the 
minister is willing to settle for an interpretative note?  This 
is certainly a backtracking from what I understand him to have 
said before and it is certainly inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he willing to change his mind on this and actually seek an 
amendment to that particular provision, chapter 11 of NAFTA or to 
eliminate it altogether? That is what is at the heart of what is 
wrong with NAFTA, and with the MAI when it was still alive. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

has been a tremendous success for all three countries.  Trade is 
up, investment is up, and employment is up. We have built a North 
American economy that is working well for all three countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, in addition to discussing the achievements, we 
also want to address the challenges that still confront NAFTA. We 
have said that we will put chapter 11 and the investor state on 
the agenda to discuss it from a perspective of transparency, 
narrowing the word and meaning of expropriation without reopening 
NAFTA and losing the entire chapter.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO COMMITTEE REPORT 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yesterday a question of privilege was raised 
by the hon. member for Red Deer.  At that time there were two 
points raised.  I judged that it was not a question of privilege, 
but I wanted to have more information on the whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first situation we dealt with yesterday concerned a matter 
of courtesy to have the information there, and we dealt with that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue dealt with the alleged passing out of 
information to the media before our members of parliament 
received it.  That was the issue we were dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked yesterday either the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the 
government House leader to give us an explanation today, and the 
government House leader seems prepared to give us the information 
now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I undertook yesterday to 
investigate the complaint made by the hon. member for Red Deer 
and others concerning the alleged leak of the government response 
to a report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and I now wish to report to the House on that 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, to put the matter into context, I should point out that 
the more common method of tabling such responses is by depositing 
them with the Clerk of the House, pursuant to Standing Order 
32(1).  As a consequence, such responses are often given little 
public profile and may even escape the attention of members.  In 
this case the government believed that the issue at hand required 
public attention and chose to table the response along with an 
outline of its position on the general question raised in the 
House itself.  The intent of the government was not to try to 
obscure the report from hon. members, but was quite the opposite; 
that is, to draw it to their immediate attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it was evident from an article in the media over 
the weekend that someone with at least basic knowledge of the 
position arrived at by the government chose to convey such 
information without authority and quite probably unlawfully to at 
least one journalist.  It does not appear from the article in 
question that the writer actually had a copy of the material 
tabled on Monday, but of course who knows?  However, somebody 
obviously improperly relayed information which was at that stage 
still a cabinet confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials in several departments were privy to this information 
and it is therefore quite impossible, at this stage at least, to 
identify the culprit.  I wish to assure the House that such 
unauthorized release of information is not condoned by the 
government, least of all by myself, and that a full investigation 
by the proper authorities is under way on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Red Deer indicated that a journalist 
contacted him some three hours—I believe that was the number he 
gave—before the documents were tabled, claiming to have a copy. 
I regret to report that two journalists were given copies of the 
material sometime between 1.30 p.m. and 2 p.m.—not three hours 
before—on an embargoed basis.  Even though the journalists in 
question appeared to have abided by the undertakings of the 
embargo, I regard this release as an error in judgment 
nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House that it is definitely not the regular 
practice of the government to provide advance copies of material 
to be tabled in the House to the media unless comparable 
arrangements are made for relevant opposition spokespersons, 
as is done on matters such as the budget.  I must assure the 
House that I will draw this matter to the attention of my 
colleagues in an effort to avoid such discourtesy in the future. 
I will come back to this point a little later in my remarks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Your nose is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Gentlemen, we are listening to an 
explanation.  I would very much appreciate it if hon. members 
would not heckle, especially at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this to be a very serious matter and I want to hear what 
the government House leader has to say about it.  I therefore ask 
hon. members to stop heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am giving the 
information which I know to the House and the information which I 
believe to be the truth.  For members to suggest that I am doing 
the opposite of telling the truth is not only disrespectful of 
me, but indeed of the entire House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been possible to discover any release of any material 
as earlier as three hours before the tabling, although, as I said 
earlier, sometime between 1.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. two copies were 
released.  I have been able to confirm that.  It may be possible 
to trace this.  If the hon. member for Red Deer wishes to be of 
assistance, he could speak directly to the office of my 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs or, if he prefers, 
with department officials or even me if he has evidence that 
information was available three hours ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue at hand concerns the availability of material 
once tabled in the House of Commons.  I am informed that the 
regular distribution system of the House of Commons was employed 
in the normal manner and that hon. members and their offices had 
access to the papers within the usual timeframes for such 
distribution.  The specific times vary, of course, depending on 
the location of each member.  I am informed that some offices 
received the material within about half an hour of tabling.  One 
case which I verified received it only minutes after it was 
tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not believe that sufficient courtesy was 
demonstrated in making information available to members in the 
House itself.  I say this for the following reason.  My 
information is that immediately after the tabling the kits 
containing the material tabled and related documents were placed 
in the government lobby and distributed in the foyer outside the 
House of Commons.  These kits were available to members of the 
opposition on request.  I was informed that a staff person from 
the New Democratic Party did in fact receive a kit upon request. 
However, they were not placed in the opposition lobby in a 
similar manner to their being placed in the government lobby, and 
I apologize for that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I am told that the clerk of the standing committee 
sent copies of the response to all members of the standing 
committee by electronic mail mechanism at 3.30 p.m.  Nonetheless, 
as I said earlier, copies were not placed in the opposition lobby 
for general availability.  That is not the same as what was 
afforded to government members and I consider that to be wrong as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties in the House sometimes place material in their 
lobbies for partisan use by members.  Nobody would expect that 
type of information, talking points and so on, to be shared. 
However, the material in question was not of a partisan nature, 
but was a review of government policy to which all hon. members 
have an equal right of access.  Again, I apologize most sincerely 
for this error in judgment and basic courtesy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reviewing this matter it is clear to me that the government 
could serve the House better by improving and standardizing the 
method of responding to committee reports, when required, by 
Standing Order 109.  I have therefore directed my officials to 
prepare new guidelines for departments with a view toward 
assuring that the needs of the House remain the principal 
objective of such responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case certainly demonstrates that some attention has to be 
given to the government's internal security.  In addition, it 
exposes some errors in judgment and courtesy which, quite 
frankly, embarrass me, for which I have apologized and about 
which I have taken steps to correct.  There was however, and I 
say this sincerely, no attempt to deprive the House of any 
information to which it is entitled. 
Indeed it was the opposite that was intended, that is to say, to 
maximize the information available to the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, however, that there was no contempt for the House 
either intended or committed and that this matter should be taken 
as a justifiable complaint.  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that you 
would determine that it was acted upon immediately, which it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have something new to 
add to what we are discussing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to clarify some of the points that have been raised just so that 
you have exactly what I said and the exact times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first interview was requested shortly after 12 o'clock, at 
about 12.04 or 12.05.  The next two were after one o'clock.  They 
said they had copies of it.  They quoted from it and asked me to 
respond to it.  That was three reporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the hon. House leader mentioned that these were available 
at 4.30.  My office is in the Centre Block and ours should be one 
of the first to be delivered, I believe.  We could not get a copy 
until 5.30, as I mentioned yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, for our lobby staff person whom the hon. House leader said 
could have gotten one across the way, it took 55 minutes before 
he was able to get a copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We checked with the Clerk and we were told it would be at least 
an hour before we could have a copy.  The clerk of the committee, 
whom we also called, confirmed that she had a great deal of 
difficulty getting copies so that she could distribute them to 
the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that we need an impartial investigation into 
all of this because there certainly is a conflict of information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I just want to say that I welcome the remarks of the government 
House leader in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt the sincerity of his apology or his good 
intentions in this regard, but I would say that he has a big job 
ahead of him.  I think there is a culture of contempt for 
parliament on the other side which he nobly struggles against but 
which we find rife within the ranks of his own party.  I wish him 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, I want to say that we were looking for a copy 
and once we realized where they might be, at about 3.45, we did 
not receive one until 3.55.  Of course the problem remained that 
by that time all the commenting was over and opposition members 
were in a position of not being able to comment in an informed 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I welcome the remarks of the government House leader and I 
wish him luck in bringing a rogue government to heel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We do have a dispute as to the facts and 
to the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand the hon. government House leader, he said in his 
statement that he was going to look into one or two other aspects 
about this particular incident as to the timing.  He asked the 
hon. member for Red Deer if the hon. member would share with him 
to try to get to the bottom of all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have an apology from the government House leader. I, 
too, believe it is sincere.  I take it at face value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the information should have been put in both lobbies.  No, 
it was not.  Will that be corrected?  The hon. government House 
leader has said that he will do everything he can to see that 
this type of thing does not occur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this whole issue of leaks, the opposition House leader says 
that he has intervened nine times.  That is true.  He has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given our committee on procedure in the House this 
particular problem to look at. 
I anxiously await its report to this House and to see what it has 
come up with as a suggestion where we, members of the House of 
Commons, can better regulate these “leaks”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to believe, as some hon. members have said, that 
the leaks come only from one side, but I do not.  I think the 
leaks come from all sides.  It is the institution that we are 
dealing with here.  It is the institution at this time in history 
is in our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in future this type of thing will not occur and I 
take the hon. government House leader's intervention as telling 
us that on his word it will not, to the best of his ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, to the other thing about when it was released, as to the 
times, was it 12.04 or was it 1.05, I think this might be open to 
discussion. The offer has been made by the government House 
leader to the member for Red Deer to collaborate, to see if they 
can get to the bottom of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for me, I judge there is not a question of privilege.  But 
how many times do we have to stand in this House together, 
to say that we want to do something about this.  If 
we decide to do something, I await some kind of indication from 
the committee.  If it is not forthcoming from the committee, then 
we will have to look perhaps at some other way of getting a 
way—and I use this word in the general sense—to police 
ourselves as members of parliament because we are not only 
hurting ourselves, we are hurting the institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I find that it is not a point of privilege.  I 
hope that it will not occur again.  I hope that the committee can 
come up with a solution to our particular dilemma.

bill commonly known as the taxpayers bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now the Reform Party through its democratic 
party process has had a policy in its blue book calling for the 
introduction of a taxpayers bill of rights which would protect 
taxpayers from summary unfair treatment by the Department of 
National Revenue. We now know that department will become the 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency which will be even less 
accountable than the current department is to this parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I move that the seventh report of the Standing 
Committee on Finance presented on Friday, June 12, 1998, be 
concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report from the finance committee deals with the issue of 
tied selling in the banking industry.  I think it is important to 
note that the banks have long been regarded as captains of the 
financial industry in Canada. 
They are heavily regulated by requirement of the government.  As 
well, they are required to operate in a most transparent and 
ethical manner by the consumers of their business.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private industry is willing to present to the public a code of 
ethics or a code of conduct by which it operates so that the 
people looking to put their trust in their institutions can 
plainly see the guidelines the banks are going to operate by. The 
public, the consumers of those services, is able to clearly judge 
whether those institutions are in fact operating within the 
guidelines of their code of ethics or code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will argue that the banking industry is a powerful 
decision maker in the financial sector and in the economy.  It 
makes very powerful decisions that affect the economy.  However, 
those decisions are less powerful than the Liberal cabinet which 
sits on the front benches of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the banks are prepared voluntarily to lay out their code 
of conduct, their code of ethics, their principles for all to see 
and to judge them by, the Liberal government has refused, for a 
number of years now, to make public the code of ethics that the 
Prime Minister himself says exists, the special code of ethics 
that he has for his ministers.  He has been telling us since 1994 
that indeed he has a special code of ethics that his ministers 
must adhere to and be judged by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Canadian public, the consumers of banking services, ask 
the banking institutions to have their code of ethics made 
public—and which they have no problem in complying—we in the 
Reform Party have been asking the Prime Minister himself to make 
public the code of ethics, that supposedly exists, that his 
cabinet members, the most powerful decision makers in the 
country, are bound to adhere to.  Yet he has refused every single 
request for the public presentation of that code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also understand that he has an ethics counsellor who helped 
draft the code of ethics.  We have requested from the ethics 
counsellor a copy of this code of ethics but he has told us to 
speak to the Prime Minister.  We have been talking and pleading 
with the Prime Minister to table in the House this mysterious 
code of ethics, if it actually exists, so that not only 
opposition members of parliament but even his own backbench 
members of parliament would be able to see this code of ethics. 
As well, the Canadian public would be able to see this mysterious 
code of ethics that the Prime Minister has maintained over the 
years actually exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the numerous requests to the Prime Minister to table 
this code of ethics, he has refused to do so a number of times. 
To date, we have not seen it.  He says he has it.  We have asked 
for it but he has not presented it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can only draw one of two conclusions:  Either the Prime 
Minister has not been totally honest with us in saying that he 
has— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the language the hon. member is using is not 
parliamentary in nature.  He is suggesting that a member of the 
House is not telling the truth.  I would ask perhaps that the 
hon. member retract his statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I listened to the 
comment by the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley and 
his exact words were “not totally”, so that there was that 
inference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the point made by the member for Simcoe—Grey.  I have 
allowed a certain discretion when the inference was not directed 
at a specific individual, but in this particular case, although 
it was oblique, it was directed at a specific individual.  I 
believe the member for Simcoe—Grey is quite correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley to withdraw that remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course I withdraw 
that.  Let me rephrase that.  I see you are anticipating this new 
phrase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has told us that this code of ethics exists 
and that it is a real thing but he has been reluctant or has 
refused to deliver it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either this code of ethics does not in fact exist—and the 
Canadian public, the opposition and even the government's own 
backbenchers can draw whatever conclusion they want from that—or 
this code of ethics does in fact exist and the Prime Minister, in 
his refusal to present it in the House, is doing it because he 
does not want his own cabinet members, the most powerful decision 
makers in the country, to be subject by the Canadian people to 
the close scrutiny that would be available if that code of ethics 
was made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to then draw the conclusion that either it does not 
exist, even though the Prime Minister has said it does, or it 
does exist and the Prime Minister feels that he may just possibly 
be embarrassed by the conduct of his ministers.  Given that those 
must be the only two conclusions we can draw, I say in the House 
that both of them, either one of them, are totally unacceptable 
in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian people look at the House of Commons and see 
the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the government and the 
opposition benches, I think we would all want them to have as 
much confidence as possible in the decision making that goes on 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the Prime Minister, in both of his red books, 
promised over and over again openness, transparency, honesty and 
straightforwardness in how the government would run the country. 
We see no example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very simple request.  If the Prime Minister has a code 
of ethics for his ministers, which he says he holds them 
responsible to, he should just simply present it to Canadians so 
they can benefit from it and be able look at it and say “This is 
fantastic.  I can see now that every cabinet minister in this 
government must hold themselves to the highest standards in the 
operation of their jobs and in the performance of their duties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we in the Reform Party want for Canadians and what 
I want for Canadians.  However, that is obviously not what the 
Prime Minister and every single one of his Liberal members want 
for Canadians.  That is a shameful display of arrogance in this 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received many letters from constituents all across the 
country asking me why the Prime Minister will not table this code 
of ethics.  They what to know what he is afraid of.  Only the 
Prime Minister knows what he is afraid of.  Only the Prime 
Minister knows the danger that might be present if he were to 
table that code of ethics for his ministers.  Not only could we 
judge and scrutinize the way cabinet ministers carry out their 
duties, but indeed all Canadians could do that.  Maybe then the 
Teflon jacket on our Prime Minister would start to fray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote last night by all the Liberal members in unison was an 
absolute shame.  It was a black mark on democracy.  It was a slap 
in the face of Canadians who want to trust the government.  The 
Liberals should be ashamed of themselves.  I hope the people of 
Canada will hold each and every one of them responsible for it. I 
would ask them to check out their local newspapers when they get 
back to their ridings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member speaks of ethics, of his request and of the defeat of 
his bill last night.  The very fact that he is making suggestions 
in the House that either individuals or the government itself are 
not abiding by a strict rule of ethics, whether it be on paper or 
whether it be in the heart, is profoundly sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question falls in line with the word “ethics”, which he has 
been tossing around in the House.  Would he stand up in the House 
today and clearly state that he feels all the members within his 
Reform caucus act in a very ethical manner when they provide the 
services they were elected to provide, keeping in mind the 
commitments of his leader on things like Stornoway, chauffeur 
driven cars, clothing expenses and so on?  I wonder if he would 
take a moment to reflect on his own party's ethics or lack 
thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the wall of my 
constituency office is a code of ethics that I signed in front of 
over 100 witnesses when I was first elected in 1993.  I had no 
hesitation in making that code of ethics public. It hangs in my 
office for all my constituents to see.  It outlines all the 
promises I made to my riding and how I would conduct my duties as 
a member of parliament, their elected representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask nothing less than that of the government.  Let it put 
forward its code of ethics.  Let the Prime Minister tell the 
Canadian people exactly how he expects his ministers to do their 
job.  The Prime Minister has not done that.  Every single Liberal 
member of that government voted against it last night. This was a 
shameful thing for them to do and they should be ashamed of 
themselves.  They have once again betrayed the trust of the 
Canadian people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the code of ethics is a very important issue.  I thank the hon. 
member for bringing forward the issue and for demanding that the 
code of ethics be tabled by the Prime Minister and his cabinet in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, we saw that not even one Liberal member voted for it. 
They seem to have some sort of fear, or, as the hon. member 
pointed out, maybe the code of ethics does not exist, or maybe 
they just do not want to present it.  What is the hon. member's 
opinion—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was under the impression that the hon. member was 
bringing forward a motion with respect to finance.  I am 
curious— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a point of 
debate and not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to find out 
from the hon. member what conclusion he draws when he sees there 
is hesitation in tabling the code of ethics document in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the only conclusion I 
can draw is that either there is not a code of ethics, as he says 
there is, or he has some fear that his cabinet ministers might 
breach that code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has not only refused to produce the so-called code of ethics. 
He failed on another promise that he made in May 1994.  He was 
asked if there would be a code of ethics and he said yes.  He 
said “As a matter of fact I will consult with the leader of the 
opposition and the leader of the Reform Party before making that 
appointment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who said that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  The Prime Minister said that in 
May 1994.  He said that he would search out an ethics 
commissioner who would create the code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not confer with the leader of the opposition or the 
leader of the Reform Party.  We were the third party then.  We 
are now the official opposition.  Not only did he not fulfil that 
promise, but now he says that there is a code of ethics he is 
unable or unwilling to present to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the conclusion I draw is that there must be something 
the Prime Minister is not telling us about this code of ethics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today both sides of the House stood and welcomed a new 
duly elected member.  I am rising to debate the motion by my 
colleague from Prince George.  I bring to the attention of the 
House that what I have to say is more important than just one MP. 
It is more important than the Liberals.  It it is more important 
than any party in the opposition.  I am talking about what is 
important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days ago a group of grade six students from Kanata 
came to visit me.  It was strange that they would come in from an 
Ontario city but I enjoyed them.  One thing I said to them was 
“You are more important as individuals today than I am because 
you are the future of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be talking in these brief few minutes about the issue 
of tied selling.  I will be talking about what is important to 
the House and every member of the House.  We have to get into a 
selling program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just debated the issue of the leakage of reports.  What did 
the public see when it listened to this debate?  It goes beyond 
this institution.  It goes beyond the city of Ottawa.  It goes to 
the farthest point west on Vancouver Island.  It goes to 
Bonavista.  Canadians are now looking at the House in a 
disrespectful way.  As individuals, as hon. members, our 
responsibility is to uphold the dignity and the traditions of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know the member is discussing the behaviour of members of 
parliament, but this is a motion that has to do with tied 
selling.  The member just said that he would not be speaking 
about tied selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great interest in this topic.  My colleagues opposite 
have raised it.  I think, Mr. Speaker, you should rule that he 
should address the topic of the motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The deputy 
government House leader makes a very good point.  The opposition 
brought in a specific concurrence motion.  The Chair will ensure 
that those who wish to speak to the subject remain focused 
closely on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I was getting at was 
our responsibilities as members of the House to take a look at 
all things which affect finance in the House and the committee 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business deals with 
finance and the financial business of thousands of its members 
across Canada.  Those same members rate politicians at the lowest 
end of the scale.  That is exactly what I am telling the 
government opposite.  It is time we stopped the nonsense.  It is 
time we stopped the bickering and took a look at something which 
is bigger than both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with financial matters and with the report of the 
Standing Committee of Finance it should be of the greatest 
importance.  Let me put it this way.  At the present time 
whenever Canadians see expenditures, revenues and so on, they 
look upon them with a great deal of suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of all parties in the House need to take all possible 
steps within our powers from every corner of the House to 
re-establish with the Canadian people a basic trust in what we 
are doing and a basic trust that every cent of revenue which 
comes in and every expenditure which is made are totally 
accounted for including, as the hon. member said, tied selling. 
That is a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pass a paper around when I talk to grade 11 and 12 high school 
students.  When I say politician I tell them to write down one 
word.  One of the most common words they write down is the same 
as the Canadian public says, crooks.   We have a job of selling 
to do not only within this finance committee report.  That is 
true, but we need to be more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, after 42 years in public life I believe the motion of 
the member from Prince George should be thoroughly considered by 
the opposition.  I hope Canadians see the purpose of what we have 
done today in the hon. member's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is about finance.  It is about tied selling.  It is 
about a lot of latitude.  When we talk about finance and some of 
the things we really value, we talk about honestly, integrity and 
ethics.  We sometimes wonder why the Canadian public does not 
really appreciate politicians.  Perhaps it is because sometimes 
some politicians have the habit of misinterpreting or 
misinforming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say something.  I am a minister of the government.  There 
is a formal code of ethics for ministers.  It is a public 
document.  We have to fill out how much we make and what we own 
and all the rest of it.  Over and above that, the Prime Minister 
insists on other things from us.  He names us.  He decides what 
he wants us to do.  That is his prerogative.  We have access to 
information. 
Absolutely everything we do is scrutinized every day.  We 
certainly do not fear any of that because we know it is a part of 
what makes the country so great.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things that have gone on are absolutely 
unbelievable.  Maybe Reformers should look to mend some of their 
own ways and look to what they said before they got here. 
Perhaps, if they followed that to the letter, we would all be 
better off and Canadians would respect us all a lot more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked about 
some hon. members misinforming.  I had no intention of doing that 
and I certainly did not do that.  Nor have I misinformed in my 
whole career.  I too have a code of ethics and I have about 42 
years in my record to prove it.

when the Speaker of the House and the hon. House leader wanted to 
look into something which does not show respect for the House? It 
was a leak, and that is what bothers me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the House did a better selling job, not just selling 
the finance report but selling ourselves, our total selves, our 
honesty and integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I will go across the 
Chamber and recognize the member for Simcoe—Grey.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is refreshing to know that you are approaching this in a fair 
manner, unlike perhaps some of my hon. colleagues across the 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The topic at hand was tied selling which is of concern to 
Canadians across the country.  We are sitting here discussing 
tied selling.  It is a very relevant subject for the House to be 
discussing.  However, once again when we have an issue at hand 
that is of concern to Canadians all across the country— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  They support tied selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  By the way, they support tied selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with a topic such as this, all of a sudden 
they detract from the important and critical issue of the 
finances of Canadians and go to the ethics of cabinet and the 
ethics of the Prime Minister.   They will not talk about their 
own ethics.  I put a question very— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Actually the hon. 
member for Souris—Moose Mountain will have to anticipate the 
question because he has exactly 25 seconds to make his point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take a bit of resentment 
from the inference that I was not being fair.  Let me tell the 
hon. member that I am one of the fairest men he will ever take a 
look at, and he should take a good look at me right now.  What I 
am talking about— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tied selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Yes, indeed, it is tied selling and 
anything related to the selling of the House to Canadians.  That 
is what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
move that we proceed to orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  When you called for a resumption of debate, the hon. 
member for Calgary East was quite prepared to stand and continue 
the debate.  Unfortunately he was missed.  I wanted to bring that 
to your attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair is deeply 
indebted to the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh has moved 
that the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  Is it the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?

<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (for the Solicitor General of Canada)</B> 
moved that Bill C-69, an act to amend the Criminal Records Act 
and to amend another act in consequence, be read for the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
rise to speak to and comment on the motion at second reading of 
Bill C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since coming to power, our government has shown through specific 
actions its desire to thoroughly reform our criminal system, by 
passing, for example, a number of administrative and legislative 
measures to prevent the sexual exploitation of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, in 1995, our government passed amendments to the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act to allow, among other 
things, certain offenders to be kept in prison until the very 
last day of their sentence, if it had been shown that they were 
likely to commit another sexual offence against a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, we added a new category of offender to the Criminal 
Code, that of long term offender, which applies to sexual 
offenders and provides for their surveillance for up to ten 
years after the end of their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, we created the national flagging system, which through 
the intermediary or the use of the Canadian police information 
centre, which I will call the CPIC throughout my text, enables 
prosecutors to better identify and try violent offenders, under 
the provisions of the Criminal Code pertaining to dangerous 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national screening system, created in 1994, also uses 
information from the CPIC on criminal records to help certain 
agencies identify child molesters seeking work where they could 
be in contact with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planned measures will therefore allow the organizations 
concerned to protect the vulnerable individuals for whom they 
are responsible.  When we speak of vulnerable individuals, we 
mean primarily all those who are more at risk than the rest of 
the population, because of age, disability or handicap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard about troubling cases where children having 
been sexually abused by individuals in a position of trust.  Of 
course this has a devastating impact on the victims and their 
families, but it also has one on the community as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the provincial and municipal governments, as well 
as the volunteer organizations, adopt policies and practices 
aimed at preventing such occurrences. 
While a criminal record check by the police is an important 
screening tool, this must not be considered the first, last, or 
only method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organizations must have a reliable recruiting, training, and 
supervision system.  Any properly designed screening system must 
make unqualified candidates, pedophiles included, withdraw of 
their own accord, when they see how careful the organizations 
are about selecting candidates and ensuring the safety and 
protection of those for whom they are responsible.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I will refer briefly, but with the utmost 
pride, to the very close collaboration that has been in place 
since 1994 between the government and an organization called 
Volunteer Canada, in promoting a national information campaign 
on this important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We produced educational material for distribution across Canada 
via volunteer organizations and local communities.  Thanks to 
these measures, increasing numbers of organizations are gaining 
an awareness of the importance of an effective screening 
mechanism.  Despite all that has been done, more needs to be 
done, and we want to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is behind Bill C-69.  It provides for a flagging 
system.  This system of flags for certain files has the support 
of our provincial and territorial colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I would remind members that, during the past year, the 
federal-provincial-territorial task force on high risk offenders 
met on several occasions to discuss certain issues with respect 
to information systems on sex offenders, and the pardon of sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It focused primarily on ways of simplifying police access to the 
criminal records of pardoned sex offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following its discussions, the task force produced a report 
containing ten recommendations, one of which specifically deals 
with the flagging system the CPIC should adopt to identify 
criminal records of pardoned sex offenders.  This report 
received the approval of federal, provincial and territorial 
justice ministers at their October 1998 meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the provisions of the Criminal Records Act and 
administrative guidelines allow access to the sealed records of 
pedophiles, particularly when the police are looking for a 
criminal record.  Naturally, when the police know or suspect 
that an individual with a record has been granted a pardon, they 
may, based on fingerprints, submit the sealed record to the 
attention of the solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the police are unaware that a pardon has been 
granted, they do not necessarily look up fingerprints while they 
search for a criminal record.  In such a case, a normal query of 
the CPIC system does not reveal the existence of a criminal 
record for which a pardon has been granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that the procedure I have just described can apply in all 
cases—I repeat, in all cases—where a pardoned sex offender is 
being screened prior to being given a position of trust, Bill 
C-69 proposes that such files be flagged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A police officer doing a check would immediately see that a 
pardon had been granted and that the file was sealed.  He could 
then apply to the solicitor general for permission to break the 
seal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This indicator appears only to police officers authorized to do 
screening research at the request of an agency acting in good 
faith and with the consent of the person the research is on. 
These are important mechanisms intended to ensure the 
credibility of the process.  By requiring finger prints be 
taken, we are making sure the person in question is correctly 
identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new arrangement will have retroactive effect, so that the 
files of rehabilitated individuals already in the system may 
have these indicators attached to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains provisions guaranteeing the rights of 
rehabilitated individuals.  Only authorized police officers and 
officials responsible for applying the law will have access to 
the information on the offenders, and each applicant must sign a 
consent form in this regard.  By requiring this consent, we give 
applicants the choice of having their job application processed 
or of withdrawing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they refuse to co-operate, applicants will be making it clear 
to the agency responsible that they are not perhaps the best 
individuals for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 will also continue to give the solicitor general the 
discretionary power to remove the seal on the file of a 
rehabilitated individual.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As there is no reason to think that the minister's use of his 
current discretionary power is causing a problem, we must keep 
it to ensure the integrity of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also carefully re-examined the legislative 
provisions of Bill C-69 to ensure they are in keeping with the 
provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore have the national police data bank, the CPIC, the 
Canadian police information centre, which is operated by the 
RCMP on behalf of all police services.  This bank contains 
information on offenders' criminal records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the national screening system I referred to before, 
by which employers or volunteer groups working with children and 
other vulnerable individuals may require a record check of 
applicants as a condition for hiring or for volunteer work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conjunction with the notation system proposed in Bill C-69, 
the CPIC and the national screening system are designed to 
prevent sex offenders from infiltrating positions of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may wonder “Why not do away with pardons, or 
considerably restrict access to them?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, a pardon allows persons found guilty of a criminal 
offence, who have served their sentence and proven that they 
have become law-abiding citizens, to have their records sealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those making this request have led crime-free lives for an 
average of eight years before applying for pardon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the majority of pardoned individuals live as 
honest citizens is clear proof that ex-offenders can indeed 
become law-abiding members of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is important to defend the principle of 
pardon, while taking care not to diminish the integrity of the 
sytem and making changes which will help provide children and 
other vulnerable groups with better protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with a comment that may be a bit 
unusual for this House. 
In this process, on behalf of the Solicitor General, and with 
his approval, I pledged before the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights that we would do everything in our power to 
speed up the process of getting Bill C-69 to a committee if it 
passes second reading.  There, it will be able to be examined by 
serious and conscientious people with one common goal: to 
protect our population, particularly our children and people 
with certain disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I would like to pay tribute to all the political parties 
represented in this House, which have helped ensure that this 
will be possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who are listening today and also for 
those who are in the House, I think we should clarify the issue 
which Bill C-69 is attempting to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today many people do not realize what a pardon is.  I 
always thought when there was a pardon it meant that some new 
information had come to light and the person had been convicted 
wrongly, was not guilty of the offence and, therefore, they were 
pardoned and the whole record was struck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is not the case in Canada with the way our parole 
board and pardons division work.  What happens in Canada today is 
that once a person has been convicted, sentenced and then 
released on parole, if they have not been caught committing 
another offence and have not re-offended, they can apply for a 
pardon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people do apply for pardons.  Let me quote some numbers for 
the clarification of those listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person applies for a pardon, what are their chances of 
getting it?  According to the National Parole Board records for 
the last number of years, only about 1% of the total decisions 
that it makes every year are denials.  In 1996-97 there were over 
18,000 decisions made with respect to pardons.  Of those 
decisions, 184 were denials, which is about 1%, and 12,566 
pardons were granted for mixed indictable offences or summary 
offences.  In effect, about 96% of the people who applied for 
pardons received them.  It is almost a fait accompli.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of a pardon is that a person's record is now sealed, 
hidden, and no one will ever know they had this on their record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would allow, in certain circumstances, for that 
pardoned record to be opened.  We think that is laudable and it 
is consistent with a bill which our party put forward, which has 
been in the House for some time, Bill C-284, which calls for 
basically the same thing.  The government has come forward with 
its bill which has followed ours in the same vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The type of pardons that we want to bring to light are the ones 
that relate to sexual offences, particularly sexual offences 
against children.  There are some good reasons for that when we 
look at the recidivism rates of those people who are involved in 
that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member equated a pardon with being rehabilitated. 
From government studies we can see that just because a person has 
received a pardon for a grievous offence, such as a sexual 
offence against children, the recidivism rates are so high that 
we cannot equate a pardon with rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report was prepared by Corrections Research and Development, 
which is a government department, concerning child molester 
recidivism.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial follow-up of the child molesters found that 42% were 
reconvicted of a sexual or violent crime during the 15 to 30 year 
follow-up period....  The highest rate of recidivism, 77%, was for 
those with previous sexual offences, who selected extrafamilial 
boy victims, and who were never married. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a 15 to 30 year program with rates as high as 77%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report to the federal, provincial and territorial ministers on 
information systems on sex offenders against children stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reconvictions underestimates the rate of reoffending—as only a 
fraction of the sexual offences against children result in the 
offender being convicted.  Consequently, the proportion of child 
molesters in the present study who reoffended would be expected 
to be greater than 50%, but the precise proportion is difficult 
to estimate.  All the men could have reoffended, but only half 
got caught. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can see that the concern is the rate of recidivism, 
and rightly so I would submit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the ability of our medical profession and our 
institutions to rehabilitate people who are in this situation? 
Again I quote from a government report by the Correctional 
Service of Canada, entitled “Factors Related to Recidivism Among 
Released Federal Sex Offenders”.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is notable that the pedophile group had the highest rate of 
sexual recidivism relative to incest offenders or rapists....  This 
finding suggests that pedophiles may be more persistent with 
respect to committing sex crimes over time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another report of the Correctional Service of Canada states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does sex offender treatment work?  We are still uncertain.  There 
is disagreement even amongst the most prolific and knowledgeable 
researchers in the area. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, the whole concept of rehabilitating 
people who have fallen to this level of depravity is in question. 
Therefore, the whole premise of giving pardons to people who have 
not been caught is a moot point and in fact puts our children at 
risk.  That is why, in some ways, I am glad that Bill C-69 has 
come forward.  However, later I will make the point that it needs 
to be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who should have access to this information if there is a 
pardoned record out there?  It is our premise and the premise of 
the bill that we put forward that the key people who should have 
access to this information are those who are hiring people or 
bringing in volunteers to look after children. 
These organizations want to know that every possible check has 
been made to ensure that those they are bringing in to care for 
the children which they are responsible for have been thoroughly 
examined and that they are not putting their children at risk or 
putting these people back in a situation where they will fall 
prey to old problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We questioned various groups.  We looked for support on this 
issue and we asked how they felt about it.  We have support from 
groups right across the country.  I have in my hand a list of 40 
different national child care organizations which desperately are 
asking why we are hiding these pardoned pedophile records from 
them when they are bringing people on board.  What is the point of 
not informing them of this kind of information?  They want 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups include the Adoption Council of Canada, boys and 
girls clubs, Canadians Addressing Sexual Exploitation, minor 
hockey associations, and even The Sheldon Kennedy Foundation. 
These groups point out that people who are predisposed to this 
type of depravity work to put themselves in positions of trust or 
care over children.  They purposely do it.  That is why we need 
to make every attempt to protect children from this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard from the YMCA and, interestingly enough, the 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General and the Minister of 
Family and Social Services from my province of Alberta.  Both of 
those ministers have sent strong letters endorsing the bill which 
we put forward, Bill C-284, which requires passing along 
information concerning pardoned records to groups which care for 
children.  In some ways Bill C-69 attempts to do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably not surprising to anyone that all of these groups 
want access to this information.  We all say publicly that we 
want to do all we can to care for children.  It is important and 
incumbent upon this House that we make every move possible and I 
am glad we are debating this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some key points in Bill C-69 which need to be 
strengthened.  This bill is the weaker sister of Bill C-284, 
which was brought forward some months back and is now before the 
justice committee.  Bill C-69 proposes to possibly extend—and 
possibly is the key word here—greater background check 
information to a person or organization responsible for the 
well-being of one or more children, or vulnerable persons, or to 
the person to whom the application has been made for a volunteer 
position.  The government is saying that possibly it will release 
this information under Bill C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 states that certain criminal records for which a 
pardon has been granted or issued would be flagged in the system, 
retroactively if necessary, as part of the criminal convictions 
retrieval system.  That is a good idea.  We support it.  However, 
it does not specify which offences would be flagged.  It states 
that those will later be mentioned in the regulations.  We have 
not seen those regulations.  We are not sure exactly which ones 
are going to be included and which are not.  When this bill goes 
to committee we will be calling for a clear disclosure of which 
offences will be included in the regulations under by Bill C-69 
because they are not explicit in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 6.3 of Bill C-69 requires the consent of the job 
applicant, in writing, for the authorities to check to see if 
there is a flagged criminal record.  I do not have a problem with 
that, but even when the person has given consent the solicitor 
general still has the authority not to disclose this information 
to the hiring body.  It seems strange to me that a person can 
give consent for his pardoned record to be checked, after it has 
been confirmed that he is applying for a position of trust or 
care over children, and yet the solicitor general will not make 
it automatic that this group know the person's past.  The 
government wants to continue to have the discretion to say that 
it will decide in every case whether it will release this 
information.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to understand why the solicitor general might choose 
not to release this information if the applicant himself or 
herself has already approved its release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concerns me.  We have been pardoning pedophiles for 20 
years and we have never released this information.  There is a 
lengthy process involved to get it.  It is so lengthy and 
cumbersome that most people do not even know it exists.  We have 
never made any attempt to advise people that they could be 
bringing on board someone who has been pardoned of a sexual 
offence against children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will anything change with Bill C-69?  We are still leaving the 
discretion in the hands of the solicitor general.  If we know 
there is a risk, and the person has signed off on it, it seems to 
me that it should be automatic, as opposed to more red tape and 
more bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real problem with this.  Julian Fantino, head of the 
police association, said the police are put in a difficult 
position because of Bill C-69.  An organization requests to have 
a record checked.  The person signs off on information with 
respect to his pardon and criminal activity.  They go in and find 
that there is a flag for a pardon.  Under Bill C-69 the police 
could not tell the hiring organization that the flag is there 
because they would be violating the Canadian Human Rights Act for 
revealing that there is a pardoned record.  It has to go all the 
way up the ladder and all the way back down, and they still may 
not be able to give the information if the solicitor general says 
no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That puts the police in a very difficult situation.  If the 
conditions are met, we should be releasing the information.  That 
is one of the amendments we will be calling for and that is 
consistent with what is called for in Bill C-284 which is already 
before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, Bill C-284 calls for an amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act which would allow organizations which 
are looking after children, or other vulnerable individuals, to 
make a decision not to hire if they find that someone has a 
pardoned record for a sexual offence against children.  They 
could make a decision not to hire and not be later dragged into 
court for violating someone's human rights because of making that 
decision based on the existence of a pardoned record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As crazy as that sounds, the fact is that if people are not 
hired because of a pardoned record their rights are being 
violated.  Therefore, we thought it necessary to include, as 
advised by legal counsel of the House, a clause in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act that would allow these organizations to make a 
decision not to hire and not be held accountable for breaching 
the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not been touched by Bill C-69 and I think that it opens 
up children's organizations to all kinds of new litigation and 
liability should they decide not to hire someone who has a 
pardoned record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is again following Reform's lead by putting 
forward legislation which the solicitor general initially 
opposed.  He opposed Bill C-284 when it was introduced.  Now he 
has introduced a weaker sister, a look alike bill, under his own 
name, Bill C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason he has done that is because there has been 
such strong public support for Bill C-284, which has come in the 
form of letters and petitions.  In fact, the whole reason the 
bill came to the House and was passed on second reading was 
because of a 25,000 name petition from parents and children's 
organization who were saying that they had to have access to this 
kind of information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the government come forward with its own bill, Bill 
C-69.  As it is presently worded, Bill C-69 only goes part of the 
way toward better protecting our most vulnerable.  It puts too 
much discretion in the hands of the solicitor general, the same 
solicitor general who has held this information for 20 years and 
not revealed it to these same children's organizations. There is 
discretion all the way up in Bill C-69 as to whether or not these 
organizations will be informed of the pardoned record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the criteria has been met.  A children's organization is 
hiring somebody to look after children.  The person has agreed 
that his or her record can be checked including the pardoned 
record. But that record is still not going to be released without 
the solicitor general's okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not requiring disclosure once the criteria is met and the 
consent is given, or specifying the type of crimes it is aimed 
at, Bill C-69 is much weaker than Bill C-284 which is at 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not amending the Canadian Human Rights Act which I just 
mentioned, Bill C-69 opens up children's organizations and 
agencies caring for vulnerable individuals to liability and 
litigation by an individual who feels that he or she was 
discriminated against on the basis of his or her pardoned record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the shortcomings of Bill C-69, Reform still supports 
its intent.  However, we would much rather work with the current 
Bill C-284 at committee stage.  It essentially proposes the same 
thing as the bill the solicitor general has belatedly introduced 
here.  We have expressed our desire to work with both bills and 
to work with the solicitor general by accepting amendments to 
Bill C-284 in committee and combining them on the merits of both 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By co-operating at committee stage the House will not have to 
start at square one in the legislative process as the solicitor 
general is proposing with Bill C-69.  After passing second 
reading it took four months to get Bill C-284 to its current 
committee stage.  We can see what might be entailed in a 
potential delay of starting back at second reading of Bill C-69. 
It is good today that we are moving ahead to get both these bills 
in committee at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the solicitor general will go beyond partisan politics 
and ensure prompt passage of strengthened legislation that will 
better protect our children from individuals who are predisposed 
to targeting and victimizing the most innocent of our society, 
our children.  In the days ahead we look forward to bringing 
forward strengthening amendments to both bills in committee and 
coming back to the House with an improved package that will go 
through third reading quickly, then on to the Senate and 
eventually into law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to such an important topic, all the more so 
with you in the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a bill, with the particular objectives it has, exemplifies 
how all members of this House can work together constructively. 
In fact, a comparison of Bill C-284 and Bill C-69 will be 
edifying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 provides a mechanism for disclosing the contents of an 
individual's criminal record to the appropriate authorities in 
cases of sex offences. 
As my colleagues pointed out earlier, the purpose of this bill 
is to prevent serious repeat sex offences against children or 
other vulnerable members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would this bill actually do?  It would introduce a system 
to flag sex offences so as to limit the number of situations in 
which a person found guilty of a sexual offence, indecent 
assault or whatever, could again come into contact with or take 
up a position of authority over children or other vulnerable 
individuals.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the purpose of this bill is to prevent a pardoned 
sex offender from becoming a care provider, a supervisor at a 
park or a children's recreational facility, or a day care 
worker, or being in any position where he could take advantage 
of the innocence of a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-69 could apply to special care facilities for the mentally 
handicapped or to support services to help them prepare for 
living on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society, we have too often heard of cases of sexual abuse 
committed by repeat offenders who had officially been pardoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to respond to requests by 
associations promoting the rights of victims of criminal acts 
and, more importantly, to ensure a safe environment, something 
we all want as a community, in which our children, our most 
valuable asset, may grow and develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism I spoke of at the start of my remarks is an 
indicator, a sort of warning light, that follows the pardoned 
record of a sexual offender and is activated when a security 
check is made on the reliability of the individual, who is 
seeking work that would put him or her in contact with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can already hear the hardline libertarians railing against 
such a practice, given that a pardoned sexual offender is 
officially rehabilitated as an individual who respects the law 
and the ethics guiding our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To them, I would say, there are never enough ways to ensure the 
security and development of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, Bill C-69 takes account of the guarantee of 
confidentiality inherent in rehabilitation and for this reason 
security checks must be done with the approval of the applicant. 
This check will be done in the national screening system under 
the Canadian police information centre by individuals duly 
authorized to consult the register. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the famous warning light come on, under the law the 
record and its contents would be sent to the solicitor general, 
who would ultimately decide on the relevance of removing the 
seal from the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here the big question arises.  It represents a major concern for 
the Bloc Quebecois.  Should the solicitor general not be obliged 
to reveal the contents of the record that are of a sexual nature 
simply as a precautionary measure for children and society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the minister's discretion could apply to the contents 
of the record where they apply to other issues, except those of 
a sexual nature.  In simpler words, the minister, in the case of 
sexual offences, must reveal the content of the criminal record; 
he may do so for all other cases.  He would continue to enjoy 
discretionary powers in all other cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this means we might save a child, who would otherwise be a 
victim of sexual aggression, I think the bill would have served 
its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the bill indicates that the minister may inform 
the appropriate authorities of the contents of the record in 
question.  We are, however, of the opinion that there is a moral 
obligation for the Solicitor General to disclose its contents 
when it includes a listed offence.  As I have said, this moral 
obligation ought to be translated into a legal one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, this security check poses a threat to children or 
other vulnerable individuals.  With this adjustment, the 
government might better attain the objective of its bill.  It 
might even, I believe, benefit from the unanimous support of 
this House, even that of my colleagues in the Reform Party, who 
are somewhat unenthusiastic about Bill C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would also have to continue to heed our 
recommendations and proposals, including those the Bloc 
Quebecois will bring to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return briefly to the verification system 
itself.  As I said, these checks would be done via the national 
screening system administered by the Canadian Police Information 
Centre.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article in this morning's <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, journalist Jim 
Bronskill describes the technological obsolescence of the CPIC's 
data bank computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, in my opinion, an unacceptable situation, and it is the 
responsibility of the federal government to ensure proper 
funding for this body, which provides frontline information to 
some 13,400 police forces all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early this year, in March, we MPs had the opportunity to learn 
more about this matter from the Canadian Police Association at 
its annual legislative conference, held right here in Ottawa. 
I had an opportunity, as did several of my colleagues in the 
House, to discuss the issue with Yves Prud'homme, the president 
of the Fédération québécoise des policiers et policières du 
Québec, and to actually meet in my office with police officers 
from all over Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois sees Bill C-69 as one more step along the road 
to ensuring our children's safety, but we must make sure that we 
have reliable records in the national screening system so that 
we can implement this political and collective wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point.  Do we have real and effective 
guarantees regarding the turnaround for analysing files 
submitted to the CPIC that could eventually end up in the 
solicitor general's office? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the matter of the time it takes for a file to make it 
all the way up to the solicitor general's office and back down 
again.  Bloc Quebecois members have some questions and concerns 
about the speed with which files could be processed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill right now to allay our concerns. 
However, I hope that the government will take note and introduce 
specific provisions so as to prevent any loopholes that would 
threaten the safety of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this brief overview of the bill, I urge Liberal 
backbenchers as well to pressure the solicitor general to put 
more teeth into Bill C-69 and make it more consistent with the 
problems we are actually facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois therefore supports this bill so that it can 
be referred quickly to committee for consideration. 
As I said at the very beginning of my speech, a comparison with 
Bill C-284 will be edifying.  Finally, a positive response to our 
concerns would help to ensure speedy passage of this bill to 
ensure the well-being and safety of our children and vulnerable 
members of our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for Charlevoix with 
whom I have had discussions on this bill and who sits on the 
justice committee with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a pleasure to say that for the second time in two 
days we see the beginning of some co-operation between all 
parties in this House on a particular measure that is important 
to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we had an opportunity to discuss in this House the 
unanimous report of the justice committee dealing with victims of 
crime.  The speeches yesterday reflected the commitment of all 
parties to ensure that those people who are victims of crime have 
a role to play in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are watching on CPAC and for those who read 
<I>Hansard</I> it is important to know that government sometimes 
can work together with others.  That is not to say there are not 
some areas in this bill that need addressing and they have been 
raised by other members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party will ensure that this important 
legislation gets to the justice committee as quickly as possible. 
It deals with protecting those who are most vulnerable in our 
society, children and adults who may be vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has always been the commitment of the New Democratic Party. 
It is why we have always pushed for inquiries into child poverty. 
It is why we have always ensured that the disabled are protected 
under human rights legislation.  We in the New Democratic Party 
recognize that the strength of our society is measured in the way 
it protects those who are most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud this piece of legislation.  It is important to know 
that it did come forward in another bill, a private member's bill 
which is now before the justice committee. 
Recognizing that there was mounting support for that, the 
solicitor general drafted his own legislation and introduced it 
to the House a few days ago and it will now go to committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That legislation does a number of things.  It attempts to 
protect children from pedophiles.  The mechanism by which it 
allows that responds to those many groups that have been 
mentioned by other speakers, the boys and girls clubs, the YMCA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the president of the board of directors of the YMCA in my 
own community.  We had to deal on an ongoing basis with hiring 
people, with volunteers who came in to work with children.  We 
had to ensure that we were not submitting the children to any 
kind of risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall in my own riding when an organization through no 
fault of its own did find itself subject to litigation. One of 
its volunteers was found to have abused children in the care of 
that organization.  The community was concerned. That 
organization, which had good principles and laudable goals, was 
set back many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those organizations will be pleased to see this legislation come 
before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be remiss if we did not say that for a long time in 
this society we did not recognize that children and vulnerable 
people could be the subject of criminal actions of a sexual 
nature.  It is to the credit and strength of character of the 
many people who have come forward in the last few years.  The 
Sheldon Kennedy organization has been mentioned.  Children and 
adults have come forward to expose what has happened to them. 
Whether it was at Mount Cashel, residential schools, hockey 
rinks, it takes tremendous courage to come forward.  Today, by 
the passage and examination of this legislation, I think we are 
responding to those needs in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I echo the comments I made yesterday.  It is important to 
recognize there has to be a balance.  Where we have to be careful 
with this legislation is in the protection of human rights and 
the protection of privacy.  This bill makes an effort and we will 
examine it very closely in committee to ensure that it meets all 
the qualifications so that privacy is protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the good things in the bill and one of the things we 
pushed for in the private member's bill was that the individuals 
who apply to work with children in an organization be notified. 
They have to give their consent to the searching of their records 
to see if they have been pardoned for any kind of sex offence 
against children.  By ensuring they have to consent to that, we 
allow them to withdraw their names if that is the way they want 
to go, or to allow them to know this check is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary Centre spoke to this and raised some very 
good questions.  I think they are questions we will examine in 
committee.  I expect he, our party, the Bloc and the Progressive 
Conservative Party will bring forward amendments to the 
legislation to ensure that it meets both of those needs.  The 
member made some good points but there are some other points I 
have to raise in response to what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member discussed what pardons were and how many people 
receive pardons.  It is important to note that 97% of those who 
receive pardons never reoffend.  There is some indication that 
those who receive pardons are deserving.  We are a human system. 
There are those who do reoffend and perhaps they ought not to 
have been granted a pardon.  A 3% error rate is not perfect, but 
it does justify that the pardon is appropriate for the other 97% 
who have not reoffended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many pardons are granted for things other than sexual offences. 
It is important for people to understand that the vast majority 
are for shoplifting offences that occurred 20 years ago, or a 
disturbing the peace charge that happened when someone was in 
university.  They may have been minor incidents but they provide 
those persons with criminal records for the rest of their lives. 
When they apply for a position where they have to be bonded, 
where they cannot have a criminal record, they may lose that job 
for that kind of thing. The pardon is there for a purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary Centre talked about the recidivism 
rate of pedophiles.  He is right.  We are right to be concerned 
about that. 
When we talk about pardons, it is important to understand that in 
order to receive a pardon, one must have been clear of any 
reoffence for at least eight years.  If there is a high rate of 
recidivism among pedophiles, one would hope they are not getting 
pardons.  Clearly if that reoffence happens in four or five 
years, they are not going to receive that pardon. That being 
said, we can never be too cautious when it comes to protecting 
the innocent and the vulnerable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the sections of this proposed law we support strongly in 
the New Democratic Party. We think it is important there be 
measures to ensure that the criminal records of pardoned sex 
offenders seeking positions of trust are available for screening 
purposes by placing a flag on the records of the sex offender so 
that police can be alerted and that a sealed pardoned record 
exists and that the police can request that record and request 
from the solicitor general authorization to open it.  It is 
important for those organizations and for the protection of the 
children that those amendments be made to the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, it is important that the individual be 
advised that that is going to happen. They can then disclose to 
the organization themselves that such a record exists, or they 
will know at least that it will be brought forward.  If they have 
nothing to fear, then they have nothing to fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are questions however and some of them were raised by 
other speakers.  In the interests of time I will not go through 
all of them.  There is some question as to discretion and why the 
discretion would be permitted to the police to notify the 
organization or not.  I question why that discretion exists. As a 
member of the justice committee, it is one I look forward to 
debating at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am struck that perhaps that discretion ought to be there in 
case of an error, but I cannot imagine that this type of check 
would result in an error.  One would hope it would not.  Even if 
there were three John Smiths who applied for a position with an 
organization dealing with children and one of those John Smiths 
had been pardoned for a sexual offence, one would hope that there 
would be a way of distinguishing that person from the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and other questions have to be raised in committee.  They 
will be.  I think there is broad based support for this 
legislation among all parties.  I hope and expect at the justice 
committee that the amendments will be brought forward in the same 
way and accepted in the same way.  I have to say that in my 
experience on the justice committee, for the most part that is 
what happens and it results in legislation like we had the other 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can work together on this in an all-party fair manner in 
the interests of our children and those who are vulnerable, it 
may well bring forward in a timely fashion legislation to protect 
our children.  We in the New Democratic Party are committed to 
that and that is the spirit in which we will approach this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed, I would like to take this opportunity to 
commend my colleague from Surrey North for his prompt and 
critical review of this long awaited piece of legislation. 
As stated in an earlier speech, my Reform colleague lends 
credibility to this debate based on a personal tragedy that 
hopefully none of us here will ever endure.  That was the murder

</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1995, more than four years ago, I undertook a 
preliminary review of the youth justice system.  My initial 
findings were circulated among my colleagues in the Reform Party. 
I would like to share with the House some of the content of the 
opening paragraphs of this paper which began with a historical 
overview of our youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Juvenile Delinquents Act enacted in 1908 created a juvenile 
justice system separate from the adult system.  The Juvenile 
Delinquents Act was distinctively child welfare oriented with a 
guiding philosophy behind the act defining “a child having 
committed delinquency not as an offender but as a person in the 
condition of delinquency”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Juvenile Delinquents Act created an informal system of 
justice with little emphasis on legal rights.  A range of justice 
officials, including judges, probation officers and correction 
officials, had very significant discretion in dealing with young 
offenders.  With this treatment rather than punishment 
orientation, sentences were indeterminate to be served until 
rehabilitation was effected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discretionary nature of the Juvenile Delinquents Act and the 
rehabilitation objective caused very substantial interprovincial 
variations in the implementation of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that the exclusively welfare oriented focus of the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act was not appropriate and to reduce 
judicial discretion, the process of reforming the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act began in the 1960s.  It was not however until the 
early 1980s with the introduction of the charter of rights and 
freedoms that major juvenile justice reform became inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Juvenile Delinquents Act was inconsistent with the emphasis 
on due process in the charter.  According to a 1994 Ottawa Law 
Review, the provincial disparities in treatment of juveniles 
permitted under the Juvenile Delinquents Act was considered to be 
contrary to section 15 of the charter that came into effect in 
1985 which guaranteed equality before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act enacted in 1984 gave youth very 
significant legal rights and established a uniform age 
jurisdiction of 12 to 18 years.  The Young Offenders Act also 
provided determinate sentencing and formal alternative measure 
programs to divert less serious cases from youth court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new youth criminal justice act will effectively re-enact 
that contentious portion of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, the 
portion that wrongfully promoted an inequitable application of 
the criminal law.  This new act provides far too much discretion 
to the courts in the sentencing of young offenders.  The only 
real direction provided to the courts is to order the less 
restrictive sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to lines 22 to 25 of the preamble of the youth 
criminal justice act which read “take reasonable steps to 
prevent youth crime by addressing its underlying causes, to 
respond to the needs of young persons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice system cannot address the root causes of crime, 
causes that cannot and should not be used as excuses for 
committing crime.  The justice system must deal and deal 
effectively with an offender after a crime has been committed to 
provide the necessary public protection regardless of the 
offender's background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forces outside the justice system must deal with the causes of 
crime through the design and implementation of crime prevention 
policies and programs, programs such as the headstart program 
sponsored by my hon. colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice system was not designed to deal with dysfunctional 
families, nor was it designed to address the economic hardships 
that often led to family breakdowns and to juvenile crime.  The 
current and past governments' failure to recognize this simple 
fact has diluted the purpose and strength of our justice system, 
particularly in the area of youth crime to the point where young 
criminals are somehow not responsible and therefore not 
accountable for their delinquent behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fact is reflected in many of the lenient sentences that 
have been and will continue to be handed out to young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago this April, the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs tabled a comprehensive report containing 14 
recommendations for amending the Young Offenders Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was a result of six months of extensive consultation 
and travel throughout the country at an expense of almost half a 
million dollars.  Over 300 people representing various sectors of 
the youth justice system and society in general testified before 
the committee.  That testimony was incorporated into the 
committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 22, 1997, on behalf of the Reform Party I published a 
minority report containing 17 recommendations and proposing a 
comprehensive three pronged approach to deal with the 
complexities of youth crime and the contributing factors, 
including early detection and intervention as an effective means 
of crime prevention, community based resolution and sentences in 
cases of minor offences, and strengthening the Young Offenders 
Act through significant amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years after the Reform Party proposed such a plan the 
Liberal government introduced a youth criminal justice act.  We 
are obviously pleased the minister incorporated some of our 
proposals, and of course not all, into the new act.  In 
particular we fully support, as we recommended years ago, the use 
of early detection and intervention and the diversion of 
non-violent and minor offenders to community formed justice 
groups such as the very successful programs in Sparwood and Maple 
Ridge, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support providing police officers with the necessary 
discretion and power to deal with non-violent offenders 
informally.  I recommend however that this discretion not be 
taken away from parents, teachers or any other person in a 
position of authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there is a movement under way spearheaded by a Liberal 
senator to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code which protects 
those in a position of authority if they use reasonable force in 
the correction of a child.  We do not however accept the 
minister's checkerboard approach to justice that appears to be 
the crux of the new youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act, as stated earlier, provides far too much discretion to 
the youth courts.  This will result in an inequitable application 
of youth criminal law across the country, which was a major 
motivation for changing the old juvenile delinquents act in the 
first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also do not accept the minister's outright rejection of what 
I consider to be the two most important recommendations of the 
standing committee.  The minister has refused to accept the 
committee's recommendation to lower the age of criminality to 
encompass 10 and 11 year olds in limited circumstances, and she 
has rejected publishing the names of all violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first and guiding principle of the new youth criminal 
justice act should be the protection of society.  The only way to 
ensure the safety of our children and grandchildren is to provide 
parents with the names of all violent and dangerous offenders, 
which in my opinion include drug traffickers.  This category of 
offender has wrongly been missed in the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to lowering the age of criminality to 10 years, 
Professor Nicholas Bala of Queen's University summarized the work 
of a 1992 Statistics Canada survey of 27 police forces in Canada. 
The data indicated that offending behaviour by children under 12 
was a significant problem.  The study further indicated children 
under the age of 12 committed about 5% of all youth crime. 
Despite this fact, authorities are powerless to hold these 
children legally responsible for their crimes.  Although a number 
of provinces do have a child welfare system that can and does 
deal with these children adequately, many provinces do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeatedly witnesses told the standing committee on justice that 
in the case of violent offences a welfare response is 
inappropriate.  Lowering the age to 10 years does not mean there 
would be a large influx of 10 and 11 year old children being 
drawn into the court system.  The system can divert most children 
of this age away from any formal response, in particular with 
support for alternative measures and community based justice 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By amending the age we will have in those very few cases of 
violent offences the means to provide these young children with 
the rehabilitation they need.  As it stands now the minister has 
abandoned 10 and 11 year olds who by committing criminal acts 
signal they are in need of help.  The minister has abandoned 
these children to the provinces that do not have the 
constitutional authority to legislate against criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to sum up my concerns about the bill by pointing out the 
most unacceptable portion of it.  The minister has attempted to 
create the impression that she has listened to the people and 
mandated in law the changes they have been asking for in the 
Young Offenders Act.  This is not the case. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the minister has done is provide the courts with the 
discretion to do so.  Many courts may not share the same concerns 
as the majority of Canadians and, through the exercise of their 
discretion provided for in the bill, refuse to mandate what the 
people have asked for.  It is the people through their elected 
representatives who should determine the law, not the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years Canadians have asked the government to make specific 
changes to the Young Offenders Act.  These changes include the 
publication of names of all violent offenders, and particularly 
repeat violent offenders.  They wanted the mandatory attendance 
of parents in court with their children.  They wanted the 
lowering of the age of criminality to include 10 and 11 year 
olds, as I mentioned earlier, and the application of adult 
sentences for all serious crime.  In each and every case the 
courts should be mandated to impose the sentences for which the 
people have asked and with which the minister has indicated she 
has complied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new act the courts have not been mandated.  Instead 
the minister has given the courts the discretion to implement 
these changes or ignore them.  This is wrong.  Canadians should 
make the law through their elected representatives.  The courts 
should interpret and impose that law so that the will of the 
people of the country is reflected through the decisions made 
within our courts and by the sentences imposed by our courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill falls far short of this simple democratic principle. It 
leads to the very serious concern in some groups in the country 
that there is a great deal of judicial activism which, if I could 
just touch on it for a moment, I believe is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The blame should not be placed at the feet of our judges but 
rather on our legislators for providing open ended legislation 
which allows the courts to make decisions that are not supported 
by the majority of Canadians.  Over the last number of years and 
certainly since I have been in the House, the people of Canada 
have asked for changes within the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if it has been deliberately done or not, but the 
minister through this bill has created the unfortunate perception 
that the wishes and the cries of Canadians for the last number of 
years have been adhered to and that those demands for changes 
have been implemented in the bill.  They have not been mandated 
at all.  They are there, but we will see the status quo 
maintained because in too many cases the courts will not embrace 
the same concern for some of these offences as reflected by the 
Canadian people.  Therefore the courts have the discretion either 
to implement an adult penalty for some of these offences or 
simply impose the penalty under the Young Offenders Act or this 
new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few if any of the changes the people of Canada have been 
asking for are mandated.  In other words we have not told the 
courts what we want.  We have not instructed the courts about the 
kind of sentence we want for a offence such as murder, serious 
assault, manslaughter and so on.  Even those offences must be 
tried in the youth court system.  Then the crown must apply for 
an adult sentence to be imposed.  The defence can speak against 
it, but it is left to the discretion of the judge as to whether 
or not an adult sentence is imposed.  The bill is deficient in 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inasmuch as it may have fooled the people, it is a very serious 
matter that the government may have brought forward a bill which 
has led people to believe the government has listened to their 
cries for reasonable changes such as the publication of the names 
of all young offenders who commit a violent offence or have a 
series of violent offences on their records. 
That again is left to the discretion of the courts.  It is not 
mandated that the names be publicized.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is on the appearance of parents or legal 
guardians in court with their children.  That is not mandated. 
Again it is left to the discretion of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have in the bill?  We have the perception of change 
where there may be no change at all.  We will have to wait and 
see.  Some of the attorneys general of the provinces have already 
expressed dismay over the principle contained in the bill, that 
is the enormous discretion which will allow judges to make 
varying decisions across the country.  We think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be going back to the checkerboard type of 
legislation we had under the old juvenile delinquents act where 
there was a varying of sentencing and adjudication from province 
to province.  We have gone back to that.  There is not a 
standardized form of sentencing implied within this statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is deficient in that way, which I think is very unfortunate. 
When the bill reaches committee stage and the clause by clause 
amendments come forward, we hope the government will take a 
serious look at the amendments we will be bringing forward to 
close some of the loopholes we think the people will be dismayed 
to see exist within the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
always interested to hear the remarks of my colleague from 
Crowfoot.  Unfortunately, it is the Reform tape playing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tabled statistics no one disputes, which indicate 
that crime among young people has dropped by 23%.  In addition, 
they also reveal, and no one disputes this either, that violent 
crime by young people has also dropped by 3.2% since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that, when the law is properly applied, as it is in 
Quebec, it works well and to the satisfaction of all 
stakeholders in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague from Crowfoot not think that instead of 
changing something that works well, we should implement what 
works well and make whatever changes are necessary after a trial 
period?  At the moment, before changes are proposed, does he not 
think that the Young Offenders Act should be properly applied 
throughout Canada, as it is now in Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Madam Speaker, if my colleague thinks 
the juvenile crime rate is okay in Quebec I disagree with him.  I 
disagree with the crime rate of juvenile offenders in Quebec.  If 
the crime rate is going down that is wonderful, but for years it 
went up year after year after year.  Now it is levelling off and 
coming down a bit, which is wonderful.  If there are methods to 
account for that, let us emphasize those methods.  Let us see 
what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my opening comments, we are very much in favour of 
the three pronged approach that is evident in Quebec to a greater 
extent perhaps than in any other province where provincial 
programs are set up.  When a child is struggling in school with 
aggressiveness or whatever, where it is clearly indicated that 
the child and perhaps the parents need assistance, that is 
provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that all provinces adopt that approach and 
funding be set aside for it.  At the second level we very much 
embrace community committees such as the Sparwood and Maple Ridge 
programs.  I am sure there are programs like those in Quebec 
where on the first or second minor offence children are taken not 
into the court system but into the community system where they 
can receive the assistance they need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the acting out by these children is a sign or a signal to 
society that they need help, surely we should be giving them that 
help.  We also wanted to encompass 10 and 11 year olds because we 
felt the federal government had abandoned them.  In the province 
of Quebec perhaps there is a good program that looks after those 
young people who are signalling by their misbehaviour that they 
do need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say the federal government, because it is the only authority 
that can legislate in the area of criminal law, has abandoned 
these young people who, by committing criminal offences, are 
signalling everyone within seeing or hearing distance that they 
need help.  It has abandoned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we urged the recommendation made by Professor Bala 
and others; that under certain circumstances the justice system 
have authority in this area to ensure that those young people 
receive the type of rehabilitative treatment that obviously their 
actions are signalling they need.  We are very much in support of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the point that perhaps the juvenile crime 
rate is down.  In so many areas, the offences committed by young 
people are not even reported because the police tell us that they 
cannot do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is break and enter into a home, what answer is there 
when the police are called?  They say “Send us a list of the 
items that have been stolen”.  That is as far as it goes.  At 
one time the police used to come to every break and enter with 
their fingerprint section and test for fingerprints.  They do not 
do it anymore because they do not have the budget for it.  The 
federal government has cut back in that particular area of law 
enforcement and crime prevention.  It is unfortunate that it is 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one area in which we would like to see greater 
spending it is in the area of helping our young children.  We 
say, save the ones we can, help the ones we can, but for those 
who create a threat to our lives, we must not shrink from the use 
of incarceration.   However, if we do incarcerate them we must 
make sure they get the help they need while they are there.  I 
hope that answers my colleague's question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, would my 
hon. colleague not think that instead of all the millions wasted 
on the old Bill C-68 from the previous parliament, that those 
millions of dollars could be better spent on this type of bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague has hit the 
nail right on the head on this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-68, the firearms registration bill came in, we were 
promised that it would cost no more than $85 million to 
implement.  Before a single firearm was registered last year, the 
cost was over $200 million, and the government cuts the budget of 
the RCMP.  If we look at it carefully, it is cutting the RCMP 
budget by over $20 million, but in what area?  It is not in the 
provincial area where there are provincial and municipal 
contracts but in the federal area.  What is it cutting down on? 
It is cutting down on drug enforcement, organized crime and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at drug enforcement, the main revenue source 
for organized crime which is responsible for bringing drugs into 
our schoolyards that affect our children and contribute to this 
terrible situation we see in many of our larger cities. The 
government is reducing that budget by an enormous amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister stands up and says the government has cut some 
$20 million out of a $1.2 billion budget, that is not accurate. 
It is not cutting anything out of the provincial budgets.  It is 
cutting out of the federal programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $22 million is coming out of the federal programs where we 
have the special units covering white collar crime, organized 
crime, drug trafficking and so on.  Yes, it is a matter of 
priorities, but the government is spending money on a useless 
firearms registration system that will not enhance the safety of 
our streets and homes.  It could be spending that money on a host 
of other things, including making sure that we have enough 
uniformed policemen on the streets to help reduce crime. 
Let us get them into the schools talking with the children, like 
the DARE drug program that many of the police forces are running 
in western Canada.  We should be focusing our money on those 
areas, not on a useless firearms registration system that has not 
proven to do anything to reduce crime or enhance safety on our 
streets or in our homes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is a real story 
here.  As a member of a police force, my colleagues and I used to 
keep more young people out of court than we ever took in because 
we had the discretion to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time, in the history of the federal police force 
that I belonged to, where in order to get the budget it needed to

one type of proof for needing more money or more men and that was 
through statistics.  Instead of—

pleased to take part in this debate, in support of the amendment 
by my colleague, the hon. member for Laval Centre, which clearly 
and unambiguously calls for withdrawal of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were asked to give an award for the most despicable, the 
most backward, the most ill-founded bill as far as youth 
rehabilitation is concerned, we would not hesitate for one 
second before giving the nod to this bill on young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like those who are listening in, or have just joined us, 
to have some idea of what is being proposed to us.  There is 
nothing run-of-the-mill about it. 
This bill refers to 14-year olds.  That is those in early 
adolescence, not those who are 18, 19 or 20, i.e. young adults. 
To all intents and purposes, these are not even adolescents yet. 
These young people aged 14 could be given sentences comparable 
to those for adults.  In order to avoid any ambiguity, I will 
read the actual words, for I am very much aware that words are 
important in matters of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are being asked to vote on, and I would ask the 
Liberals to pay a bit of attention.  The clause in question 
states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—being the group of offenders liable to be sentenced to what 
would be imposed upon an adult, in order to encompass the 14 and 
15 year-old group. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes no sense whatsoever.  How can the Government of 
Quebec, Quebeckers and all the youth support network, which makes 
Quebec society something very unique, accept such a bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I have just come from a Privy Council briefing 
session in which I heard reference made to the House leader.  He 
is, I know, a man who can be called upon for certain matters, 
for certain circumstances, but there are some matters with a 
human dimension which require, I believe, an appeal to his 
common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him to tell us in all honesty if he thinks that a 14-year 
old who is just starting out in life, who has no experience and 
is at the mercy of his environment, can be considered a hardened 
criminal the way an adult can?  Naturally, it is possible that 
there are circumstances where young people get off to a bad 
start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our work as MPs, we all see instances of this.  That is why 
we must turn to family support, social institutions, and 
measures for socializing and moulding a young person that will 
completely redirect these values, that will attempt to give 
meaning to his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader surely knows that the commission of a crime by 
a 14-year old is a cry for help. It is a sign of distress, a sign 
of inner turmoil.  It does not make the offence committed any 
less serious, but we cannot agree with the logic that 
imprisonment and an intense process of criminalization will 
resolve the problem.  I just do not see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that this bill is politically driven.  They know 
that the Minister of Justice wants to align herself as closely 
as possible with the Reform Party.  It is a question of votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Justice introduces a bill such as this, she 
does so not as the Minister of Justice but as an Albertan.  That 
is what has to be understood.  She introduces it as a servant of 
the federal government, which wants to hold on to its seats in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill comes straight from the Reform Party mould. I wonder 
whether the union of the Liberal Party and the Reform Party is 
not germinating in a bill like this one.  That is what we are 
talking about.

criminalize 14-year olds.  Can the House leader tell us whether 
in the red book—and I leave the description to him, but it went 
round in certain circles—there was ever talk in 1993-94 of 
criminalizing 14-year olds?  There was not.  Now, the Liberals 
are realizing that the time for elections is approaching and 
consideration must be given to an electoral base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too sad to be funny.  No one here finds it funny, because 
the fate and the future of the young are at stake. 
I would ask the House leader to exert his influence on cabinet 
to ensure that corrective action is taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find the hardest to understand is the levels of crime. 
When the discussion concerns the organized crime that is gnawing 
away at communities, cities such as Montreal, we are entitled to 
expect remedy.  How is it we are discussing a law on young 
offenders aged 14, but for three years we have been calling for 
legislation on money laundering, which we have yet to see? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem setting priorities.  This government must 
understand that there are nuances to the subject of crime. 
Things are happening as if the word nuance was prohibited in 
ministers' speeches.  And yet, I think a distinction must be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, I am often asked by my 
constituents about this issue, by people who are concerned about 
street gangs, about young people aged 13, 14 or 15 who may go 
astray and commit reprehensible acts in our society. This does 
not make them criminals in the same way as adults. This is what 
I just cannot understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly believe that we would make a terrible mistake, as 
parliamentarians, if we were to get caught up in that. If we set 
the age at 14 today, who is to say that, next year, 
representations will not be made to set the age at 13, or even 
12? Where would it stop?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ)</B> moved that: 
<A NAME="LINK183">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should have a 
standing committee of the House of Commons hold public hearings 
on every proposed procurement of goods or services by the 
Canadian Armed Forces valued at more than $100 million, in order 
to ensure that the procurement process is transparent and fair 
to all concerned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I will begin with the following 
question: Why did I move such a motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On numerous occasions, examples of insufficient spending on the 
part of National Defence have been raised in the daily 
newspapers and in the House, and there have also been examples 
of heavier spending, in fact, very substantial spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at these examples, one could not help but conclude that 
what applies to minor spending ought to apply equally to major 
spending, which is the reason for this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, National Defence's goods and services procurement 
procedures have experienced numerous failures.  I want to go 
into a few examples of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the purchase of the utility tactical transport 
helicopters known as the Griffons. Cabinet approved this on 
April 7, 1992, and Treasury Board assented on September 8, 1992. 
The very next day, a $754.5 million contract for the purchase of 
some 100 Griffon helicopters, a flight simulator, and other 
equipment, plus related documentation and services, was awarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first aircraft was delivered in March 1995, and the last in 
January 1998.  The estimated total cost of the project was $1.2 
billion, according to the auditor general's April 1998 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can therefore be seen that the project went $445 million over 
budget, more than 59% over budget.  It has cost $1.2 billion 
rather than $754.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Griffon replaced three other models of helicopter, which 
were retired: the CH-118 Iroquois, the CH-135 Twin Huey and the 
CH-136 Kiowa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general made many criticisms with respect to the 
selection of this helicopter. I refer to the April 1998 auditor 
general report, which states that “it appears there was a review 
of how a single aircraft could replace two types but 
departmental officials could not produce a copy of it”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other documents as well were lost only God knows how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study done in August 1992, after the department had decided on 
the Griffon, showed that its load capacity was less than that 
required to transport a gun or engineer equipment. Its load 
capacity for evacuating wounded and for logistical support was 
also lower than required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its response, the department stated that the lack of capacity 
could be made up by the support provided by allied aircraft. In 
other words, the equipment we are unable to load in our 
helicopters could be loaded with the help of our good 
neighbours. That is the good neighbour strategy. So much for 
Canada's sovereignty in the area of national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department concluded that to buy only one type of utility 
tactical transport helicopters would cost less than to modernize 
and maintain a fleet made up of several types of aircraft. 
However, the auditor general demonstrated that the operating 
cost of the new helicopter would be 20% to 40% higher than that 
of the aircraft to be replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department bought the aircraft from the only supplier it 
consulted. Only one supplier was consulted. 
This is a commercial aircraft and not a military one. Other 
types of helicopter were turned down. Life cycle costs for other 
aircraft, which might have been lower, were not considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This aircraft has a limited reconnaissance capability, and the 
auditor general concluded that the tactical studies did not 
adequately justify replacing two divergent aircraft types with 
one, and that they were concluded too late in the process to 
affect decision making. In addition, the studies called into 
question the suitability of the aircraft that was selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The acquisition of search and rescue helicopters is another 
example. They are the Cormorant helicopters, the ones in the 
notorious helicopter contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23, 1998, the Minister of National Defence announced 
the purchase of 15 Cormorant search and rescue helicopters from 
a British-Italian consortium, E.H. Industries. The total value of 
this contract was $777 million, with $580 million for the 
aircraft and $197 million for project management, training, 
parts, integrated logistic support, and a small contingency 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delivery to the Canadian forces should commence in the summer of 
2000 and be concluded by the spring of 2002. The financial 
resources for this program are provided for in the February 1997 
federal budget, and they are within the existing financial 
framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four helicopter manufacturers were competing for this contract. 
There was E.H. Industries, which manufactures model AW-520 or the 
Cormorant; Boeing, an American manufacturer offering the 
Chinook; Eurocopter, which manufactures the Cougar; and 
Sikorsky, an American company manufacturing the Maplehawk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially the cost of acquiring helicopters was some $593 
million. This was reduced to $580 million, because a saving was 
made by having the helicopters picked up at the manufacturer in 
Italy, rather than having them delivered to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>E.H. Industries expected providing the Canadian forces with 
helicopters would mean jobs totalling 5,000 person years for 
Canadians over the life of the eight year contract. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>E.H. Industries also undertook to provide major industrial and 
regional benefits before the conclusion of the contract.  So, it 
made a commitment to spend a total of $629 million on industrial 
and regional benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, of the $593 in industrial and regional benefits 
already distributed—that is what we were told in May 1998—$318 
million will go to Quebec companies.  The E.H. Industries 
consortium in Canada includes Bombardier, located in Montreal, 
Canadian Helicopter Corporation, in St. John's, Newfoundland, 
and Bristol Aerospace in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples of major purchases. 
I mention here the purchase of 35 helicopters intended this time 
for maritime patrol.  The purchase of these new helicopters has 
become necessary because it is time to get rid of the thirty or 
so Sea King helicopters from the 1960s.  Every hour of flying 
time requires an average of 21 hours of maintenance, according 
to the army.  In addition, the army also says that they have to 
be stripped down almost entirely after every 500 hours' flying 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sea Kings are based on warships.  They fight submarines, 
acting as the eyes and ears of the frigates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Eggleton, like his predecessor, asked his staff for a 
study on the possibility of renting helicopters instead of 
buying them. 
The acquisition cost of 35 helicopters is estimated at $2 to $3 
billion. As for the search and rescue helicopter contract, 
Eurocopter is in contention for this new contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, this company lost out in the bidding process for 15 
maritime search and rescue helicopters. Bitter, it even threatened 
to sue the government and its competitors. It would have been 
useful to have a committee of the House compare the bids at the 
time so that parliamentarians could see them and make absolutely 
sure that we made the right choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that, originally, the Department of National 
Defence had called for 50 aircraft, that is 15 search and rescue 
helicopters and 35 maritime patrol helicopters. However, in 1993, 
the Liberals cancelled the EH-101 contract, saying that the 
contract, which was awarded by the Conservatives, was too 
expensive. We demanded a lot of explanation at the time but never 
got the information we wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cancellation of this contract cost taxpayers a whopping 
$478.3 million, or almost half a billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with regard to the search and rescue capability, the 
Liberal government would have us believe that it saved money, 
even taking into account the cost of cancelling the EH-101 
contract. Let us wait and see how much this contract for 35 new 
aircraft will cost taxpayers. Again, in this case, we think that 
the opportunity to discuss this issue before a standing 
committee of the House would help shed some light on the real 
terms of the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now deal with the auditor general's report on DND, dated 
April 1998 . It shows that DND bought military equipment that 
does not meet the needs of our troops. In other words, the 
department is badly mismanaging its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of six major capital equipment projects worth a total of 
$3.3 billion, half the projects scrutinized by the auditor 
general do not meet the pre-established needs of the military. 
Therefore, 60% of the $3.3 billion worth of capital equipment 
purchased does not even meet the real needs of the army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the Leopard thermal weapon sight. On 
September 19, 1996, Treasury Board officially approved a project 
to install a thermal weapon sight on Leopard tanks. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745
<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total estimated cost of the project is $145 million. The 
results of tactical analyses on how to upgrade the Leopard do 
not justify the decision to improve only the night vision 
system. Indeed, the army established that the upgrading of the 
whole vehicle, including the gun and the armour, was the minimum 
that would have been acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to DND, a detailed analysis of existing options was 
not carried out for financial reasons. DND decided that 
purchasing the thermal weapon sight was the only affordable 
option. However the auditor general found no study showing this 
option optimized the financial resources of the army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of a 1992 study by the Canadian forces, contracting out 
was considered. However, they came to the conclusion that no 
Canadian firm could supply this service and it was therefore 
preferable to buy the equipment. However the department did not 
bother calculating the cost of contracting out this service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the project to replace the Lynx, the Coyote 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the government announced it was purchasing 299 light 
armoured reconnaissance vehicles and related support equipment. 
A contract was signed in March 1993. The total cost approved by 
Treasury Board was $883,686,000 for the budget year. The 
vehicles were delivered in March 1996 and January 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coyote provides the army with a reconnaissance capability. 
The tactical concept adopted for the Coyote armoured 
reconnaissance vehicle was based on various studies, including 
the simulation study used for the Leopard C1. This study showed 
that, without the support of a powerful force, a vehicle with 
armour like the Coyote's could not withstand enemy fire during a 
battle of average intensity. There again, the vehicle acquired 
was not suited to the needs of the army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also showed that this type of vehicle could certainly 
not be used by a multipurpose force. Units using this kind of 
vehicle should be considered light units with limited means and 
should perform only limited tasks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the audit by the auditor general, Canadian forces 
were still conducting trials to determine how the Coyotes could 
best be used. 
The assistant deputy minister, materiel, and the vice chief of 
defence staff ordered that Coyotes be bought on the basis of 
prime necessity. However, no other vehicles had been tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are enough examples to justify the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will deal with the conclusions reached by the auditor 
general in April 98. He concluded that the Department of Defence 
relied on simplistic judgments for complex purchases, that it 
relied very little on equipment use plans in its studies and 
that the choice of materiel it ends up buying is not based on 
the results of the studies carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This probably explains why, for 12 maritime coastal defence 
vessels, the department bought two units of a mechanical 
minesweeping device that is only effective against specific 
types of mines. This probably also explains why it did not buy 
all the necessary equipment that would allow its ships to 
conduct effective night patrols in poor visibility. In other 
words, we are well protected, but only during the daytime and 
when the weather is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For taxpayers in Quebec and Canada, this waste of public money 
is unacceptable. It is also a major cause for concern, since DND 
plans to spend close to $6.5 billion over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government is mismanaging our tax 
dollars, and taxpayers in Quebec and Canada would be well 
advised to see to this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT47"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT47"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must change the defence department's way of doing things. On 
February 11, 1999, the auditor general appeared before the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs to 
provide an update on that department's procurement policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that occasion, the auditor general levelled criticism at the 
defence department's way of doing things. The department now has 
a plan of action to reform its procurement process, but that 
plan is incomplete and it does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the purpose of the pilot project component is to 
test certain procurement concepts. However, several of these 
projects will not be completed before September 2000. Moreover, 
the pilot projects selected are relatively unimportant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, in Great Britain, the smart procurement initiative 
was much for audacious. It led to a broad reform of the 
procurement proposals process, which could lead to a closer 
partnership between government and the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what is done here, the British have literally opted 
for their major procurement items, namely their aircraft 
carriers, attack submarines and Apache helicopters. Canada could 
follow the lead of the British in that regard. Meanwhile, the 
House could make a first step by voting in favour of this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish to say that taxpayers in Quebec and Canada 
can expect, in the months and years to come, to pay colossal 
amounts of money for these projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, they have a right to expect that their money is being 
spent wisely on good quality products. 
For that to happen, we believe that we should avoid past 
mistakes and change the way the department does things, first by 
adopting a rule whereby any procurement project valued at more 
than $100 million will be examined during public hearings by a 
standing committee of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose is to make the process more transparent and fairer 
for taxpayers in Quebec and Canada, so that they can get more of 
their money's worth. Finally, we do not believe that our motion 
is an end in itself. However, we do think that it is a step in 
the right direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Minister of Public Works and Government Services I 
would like to respond to the question raised by the hon. member 
for Joliette concerning the transparency and fairness of the 
procurement process, most specifically where the Department of 
National Defence is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore pleased to provide the House with a general 
overview of the procurement policies, processes and practices of 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services, as well 
as a brief historical background of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lengthy debate on every proposed procurement of goods and 
services by the Canadian Armed Forces over $100 million is not 
needed.  Nor is it very efficient.  The procurement policies 
presently in place demonstrate precisely what the hon. member is 
seeking: the assurance of an open and fair process to all 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Public Works and Government Services is 
mandated to ensure that the procurement process is one of 
integrity and one which is conducted in an open and transparent 
manner.  Wherever possible competition is the preferred approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure businesses have equal access to contract opportunities 
the government has put in place an electronic tendering system 
called MERX.  Accessible through the Internet all potential 
suppliers are informed about procurement opportunities at the 
same time.  MERX reduces access costs, increases competition and 
provides businesses with a single point of access to information 
on contracting opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system is also currently being used by seven provinces and 
a growing number of public institutions such as municipalities, 
academic institutions, school boards and hospitals.  It is an 
excellent example of the kind of co-operation we can work on with 
all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in 1997 the Government of Canada launched Contracts 
Canada.  Through this initiative hundreds of seminars were 
conducted annually and are conducted annually today with 
businesses across the country on how to do business with the 
crown.  Furthermore, virtually all contracts processed by the 
department are published on the Internet, again ensuring openness 
and equal access at the same time.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to promote the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services benefits 
driven procurement initiative.  In the past the traditional 
approach to procurement in a complex project was for an 
organization to spend months, possibly years, developing a 
detailed requirement to present to industry.  Firms were invited 
to present bids based on a sometimes massive document and the 
lowest bid usually won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach had many pitfalls.  That is why a new approach has 
been introduced to deal with the complexities and risks of major 
procurement projects.  Basically the benefits driven procurement 
asks the industry to deliver certain agreed upon results rather 
than follow a blueprint assigned by the government.  The industry 
is also invited to submit ideas on what sort of project should be 
undertaken before a formal request is issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What distinguishes this approach is thorough and rigorous front 
end planning to remove or mitigate potential problems in a 
procurement process.  Both the front end planning and the 
management of the entire acquisition life cycle are based on four 
basic elements:  a solid business case, risk analysis, clear 
delineation of accountabilities, and a compensation structure 
closely tied to the contractor's performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits driven procurement will help support the Canadian 
industry, boost confidence in the public sector and confirm the 
public works department as a world leader in government 
procurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal purchasing services are provided to more than 100 
federal departments and agencies by the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services, the Department of National Defence 
being its biggest client.  Its mandate is to ensure the integrity 
of the procurement process.  It is committed to open, fair, 
transparent and competitive procurement policies and processes. 
This is fundamental to our ability to deliver excellent service 
to our clients through the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the department is determined to harness innovative 
ideas and make the federal procurement process even more 
efficient as we move into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Public Works and Government Services is the 
nation's largest purchasing agent, providing an astounding range 
of services to support the daily operations of government to meet 
the needs of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year this department buys more than $8 billion in goods 
and services covering 17,000 categories of service and creates 
more than 60,000 contract opportunities for businesses in Canada. 
These opportunities stimulate Canada's economy and create or 
maintain jobs in every sector, particularly for small and medium 
size businesses which are the engines of economic growth for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I previously mentioned, the Department of National Defence is 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services biggest 
client, accounting for approximately half the department's 
business every year.  It includes much more than weapons, ships, 
aircraft and military vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public works and government services department has a long 
history with the Department of National Defence going back to 
September 1939.  On the eve of the second world war Prime 
Minister Mackenzie King asked for the preparation of an act to 
create a department of supply.  On the prime minister's behalf C. 
D. Howe, the then minister of transport, defended the move in the 
House of Commons by declaring that “the best guarantee that 
profits on war material will be kept to a minimum is to place men 
of skill, experience and absolute integrity” in charge of 
purchasing and production.  This led to the war supply board 
which became the department of munitions and supply and then the 
department of defence production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost 60 years the Department of National Defence has 
identified its needs and the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services has been responsible and accountable for 
developing and implementing procurement strategies to fulfil 
those needs.  Canada is one of the few countries in the world 
where this separation exists.  It is crucial to ensure the 
process remains fair.  In the end we want Canadians to receive 
the best value possible for the money spent on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me reiterate the government's commitment to a 
fair, open, transparent and competitive procurement process, a 
process which ensures equal access for all businesses and is 
managed in a way that will pass the test of public scrutiny.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today to discuss the motion of the hon. 
member from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-73 calls on the House to hold public hearings on every 
proposed procurement of goods and services by the Canadian forces 
valued at more than $100 million.  With respect, I would like to 
suggest that this would be a bad idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many observers of the defence department procurement process 
have pointed out that the level of bureaucratic and political 
interference at that process is already bad enough.  In fact the 
auditor general's report makes mention of that.  I will quote 
from that document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's approach to major weapons systems 
acquisition is too complicated, marked by the involvement of 
several departments, an adversarial approach to industry and 
complicated paperwork and specifications.  Overall (industry 
experts) believe the current federal approach adds overhead costs 
and slows project completion, adding again to the total cost. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the hon. member from the Bloc is suggesting that 
they would add another layer of political involvement and the 
bureaucracy that would come with it and the process would be even 
more extended.  In my view, the defence procurement process could 
use a lot less political involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last speaker from the Bloc sat in the defence committee 
hearing yesterday when Dr. Bland made a presentation on 
procurement.  The question came up regarding the cancellation of 
the EH-101s and the present purchase of the shipboard helicopters 
and the process that it now entails. The question basically was 
what is wrong?  What happened? Where is the problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Bland put it in this way.  He said that the problems lie 
with the military, bureaucratic and political interface.  That is 
where it lies.  Tell me what that means, military, bureaucratic 
and political interface on this procurement process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EH-101 helicopter is a prime example of political 
interference, I might add. In other words, it is political 
interference.  In the hard face of all these contracts that have 
been either cancelled or altered, it is direct political 
interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think adding another layer of political involvement 
would work. I can see all kinds of arguments arising out of 
having public hearings on this matter.  All of a sudden there 
would be a myriad of politicians wanting to jump into the fray 
making sure that a chunk of that contract was going to end up in 
their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen to the process?  It would be extended.  It 
would be more involved, and I would have to suggest it would be 
much more costly to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the defence department needs is to be able to purchase the 
equipment it needs to do its job.  It needs politicians to leave 
it alone and not tell it what to buy. There is always the issue 
that there is a political element to every purchase, but that is 
where experts come in to advise the politicians.  The politicians 
should not be telling the specific department what to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that other contracts have been let.  There has always 
been the question of sole sourcing.  That is one point that has 
always come up, where there is no bid process.  It would be nice 
to have the assurance that there would be a greater number of 
open bid contracts and not the sole sourcing we have seen in many 
cases here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always the question of political interference.  It may 
not be directly by anybody in the cabinet, but it could be 
someone else.  They could have a certain industry in their riding 
and may want to have a chunk of all that. 
I can see that coming into the mix here if we have these public 
hearings and politicians demand that they be involved, that 
industries in their ridings be involved. It may often be the case 
that it may not be the best industry to be involved in that bid 
process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the frigates were built, the contract was let to one 
shipbuilder.  The one shipbuilder decided on who the 
subcontractors were going to be.  He was guaranteed that in the 
contract, which was a good provision within the contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It prevented what some members tried to do.  They tried to have 
that contract changed by saying they had a subcontractor in their 
riding that would be suitable for that contract.  The contractor 
was able to say “No, you will not be permitted to become part of 
this bidding process.  I have the final say”.  It is my 
understanding it saved millions and millions of dollars because 
the subcontractors were selected by the contractor and everything 
went ahead smoothly without the interference of the politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons alone, I must declare my opposition to the 
hon. member's motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this motion.  We see it as an initiative to begin 
the huge job of cleaning up the mess in this government's defence 
ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general pointed out in his report last year that 
national defence plans to spend $6.5 billion over the next five 
years to purchase equipment for the Canadian forces.  The auditor 
general was scathing in his report.  All Canadians deserve an 
open and fair defence procurement procedure.  They are not 
receiving the quality they deserve from their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's auditor general had these words to say about this 
Liberal government's defence procurement practices: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned at the extent to which the Department relies on 
professional judgment in making complex purchase decisions. 
Management did not conduct adequate analyses to justify its 
spending decisions for most of the projects we examined. Tactical 
studies often did not reflect the way officials said they 
actually planned to employ equipment, were done too late to 
influence decisions, produced results that contradicted the 
purchase decision, were undertaken by contractors who had an 
interest in the Department's decision, or were not done at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In three cases, the Department considered only a single option. 
In other cases, the options analyses were inadequate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply not good enough.  Furthermore this is not news to 
this government.  The auditor general has been sounding the alarm 
bells on the government's procurement policies for years.  The 
auditor general reminded the government of the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, we reported that DND had recognized the need to simplify 
and streamline its major capital acquisition process, which had 
become unnecessarily complex, process-driven, costly and no 
longer appropriate for the management of the defence capital 
program.  Our 1994 chapters on Information Technology and 
Infrastructure Management pointed to continuing problems with the 
Department's project and program management systems, despite 
attempts to improve them.  Our 1994 follow-up chapter also noted 
that while the Department has generally concurred with our 
recommendations, it has been slow to implement improvements. We 
also expressed our concern that the actions it has taken may be 
inadequate to address the problems with the project and program 
management systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the problems associated with the purchase of major 
capital equipment that we found in our 1984, 1987 and 1992 audits 
continue to affect today's defence capital acquisition projects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just how bad is this situation?  Following is a partial list of 
the disastrous mishandling of the Canadian taxpayers' money by 
this Liberal government's defence spenders courtesy of the 
auditor general: excessively complex and labour intensive 
acquisition process; inadequately trained project managers; 
insufficient resources and underestimation of supportability 
costs; an ineffective and untimely staffing of project management 
offices; gaps and overlaps in project management 
responsibilities; poor procurement practices; poor application of 
program and project risk evaluation and risk management 
principles; lack of an integrated information system; and 
inadequate project management information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing and pay conditions for our forces personnel still demand 
attention.  Recent announcements to improve pay, particularly for 
the lowest paid defence personnel, helps but it is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were not guilty of wasting the taxpayers' 
money, I wonder how much we would be able to improve housing for 
our forces personnel.  I wonder if we would be facing the safety 
crisis posed by our obsolete Labrador and Sea King helicopters. 
All Canadians deserve to have these very serious issues resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us proposes to hold public hearings on every 
expenditure over $100 million.  The sentiment lying behind the 
motion is good.  It raises a very important question.  At the 
crux of this issue is the extent to which the Liberal government 
is wasting untold millions of dollars.  I can say that the people 
of my riding of Halifax West and throughout the province of Nova 
Scotia do not want the government to continue to waste their 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know, and I am quite sure that Canadians would want to 
know, what military hardware is currently mothballed in 
warehouses and elsewhere throughout the land.  There must be big 
ticket items that are neither currently being used nor intended 
for use.  Let us see an inventory of unused hardware that might 
be sold to other allied countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the government may be reluctant to provide 
this information so as not to be embarrassed by the amount or 
value of equipment purchased that was never used or used only for 
a short period of time before becoming obsolete or incompatible 
with other equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the standing committee we are currently reviewing the 
procurement process.  It is true that one of the things that 
comes to mind is the complexity of this process and the length of 
time involved from deciding that a piece of equipment is required 
to the time that equipment is acquired.  Perhaps part of the 
problem could be resolved if there was more public transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public should be aware of what is happening, the amounts of 
money that are being spent and how they are being spent.  The 
previous speaker argued that public involvement might further 
complicate the problem.  However, I would think that perhaps the 
threat and the involvement of public scrutiny would be a very 
positive thing.  As things become more transparent it places more 
responsibility upon us to make sure that things are done 
properly, adequately and more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance we could argue very strongly that with such 
huge amounts of money being expended, public scrutiny and 
transparency is a very important factor and would assist in the 
process.  Anything that can assist in this procurement process to 
bring fairness and justice to the system and to bring good value 
for the money being spent is something that we would support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party I am pleased to indicate 
our support for this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
today to support this motion by the member for Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should have a 
Standing Committee of the House of Commons hold public hearings 
on every proposed procurement of goods or services by the 
Canadian Armed Forces valued at more than $100 million, in order 
to ensure that the procurement process is transparent and fair 
to all concerns. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, there are good reasons to support this motion.  I 
think that the Liberal government has given Canadians great cause 
to question its procurement programs.  I tend to partially agree 
and partially disagree with the member for Calgary Northeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has said that there is too much bureaucracy 
within our procurement process.  Perhaps we should be taking out 
some of those levels of bureaucracy and putting in public 
scrutiny at that point.  Public scrutiny should probably be at 
the level of the statement of requirement so that we could get 
this moving a little faster.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the maritime helicopter project, the SOR on that 
has already been nine years and we still have not seen anything. 
If we had the defence committee involved in it we would have seen 
something by now.  From that point on it can go through the 
regular process but again taking out some of the levels and maybe 
speeding things up a little.  There is no question that things 
have been dragging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, this is the Liberal government that came to power by 
cancelling the EH-101 program at a cost of about $1 billion.  It 
says it was only $500 million.  If we look at what it will cost 
by the time we get the new Sea Kings and the search and rescue on 
line, it will probably be well over a $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program was critical to the Canadian search and rescue 
forces and maritime helicopter capability.  It was cancelled for 
strictly crass political purposes.  Our search and rescue 
capability today is hanging by a thread.  A couple of weeks ago 
an American helicopter piloted by a Canadian completed a rescue 
mission off the coast of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a report sitting in the minister's office that 
reportedly says the Labrador helicopters are prone to 
catastrophic failures and they present a high risk to crews.  The 
Liberals have since turned around and bought the EH-101 
helicopter for search and rescue, but after spending almost $1 
billion to cancel a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting point is that we will not see the first new 
helicopter until the year 2001.  As for the Sea King it is still 
waiting for a replacement.  We do not even have the SOR on it 
yet.  Once we get that it will still take five to eight years 
down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to Greenwood to see the work they are doing to 
rebuild these helicopters.  If we add in the rebuilding they are 
doing, we are talking about 70 hours for every one hour of 
flight.  No wonder the auditor general is nervous about the whole 
situation and is saying that the government is not handling 
things properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is costing us millions of dollars to keep these aging 
helicopters air worthy, and that with a minimal return.  The Sea 
King is available less than 40% of the time and its mission 
system fails half the time when it is available.  There is 
question about the legitimacy of the Canada search helicopter 
program from industry and the Sea King replacement contract is 
coming up. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Joliette has already spoken to us about the 
infamous Griffon helicopters.  I will therefore leave them aside 
for now. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was a Bombardier contract for NATO flight training in 
western Canada, an untendered contract awarded by the Liberal 
government to the tune of $2.85 billion.  Many questions have 
been asked about this Liberal decision.  Perhaps, if the process 
were more transparent, parliamentarians would have been less 
suspicious of Liberal motives in the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions that parliamentarians should be able to ask 
and should be able to get substantive answers to, but not at the 
moment.  In my opinion the Liberal government, through its 
sleight of hand approach to procurement, has forced 
parliamentarians to put forward these types of motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the very functions of the committee process is to enable 
parliamentarians to question government on the estimates.  The 
government has not been forthcoming in this regard and has 
demonstrated its disrespect for the parliamentary process.  It is 
not just a problem of the Department of National Defence but of 
all departments of the government.  Thus parliamentarians are 
forced to take action such as this motion to create another 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SCONDVA is studying the issue of procurement.  This committee 
should have the same oversight role with regard to defence 
procurement.  SCONDVA demonstrated its competence and its 
credibility with the recent quality of life study.  It is a good, 
strong committee with members deeply interested in the defence of 
the country and has garnered considerable expertise on defence 
issues in the last several years.  Thus it is only right that the 
expertise of SCONDVA is given an oversight role on defence 
procurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we remember, the Somalia inquiry called for a vigilant 
parliament.  Vigilance must be demonstrated in the field of 
defence procurement as well.  Another committee as recommended in 
the motion would be necessary to allow SCONDVA to deal with the 
massive issues before it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My only concern is that while remaining vigilant we do not 
unnecessarily tie the hands of government in times of crisis. For 
instance, the United States is now running low on cruise missiles 
at a time when it is at war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might not be in the nation's national security interest to 
put procurement issues through a committee during a serious 
crisis.  I think many would agree that this is a delicate time 
and a delicate issue.  Thus I support the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the motion by the member for Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seconded this motion because I think it makes a lot of sense. 
One could even ask why what it proposes is not already in 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes that a standing committee hold public 
hearings on every proposed procurement valued at more than $100 
million.  This would probably come under the Standing Committee 
on National Defence and Veterans Affairs.  There would therefore 
be witnesses, people who would ask questions in order to examine 
all aspects of such procurement. One hundred million dollars is 
a lot of money.  The government would do well to be transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of national defence, we can see in the Kosovo crisis 
that one of the problems of this government is a lack of 
transparency in its actions, the paucity of information it 
provides. Ultimately, we should perhaps not expect to be given 
strategic information in wartime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to replace the member for Joliette on the committee.  He 
almost never misses committee meetings.  He is extremely 
available and devoted to his work.  Approximately one month ago, 
however, he asked me to replace him on the defence committee. 
At the time, the committee was examining government contracts 
and defence procurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National Defence representatives, officials and military 
personnel appeared as witnesses. 
I was surprised at the difficulty, not to say the impossibility, 
of obtaining information, about the breakdown by province of 
military equipment procurement, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were given a few examples.  If memory serves, there were 
about 50 budgets and, at the most, three breakdowns.  It is 
interesting for members, who represent their riding, of course, 
but also their region and their province, to know how the money 
is distributed.  I was able to question witnesses on regional 
impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the member for Joliette ask me to replace him?  Quite 
simply because I am the Bloc Quebecois critic for regional 
development.  I therefore wanted to see the defence budgets, the 
impact they could have on a region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information seems to be a state secret.  Yet I was not 
questioning them with a view to finding out what the equipment 
looked like or what it was made of, or to obtain military 
secrets.  If that had been the case, I could understand.  There 
is no question of telling all, of making everything public, when 
dealing with defence matters.  It is important, however, to know 
how the money is distributed, what companies and how many jobs 
are involved.  Questions have to be asked about how defence 
budgets are allocated and decided upon.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also asked how these things were assessed and by whom. 
Departmental officials said that they had committees, that 
studies were commissioned and that the findings were submitted 
to cabinet. An interesting discovery we make while reading the 
auditor general's report is that taxpayers from Canada and 
Quebec can expect to spend large sums of money on projects over 
the next few months. That means there is a lot of money to be 
spent each year and, over the next few years, more equipment 
will have to be replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also says that cabinet did not always rely on the 
findings from studies commissioned by the Department of National 
Defence. 
The findings from studies, whether in-house or conducted by firms 
outside DND, should be used. The auditor general noted, however, 
that decisions made by cabinet were seldom based on these 
studies, which is absolutely deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the choice of criteria, officials told me that studies 
were taken into account, but that decisions were primarily based 
on the political judgement of cabinet members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When small amounts are involved, I can understand that it may 
not always be necessary to call for public tenders. But for 
contracts of $100 million or more, as the member for Joliette 
said, it seems to me that tendering should be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I think the member for Joliette is a little bit too 
reasonable. 
If I have one criticism to voice regarding his motion, it is 
that the amount could have been smaller. However he made the 
following comment in his speech “This is for lack of anything 
better, since currently there is no obligation to go to tender 
for procurement projects valued at even more than that”. He 
suggests that at least we start at this level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I would go further, but he is wise. He is trying to 
get the support of all parties and possibly government members. 
Even though it is a private member's motion, government members 
could support it. It seems to me it would be in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a parliamentary committee to review budgets, 
legislation and regulations on this. This is what our 
constituents want us to do. 
We are talking about $100 million in military equipment 
procurement and the government it telling us “No, these 
decisions are up to cabinet”. The auditor general, public 
servants and independent observers are saying that the trouble 
these days in Canada is that everything is decided by the 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will not go as far as my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean 
and leave with my seat on this account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night, the governing party went against the wishes of all 
the opposition parties and refused to hold a vote in the House 
on the deployment of ground troops in Kosovo. Decisions like 
these reflect the centralizing approach of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 is near. 
In my riding, people do not think much of politicians as a whole 
because they feel that in this parliament, as in others, 
democracy means “You can say all you want, decisions are made 
elsewhere”. 
In this instance, decisions are made strictly at cabinet level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And who controls the cabinet? The Prime Minister. This is how 
things are done in the Prime Minister's office: the minister 
responsible makes a recommendation and the other ministers 
support it because of what is called collective cabinet 
responsibility. In fact, only a handful of people make the big 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that we are talking about $100 
million, which seems quite reasonable to me. This is why I 
wholeheartedly support the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Joliette. I want to commend him for moving the motion and 
aptly arguing in its favour. I urge my Liberal colleagues to 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on 
the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. 
tomorrow, pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
