	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I

	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State (Veterans), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on November 6, 1993 I had the privilege of 
announcing the Canada Remembers program. There have been 
literally hundreds of events commemorating events that led to the 
end of the second world war.
<P>
	I had the privilege of leading a number of pilgrimages through 
Italy, France, Belgium and Holland. Indeed they were very 
touching events.
<P>
	I remember standing outside Belgium with a number of 
Canadian veterans and marching into the city. In the city the people 
were singing ``O Canada'' and their greatest desire was to touch a 
Canadian veteran.
<P>
	In Vlissingen, the Netherlands over 100,000 people came to say 
thank you to the allied veterans.
<P>
<B>(1005 )</B>
<P>
	The most touching event for Canadian veterans was in 
Apledoorn where between 300,000 and 500,000 people came to say 
thank you to the Canadian veterans.
<P>
	Now I have the privilege of leading a delegation to the far east, 
to Burma, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. In 1941 about 2,000 
Canadians of the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles left 
Vancouver for Hong Kong.  More than one-quarter of these 
veterans died either on the battlefield or in prison camps.
<P>
	About 10,000 Canadians served in the far east during the second 
world war, and over 1,000 paid the supreme sacrifice. We will be 
visiting a number of those graves in commemoration of these 
people. We will also be visiting memorials in Rangoon, Singapore 
and Yokohama. These memorials bear the name of the Canadian 
veteran who has no known grave.
<P>
	In 1995 when we are looking ahead it is so important to look 
back to 1945 and really understand what price was paid for 
freedom and democracy. This pilgrimage is the last event for the 
Canada Remembers program. There have been so many events 
throughout this country from the largest provincial organization to 
the smallest community organization, all of which did nothing but 
add to the knowledge and the great respect we have for our 
Canadian veterans. These people can be justly proud and I thank 
them very much.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this morning on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois 
concerning the pilgrimage to the far east which will be undertaken 
later this week by the secretary of state, along with several 
parliamentarians and a group of veterans. The purpose of that trip 
will be to provide the veterans with the opportunity to honour the 
memory of their fallen comrades in Commonwealth cemeteries in 
Hong Kong, Burma, Singapore and Japan.
<P>
	It is important for the vital role played by our veterans in the 
defence of freedom to be properly commemorated, particularly this 
year, which marks the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day. We have 
already had a number of opportunities to recall to mind the selfless 
sacrifice of the men and women to whom we owe our heritage of 
freedom and democracy. This morning I would like to again 
express our gratitude to all of those who laid down their lives, and 
all those who were prepared to lay down their lives, in defence of 
that cause.
<P>
	Such was the price of our allegiance to the values of democracy 
and peace and it is precisely because our young servicemen shared 
those values that they fought to uphold them throughout the world. 
More than 100,000 young Quebecers and Canadians lost their lives 
during the two world wars, and many hundreds more in Korea and 
various peacekeeping operations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16868"> 16868 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, we want to honour, more specifically, the war effort of 
our veterans in Hong Kong and other parts of the far east during 
the second world war. Ten thousand fighting men and women 
served there, and nearly a thousand did not return home. As the 
secretary of state rightly pointed out, the war effort in the far east 
was primarily an air war. The battles there were vital to the 
triumph of freedom and democracy.
<P>
	Our soldiers were actively involved in reconnaissance, 
transportation, fighter and bomber squadrons. RCAF air crews and 
ground crews supported Commonwealth land forces in the war in 
the Pacific. We want to express our heartfelt gratitude to them.
<P>
	This pilgrimage is one of a number that have been made to 
different parts of the world, particularly Europe, where Canadians 
and Quebecers helped liberate Belgium, France, Italy and the 
Netherlands. The celebrations for V-E Day were particularly 
emotional.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The significant loss of human life and the horror of the suffering 
of our veterans in the far east, including all the members of 
Canada's troops of Chinese or Japanese extraction, must not be left 
to fade with time.
<P>
	This heritage must be passed on to the very young. We are 
therefore delighted to learn that four young people will take part in 
the pilgrimage. They are at the same age that the veterans were 
when they left to defend our freedom.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is pleased to support this initiative.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was 13 years old when the second world war ended; 9 
when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour and the war in the Pacific 
commenced. Young as I was, with an aunt, an uncle and a cousin 
already in Canada's armed forces, Pearl Harbour impacted strongly 
on my family and on me.
<P>
	For the men of the Winnipeg Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles the 
overwhelming numbers of Japanese attacking Hong Kong made the 
battle short but the ensuing years in prisoner of war camps long and 
arduous.
<P>
	Overworked, underfed, exposed and vulnerable to tropical 
diseases and without adequate medical care, almost as many died 
in those camps as had been killed in the fight.
<P>
	History tells us that the Japanese met their strongest resistance 
where men of the Royal Rifles and Winnipeg Grenadiers held the 
ground.
<P>
	More than 500 of those who sailed for Hong Kong did not return. 
Those who did suffered abuse and deprivation which would affect 
them for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	In the air, whether flying the hump in transport aircraft, in 
bombers carrying the fight to the enemy or in fighters defending 
our forces against enemy air attack, the Royal Canadian Air Force 
made a vital contribution to the successful resolution of that war.
<P>
	I was delighted to see on the list of 40 veterans whom we will 
accompany on this pilgrimage the name of a pilot with whom I 
served during my career in the air force. Until I saw his name 
among the veterans I had no idea he had flown in that campaign. He 
is not one to trumpet his accomplishments. We have not seen each 
other for many years and I look forward with great anticipation to 
meeting him again. I look forward to meeting and coming to know 
all these veterans who gave so much for Canadians and the world 
during that difficult time.
<P>
	1994 marked the 75th anniversary of the end of the first world 
war and the 50th anniversary of events leading to the end of the 
second world war. 1995 has seen ceremonies commemorating 
events late in the war and finally victory in Europe.
<P>
	This pilgrimage on which we embark tomorrow will visit 
cemeteries where Canadians lie in Burma, now Myanmar, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo.
<P>
	I will take great pride in joining our veterans of those campaigns 
as we pay tribute to their many comrades who made the ultimate 
sacrifice and did not return.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-360, an act to amend the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act (deduction re other income).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the hon. 
member for Prince George-Peace River, for seconding the bill.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to introduce my private member's bill which calls 
for amending the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. 
Members opposite know how the Reform Party and indeed the 
overwhelming majority of Canadians feel about the rich MP gold 
plated pension scheme.
<P>
	My private member's bill proposes to introduce an MP pension 
clawback which would apply to former parliamentarians. It would 
work on exactly the same principle as the old age security clawback 
applies to senior citizens. Former parliamentarians earning more 
than $53,215 in the private sector would have a portion of their MP 
pensions clawed back.
<P>
	It is time for this kind of legislation. Canadians are calling for 
legislation which reflects fairness from their elected 
representatives.

<P>

they are subsidized with tax dollars. This bill will open

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-362, an act to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act and the Canada Elections Act 
(confidence votes).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, this bill if enacted would amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act and the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	It would end the uncertainty over when our general elections 
would be called. Provisions in this bill would call for the general 
elections to be held every four years. This would in no way 
contravene our Constitution. No constitutional amendments are 
required because the Governor General still has the authority to 
determine whether or not that election shall be called.
<P>
	There are also amendments to the Canada Elections Act that 
would clarify when a byelection would be called. It would ensure 
that in constituencies where members no longer represent their 
constituents because they have either been appointed to the Senate, 
as we have seen in the past, or they have passed away, timely 
byelections would be called on fixed dates.
<P>
	Provisions in this bill would come into play if there was a crisis 
thus giving the bill the flexibility to be very usable.
<P>
	I ask that all members of the House give serious consideration to 
this bill. If the bill passes, we would know that the next general 
election would be held on October 20, 1997.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition which 
has been circulating all across Canada. This particular petition has 
been signed by a number of Canadians from Waterloo, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill, 
or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill, or the aged.

<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) by replacing lines 24 and 25, on page 1, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(<I>d</I>) ninety per cent, or such other percentage as is fixed by the committee of the

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 5</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-99 be amended by adding after line 32, on page 4, the following 
new Clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``4.1 The Act is amended by adding the following after section 7:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7.1 The committee of the House of Commons that normally considers matters 
relating to industry may, for the purposes of paragraph 3(1)(<I>d</I>), fix the 
percentage of any loss that the Minister is liable to pay.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	-He said: Madam Speaker, thank you for your co-operation. 
Our set of amendments consists of three groups. There are six 
amendments, and I will now speak to Group No. 1, as agreed.
<P>
	In this first group, there are two elements that reflect the spirit of 
our amendments. One concerns the change in coverage now 
provided under the act. The government currently guarantees 90 
per cent of loans made under the Small Business Loans Act, but 
that same government now wants to cap coverage at 85 per cent.
<P>
	The other aspect concerns our role as legislators, in Parliament 
and in committee. In clause 1(1)(<I>d</I>), and we will get back to this 
later on, the government's share will be prescribed, and we feel that 
is wrong. To get back to the loan guarantees provided under the 
Small Business Loans Act, which will be reduced from 90 per cent 
to 85 per cent, a difference of 5 per cent, this means the government 
is in a way backing out, is reducing its contribution to this 
legislation, and this increases the lender's liability by 5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The implications of this measure, although not dramatic, are 
nevertheless very serious, because there is a message here for small 
lending institutions, especially in Quebec where there is a credit 
union in every town. Since the risk to the lender increases, small 
lending institutions that do not provide more than 10, 15 or 20 
loans per year may think twice. We fear that this may cause bank 
managers to be more cautious, to be psychologically inclined to 
direct loans to less risky businesses, because the lender will, in 
theory, still run a greater risk.
<P>
	This, in our opinion, will cause banks to favour less risky 
businesses. This runs somewhat counter to the economic 
development needs of our society, which is increasingly focused on 
high-tech companies in preparing for the future. These companies 
represent a risk in themselves because, as we know, contrary to 
traditional businesses, high-tech companies often have nothing to 
reassure lending institutions because their operating strength is 
based on their owner-managers' knowledge and expertise, on 
intangible values, and not on the usual buildings or facilities.
<P>
	Reducing government coverage indirectly penalizes high-tech 
companies, which represent an extra risk for the banks. This has 
already been clearly identified as a problem during the industry 
committee's proceedings, because we know that the banks are 
generally reluctant, perhaps with good reason, to finance these 
high-tech companies.
<P>
	This, we also fear, will penalize new businesses without any 
experience or history that have not yet proven themselves. These 
businesses represent an extra risk for lenders. Reduced coverage 
will make it harder for them and for the banks to accurately assess 
the situation, since any banker knows that lending to a new, 
unproven business without annual statements for the previous years 
will make the matter even more difficult.
<P>
	Perhaps I should have pointed out earlier that we should keep in 
mind that what this bill implies comes from the last speech of the 
finance minister, in which he suggested rather strongly that the 
Small Business Loans Act program should be self-financing.
<P>
	This is the articulation of this political will. We members of the 
Bloc Quebecois realize that this is a legislation, a small business 
assistance program with a price. In 1993, bad debts that had to be 
absorbed by the federal government totalled $32 million and, with 
the envelop growing from $4 billion to $12 billion, losses could 
rise to $100 million.
<P>
	There may be food for thought here, serious thought. That is 
what the official opposition has in mind when suggesting that, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16871"> 16871 </A></B>
<P>
before amending this act to limit its scope and introducing concepts 
such as self-financing, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted 
to identify the benefits arising from this legislation. We at least 
need to  know how many jobs are created, what the government's 
tax return on its investment is-since the loss incurred as a result of 
the implementation of this act could be likened to an 
investment-and what indirect taxes are indirectly created by the 
implementation of the act, taxes that otherwise would not have to 
be paid.
<P>
	So, before the scope of this act is restricted, we in the committee 
would have liked, and that was part of our recommendations, to see 
a cost-benefit analysis. Unfortunately, the government did not 
follow our advice and is now going ahead by reducing, as we can 
see, coverage by five per cent.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The other aspect of Group No. 1, which is also found in Group 
No. 2, relates to clause 1(<I>d</I>), which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection 3(1) of the Small Business Loans Act is amended by striking out 
the word ``or'' at the end of the paragraph (a) and by replacing paragraph (<I>b</I>) 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) eighty-five per cent, or such other percentage as is prescribed-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is that ``as is prescribed'' provision that we object to and that 
we oppose. As you may have noticed, the official opposition-we 
all do-feels that the role of parliamentarians, including that of 
Parliament as legislator and that of the committees, is neglected 
and belittled. This bill should be a good opportunity to enhance the 
role of parliamentarians and committees, and this is why we 
condemn the fact that the government intends to resort to 
regulations.
<P>
	All the polls show that we must enhance the role of elected 
representatives. We were elected through a democratic process, we 
have things to say, and we all represent our constituents. We are 
here to express their views. Yet, the system relies less and less on 
the expertise and sensitivity of parliamentarians. If we are not the 
ones who can influence decisions, then who can? It is the 
bureaucracy, the lobbies and those who have money, as the current 
Quebec premier so accurately pointed out in his review of the 
referendum results.
<P>
	Given how much money circulates in our economic system, it is 
easy to see the power of money. That is confirmed once again. 
Indeed, if the government does not work openly with the 
institutions that we represent, than it works on the sly and resorts to 
its authority. With that provision, we will only find out after the 
fact that the government decided to change its coverage. By 
resorting to regulations, if the government wants to ensure 
self-financing and realizes that implementing the act is too costly, 
it can simply decide that its coverage will no longer be 85 per cent 
but, rather, 80, 75 or 70 per cent, without any discussion. All of us 
here will simply be put before a fait accompli, and that is not good 
for any self-respecting democracy.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
member for Trois-Rivières. Quite frankly, there are some points the 
member makes that are quite valid. I would like to dwell on the 
first point for a couple of minutes, and that has to do with the 
reduction in the government's liability from 90 per cent on the 
small business loan guarantee to 85 per cent.
<P>
	Last year the government liability for the Small Business Loans 
Act float was approximately $100 million. That is what it cost. 
Effectively, what we are doing with this amendment to the bill, 
which the Bloc does not support, is reducing the liability from $100 
million to $95 million. In other words, by lowering the exposure of 
the government we are going to save $5 million.
<P>
	The member for Trois-Rivières makes a very interesting point. 
Will that five per cent threshold cause banks to not look as hard or 
take as much of a chance with those smaller, more innovative, 
knowledge based firms? I am not sure that it will not.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Two weeks ago we heard in the industry committee that the 
small business float for all banks in Canada was $28 billion, a one 
per cent increase in the float over the year before. The banks of 
Canada that make loans under the Small Business Loans Act were 
guaranteed, prior to this legislation, 90 per cent of that loan by the 
crown. The float right now is around $4 billion to $5 billion. If we 
deduct that Government of Canada guarantee to the banks on those 
loans, then effectively we have not had a real increase in the small 
business loan activity in this country in the last two years.
<P>
	We have to be very careful. I am not going to support the 
member's motion to reduce the crown's exposure. The member 
from Trois-Rivières wants the government to go on the hook for 
another $5 million. I am not going to support that. Because of the 
pressure from the Reform Party, our government is on a fiscal 
obsession with the deficit and the debt. I hope this path will head to 
a quicker economic recovery. But I share the view of the Bloc 
member for Trois-Rivières that we are going to have to be vigilant, 
because if we lower the government guarantee to the banks we may 
see a lot of good opportunities go by the wayside. The banks might 
not come to the party. We need small business going full throttle in 
the country.
<P>
	I think the member's motion gives us an interesting concern, 
which we register. But we must at the same time balance our 
responsibility with reducing the cost of managing the program to 
the taxpayer. We will try it, and if we see that the activity on the 
Small Business Loans Act does not continue at the same rate or if 
there is not the same action on the Small Business Loans Act, then 
as  a committee and as a government we can ask the minister to 
reopen the file. But we must give it a chance in the interest of fiscal 
restraint and make sure that the bill is focused on cost recovery.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16872"> 16872 </A></B>
<P>
	I must say that the member for Trois-Rivières has done a 
fabulous job in the industry committee in the last two years. Instead 
of his party being called the Bloc Quebecois, I wish they were 
called the Bloc Canadien. If they were called the Bloc Canadien, 
then imagine the thrust we could get going in the House and the 
stimulation to the economy.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	Who knows, once the current leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
moves to Quebec City perhaps we will get a conversion going and 
the Bloc can become the Bloc Canadien. I sense there are a lot of 
members in the Bloc who really do by and large share some of the 
values and some of the things we all aspire to in the House for all of 
Canada.
<P>
	The second part of the member's point is about giving the 
industry committee the authority to amend this bill. That would be 
equivalent to changing the whole system of government. We all 
know our system of government gives the Prime Minister and his 
cabinet the executive responsibility to put legislation forward. We 
members of Parliament have the ability and the opportunity to 
provide input and to amend, as we are doing here today.
<P>
	The reason we do not have any motions being put forward today 
by the Reform Party is because the motions and ideas of the 
Reform critic for industry were accepted in committee and have 
become part of the bill. It is not as if members of Parliament do not 
have the-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It was the first time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> No, it was not the first 
time. We have accepted many of the good ideas of the member 
from Okanagan.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is the government would not 
abrogate to committees of the House its executive responsibility. 
The member for Trois-Rivières is asking the executive of the 
Government of Canada to just give its executive responsibility to 
the industry committee. We could not support such an idea, 
because ultimately the Prime Minister and the cabinet, the 
government, are responsible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They call the shots.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> That is right. We can 
have input, but that is the way we are governed in this country and 
that is the way it will have to stay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the debate on this very interesting 
motion. In some ways it sounds very good in principle. In another 
sense, I have great difficulty with it.
<P>
	I would like to review some of the provisions of the Small 
Business Loans Act itself and what it is doing. I noticed the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry alluded to the 
exposure of the government and the liability that is incurred on 
behalf of the government for the people of Canada under the Small 
Business Loans Act. It is rather substantial. Last spring the $4 
billion ceiling was increased to $12 billion, which is a threefold 
increase. It is very interesting that at that time the government's 
liability was 90 per cent of that $4 billion, which works out to about 
$3.6 billion. That costs roughly $100 million a year in terms of the 
non-payment or the defaults on various loans.
<P>
	The current amendment proposes to reduce the liability for the 
$12 billion ceiling to 85 per cent, which still means a liability for 
the government of approximately $11.2 billion or $11.3 billion. If 
that proportion of $100 million goes with a $4 billion ceiling, this 
could now go to $300 million with this new ceiling, which is pretty 
substantial. We have to be very careful about this.
<P>
	We have to recognize that Professors Haines and Riding did a 
very interesting study about small business loans and what 
happens. The cap of the individual borrower under the Small 
Business Loans Act is now $250,000; it was $125,000. The ceiling 
or the size of the business has increased. It was limited to any 
business that had $2 million or less of sales on an annual basis. The 
new ceiling goes up to $5 million.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	It is very interesting what this study of Haines-Riding showed. It 
showed that businesses below the $2 million ceiling had a default 
rate of somewhere between 7 and 8 per cent. Those with sales 
between $2 million and $5 million had a default rate of 14.7 per 
cent, which is much greater.
<P>
	We can see the exposure under the new provisions, under the 
new ceilings, are rather interesting because they increase the risk to 
which the government has exposed itself.
<P>
	To combat that the bill comes forward and says that there will be 
an administration fee. As we all know there is a 2 per cent 
registration fee right off the top which is added to the principal. 
Then there is a 1.75 per cent fee in terms of cost to make the costs 
of defaults and various other administrative items recoverable. It 
was not good enough that it resulted in a $100 million loss. That 
has been increased by another 1.25 per cent which means a total of 
3 per cent. The 1.25 per cent can be recovered in only one way, and 
that is through interest rates.
<P>
	The earlier situation was that the Small Business Loans Act used 
the prime rate that could be increased by 1.75 per cent. It went up to 
6.75 per cent. Now it is 3 per cent above prime, which means that 
we will probably run the new small business loans under that 
provision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16873"> 16873 </A></B>
<P>
	To give us the context of what is happening, the liability of the 
government is increased under the Small Business Loans Act by 
about 300 per cent over what it was before. It is our responsibility 
as elected representatives of our constituents to protect their 
interests. If we are exposing their risk from $4 billion to $12 
billion, it should not be delegated to the executive council of the 
government. It should be the responsibility of parliamentarians in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	The bill had the provision that it should be delegated to the 
executive council. We proposed an amendment. The hon. 
parliamentary secretary referred to the amendment in his 
presentation a few moments ago. It was accepted by the committee. 
It has now been taken out of the bill so that parliamentarians have 
control over fixing whether it will be 90 per cent or any other 
percentage. It is a real positive move for democracy.
<P>
	When I look at the amendment before us I notice that it has been 
adulterated because it is neither fish nor fowl at this point. It is 
being proposed that parliamentarians in the House of Commons 
should not have control but the committee should have control. 
Admittedly the committee is made up of parliamentarians elected 
from all parties represented in the House. They are elected 
representatives of the constituents.
<P>
	However when we are talking about $12 billion it is a lot of 
money. I do not think a committee should have the authority to 
make those kinds of decisions on behalf of Parliament. If we 
thought the executive council should not have that kind of power, it 
is much less that a committee of the House should have the 
authority.
<P>
	While the direction of giving authority to the people is a good 
one and while the intent is noble, the way it is being proposed will 
not achieve what we really need. We need to recognize that as 
representatives who have been elected by the people we represent 
them in a threefold way. First, we represent them because of the 
party we are a member of that presented the candidates to the 
people. They knew we were to present certain things. I appreciate 
the parliamentary secretary's statement that gave us credit for the 
fact that the Reform Party is here to bring about an awareness of the 
fiscal responsibility and the need to get our house in order 
financially. That is absolutely superb. We need to do that.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The difference I have with the hon. member opposite is that it is 
not an obsession. That is a reality. That is something we have to 
come to grips with. It is high time that we do it just as soon as we 
can. If truth is an obsession it is time we were all obsessed because 
truth is what we need. That is the first point.
<P>
	As we represent our people we have another responsibility to 
detect very clearly what they feel about certain kinds of issues. 
They want a voice and they have told us clearly that we have to get 
our financial house in  order. That was not a mandate that we in the 
Reform Party said we would have, but the people told us quite 
independent of it being a Reform platform that it was what they 
wanted us to do.
<P>
	Second, as representatives we actually go out and represent the 
people in what they think. Finally, we apply our best judgment to 
ordinary everyday housekeeping items where we do the things that 
have to be looked after.
<P>
	This is a very critical and important issue. To put this into the 
context of only a one-industry committee is not enough. The whole 
House of Commons is involved in financial issues of major import 
affecting small business, the engine that generates about 85 per 
cent of new employment in Canada. It is the issue.
<P>
	Also that group, especially the high tech group, is bringing about 
innovations to make our economy grow. There is no question that 
today we will move faster and faster not because we are so smart 
but because we bring about new innovations, new applications of 
new knowledge. That is what we need to do. The small business 
component is the absolute number one component in the economy 
that will help Canada grow to where it becomes a truly competitive 
industrial nation in the world. That is where we need to move.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity the motion has given me to express 
some ideas although I oppose the motion not because we do not 
need to deal with small business and not because we do not need 
representatives of the people but because the method is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter the debate at report stage of Bill C-99, 
specifically Motions Nos. 1 and 5 brought forward by the member 
for Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	I was interested in the member's speech. He discussed the need 
to defend lenders. It seems unusual to me. Sometimes when I look 
at the Small Business Loans Act the question that comes readily to 
mind is why the Government of Canada has to encourage and 
guarantee lending to small business, which is the obligation of our 
financial community.
<P>
	I was very surprised to hear the member defending moving the 
guarantee from 90 per cent to 85 per cent. He defended the 
potential liability for another 5 per cent on these loans to lenders. 
The banks of the country have reported something in the 
neighbourhood of $1 billion worth of profits. It is apropos that as 
legislators and parliamentarians we are concerned about the small 
and medium size business communities and where they fit.
<P>
	The question could well be why the guarantee is at 85 per cent. 
The intent of the legislation is to recognize a liability exists for the 
Government of Canada in terms of these loans. As far as I can 
understand, the guarantee has been amended to 85 per cent 
basically to allow more lending to occur. The growth in the SBLA 
program has  been remarkable. In that sense it has been very 
successful in channelling investment loans to small and medium 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16874"> 16874 </A></B>
<P>
size businesses. By leaving the guarantee at the 90 per cent level, 
loan losses could well exceed $100 million a year.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	As we have heard from the hon. member from Okanagan the 
government is committed to reducing our expenditures and our risk 
to loss. He spoke about a maximum liability of something in the 
neighbourhood of $12 billion. That is erroneous. That kind of risk 
would be like giving somebody an $85,000 mortgage on a 
$100,000 house and expecting to lose the entire $85,000. Most of 
the small business community could look at that situation and 
realize it is an unrealistic assumption.
<P>
	Most of the loan loss provisions that have resulted in losses to 
the government are somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2.5 per 
cent. That is not unreasonable in the lending business, which gets 
me back to my original question of why we cannot encourage our 
financial institutions to be more aggressive in lending to small and 
medium size businesses rather than require the federal government 
to guarantee the loans.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned a number of other issues, not the 
least of which was investment in new and emerging technologies. 
Certainly that is a good point. The history of the loans has been that 
they are used for capital additions to small and medium size 
businesses, basically equipment, real estate and so on. The aspect 
of new technology still befuddles the investment community 
generally. We need to look for new and different types of sources of 
capital for small and medium size businesses. I suspect small and 
medium size businesses and the SBLA program do not look to this 
source of capital to finance emerging technologies.
<P>
	About a year ago I had the opportunity to tour the Royal Bank. I 
talked to some of the portfolio managers and listened to their 
concerns about emerging technologies. I still believe that the 
financial community has not come to grips with how to deal with 
emerging technology. It is still very much focused on the concept 
of security, based on what it was doing 10 or 20 years ago, looking 
for hard assets as security for the loans.
<P>
	The most prevalent asset was real estate. I do not have to tell my 
colleagues what has happened in the real estate industry in the last 
five years. The banks, in an effort not to be burned twice, are 
getting back to using real estate as a security item, which has 
compounded the problems of small and medium size businesses. 
The banks are refusing to enter even traditional markets because 
they do not know from where they will get security.
<P>
	Through the Small Business Loans Act the government has 
attempted to inspire financial institutions to come forward and lend 
to small and medium size businesses. Most businesses will be 
smaller,  based on some of the changes to the act. When we are 
talking about sales of $5 million and so forth a lot of people in the 
riding of Durham do not think that is small business; they think it is 
big business.
<P>
	The changes to the SBLA will allow it to be more focused on 
genuine small businesses. The question is how big businesses 
occur. They occur from the emergence of small businesses that are 
allowed to grow within the system. The Small Business Loans Act 
has really been a hand up for some small businesses. As the hon. 
member for Broadview-Greenwood suggested, it may well be the 
only hand up that exists between the financial sector and small and 
medium size businesses.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	The second part of the motion deals with the possibility of 
having the industry committee approve changes in the guarantee 
aspect of these provisions. One thing that small business needs is 
flexibility and rapidity in decision making.
<P>
	I question whether it is in the purview of the committee system 
to undertake this sort of review process knowing the heavy 
workload the committee constantly has in this place. I also question 
whether it is within the competence of the committee to make those 
kinds of decisions.
<P>
	In order for the committee to change these kinds of guarantees it 
would need rapid and up to date information about the experience 
of loan losses. It would have to be able to understand emerging 
tendencies within the lending business.
<P>
	I really question whether it would be a service to small and 
medium size businesses which would find a great lag in being able 
to have a flexible relationship with the government. I think the 
government is attempting to be very flexible in allowing this plan 
to emerge and foster support of small business.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am opposed to both of these motions for the 
reasons I have mentioned.

<P>
	-He said: Madam Speaker, I realize these amendments are 
rather technical and dry but they are nevertheless important, and 
they take the same approach as the amendment we introduced 
earlier when we condemned the use of the word prescribe and the 
whole regulatory process and mechanism that entails.
<P>
	However, before I continue, I would like to thank the 
parliamentary secretary for his kind words, which I appreciated. I 
want to return the compliment, because I think we should realize 
the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Industry is not only a 
very good parliamentarian but also an outstanding asset to our 
work in committee.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on what he said about establishing 
a bloc canadien. In fact, in the forties there was a ``bloc populaire'' 
to defend the interests of Quebecers. In the nineties, and English 
Canada is not about to forget it, we saw the birth of a bloc 
québécois. To continue the musings of the parliamentary secretary, 
we might see the birth of a bloc canadien very shortly in  Canada, 
after Quebec becomes sovereign, a bloc that would be foster the 
best possible relations with a sovereign Quebec, including an 
economic and political partnership, which we support because it is 
sensible, it is the way to mutual respect between good neighbours 
and recognition of the equality of the two peoples here in America 
who are different from the United States, who are different from 
Europe and who represent certain cultures on this planet, since 
Canada is also a distinct society. If there is enough good will on 
both sides in the months and years to come-and our contribution 
to the industry committee is a good example of that, we will be able 
to work together for the well-being and prosperity of our respective 
peoples.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the remarks of my colleague 
opposite, who expresses surprise at the spirit of our amendment on 
the reduction of government coverage, claiming that we wanted to 
protect lenders rather than borrowers. I think we have to face the 
fact lenders are reluctant when it comes to small business. That is 
the reason for a small business loan act. We know there is a 
reluctance and that the government wants to keep the legislation 
but to distance itself from it by reducing its coverage. I think this 
will be to the detriment of what is increasingly the motor of 
economic development: the small and medium business, the 
SMBs. This is why we are being very careful in this. We want to 
ensure the continuation of the coverage currently offered to the 
more vulnerable small borrowers, the ones threatening to lenders.
<P>
	So, getting back to the spirit of this second bloc, it is to reinforce, 
as mentioned earlier, the roles of parliamentarians. In any civilized 
society, as ours claims to be, where there is representation by 
election, I believe there has long been a certain malaise over the 
role of those elected to Parliament. The role of parliamentarians is 
becoming more increasingly insignificant. And I think this is one 
of those times when we are reminded that things could be done 
differently. Over the course of several decades, the public service 
has progressively become heavy, especially at the top. As was 
mentioned earlier, the executive branch assumed a great deal of 
power, and while Parliament is certainly a place for debate, it has 
very little power, and that is what we are condemning and want to 
change. There is also continuity.
<P>
	I think that anyone who has seen the Bloc Quebecois at work in 
the various committees can appreciate the logic underlying our 
remarks and contribution, in ensuring, rather like I am doing this 
morning, that parliamentarians have greater power to influence the 
decision making process so that the public interest remains first 
and foremost, at the expense, if need be, of other interests, which, 
as you know full well, have other ways of making themselves 
heard.

	Earlier, I heard the parliamentary secretary criticize our 
amendment proposal, saying that, should coverage be reduced, as 
we in the official opposition are concerned it will, the industry 
committee will make appropriate representations to the Minister of 
Industry to have this issue reviewed. That is not much, in terms of 
power.
<P>
	This means that, when a problem is reported, the industry 
committee will come to agreement and quietly make 
representations to the minister, asking him: ``Would you please 
stop doing this, Sir; you are hurting our constituents''. 
Parliamentarians certainly do not have much power, in such 
instances.
<P>
	This is what we deplore and want to change by introducing an 
amendment which, as we can see, has unfortunately not garnered 
unanimous support in this House. Even the Reform Party is not 
very keen on our proposal. This is unfortunate because it discredits 
our role once again, given what that role should be. This is not only 
the case in the Parliament of Canada, but in all British legislatures 
where, over the decades, elected representatives were gradually 
stripped of certain powers because of the size of the bureaucracy, to 
the benefit of technocrats who want to work behind close doors. It 
goes without saying that it is easier to resort to regulations and 
orders in council.
<P>
	I remember the debate on Bill C-88 dealing with internal trade. It 
provides that the federal government can, through orders in 
council, take action against the party deemed at fault. Using orders 
in council means that there is no public debate. It means that we 
cannot even discuss the issue on behalf of the province deemed to 
be unco-operative or at fault. The elected representatives of that 
province would not even be allowed to make public 
representations, because the issue would have been settled through 
an order in council. This, in my view, is rather ominous. This is 
why we moved these three amendments, which essentially seek to 
eliminate the use of regulations and replace it with a committee 
decision. More specifically, Motion No. 6 seeks to add a new 
clause 7.1 which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7.1 The committee of the House of Commons that normally considers matters 
relating to industry may, for the purposes of sub-paragraph 3(4)(<I>c</I>)(i), fix the 
annual administration fee or the method of calculating the annual 
administration fee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As things now stand, the minister is keeping this power for 
himself without too much consultation and is being very discreet 
about it. So much the better for those who will be aware of that, and 
too bad for the others.
<P>
	Instead of that, it is possible to rely on the existing political 
structure, and to proceed in a manner which is more transparent and 
more public. This is what we hope to achieve with these 
amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have always been an advocate 
that members of Parliament can play a meaningful role in 
amending or designing legislation in the House of Commons. 
Therefore, I do not share the view of the Bloc member for 
Trois-Rivières. It is important that we explain to Canadians how as 
individual MPs we can have an impact on the system.
<P>
	If I have a particular view of how the Small Business Loans Act 
should be amended, then I should sit down with colleagues on both 
sides of the House and develop a consensus. Quite often when we 
can get a consensus it has always been my experience that unless it 
is something that really upsets the fiscal framework of the country 
most ministers accept good ideas from their parliamentary 
committees.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I have never experienced a situation in which a minister who had 
constantly ignored the advice of his political confreres on a 
constant basis whether in the House, in committee or in caucus still 
succeeded as a minister. I have never known ministers to succeed if 
genuine requests from MPs to their departments are ignored. If 
they are ignored it is the MPs' fault.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Ask the Minister of Justice if he listens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I presume the hon. 
member is talking about gun control. The Minister of Justice did 
listen. This was a balancing act he had to perform. He had to make 
a very tough decision. Do we think for a minute the Minister of 
Justice did not balance in his decision making process the 
difficulties rural members were having versus the concerns urban 
members had?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He ignored them completely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The judge is out on 
whether he ignored rural MPs or whether this situation will succeed 
in gun control. That is a fair example. It was a tough decision.
<P>
	By and large on ideas not as controversial, when we get a 
consensus ministers tend to listen.
<P>
	It is very important that we take notice of the Bloc's point on the 
control the bureaucracy has in this community. I have been 
working around this town since 1979. I came here as a young 
political assistant, not a bureaucrat. I was amazed at the way the 
bureaucrats, the public servants, operated and managed 
departments within government. We call it the machinery of 
government.
<P>
	I had a terrific experience working in the Prime Minister's office 
for almost four years. I was amazed even in that office when we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16877"> 16877 </A></B>
<P>
wanted things done the public service had this capacity to actually 
control the tempo of implementation. I coined an expression back 
in 1981  called the MAD treatment, maximum administrative 
delay. They were good public servants. It was just part of the 
culture. It was part of the thought process that even though the 
political will wants a particular policy implemented, before we 
actually put it into the factory and implement it we must do further 
analysis. We must check this, we must check that. The delay was 
enough to drive one nuts.
<P>
	The member for Trois-Rivieres has given us a very important 
point on which we must be ever vigilant. Those of us who are 
elected, who are accountable, have to make sure the things 
approved in the House are implemented and not steered off and 
done in a way the bureaucracy thinks should be done.
<P>
	I do not share the member's view when he says we do not have 
an opportunity for input. I think we do. If we are passionate about 
our ideas and we get support from other colleagues usually they can 
be implemented.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	It is not always easy. I could give a personal example and pass it 
on to the members opposite on the whole issue of tax reform. I have 
been working on the issue of tax reform for six years, the single tax 
system.
<P>
	I was hoping that with 50-odd members from the Reform Party 
who apparently believed in tax reform we would have much more 
energy in support of the notion of comprehensive tax reform, but 
that has fizzled. Obviously I have not done a good enough job on 
that issue in convincing other colleagues we need comprehensive 
tax reform. We are not talking about it enough, debating it enough 
or selling it to the rest of the decision makers in the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Convince the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> We cannot simply 
convince the Minister of Finance. This is where we go to the 
member for Trois-Rivières' point about the technocrats, the 
bureaucrats. What we really should be doing is lobbying as elected 
men and women. We should lobby the finance department.
<P>
	How many members have taken the time to go to the finance 
department, sit down with a senior bureaucrat and talk to him or her 
about their ideas for tax reform? Those public servants cannot 
refuse to see elected members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> They do it to me all the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> If they are refusing to 
see the member, he should go to the minister. They do not refuse to 
see the lobbyists so I cannot imagine a public servant refusing to 
meet with a member of Parliament. I find that crazy.
<P>
	If a member tells me of any public servant who refuses to meet 
with an elected person I will stand up in the House and we will talk 
about it. Even before I will, the Prime Minister will go berserk. As 
someone who has  been in nine different government departments, 
the Prime Minister understands the public service is there to 
implement the political will of the approved legislation in the 
House. If there is resistance to it, it is our fault to allow the 
resistance.
<P>
	I appreciate the comment from my colleague from 
Trois-Rivières that we should be ever vigilant as we deal with the 
public service in the way it manages some of these pieces of 
legislation we approve in the House. However, I do not share his 
view that members of Parliament cannot have a substantial role in 
amending and designing legislation. For that reason we will not be 
supporting this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to debate the motions placed by the Bloc. I listened to the 
eloquent defence of Parliament by the previous speaker. I 
wondered why in his eloquent defence he would be opposed to the 
idea that Parliament make the decisions regarding the levels of the 
fees and so on charged within Bill C-99.
<P>
	The member also told us about how difficult it is to get through 
the civil service, how difficult the bureaucracy is to move and the 
challenges we as members of Parliament face in achieving these 
things. Yet he gave no indication whatsoever that he was prepared 
to recognize these decisions should be made right here on the floor 
of the House rather than some back room by some unelected 
unknown bureaucrat we cannot even find much less influence as far 
as making these decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. I would like to humbly correct the member 
because I did not in any way, shape or form say the elected people 
in the House do not have an influence on the way bills are designed 
and approved.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I advise the member that 
decisions regarding the level of fees should be made right here on 
the floor of the House. We should not be delegating the authority to 
some bureaucratic who is nameless, unelected and unknown, who 
advises his minister that he thinks they should vary or increase the 
fee and the minister does it. This is how the bill reads.
<P>
	The Bloc is trying to change the motion so that a committee of 
the House would make that decision in lieu of the minister by order 
in council.
<P>
	Unfortunately we cannot support the motion by the Bloc even 
though we feel the decision should be made right here on the floor 
of the House because unfortunately the Bloc does not understand 
the rules of the House. Committees do not make decisions. All 
committees can do is report back to the House. Committees do not 
have the authority to make legislative decisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16878"> 16878 </A></B>
<P>
	Any motion approved on the floor of the House is not legislation 
by itself. It is only an expression of the House. We only approve 
legislation. We cannot initiate legislation through a committee. 
That is where the Bloc is totally misinformed and cannot 
understand the rules of the House, which leads me to the question 
of separation. When Bloc members want to separate from the rest 
of the country they have no understanding of the process. The 
referendum they had in Quebec last month was ruled illegal by 
a court in their own province, and yet they proceeded with the 
referendum anyway.
<P>
	We now find they do not understand the rules of the House, 
where they expect committees to make legislation. It is little 
wonder we have a party that cannot understand how to enjoy life 
within the confederation and would rather head off on its own. I am 
concerned for the people of Quebec if they are to be led by a group 
with no concept of how to live within a set of rules.
<P>
	Getting back to the legislation and getting back to more 
relevance, we want to see decisions made by members of 
Parliament. We do not want to delegate the authority to the minister 
who acts on the advice of some bureaucrat. We want to see the 
minister make up his mind and bring a proposal to the House in the 
form of legislation. We look at it, debate it and vote on it. If it is 
approved that is fine, but we do not want to give him a carte 
blanche to vary the rules at his whim without debate, without the 
public at large realizing what is going on. That is why we have to 
oppose the motions proposed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to once again enter the debate on Motion No. 6.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member for Trois-Rivières talking about 
how different Quebec and its people are from the rest of the 
country. The Small Business Loans Act shows us very realistically 
how we are all similar. The problems of small and medium size 
businesses whether in Montreal or Chicoutimi, Oshawa or 
Vancouver are very much the same. Small and medium size 
businesses have difficulty obtaining access to capital.
<P>
	Clearly it is important for us as a country to look at as big a 
market, as big a capital access as we possibly can and to assist 
small and medium size businesses. What are we talking about 
here? Ultimately, we are talking about jobs and the ability to create 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I was very interested recently to read a summary by the Quebec 
Manufacturers Association that stated that Quebec is the least 
attractive jurisdiction in Canada in which to do business. This is 
not something that has been created by the federal system; it is 
something that has been created within the province of Quebec. I 
addressed some manufacturers from Ontario this week and asked 
them how we could assist our fellow business people  within that 
province overcome some of the problems of high wage structures, 
high interest rates, and so forth that the manufacturers of Quebec 
are having, which means an inability to create jobs in that province.
<P>
	This motion deals with the ability of making the administrative 
changes to acts within the purview of the committee system. What 
we have to do is ask ourselves what is our role as parliamentarians. 
Psychologically, it sounds very good to say that we should be 
involved with every decision of government, possibly every change 
in the Income Tax Act, possibly every idiosyncracy or change in 
the Environmental Protection Act, fee structures that are 
administered by Canada Post. There are all kinds of administrative 
actions that occur on a daily basis.
<P>
	When I practised as a chartered accountant I had a list of 
complaints, and I agree that the system is too complex. I had a 
stack of information that came in every week of changes within the 
system, a stack of about four or five inches. If that is to be the 
purview of the committees, I do not think they will get much work 
done.
<P>
	The other aspect of this is that we need to empower somebody 
with responsibility, somebody who is answerable, somebody who 
can appear before the committee and answer for decisions that are 
being made. I question whether on a daily basis we can have 
members of Parliament involved in all of these individual 
decisions. On paper it sounds very good, but the reality will be that 
we are going to delay the decision making.
<P>
	For instance, on administration fees, the object of that exercise 
was to basically make the administration of those loans break even 
for the government, for the government to have no costs involved, 
covering our loan losses, et cetera. For the committee to make 
rational decisions on an ongoing basis, they would have to know 
almost on a weekly basis the administration of those loans, the 
numbers that have gone into default, the industries that are being 
pressured, and so forth to know whether to increase or decrease 
fees in certain areas.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that 
committees do not meet that often. The reality is that Parliament is 
only in session less than half of the year. How could it possibly 
react on a daily or weekly basis to these kinds of changes? That is 
not the purpose of Parliament or even the purpose of the committee 
system.
<P>
	Once again, I am opposed to this group of motions. If we want to 
improve the committee system, we should ask whether the reviews 
the committees enter into are efficient and adequate, whether the 
powers of investigation are adequate and whether they exercise 
them adequately. Those are really properly the issues that would 
face parliamentarians on how to make this place more efficient and 
more democratic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16879"> 16879 </A></B>
<P>
	There is room for possibly strengthening the committee system, 
and I thank the member for Trois-Rivières for making that point. 
A lot of people in this country would like to see the committee 
system strengthened to use the talents of members of Parliament 
to their optimum benefit. Quite frankly, approving administration 
fees I do not think is one of them.
<P>
	There is another important aspect we overlook about the 
administration fee. It has been the complaint of the SBLA program 
that it was essentially the prime borrowers, well heeled companies, 
that were getting the loans. In other words, these people could 
possibly get loans on their own without that guarantee but chose to 
get the guarantee because it was a cheap source of capital for them, 
with a government guarantee attached to it. By increasing this fee 
that will no longer be an advantage to them.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	As a consequence, what we have done is opened up a significant 
amount of capital for small and medium size businesses. What this 
means is that those companies that can afford to pay regular rates 
of interest will be unattracted because of this fee structure and will 
go off and borrow through the normal financial channels without 
the SBLA guarantee. The companies that will be left will in fact be 
those emerging companies, the ones that find difficulty in getting 
access to loans.
<P>
	Time and time again on the industry committee and through our 
report, <I>Taking Care of Small Business</I>, we have been told by small 
business that the most important thing is access to capital and not 
necessarily the cost. Of course there is a point at which the cost of 
capital becomes prohibitive, but those small emerging companies, 
the ones we are looking toward as creating new jobs and new 
industries, are going to have better access to funds under this 
system. This sounds ironic, because the fees are slightly higher, but 
it will open up an area for small and medium size business that 
does not currently exist.
<P>
	Getting back to the original motion, I think it will be a detriment 
to those industries if for some reason the administration fee is 
somehow logged into a committee that is cumbersome and takes a 
long time to react. It is wise that the government leave that decision 
making possibly with a bureaucrat. That bureaucrat from time to 
time and at the discretion of the committee can appear before the 
committee and explain his actions. If for whatever reasons we find 
him negligent, we can get rid of him and hire somebody who is 
better. I believe that is more appropriately the administration of the 
committee system.
<P>
	In conclusion, very simply, I am opposed to Motion No. 6 
because I do not believe it is in the best interests of small and 
medium size business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-99 and related 
amendments 2, 4, and 6 put forth by our colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	The backbone of our economy is made up of the small and 
medium size businesses in this country. They are the ones who 
truly create longlasting jobs within Canada. They are the ones who 
create real employment in our country. They form an essential part 
of our tax base in areas of innovation, science, technology, finance, 
and many other areas. They are something we Canadians should be 
proud of.
<P>
	The small to medium size businesses are finding it increasingly 
difficult in Canada to function because of the high tax loads, the red 
tape they are forced to struggle under, and the difficulty they have 
in securing loans. Lending institutions within Canada are 
historically very conservative. Therefore, individuals in this 
country who bring forth many good ideas find it difficult if not 
impossible to have their efforts actually go to fruition. This is an 
enormous loss for Canada.
<P>
	One just needs to look in the areas of medicine, science, 
technology, and the pharmaceutical industry to see good ideas 
going nowhere or in fact being sold to companies in other parts of 
the world. I recently read some very interesting information on 
this. I read about incredible ideas being born within our own 
country and being sent to other countries, where they become 
productive, profitable, and contribute to the society by providing 
long term, high tech, high paying jobs for people in other countries. 
This is indeed a sad thing.
<P>
	Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, 
comprises efforts to put this program on the road to cost recovery. 
Everyone in this House approves of this. However, we are also 
addressing the amendments put forth by the Bloc Quebecois. We 
oppose these amendments because they bring the power of 
determining liability directly to the committee, instead of bringing 
it down to the area in this government that is closest to the public, 
and that is the House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to congratulate my colleague from Okanagan 
Centre, who put forth amendments that were adopted by the 
committee that would bring the decision making process closer to 
the people, and that is the House of Commons.
<P>
	I find it quite strange that members of the Bloc Quebecois are 
putting forth amendments but are not addressing some of the large 
issues that are affecting their province. Sadly, Quebec in recent 
times has seen economic destitution and social problems unrivalled 
in its history. It is easy for the Bloc Quebecois and other separatist 
forces to blame history and Ottawa for these problems. But I ask 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16880"> 16880 </A></B>
<P>
my honourable friends in the Bloc Quebecois, does not 
responsibility for some of these  problems rest on their own 
shoulders? Is it not the intent of the separatist forces to carve 
Quebec out of Canada? Are they not at least partly, if not largely, 
responsible for the terrible economic and social destitution we see 
in many areas of Quebec? One just has to visit the eastern part of 
Montreal to see this in real life.
<P>
	I hope the hon. members of the Bloc Quebecois will look toward 
building a united Canada and addressing the economic and social 
problems that affect all of us within the context of this country. I 
find it extremely strange that they say that if they did not have to 
give their tax base to Ottawa they would be a lot better off. I ask 
them to wake up and look at the fact that net transfer payments go 
to Quebec and not to Ottawa. I ask them to remember that before 
they continue to pursue their course.
<P>
	I would also like to address some of the problems that are 
affecting small and medium size businesses and put forth some 
constructive solutions. As I said before, small and medium size 
businesses are have increasingly difficult times because of the high 
tax loads they are forced to work under. This is indicative of the 
government's huge tax loads. With these huge tax loads, the high 
debt and deficit we have incurred, we are forced to pay off 
increasingly larger amounts of interest on these debts. As a result, 
interest rates in the country are higher than they ought to be and tax 
rates are also higher than they should be. It makes it very difficult 
for these companies to compete in other countries.
<P>
	The industry committee supported the fact that federal, 
provincial, and municipal governments should get their fiscal 
houses in order so that interest rates may be brought down and 
more money made available to companies, making a stronger, 
healthier dollar. It would provide an element of stability that is 
essential if small and medium size businesses are to be effective 
competitors in the future.
<P>
	In talking to business, we have found that one of the greatest 
obstacles they face is the red tape they must endure. It is 
extraordinarily strange that the great ideas put forth in this country 
have to pass through so many loopholes to get to where they can be 
effective that many do not achieve their ultimate end. Red tape that 
is supposed to work for businesses is in effect choking them. We 
need to take a very close and hard look at this. We need to work 
with the finance and revenue departments to determine ways in 
which we can decrease the red tape and make businesses more 
effective and virile competitors in this country.
<P>
	I would also like to raise the issue of using tax incentives to 
make more capital available to businesses. Indeed, the industry 
committee looked at this and suggested that decreasing capital 
gains tax rates for long term investment in Canadian small and 
medium size businesses would be an effective way to provide these 
companies with money to invest to build their businesses.  
Maintaining the $500,000 capital gains exemption is also a useful 
technique. If that were applied to small and medium size 
businesses, it would provide more capital for them.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Relaxing the use of RRSPs in investing in one's own business is 
another measure which would put the responsibility back on those 
brave men and women who like to go it alone and try to make a 
private business work. They could use their own funds to invest in 
their business.
<P>
	We also need to find ways in which the public can invest in 
Canadian companies. We need to define new financial relationships 
for the government, the banks and the private sector.
<P>
	We can look at many examples. Germany and Japan are two 
giants which have managed to capture large segments of markets 
throughout the world. In part that is due to the unique relationship 
which the private sector has with the lending institutions in their 
respective countries. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. There 
are many examples in the world of these ideas being put into effect 
to support business.
<P>
	In summary, small and medium size businesses are the backbone 
of the Canadian economy. They are an invaluable source of taxes 
for the federal and provincial governments. They are the primary 
employers. Without these institutions the employment rate would 
be much higher. They provide long term, long lasting, high paying 
jobs for Canadians. It is the responsibility of the government and 
opposition members to support measures which would maximize 
the effectiveness of small and medium size businesses. Let us look 
at other parts of the world and find ways in which we can support 
the backbone of Canada's economy.

through this amendment. In fact, the proposed amendment is 
entirely in line with the message we got during the last federal 
election campaign, when the Liberal Party of Canada had already 
said in its famous red book that if it were elected, it would ensure 
that no personal guarantees were required for loans under the Small 
Business Loans Act.
<P>
	However, whether it was divine or some other kind of 
intervention, whether it was a lack of political will or loss of 
memory-Alzheimer's not being restricted to humans, even 
institutions will forget, and I think this is very disturbing in the 
present case-I think the government forgot a promise that must 
have been welcomed by the business community, especially small 
business entrepreneurs who are directly affected by the Small 
Business Loans Act. The promise was that from now on, the Small 
Business Loans Act would no longer require personal guarantees.
<P>
	The Liberals forgot, and it is our job to remind them of one of the 
few promises in the red book that made sense. Asking the borrower 
for a personal guarantee under the Small Business Loans Act is, 
like the hon. member for Champlain said earlier, like having a 
belt-the government guarantee-and asking for suspenders 
because you are afraid the belt will break and the loan will 
otherwise be a write-off.
<P>
	With the 90 per cent guarantee the lender used to have and which 
will now be 85 per cent, the lender could still expect to avoid 
severe losses after agreeing to lend money to a small business. 
However, if the lender can also ask for a personal guarantee, in 
most cases a home, a bank account, a car or part of the assets of the 
entrepreur and business owner, we are seeing a kind of security that 
may  be unnecessary and provides what may be excessive 
guarantees for the lender.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Durham mentioned earlier, there is 
always an element of risk involved, and the lender should be 
prepared to share the risk. In this area, 15 per cent may be riskier 
than 10 per cent, especially in the case of new or high tech 
businesses, as we pointed out, but to ask for personal guarantees as 
well is something to which we object, and we hope the government 
considers and endorses this amendment.
<P>
	Another direct advantage is that, if personal guarantees such as a 
house were not required as security under the Small Business 
Loans Act, because the government provides a guarantee to the 
bankers-these assets in the possession of the borrower, in the 
possession of the manager of the small business, particularly in the 
case of high tech or exporting companies, which make lenders feel 
insecure-if those assets were freed up and not used as security, 
they could be presented to lenders to facilitate obtaining a loan, as 
security in any negotiations or transactions other than those under 
the SBLA, the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	The borrower could therefore use these personal assets not 
required as security to plan future business development, 
particularly in the case of small high tech or export businesses, 
where lenders might justifiably feel insecure about the operation or 
the very nature of the business' activities. Often lenders are not 
familiar with high tech and export businesses, whose accounts 
receivable are outside the country and not always easily checked.
<P>
	The Export Development Corporation is involved as well, but 
here again with additional administrative costs and delays.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Thus, by eliminating the personal guarantees now required under 
the SBLA, they could be placed in another context for use by the 
borrower as security with a lender. This is what we hope the 
government will accept, and that is why we have presented this 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important for people to 
understand that to be eligible for a small business loan under the 
current system the loan has to be applied toward certain conditions. 
For example, it is not to be used for working capital; it is to be used 
for the purchase of equipment, leaseholds, things that have true and 
sustained value.
<P>
	If a loan is in default under the Small Business Loans Act, that 
equipment has a value. It can be sold. When the value of that 
equipment or leaseholds that have been  sold has been realized, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16882"> 16882 </A></B>
<P>
amount that is left over is subject to a 25 per cent personal 
guarantee.
<P>
	For example, if you have a loan of $100,000 for equipment, 
under the Small Business Loans Act you have to have a minimum 
of approximately 15 to 20 per cent. The amount of exposure right 
off the bat is $80,000. Of course, you are in the process of paying it 
down almost immediately because it is always part of a 
programmed return. If your business goes bad and you at least 
realize half of the value of the equipment, then your exposure on 
that $100,000 is approximately $30,000. Then, from a personal 
guarantee you are only exposed to 25 per cent of that.
<P>
	Because of the way banks have been dealing in Canada 
traditionally, there is this mindset right now that when you go to get 
a loan they want your home, they want your RRSPs, they want your 
life insurance as security. They want four and five times security 
for the loan. That is not what we are talking about here.
<P>
	We are saying under the Small Business Loans Act the personal 
guarantee is limited to 25 per cent of the amount that is left over 
after everything has been liquidated. From a normal commercial 
business point of view I do not see that as a bad thing. It is a big 
improvement over the traditional type of security that banks would 
want on most other small business loans.
<P>
	We are not going to support this motion. The bill is designed in a 
way that gives much greater flexibility. Once the loan repayment 
reaches a certain level, where there is security in the assets to cover 
the exposure, under the current act the personal guarantee, the25 per cent, can be released. Once their exposure was reduced most 
banks would release the personal guarantee. I believe that is fair 
and that we should not change that aspect of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The member for Trois-Rivières has put forward good ideas and 
thought provoking points. However, on balance the design of the 
bill is quite solid and will probably do the job we intend it to do.
<P>
	As this is the last motion, I should like to say that the industry 
committee is very good. It has had a very tight focus on the issue of 
access to capital by small business. This is the third time in less 
than three years the bill has been through the House of Commons. 
It was amended three years ago by the then Conservative 
government. By the way, it went through all three readings in the 
House in one day. We supported the Conservative government in 
amending the bill three years ago because we believed in the 
importance of the issue of access to capital and some kind of 
instrument that would act as a catalyst to sensitize the banks and to 
push the banks forward.
<P>
	As much as I support the bill, I am becoming a little concerned 
that we are creating too much of a crutch for the banking 
institution. I listened to the critic from the  Reform Party this 
morning. He mentioned that the float capacity in the last two years 
under the legislation had gone up from $3.5 billion to $12 billion. 
The total small business float last year for all financial institutions 
and small businesses in Canada was $28 billion. Now we are 
suddenly letting the small business float go up to $12 billion, and 
this is the one the crown guarantees.
<P>
	In my judgment we are doing the work the banks should be 
doing. We are taking all the risks of decision making away from 
banks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The member asks why 
we are doing it. It is because we realize that small business 
represents our greatest hope for taking people off unemployment 
insurance, taking them off welfare and getting them back into a 
productive state in life where they have dignity and are paying 
taxes. When we get this fiscal framework together small business 
represents our greatest hope. The greatest difficulty of small 
business is getting access to capital.
<P>
	We are urging, hoping and coaxing banks to get into the small 
business game, but it is not easy. We have to be a catalyst along the 
way. I am being very candid in my belief that we must have a heads 
up on the issue because we are essentially making the work of 
banks a lot easier by increasing the float to such a large amount and 
giving that guarantee. We had to do it to spark small business loans 
activity. It was not happening. What else are we to do? Are we to 
bring back the Bank Act and dictate to the banks to whom they 
should lend money? We cannot do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> We need more banks, more competition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear from 
the Reform Party that we need more banks. I could not agree more. 
We need more competition in the banks. The problem is how we do 
that. If they know of a way or have a formula to create more 
competition for major financial institutions without putting the 
treasury of Canada at any greater risk we would be the first to 
listen. The minister responsible for financial institutions is in the 
House. He would love to hear how to create more competition for 
financial institutions within the framework of ensuring the 
financial exposure of the treasury is not put at greater risk.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The minister responsible for financial institutions is from the 
banking community but he is not from the establishment. He has 
always been a reformer-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> -and a challenger of the 
status quo of banks. He has always been there for small business. 
Speaking of the word reform, a number of us over here are quite 
proud to be called Liberal reformers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16883"> 16883 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we may 
have to stray again from the narrowness of the debate on the 
motion to amend the clause regarding security. Getting back to 
the motion before us, we must recognize that we need some rules 
or guidelines by which security may be varied as the loan is 
reduced. As the hon. member mentioned, it is only prudent after 
a loan has been reduced by a reasonable amount that we may want 
to release some of the security taken to grant the loan such as the 
person's house, car, equipment, office building and everything 
else.
<P>
	These types of comments are appropriate to ensure that the 
financing of small businesses, if they want to raise additional 
capital at a later date, can be accommodated without being ground 
down by inappropriate rules and regulations when the loans have 
been reduced in an orderly fashion.
<P>
	Speaking in a wider context on the bill, I mention again that I 
still do not think the point got across to hon. members opposite. 
They talk about the treasury's involvement as a catalyst for small 
business lending; about not wanting to put the treasury at too much 
risk but nonetheless having a role to play; and about the banks 
perhaps getting off too easy because of the Small Business Loans 
Act.
<P>
	I reiterate that the bill will turn the Small Business Loans Act 
into a no cost service by the government. That strikes me as being 
strange. I cannot really understand the logic of it. The amendments 
to the act will require that borrowers carry the cost. Borrowers will 
have to pay a fee to the banks. The banks will take the fee and pass 
it on to the government. The government will take the money it has 
collected and reimburse the banks for what they have lost. That is 
the end of the line.
<P>
	Who is left with the tab? The borrowers, the guys who are trying 
to create jobs, will be left holding the bill to subsidize those that 
tried but failed, to subsidize the banks that made a wrong decision 
and to let the government off the hook so that it can say what a 
wonderful service it is providing in that $12 billion of loans to 
small business have been guaranteed. Who is paying? It is not the 
government. It is a tax on successful small business borrowers who 
have had to pay an administrative fee in addition to interest to 
subsidize banks and let the government off the hook.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	As I said before, and I will say it again, a dollar in the hands of 
an investor, a businessman or a consumer is far better spent than a 
dollar channelled through a bureaucrat. I cannot think of any 
greater illustration of the bill. It has been designed to fulfil the 
process we are absolutely opposed to. It will channel the money 
through a bureaucrat and back to the private sector at no cost to the 
government. Who ends up paying the bill? It is the private sector. 
The small businessman is being asked to carry an additional loan in 
the name of allowing the  government to take credit for providing 
something it is not providing.
<P>
	I am fully in favour of helping small business. I had an 
accounting business before I became a politician. I served small 
business people in my community. I was a fan and still am a fan of 
small businesses. They are the generators of employment. They are 
the innovators, the creators and the people who see a niche, develop 
it and make money. They are the ones who are the driving force of 
the economy, the ones we depend upon to employ people so that 
taxes can be paid. They are the people who have given us our 
standard of living and our prosperity.
<P>
	Again they are being loaded down with another tax so the 
government can take credit for helping small business. Small 
businesses certainly need a hand. They need to be motivated as 
much as possible. We have to encourage lower taxation and 
encourage them to meet the new challenges because they are the 
ones who ultimately accept the risk. They are the ones who lose 
their life savings, their houses, their businesses and their 
investments; they lose everything. They are the ones who are 
prepared to put their financial lives on the line. Many do and 
unfortunately many fail.
<P>
	As I have also said before and will say again, the cost of 
eliminating failure is equal to the price of success. We cannot have 
a success story without having some failures. Our challenge is to 
try to reduce the failures but we will never eliminate them.
<P>
	If the government thinks by churning money through its books 
the system will be made better, I suggest we have a new method of 
rethinking how we are to motivate society, to live up to the 
challenges of the 21st century, to live up to the global economy, to 
market Canadian expertise and talent around the world and to 
generate an increased gross domestic product which will allow us 
to come to terms with our debt and our deficit.
<P>
	These are the challenges we should be addressing, not the idea of 
smoke and mirrors through the SBLA.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud today to initiate the final stage in the House of 
passing Bill C-107 into law. It is a day which I am pleased has 
come at last.
<P>
	I am grateful for the non-partisan approach taken by parties 
opposite on this bill. The history of the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission has been one of partnership among people of diverse 
political stripes, and I am glad that spirit has continued in the 
House.
<P>
	The tone set in this debate reflects and reinforces all of those 
who across the years and across party lines have joined hands in a 
common cause. That cause is simple: to bring justice to aboriginal 
peoples and certainty to British Columbia.
<P>
	During the course of debate on the bill we have heard the 
historical incidents which have made the legislation necessary. We 
have seen that only a handful of First Nations in British Columbia 
ever signed treaties with the crown. As a result, 124 years after 
becoming a province, the key questions of aboriginal title over land 
and resources remain unresolved, and the majority of British 
Columbia remains subject to outstanding aboriginal land claims. 
With those claims come uncertainty and confusion.
<P>
	We have also seen the historic step taken by the Government of 
British Columbia in 1990 to agree to the negotiation of treaties and 
the subsequent establishment of a task force to make 
recommendations on the process and mandate for treaty 
negotiations. We have heard of the key recommendation of that 
task force: the creation of an arm's length B.C. Treaty 
Commission.
<P>
	Since its creation in 1992 the commission has received 
statements of intent to negotiate from 47 First Nations, 
representing over 70 per cent of First Nations in British Columbia. 
Clearly there was a need for this type of process, a need now being 
met.
<P>
	Today we honour the commitment made by our predecessors to 
establish the commission in legislation. However, the bill is about 
more than just creating a certain status for the commission. It is 
about creating opportunity for all British Columbians.
<P>
	Because the failure to deal with these issues has greatly limited 
opportunity in B.C., the uncertainty over ownership of land and 
resources has exacted a high cost. Uncertainty has meant lost 
investment.
<P>
	The Price Waterhouse study, referenced in second reading 
debate, prepared in 1990 estimated that $1 billion in investment in 
the forestry and mining sectors had not occurred because of 
unresolved land claims.  Three hundred jobs had not been created 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16885"> 16885 </A></B>
<P>
and $125 million in capital investments had not been made. Since 
the time of that study the price has continued to be paid year in and 
year out. It is a price we can no longer afford and it is a price we 
will no longer have to pay.
<P>
	Settling land and resource issues will create an environment for 
investment and increased local economic activity. Therefore I 
commend members from all sides of the House for their support of 
the legislation. Certainty will be good news for the forest worker 
and the miner. Certainty will mean an expanded tax base, as the 
infusion of settlement funds stimulates economic activity and 
creates jobs. Certainty will mean lower social costs associated with 
poverty and unemployment in aboriginal communities. It will 
mean an end of conflict and litigation and the beginning of 
co-operation and negotiation.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	The mandate of the B.C. Treaty Commission is straightforward. 
It is to facilitate, not negotiate, modern day treaties. Its main 
functions are to assess the readiness of parties to negotiate, allocate 
negotiation funding to aboriginal groups, assist parties to obtain 
dispute resolution services and monitor and report on the status of 
negotiations.
<P>
	Because these negotiations will affect all British Columbians, 
we have established a province-wide consultation process so that 
all interests will still be heard.
<P>
	This consultation process, as I indicated at an earlier stage of 
debate, operates at two levels. The first is a 31-member treaty 
negotiation advisory commission, which brings together the 
perspectives of municipalities, business, labour, fishing, wildlife, 
forestry and environmental groups to the treaty making process.
<P>
	The second level brings the diverse interests of the various 
regions of B.C. to bear on the land claims process. Regional 
advisory committees are being struck in each treaty negotiation 
area so that local voices may be heard. These committees work 
directly with federal and provincial negotiating teams.
<P>
	As land claims issues are resolved, the land base and access to 
resources they provide will establish a foundation on which 
aboriginal peoples can build self-sufficient communities. The 
growth of strong, self-reliant, economically vibrant aboriginal 
communities strengthens us all because it will bring positive 
economic spillover into non-aboriginal communities.
<P>
	For too long the aboriginal peoples of British Columbia have 
been denied both their rights from the past and their hopes for the 
future. For too long we have denied ourselves the contributions 
they can make. With the rights and obligations clearly defined by 
treaties, all British Columbians, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, will 
be able to get on with realizing the potential of their  province and 
expanding their opportunities for advancement.
<P>
	On August 10 our government released its approach on the 
inherent right of aboriginal self-government and presented the 
principles which will guide the negotiations. In the case of British 
Columbia, the policy provides that negotiations on 
self-government will take place at the same table as discussions on 
land and resources. In other words, the process and structures 
already in place for treaty negotiations will also be used to 
negotiate self-government issues.
<P>
	These two sets of discussions, self-government on one hand and 
land and resources use on the other, complement each other 
perfectly. Treaties will clarify and define the issues and 
self-government will establish the authority to manage them.
<P>
	What this means is that for the first time the parties will be able 
to have all of their issues dealt with at one table, under one set of 
negotiations. This will be more cost effective, as it eliminates 
overlap and duplication and permits a much more comprehensive 
approach.
<P>
	I spoke earlier of the high cost associated with leaving these 
issues in British Columbia unresolved. If the price is high for the 
general population, for aboriginal peoples it has been yet higher. 
For aboriginal peoples it has meant great hardship and grinding 
poverty. It has meant generations of frustration, of dreams deferred 
and promises unkept. It has meant a quality of life few of us can 
imagine and none of us should accept.
<P>
	Some of those conditions are appalling. Diseases such as 
hepatitis and tuberculosis, virtually eradicated in the 
non-aboriginal population, persist in aboriginal communities. 
Death by fire is three and a half times the non-aboriginal level 
because of unsafe housing and the lack of proper sanitation. 
Aboriginal peoples are more than three times as likely to die a 
violent death and about twice as likely to die before the age of 65. 
The suicide rate among aboriginal peoples is 50 per cent higher 
than non-aboriginal peoples. That difference is even more 
pronounced in the 15 to 25 age group.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	This country simply cannot afford to lose another generation of 
aboriginal peoples able and willing to make their contributions. We 
cannot afford to continue to condemn aboriginal peoples to lesser 
lives in a lesser land.
<P>
	I do not mean to suggest that all of this will be magically solved 
with the passing of this legislation, but it will constitute a true 
beginning. It will take us off the rutted road of confrontation and 
litigation. It will send a signal to all parties that this is how we 
resolve problems in this country.
<P>
	This legislation does several things. It ends uncertainty. It 
honours our obligations. It creates hope for tomorrow.  It also does 
something else, something even more important. It confirms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16886"> 16886 </A></B>
<P>
negotiation over confrontation, consultation over litigation. It 
stands as a vivid reminder of what can be achieved by men and 
women of understanding. It is an eloquent reminder that progress is 
possible, that persistence prevails. It is a testament to the simple 
fact that more can be achieved by joining hands than by shaking 
fists.
<P>
	This must always be our approach, but it is an approach which is 
by no means automatic. It is one we must work to adopt. That is 
why legislation such as this is so important. It creates a process and 
a forum for negotiation.
<P>
	If we fail to demonstrate our resolve to negotiate, we leave the 
field and the resolution to those with little regard for the law to 
those who seek solutions through less democratic and less peaceful 
means.
<P>
	We should not underestimate the historic qualities as well as the 
substantive importance of this bill. To all of those who have fought 
so hard for so long to see it through, I offer my admiration and 
appreciation. I again want to thank this House for its wisdom and 
its support.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise today to speak to Bill C-107 at third 
reading.
<P>
	When this bill was at second reading, I talked about my very 
extraordinary trip to western Canada this year. I visited several 
First Nations in western Canada, including the Nisga'a, the 
Chilcotin and the Carrier-Sekani.
<P>
	I will not go over this trip again, but I think it is important to 
address the situation of the Nisga'a because the current debate on 
the proposed legislation to recognize the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission has some precedents.
<P>
	I think it is worth mentioning that the Nisga'a have succeeded in 
negotiating agreements, probably because of their perseverance 
and determination. They may be the precursors of what is before us 
today, which follows an act of the legislature of British Columbia 
and a resolution of a summit of official representatives of the First 
Nations.
<P>
	All this was achieved, and we must, I think, recognize the 
Nisga'a's commitment to try to negotiate agreements.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	When I visited the Nisga'a last summer, negotiations were 
unfortunately at a standstill and people were somewhat 
discouraged because these negotiations had been going on for 19 
years; people were working very hard to get things moving again.
<P>
	I am happy to see that things are starting to move again. Only 20 
minutes ago, I talked with the chief negotiator, Nelson Leeson, who 
is chairman of the  Nisga'a education committee and their 
negotiator in this matter. They have a negotiation meeting today 
and I will be happy to give the House a progress report on these 
talks.
<P>
	But why spend so much time on the Nisga'a? Of course, they are 
precursors to the process we are reviewing today. But, moreover, 
the Nisga'a hold the key to negotiations in British Columbia. Most 
of the First Nations I met with last summer told me, ``You know, 
Mr. Bachand, if the Nisga'a negotiations do not resume, the other 
nations will be wasting their time. It is useless; we would have no 
faith in the proposed process if we see that 19 years of negotiations 
have failed''.
<P>
	That is why it is important to always start our speeches on the 
British Columbia Treaty Commission by supporting the cause of 
the Nisga'a and what has been done so far.
<P>
	Only 20 minutes ago, I was given a brief update on the 
negotiations. I can report that there does not seem to be a problem 
with self-government for instance. Ninety-eight per cent of the 
objectives relating to self-government were achieved.
<P>
	A final agreement on self-government is imminent. One 
stumbling block seems to be fisheries, and commercial fisheries in 
particular, because of licensing requirements and, unfortunately, as 
we known, fish stocks are dwindling. Fishing licences have been 
issued and licensing authorities are looking into the possibility of 
transferring a number of them to first nations. As we speak, there is 
a bit of a problem there.
<P>
	This matter has not yet been settled for good. Another major 
problem is the apparent lack of firm offers concerning land claims. 
Many difficulties emerged regarding land claims. I will explain in a 
moment. At times, B.C. columnists even suggested that it made no 
sense, as first nations ended up claiming 125 per cent of the 
territory because of overlap. So, there is a great deal of qualifying 
to do there.
<P>
	I think that both provincial and federal authorities might be 
afraid of giving up too much land. All of this needs to be put in 
perspective. That is how negotiations go; it is better to start by 
asking for a little more rather than less.
<P>
	The Nisga'as are one case where, as I will explain in a moment 
also, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that they indeed had 
title to all the lands they claimed. As we will see in a moment, the 
Nisga'as are claiming self-government and title over only 8 per 
cent of their claim site and certain things already granted by the 
Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	I felt it was important to open the debate on the Nisga'a case. In 
British Columbia, there are some 200 reserves. There is a very rich 
aboriginal culture in that province, with 200 native reserves or 
communities and eight language groups. In addition, aboriginal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16887"> 16887 </A></B>
<P>
people who  share common interests often get together in groups 
known as regional councils or band councils. There are nearly 30 
such aboriginal councils.
<P>
	This goes to show that aboriginal culture is pervasive and very 
strong in British Columbia. It came as a surprise to me. We are not 
used to seeing every second store on main street a native one, as is 
the case in Vancouver for instance.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	This shows how predominant the aboriginal culture is in that part 
of the country. It is important to do a bit of history here. At one 
time, that region was one of the most populated on the American 
continent. Europeans settled there 140 years ago. Yet, and unlike in 
other parts of the country, only 15 agreements were signed during 
that period in western Canada.
<P>
	Fourteen of these treaties relate to Vancouver Island. They were 
signed by the Hudson's Bay Company. These are 
pre-Confederation treaties, dating back to before 1867. The only 
post-Confederation treaty is Treaty No. 8, signed in 1899. In 
central Canada, treaties were numbered from one to ten. Only one 
of these treaties, namely Treaty No. 8, relates to British Columbia 
and part of Alberta.
<P>
	Treaties were also signed elsewhere in Canada, including some 
in Quebec, such as the Murray treaty, as well as other important 
ones. However, it seems that, during those 140 years, people tried 
to avoid negotiating anything in western Canada. They did not wish 
to recognize the contribution of aboriginal peoples to the European 
culture. They did not want to negotiate,so they just ignored the 
issue. Ultimately, that approach brought about more serious 
problems. Indeed, problems do not go away if you bury your head 
in the sand or ignore them.
<P>
	It is important to keep that historical context in mind. Over time, 
some changes were made.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Nisga'as helped clear the road to 
negotiation. The Calder case was probably instrumental in the 
negotiation of territorial claims. At the time, in 1973, that decision 
was hailed as a victory for aboriginals since the Supreme Court 
confirmed their claim on aboriginal titles.
<P>
	Following that decision, the federal government came to the 
conclusion that, since the Supreme Court had ruled that the claims 
on aboriginal titles were valid, it might as well start negotiating. 
Negotiations slowly got underway and the Nisga'as were the first 
ones to participate in the process.
<P>
	There were other historic advances in terms of aboriginal values 
and culture and negotiations with aboriginal peoples, including the 
patriation of the Constitution in 1982, and I am referring to the 
often quoted section 35 which contains some recognition and  
affirmation of the existence of aboriginal, Inuit and Metis rights 
and treaties.
<P>
	Of course there were other judgments that point out that a treaty 
is not necessarily a contract as we know it. It is not necessarily a 
document bearing the signatures of Europeans and aboriginal 
peoples. In many cases the oral aspect of treaties is recognized. 
This is not to say that aboriginal peoples were illiterate, because 
that is not the case. They had their own language, their own 
linguistic roots, but the language of the white man was not like 
theirs, and so when they had to sign a treaty, they would say: ``We 
agree; let us have a verbal agreement, since we cannot sign in your 
language, the way you sign''.
<P>
	For me it would be like signing a contract with the Inuit. I do not 
know whether you ever saw Inuktitut, but I would not know what I 
was signing, and I think that is what happened at the time. The 
courts in their wisdom judged that treaties have a certain oral 
value; it is not only the signature that counts.
<P>
	So in 1982 this was recognized by section 35 of the Constitution. 
In 1989, political action was stepped up, especially in British 
Columbia. It was decided to create a Department of Indian Affairs. 
This was quite a step. The government had no one who was 
responsible for conducting negotiations with the aboriginal people, 
although the problem had been around for 100 or 120 years.
<P>
	In 1989, they really started to tackle the problem in British 
Columbia by establishing the Department of Indian Affairs.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Premier of the province appointed a Premier's 
council for aboriginal affairs. So there was a new awareness 
following all the legal discussions and the problems generated by a 
failure to negotiate, problems that were becoming increasingly 
obvious. A decision was finally made to sit down and deal with the 
matter once and for all.
<P>
	The cabinet urged the provincial government to change its past 
policies. In 1989, the Premier's council told the government: 
``Listen, we have to change our attitude and our perception of 
negotiating which is 120 years old and which has meant we simply 
ignored the problems''. So they sat down and started to settle land 
claims. At that point they set up a task force which I see as the 
predecessor of the commission we are discussing today. They set 
up a task force whose members identified the need to conclude 
creative and far-sighted treaties with the First Nations, the 
provincial government and the federal government.
<P>
	The treaties had to include three parties: the First Nations, the 
federal government with its fiduciary responsibility for the First 
Nations, and the provincial government, because it was often on 
provincial land that the federal government exercised powers in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16888"> 16888 </A></B>
<P>
areas that  were the responsibility of the province. The report called 
for a new partnership to recognize the importance of Canada's 
natives and First Nations, based on voluntary, properly conducted 
talks in which the natives, the province and the federal 
governments would negotiate as equals.
<P>
	The agreement in principle between the three parties I referred to 
earlier-the federal government, the province and the First 
Nations-was signed in September 1992. The legal entity 
empowered to sign for the First Nations is called the summit. This 
agreement implements the 19 recommendations made by the task 
force, including Recommendation No. 3. That is why I referred to it 
as a precedent earlier.
<P>
	Recommendation No. 3 of the task force was to form a British 
Columbia treaty commission, which was done. The agreement also 
outlined the commission's role, mandate and operation. The 
purpose of Bill C-107 is to establish this commission on a legal 
basis. On May 26, 1993, the province followed up by tabling a 
proposal to create the commission. It has already passed an act to 
that effect. As for the First Nations Summit, it has already ratified 
the proposal through a recommendation signed by summit 
participants.
<P>
	The parties were willing to go ahead. The only thing missing was 
the federal legislation before us today, which, I hope, will be 
passed as soon as possible, although some of the work has already 
started. I think it is important for the House to adopt this legislation 
once and for all, to prove that the third signatory to these 
agreements, the federal government, is acting properly, and that is 
the purpose of the bill before us today.
<P>
	So why should we negotiate treaties? I think that we should put 
things in their historical context. Commissioners have pointed out 
that, if the role of treaties and their historical context were 
explained clearly to B.C. residents, they would be much more open 
to the land claim settlement process. In my introduction, I talked 
about overlapping land claims covering 125 per cent of the 
territory.
<P>
	Just the same, there are individuals who are, in my opinion, 
adding fuel to the fire in B.C. right now by saying: ``Look, we 
cannot give the natives the whole thing''. I must stress the fact that 
this is an initial bargaining position. I believe the provincial 
government promised to reply: ``Look, we cannot give you more 
than 5 per cent of the land. We shall see''.
<P>
	In other words, the federal government's opening position is five 
per cent, as opposed to 125 per cent for the First Nations. As usual 
in any negotiation they will settle somewhere in the middle. For the 
time being, I think that what matters is that the government sit 
across the First Nations at the negotiation table, listen to what they 
are asking for and see what we can offer. That is when negotiations 
are most valuable.
<P>
	It is also very important that treaties be negotiated to prevent 
challenge strategies. Events like those that took place at Gustafsen
<P>
Lake or, in Quebec, at Oka and Kanesatake, must not be allowed to 
happen again if it can at all be helped.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	It is therefore important that indications be given that the legal 
dispute and tangle can soon be resolved once and for all, not by 
force, endless legal controversy or roadblocks, but rather through 
negotiation.
<P>
	At present, in B.C., there are even non-native groups who are 
quite familiar with the negotiation process and are siding with the 
natives to force the appropriate authorities to reach agreements 
once and for all, in the hope of avoiding unfortunate incidents such 
as roadblocks and illegal land occupation, which often lead to 
disaster and crystallization in relations between natives and 
non-natives.
<P>
	Why negotiate treaties? To avoid confrontation and promote a 
peaceful settlement around negotiation tables.
<P>
	In that context, the role of the commission is to facilitate the 
negotiation of treaties. It does not participate directly in 
negotiations, but, if they stall, it must step in, try to sort out the 
problem and basically act like a mediator by bringing parties 
together.
<P>
	The commission is made up of five commissioners. This is 
important. Two of these commissioners are appointed by the First 
Nations Summit. This is almost a majority, since one 
commissioner is appointed by the federal government and one by 
the provincial government, while the chief commissioner is 
selected by these four commissioners. The chief commissioner will 
be selected because of his expertise and may often be an aboriginal 
who has a great deal of knowledge regarding treaty negotiations. 
Consequently, aboriginals will have a strong representation.
<P>
	The commission approves the participation of first nations and 
organizes an initial meeting between the parties. I will try to 
explain this six-stage process and discuss it at length later. It is 
interesting to note that, when the parties meet for the first time, 
traditional ceremonies often take place. This helps government 
officials become acquainted with aboriginal culture. It is also a way 
for aboriginals to show that there is no animosity. Their culture 
includes certain traditions which are quite fascinating. Often, 
inviting someone to a traditional ceremony is a gift, as well as an 
indication of the open-mindedness of aboriginal people. Such 
ceremonies are common procedure during initial meetings.
<P>
	The commission then puts in place the structures that will ensure 
smooth negotiations. Obviously, the commission has certain tools 
available to it. It can provide loans and contributions to first 
nations. That program is funded by both levels of government. The  
commission also provides expertise to solve disputes and ensure 
progress in the negotiations. This is more or less the role of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16889"> 16889 </A></B>
<P>
mediator to which I alluded earlier. Finally, the commission acts as 
keeper of the process.
<P>
	It goes without saying that it does not participate in treaty 
negotiations. None of the commissioners sits at the negotiating 
table with a nation which has opted to use the BC Treaty 
Commission process.
<P>
	The Commission is also required to produce annual reports. 
According to the first report, apparently, 42 first nations, groups or 
tribal councils have indicated a desire to establish negotiations. It 
should be pointed out that the Nisga'a will not fall under the 
commission's jurisdiction, because both levels of government have 
agreed that the negotiations had been long underway. Because they 
were so far advanced, there was no question of their being started 
over again or integrated at the stage they had reached. The decision 
was made to move ahead.
<P>
	I have already told you what stage the negotiations had reached. 
The aboriginal nations of British Columbia breathed a great sigh of 
relief to see that the negotiations with the Nisga'a are moving 
forward.
<P>
	Before I begin to talk about the six distinct steps in the process, I 
must also point out the optional nature of the process. In other 
words, a BC nation can decide not to make use of this negotiating 
mechanism but to explore other paths. To date, however, it seems 
that the first nations are greeting the process with a great deal of 
approval and are readily integrating themselves into the process.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The first step of the process is to file a statement of intent to 
negotiate. The First Nation concerned identifies itself, the people it 
will represent, its geographic area, and the territory it claims as its 
ancestral land. It appoints a resource person with whom the two 
levels of government will get in touch. Often, the important thing 
in negotiations is to know who to contact in case there is a hitch or 
if further details are required. In the first step of the process, it is 
clearly specified that the First Nations must meet these conditions.
<P>
	The second step consists in preparing for negotiations. A first 
meeting must be held within 45 days of the first contact. As I 
pointed out earlier, this first meeting is usually held on the 
ancestral land. It starts with a traditional ceremony to which the 
negotiators and the various observers involved are invited.
<P>
	At this stage, the First Nation is asked to appoint a negotiator 
with a full and specific mandate. It must get resources from the 
commission, adopt a ratification process, and identify the 
substantive and procedural issues to be negotiated.
<P>
	Another very important point is that it must identify and file its 
claims on its ancestral lands. Reference was  made earlier to 
overlapping aboriginal land claims. Negotiating first nations are 
required to consult neighbouring nations to make sure that their 
land claim does not encroach on other nations' claims. It is 
important that this be done early on, and negotiations cannot 
resume as long as this requirement is not met.
<P>
	Governments must also consult non-natives and ensure that 
appropriate information is gathered. This too is important in my 
view because all the people living on a first nation's ancestral lands 
are not necessarily native people. There may also be non-natives, 
European families who, in many cases, settled there many decades 
ago, perhaps 120 years ago, sometimes at the very beginning of the 
colony.
<P>
	There people feel rather insecure. That is why this is so 
important. At this stage of the game, commissioners should be 
consulting non-natives and gathering information to be prepared to 
answer any question that may come their way.
<P>
	Once the commission is satisfied that the three parties to the 
negotiations meet the requirements, negotiations on the master 
agreement begin. Stage 3 is the negotiation of a master agreement. 
At this stage negotiation goals and objectives are set and a time 
frame suggested, but of all the negotiations under way none have 
gone further than stage 3.
<P>
	In fact, none of the 42 first nations I mentioned earlier, who are 
taking part in the process, have gone past stage 3. The closest one is 
the Nisga'a. Earlier today, I spoke to Chief Leeson, who told me 
that they hope to sign an agreement in principle before Christmas. 
Although such an agreement would not be binding, they hope to 
have it. Even though this is an unusual process, some form of 
negotiations existed before. The Nisga'a are now at the agreement 
in principle stage, and they hope to have such an agreement before 
Christmas. We all hope that they do.
<P>
	Negotiating an agreement in principle means negotiating 
substantive issues. For example, it means finalizing the agreements 
on self-government and territorial claims, defining the real basis of 
the treaty that will follow, and discussing what is to be included in 
that treaty. This all takes place at stage 4.
<P>
	Stage 5 involves the negotiations to finalize a treaty. This is the 
stage at which a treaty officializes the content of the agreement in 
principle. All that was agreed to is finally put together and 
confirmed in a treaty. Following that stage, the treaty is signed and 
officially ratified.
<P>
	Stage 6 is, of course, the implementation of the final treaty.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I must mention here a criticism that was made. Some aboriginal 
nations told me that, indeed, negotiation, and not confrontation, 
was the way of the future. However,  given this series of stages and 
the fact that it took 19 years for the Nisga'a to reach stage four, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16890"> 16890 </A></B>
<P>
some think that setting up the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission is a delaying tactic.
<P>
	That criticism must be pointed out. I share that concern, to some 
extent. However, it seems to me that the investment made in 
establishing that commission is worth it, both in terms of time and 
ideas put forward. I think this is better than letting each community 
in British Columbia, and there are 200, progress at its own pace, 
which would hardly be conducive to orderly negotiations. Some 
people might use this as an excuse to say: Listen, next door they are 
getting nowhere fast and the same here, so we do not want to 
negotiate any more.
<P>
	In this way the process is more uniform. Perhaps it will take a 
little longer, but I think it is worth it and time will tell us we were 
right. Treaties will be signed on a peaceful basis, and I think the 
confrontation that has existed in British Columbia for 120 years 
will finally disappear. Time will tell us we were right and that 
negotiating is more important than protests.
<P>
	Of the 43 First Nations participating in the process today, 14 
have finished stage one. Seven have finished stage two and are now 
negotiating a framework agreement, 11 have basically finished 
stage two; according to the commissioners, these 18 First Nations 
are expected to reach stage four by 1995-96.
<P>
	The process is picking up speed, and it is a process that is 
supported by the First Nations and will become fully operational in 
the months to come.
<P>
	No group has yet finished stage four. I also want to say that the 
First Nations have my full support. If they ever reach an impasse, 
in a democracy, in the House of Commons, there is an official 
opposition, and I want to take this opportunity to tell people, and I 
admit it has happened before, that when negotiations reach an 
impasse, the First Nations of British Columbia can count on my 
full support. I could intervene within the limits set in a democracy, 
by going to the minister or the provincial authorities to ensure 
negotiations are successful.
<P>
	Incidentally, I also looked up some recommendations the 
commission made in its annual report, which I feel are important.
<P>
	The first recommendation made by the commissioners is that 
federal legislation should be passed and federal and provincial laws 
ratified as soon as possible to give the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission the status of a corporate entity. That is what we are 
doing today. The commission will be recognized as a corporate 
entity once we have passed Bill C-107.
<P>
	The second recommendation is also very important. The 
commissioners recommend that the parties to the agreement and 
the negotiating parties continue to make every effort to ensure that 
the public is better informed  and that the parties to the agreement 
are more involved in educating the public. Any initiative in this 
respect is to take place at the provincial, regional and local levels.
<P>
	This is one thing the Nisga'a pointed out to me the last time I 
was there. They told me it was important to get a lot more 
information out to the public, because there are people whose 
interests do not coincide with those of the First Nations and who, as 
I said earlier, were fanning the flames of controversy. They claim 
that land claims cover 125 per cent of the province, that aboriginal 
people want all the land, and so forth.
<P>
	The Nisga'a saw to it that their part of the contract was fulfilled, 
that is to say they informed non aboriginals and the population in 
general of the appropriate nature of their claims, of the 
appropriateness of dealing with them on the same footing. I think 
they did just that. But from what I know about the process to date, 
the federal and provincial governments have not made much 
progress in raising public awareness of the relevancy of the process 
I explained just now.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	If the process is properly explained and the people of British 
Columbia can be confident that the aboriginal people do not pose a 
threat, this should speed up the process, preparing the ground for 
negotiation.
<P>
	It is important to acknowledge that, if the climate for 
negotiations is propitious, the process progresses a lot better than if 
it is tense and government officials are told, ``Now listen, we 
cannot go too fast because our people are not all that much in 
favour''.
<P>
	It is very important for this public awareness to be, not just 
maintained, but stepped up, particularly by governments.
<P>
	Another recommendation which struck me, and I feel I must 
raise it here, is that the Government of Canada and the Government 
of British Columbia use all methods of consultation available to 
them to let the community as a whole know that it has been 
understood and its concerns taken into account.
<P>
	My colleague has just spoken of a degree of uncertainty. There 
are all kinds of companies out there and what struck me on my last 
trip was the speed with which natural resources are being taken out 
of the area. It is as if the companies on these ancestral lands said: 
``We are in a race, because once these lands are transferred to the 
native people, we will not be able to continue our present 
operations''.
<P>
	I saw up to 500 logging trucks a day coming off Chilcotin, 
Nisga'a and Carrier-Sekani land. That really impressed me. It 
really disappointed me as well, and I even mentioned it to the 
Premier of British Columbia and to the Minister of Indian Affairs. 
To my mind, those forests were being clear cut and would have a 
hard time  recovering. Moreover, for the trees coming out of B.C. 
of late, no money is going to the first nations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16891"> 16891 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems to me, that the whole question of natural resource 
development could be included in the upcoming treaty discussions. 
In fact, we are looking into the possibility of joint management in 
the House standing committee. We will therefore conclude our 
work, but, in the meantime, I think it important to point out to the 
principal groups developing natural resources, particularly, that 
there is no danger, in our opinion.
<P>
	The taxes they currently pay to develop these resources could be 
paid to the native peoples rather than to the provincial or federal 
governments. This is the sort of discussion being held, and I think it 
important that these financial groups be part of the process and not 
consider negotiations on these ancestral lands as a threat to their 
business. The entire community must know this as must the special 
interest groups.
<P>
	In conclusion-I see my time is just about up-our objective is 
to put an end to 140 years of injustice. We are very lucky that the 
first nations have this mentality of sharing. You know that, when 
the Europeans appeared, regardless of where in Canada they 
appeared, the native peoples always said: ``Look, the land belongs 
to everyone, so let us share it together''.
<P>
	We have been lucky up to now to have the use of this land, but I 
think an injustice has been done to the native peoples in their being 
confined to small reserves with few natural resources and not 
enough of a land base to enable them to take control of their lives.
<P>
	The extent of their dependency is rather outrageous, in my 
opinion, because they are always depending on government grants. 
This means they are unable to really fly on their own and to take 
control of their lives. I think the process before us today will enable 
them to take off. We are lucky, as I said earlier, that they have 
agreed to share this land with us without violent challenges. We 
have had some of late, but they have to stop. We cannot have them.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The most logical and sure way to avoid any reoccurrences of 
such unfortunate situations is the process of negotiation before us.
<P>
	So let us avoid roadblocks and events such as at Gustafsen Lake 
and Oka. Let us exchange aggression and argument for discussion 
and negotiation.
<P>
	I wish the first nations of British Columbia good luck. The Bloc 
Quebecois will support Bill C-107.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak on Bill C-107, an act respecting the 
establishment of the B.C. Treaty Commission.
<P>
	I noticed at the beginning of the previous speaker's speech he 
talked quite a bit about the Nisga'a negotiations. I would like to 
point out that the Nisga'a negotiations are not part of the B.C. 
treaty process under the B.C. Treaty Commission as they predate it 
and are not subject to the same terms of reference.
<P>
	There has been a high degree of increased public awareness of 
the ramifications of the B.C. treaty negotiations in the last two 
years in British Columbia. It has now risen to be the number one 
issue in the public mind in British Columbia.
<P>
	The opposition political parties at the provincial level are 
adopting treaty policies very different from what has gone on up 
until now and very different from the federal government. There 
are concerns about the costs and the length of time the negotiations 
are going to be taking. There are concerns regarding the negotiating 
mandate of the two senior levels of government. There are also 
concerns regarding the consultation and ratification process for any 
negotiated treaties.
<P>
	As we talked about the Nisga'a agreement earlier, this is a 
precedent setting agreement outside of the B.C. treaty process and 
at this point it will not necessarily be adopted by an incoming B.C. 
government. We are in the circumstance of having a government 
that is currently in the last year of its mandate and the other two 
major parties vying for government have made that statement.
<P>
	Against this backdrop of a precedent setting negotiation which 
has largely been cloaked in secrecy and mystery, that is the Nisga'a 
negotiations, we do have this B.C. treaty process. The terms of 
reference for the Nisga'a negotiations certainly allow for a much 
greater degree of openness than has been demonstrated to date. In 
an overall context, this is not a good start.
<P>
	Some of the history of the B.C. Treaty Commission is that in 
December 1991 British Columbia accepted all the 
recommendations of a task force. Those recommendations led to 
Canada and B.C. beginning formal negotiations on the roles and 
responsibilities of the two governments within treaty negotiations, 
including cost sharing. This was culminated in March 1992.
<P>
	In September 1992, Canada, B.C. and the First Nations Summit 
leadership formally supported the establishment of a B.C. treaty 
commission and signed a B.C. treaty commission agreement. In 
April 1993 commissioners were appointed on an interim basis by 
provincial and federal orders in council and by First Nations 
Summit resolution.
<P>
	In May 1993 the provincial legislation received royal assent 
which was pending federal legislation. The Governments of 
Canada and British Columbia then successfully concluded cost 
sharing negotiations in June 1993. This allowed for the treaty 
commission to open its doors in December 1993.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16892"> 16892 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Virtually all of these actions, save the very last, occurred prior to 
the last federal election in October 1993.
<P>
	Currently an estimated 77 per cent of the British Columbia bands 
are involved and signed up in this process. There are 196 bands in 
British Columbia. As I mentioned earlier, the Nishga negotiations 
are completely outside of the B.C. treaty process. All the remaining 
bands in British Columbia that are not a part of the B.C. treaty 
process have no option: they either go with the B.C. treaty process 
or there is no other negotiating option for them. Those are the terms 
of reference. This is problematic for those 23 per cent of B.C. 
bands that have concerns and do not want to enter into the process.
<P>
	There is one major omission, which is not mandated by the act, 
by Bill C-107, which we are discussing today, and that is the 
consultation process. There has been a separate set of agreements. 
In July 1993 the federal and provincial governments announced the 
establishment of a 31-member treaty negotiation advisory 
committee to advise ministers in the treaty negotiations. That 
committee is not referred to in any way, shape, or form in Bill 
C-107; it has no recognition. In addition, regional advisory 
committees are being struck in each treaty negotiation area to 
represent local interests. There is much unhappiness about the 
consultation process and about the ratification process at this time.
<P>
	I would like to point out that in the term of this 35th Parliament 
we have had previous legislation dealing with aboriginal issues. We 
have had the Yukon self-government and land claims agreements. 
We have had the Sahtu agreement in the western Arctic. We have 
had the Pictou Landing compensation agreement in Nova Scotia for 
environmental damage at the reserve level. We have had the Split 
Lake compensation agreement in Manitoba. And now we have this 
enabling legislation, which has been very late in following the 
provincial legislation and the agreement.
<P>
	The reason I mentioned all of that is because each of these bills, 
every piece of aboriginal legislation that has come before the 
House in this 35th Parliament, predates the last federal election in 
terms of when the agreements were reached. There has not been 
one piece of legislation from this department in this Parliament.
<P>
	In preparing to look at Bill C-107, one of the necessary steps is 
to talk to legislative counsel. Legislative counsel advises that no 
legislative changes are possible to Bill C-107 because neither the 
federal nor provincial governments can make unilateral changes, 
and the B.C. Treaty Commission agreement, the tripartite 
agreement between the federal, provincial, and First Nations 
Summit, which was signed in September 1992, and also the 
provincial enabling legislation override the ability to make 
changes. The only way a change could be made is if  those 
agreements were also changed. This is really a reverse onus on this 
Parliament in many respects.
<P>
	I have some concerns about this bill, many of which are quite 
basic. Who would enter into an agreement in which there is no 
satisfactory amending clause? Who would enter into an agreement 
in which there is no satisfactory cancellation clause? In both cases 
this bill comes up lacking. The agreement leads one to assume a 
lot.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	If a band enters into the process, it receives funding that is 80 per 
cent repayable upon completion of negotiations. In effect, they are 
being given a loan to set off against the eventual settlement 
package. The agreement is silent in terms of what happens to these 
moneys should the band or the tribal council not complete 
negotiations. The act is also silent about those bands that do not 
enter into the process and may not want to enter into the process. 
There is no alternative open to them.
<P>
	The First Nations Summit organization and their appointment of 
representatives is open to any band, whether they are participating 
or not. I find this a little strange. It is a very fluid thing. They are 
not elected. It is very difficult to pin down. And the compensation 
packages for the summit commissioners have no transparency 
whatsoever in terms of the arrangements for these appointments or 
the compensation for these appointments.
<P>
	Clause 22 of the proposed act states that nothing in the act 
prevents the three parties from amending the agreement of 
September 1992. I mentioned this earlier. This is very problematic, 
because this very agreement has been shown to compromise 
Parliament's ability to amend the very act we are being asked to 
pass at third reading. Therefore this is an unacceptable reverse 
onus, in my view.
<P>
	I have other concerns. The municipal level of government is not 
recognized in the act. They are simply a sidebar arrangement 
through the provincial negotiators. Also, funding of recognized 
interests beyond the bands is not addressed in the act. There is 
$15.3 million a year going into funding of the aboriginal 
negotiating parties. Right now, through the provincial government 
the municipalities are receiving $250,000 per year. They have 
many concerns about that.
<P>
	From their meeting last month, the Union of B.C. Municipalities 
is certainly expressing great displeasure about what this process 
has done. They have a responsibility to take part to represent their 
interests. They have no choice but to get involved, because they are 
very much impacted. The ten regional groups that now represent 
municipal interests in the treaty talks are capped at a $250,000 
funding level. According to the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16893"> 16893 </A></B>
<P>
municipalities are  having to fund this thing out of local taxpayer 
funds to make up the difference.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments have spent more than 
$30 million on the negotiations since they began in 1993. Some of 
the municipalities in the lower mainland have competing 
aboriginal claims. Rather than having to deal with one set of 
claims, they have to deal with multiple claims over the same piece 
of ground. This is becoming very expensive for the municipalities. 
It is an unfair burden and one that should be addressed in this bill. 
The bill is silent on the municipal role.
<P>
	There is no reference in the bill to readiness guidelines for the 
regional advisory committees. They are not in the terms of 
reference of the B.C. Treaty Commission. This has proven to be 
very problematic as well.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	We have readiness guidelines for the other parties, but not for the 
advisory groups at the local level. Because the readiness guidelines 
are not there, there is a tendency for senior governments and the 
negotiating parties to set a few people in place at the local level and 
then carry on with negotiations. As the keeper of the process, the 
B.C. Treaty Commission should have terms of reference that also 
include readiness guidelines for the consultation groups. That is not 
addressed. It is not there. And because it is not there this is not 
happening.
<P>
	It was identified in the 1993 and 1994 B.C. Treaty Commission 
annual reports that there was no federal enabling legislation for the 
B.C. Treaty Commission. As as result, the B.C. Treaty Commission 
had major concerns. I asked what the reason was for the lengthy 
delay in bringing forth the federal legislation. Apparently it is 
related to summit concerns over the wording of one clause in the 
bill. I have to ask, how can one party's concern over one clause 
hang up or protract this legislation for more than two years?
<P>
	The province has negotiated interim agreements, which have 
compromised the B.C. Treaty Commission process. The B.C. 
Treaty Commission made that statement in its 1993 annual report. 
The bill does not empower the B.C. Treaty Commission to deal 
with that kind of concern.
<P>
	In summary, Canada and British Columbia have budgeted $77.6 
million over the period from 1994-95 to 1997-98 to the process. 
Given the weaknesses inherent in the bill, I will not be able to 
support the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to 
join in the third reading debate on Bill C-107, an act respecting the 
establishment of the B.C. Treaty Commission. It is helpful to have 
the co-operation of the opposition members in support of the bill.
<P>
	The events of the last few months, whether in B.C. or elsewhere, 
are convincing that issues of aboriginal rights and land claims can 
only be resolved through negotiation. It is very important to get on 
with the process. The sooner we can get the land claims settled, the 
faster we can get on with economic development and other 
government issues.
<P>
	I want to talk about the process upon which we have embarked in 
British Columbia and also about the importance of the economic 
development aspects, which need to coincide with this process, and 
the role in particular, in view of my position as Secretary of State 
for Science, Research and Development, of science and technology 
in promoting economic development for First Nations people.
<P>
	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
recently visited British Columbia several times, the latest being 
November 24. During the summer he met with the First Nations 
Summit to report on the inherent right of self-government policy 
and he formally signed two of the four framework agreements. The 
signing of framework agreements with the Champagne and 
Aishihik, the Sechelt and the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en First Nations 
are visible examples of the benefits and results of resolving these 
issues through negotiation.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Many other First Nations are working on framework agreement 
negotiations or completing the readiness stage. The government is 
committed to moving negotiations to conclusion rather than 
pursuing endless negotiations. That is evident from these recently 
signed agreements.
<P>
	About 140 of the almost 200 B.C. First Nations want to sit at the 
table with federal and provincial governments to solve these issues. 
That represents over 70 per cent of the First Nations of British 
Columbia. Of the 47 nations in the process 25 have completed the 
readiness requirements. In 12 of those the 2 governments have also 
met our readiness requirements and 9 have completed or are 
working on framework agreements.
<P>
	Clearly this process deserves the support of the House so that it 
can continue toward its goal of reaching acceptable, affordable and 
fair settlements.
<P>
	It is important to note that we need fair settlements for all British 
Columbians and for all Canadians. That is the basis on which we 
must work.
<P>
	It is important that third party interests be well taken care of in 
this process and indeed they are being taken care of. The British 
Columbia Treaty Commission process is the product of extensive 
consultations. In 1990 the federal and provincial governments 
established a task force to come up with a made in British 
Columbia approach to map out a negotiation process that could 
accommodate the many First Nations in British Columbia that 
wanted to negotiate settlements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16894"> 16894 </A></B>
<P>
	The recommendations of the task force were accepted by both 
governments and the representatives of the First Nations. One of 
the key recommendations was the establishment of the British 
Columbia Treaty Commission as an independent keeper of the 
process.
<P>
	The task force also made several recommendations on public 
information and education as well as on consultation. The members 
recognize that treaty negotiations will succeed if both aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal communities understand why we need treaties 
and what those treaties mean.
<P>
	As the negotiations for framework agreements proceed, 
governments must obtain background information on the 
communities, people and interests likely to be affected by the 
negotiations and establish mechanisms for consultation with 
non-aboriginal interests. These are among the criteria the treaty 
commission considers when it assesses the readiness of the parties 
to begin working toward a framework agreement.
<P>
	In other words the commission will not give the green light to 
negotiate unless proper consultation mechanisms are in place. 
There is already a province-wide treaty negotiation advisory 
committee which my colleague spoke of but for each claim 
regional and even local committees are established, and these 
committees are becoming more and more active as parties move 
into the framework negotiations.
<P>
	To date there are advisory committees up and running in 
Bulkley-Skeena, in Lilloolet-Pemberton, Westbank-Kelowna, the 
Lower Mainland, on Southeast Vancouver island, the west coast of 
Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast.
<P>
	Regional advisory committees are also being formed in Central 
Cariboo, Kitimat-Skeena, Central Coast, the Desolation Sound area 
and in the Prince George and Nechako Valley. Clearly third party 
interests are a central part of the treaty making process in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	It seems the demands of some to halt the negotiation process 
seem aimed at avoiding the issue rather than finding workable and 
honourable agreements.
<P>
	The government remains firmly committed to negotiating 
treaties with First Nations across Canada where needed. We will 
stay focused on that objective because it is the only way 
uncertainty can be ended and all British Columbians can benefit.
<P>
	I will speak for a few minutes on the importance of this process 
in going forward in economic development and in particular in the 
potential in the area of science and technology and 
telecommunications for economic development for First Nations 
people in British Columbia and elsewhere.
<P>
	It is important we get through this process, that we sort out the 
settlements and finalize the situation. It is  also important that we 
start building the economic framework and in particular the 
telecommunications. The telecommunications, the information 
highway infrastructure which the government has promoted from 
the moment we were elected is vitally important for communities 
in rural and remote regions of Canada and particularly for First 
Nations communities.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	As we outlined early on in our mandate, this information 
highway infrastructure is essential for jobs and learning in rural 
areas. It is essential we move quickly in areas of access and it is 
fundamentally important that we move quickly in developing 
Canadian content. We need aboriginal First Nation content so First 
Nations people are not only receivers but providers of content in an 
increasingly important way.
<P>
	One major effort we have made is in the SchoolNet process. This 
process is one to which we are committed to ensure that schools in 
all First Nations communities are linked to SchoolNet and to the 
Internet and can join the information highway as one important 
step not only in learning but in community development as we have 
moved into the community access program.
<P>
	In British Columbia there are some important advantages in 
technology becoming available with ATM networks giving broad 
band, multimedia access on the information highway.
<P>
	As recently as last week I was in British Columbia to announce 
the establishment of the telelearning network centre of excellence, 
linking communities across Canada and centred at Simon Fraser 
University. The development of teaching materials on the 
information highway using the worldwide web and other 
multimedia tools will enable delivery of learning and jobs at a 
distance.
<P>
	In this context it is important to realize a big change is occurring. 
Universities like Simon Fraser are already putting courses on to the 
worldwide web so they can be taken from anywhere around the 
world. In a few years a number of courses will be dramatically 
increased and therefore the possibility of taking courses and 
learning materials from anywhere in Canada, from any First 
Nations community in Canada, will be there and realized.
<P>
	The people at Simon Fraser are already working on the 
possibility of having all courses on the worldwide web by the year 
2000. If that happens, what a remarkable achievement and what 
important new access to learning and post-secondary education it 
would give to people across Canada.
<P>
	There is another side to the question. Even as the learning 
material becomes more available it is now more possible and more 
important to develop learning materials based in and coming from 
the First Nations people of Canada. This is also an important 
objective of the SchoolNet program and an important objective of  
economic development, to enable teaching materials to be shared 
from one First Nations community to another to develop content 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16895"> 16895 </A></B>
<P>
and learning materials which can be very important as cultural 
expression for First Nations people into the next century.
<P>
	As we proceed in settling land claims, providing the framework, 
it is also important we proceed with economic development, with 
the information highway so that it will allow people across the 
country and particularly First Nations people access to the 
information they need when they need it and where they need it.
<P>
	This will allow better management of natural resources and a 
remarkable new array of economic development opportunities and 
jobs, particularly in remote locations, as is already starting to 
happen in small communities in northern British Columbia and 
remote communities in Newfoundland, setting up businesses on the 
information highway and worldwide web and to operate around the 
world.
<P>
	It is a very different world from what we have lived in, one 
fundamental reason it is important to move quickly to settle land 
claims so we can move forward in development, learning and in 
new possibilities.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	I urge my hon. colleagues to show support for this process, 
which will bring certainty to the province of British Columbia and 
renewed hope and prosperity to the people of British Columbia and 
particularly First Nations' people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to my hon. colleague's 
comments. He said the whole business of the Indian question and 
what to do about land claims, self-government and these types of 
issues will be resolved only through negotiation.
<P>
	That is true. That is something we can all agree on. But if that is 
true, why have so many of the Indian bands in British Columbia 
either backed away from this process or not participated to begin 
with?
<P>
	One of the reasons we are opposed to this treaty process is that 
the only examples we can see are the ones history has taught us. 
Treaties enshrine special rights. They enshrine racism because 
certain rights are attributed to one group of Canadians based solely 
on their race.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes the ultimate goal of any negotiations, 
as the hon. member said and I agree, is we must get to the point at 
which we can negotiate an end to these issues and put them to rest. 
The end goal must be the equality of all Canadian citizens, not 
further inequality, not enshrining inequality in agreements.
<P>
	Another point is the finality. We believe on this side of the House 
these must be final agreements. They must bring about 
extinguishment of special rights and they must be final.
<P>
	Once again when we look at history and at what happened with 
the settlements in the northern territories, we do not see that 
finality. Rather, there are clauses in those agreements whereby any 
future negotiations that bring about benefits south of 60 could also 
accrue to those bands that have already completed negotiations in 
the territories. We do not have finality. Canadians do not know 
what the final bill will be.
<P>
	One of the reasons the Charlottetown accord was defeated was 
the ambiguity of the Indian questions. In other words, what did 
native self-government really mean? How would it come about?
<P>
	I heard my hon. colleague putting forward the Reform 
perspective that what we need is a very clear definition of whether 
self-government will be based on a municipal model or some third 
level of government. These are the types of questions Canadians 
want answered.
<P>
	Where is the involvement of the third party during these 
negotiations, private landowners? There are a whole bunch of 
questions not answered and not adequately addressed by this treaty 
negotiation process presently underway and which this bill would 
enshrine.
<P>
	In a constituent survey in my spring householder I asked a 
number of questions on native land claims because I wanted 
feedback from the citizens of Prince George-Peace River. The 
first question was: Does government have an obligation to 
negotiate modern day treaties with natives?
<P>
	This is exactly what we are talking about today with this bill. It is 
interesting that although the returns were low, the sample size was 
low, of the more than 500 people who returned the questionnaire 
two to one voted no. They said we are not obligated to negotiate 
treaties.
<P>
	For that reason and the others I outlined I will be joining with my 
Reform colleagues in opposition to this bill.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me rise to reply to the questions 
raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	It is fundamental that we have a process of negotiation. It is also 
important that we have a framework so that there are not 200 
separate processes going on simultaneously in British Columbia. 
We need a framework in which we can negotiate with British 
Columbia First Nations in order to move this process forward as 
rapidly as possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16896"> 16896 </A></B>
<P>
	More than 70 per cent of the First Nations in British Columbia 
are involved in the process. Therefore, the concern that huge 
numbers will be left out will likely be  mitigated. We will see what 
happens as we proceed further.
<P>
	On the question of finality, in the end the process on which we 
are embarked will have an outcome which gives much greater 
certainty than we have at the moment. As a result of this process, 
we will be able to give important consideration to the situation in 
British Columbia for a stable and good future for both First Nations 
people and non-First Nations people and that will be a building 
block on which all British Columbians will benefit in the long run.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I seem 
to be the only one who would like to participate in this debate with 
the hon. member.
<P>
	I take exception to the point the member made that he believes 
this process will bring greater stability and certainty for British 
Columbia. That is certainly not what I have seen. I am not opposed 
to negotiations if they lead to the type of agreements that all of us 
and the vast majority of Canadians can ultimately support. My 
great concern and the concerns expressed to me all of the time from 
my constituents is that these processes are not doing that. They are 
driving a further wedge between the Indian people and Canadians 
at large.
<P>
	A great concern of mine is that we are not bringing about finality 
or extinguishment of special rights. We are just further enshrining 
them.
<P>
	Sometimes I question and am questioned as to whether we are 
really addressing the concerns of the average Indian in this country 
who in many cases is living in poverty on reserves. Or, are we 
really addressing the concerns of the Indian leadership which in 
many cases is vastly different from the primary concerns of the 
individual Indian?
<P>
	It is estimated that combined provincial and federal spending is 
between $7 billion and $9 billion a year on Indian programs. When 
I travel to the reserves in my constituency, which, I am assured by 
colleagues in the House, are not that much unlike other 
constituencies, I see very few examples of where that money is 
being spent on the reserves.
<P>
	I really question whether this process is the best way to address 
the concerns of the average native in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two quick comments in reply.
<P>
	First, if the member is trying to suggest that we should go back 
and start all over again, I think we have made a lot of progress. We 
have a process which has been agreed to by the federal government, 
the provincial government and more than 70 per cent of the First 
Nations in British Columbia. It is a reasonable basis for proceeding 
and I believe we should proceed.
<P>
	Second, when I spoke I deliberately talked about economic 
development, the information highway and the changing things 
that are coming. These are also very important in making sure that 
individuals and communities have the benefit of the changing 
times in order to move forward and progress to a better 21st 
century.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-107, an act 
respecting the B.C. Treaty Commission.
<P>
	The aboriginal people tragically form some of the lowest 
socioeconomic groups within Canada, a first world nation. Indeed 
the incidence of violence, sexual abuse, crime, infant mortality, 
suicide, substance abuse and unemployment are among the highest 
of any sector within our country. It is not something our country 
should be proud of, and indeed we are not. That is why we are here 
today, to try to develop some sensible solutions to address these 
tragic problems within our midst.
<P>
	I have seen with tragic frequency these individuals shot, stabbed, 
dying and sometimes dead from other people's hands and tragically 
too often from their own. It is a situation that needs to be addressed. 
It needed to be addressed yesterday but now we have an 
opportunity to do something about it today.
<P>
	The cultural and social genocide which is taking place among the 
aboriginal people has been taking place for decades and continues 
to this day. In part this is due to successive governments that have 
continued in a paternalistic fashion toward the aboriginal people. 
They have had unequal treatment for the aboriginal people. 
Because this treatment is unequal, it is by its very nature racist in 
that we are treating the aboriginal people in a different way. We do 
not treat any other segment of our society that way.
<P>
	The mindset has been to pour successive amounts of money into 
the department of Indian affairs for the aboriginal people. We 
continue to pour money down a black hole. If we look at the results 
of where this money has gone and wonder whether it has really 
gone to help the aboriginal people, if we go to the aboriginal people 
on and off reserve we will see that sadly it has not.
<P>
	By pouring money down this black sinkhole, successive 
governments have created an institutionalized welfare state. If we 
continue to give money to people without them working for it, we 
erode the very soul within the individual. This does not matter if 
the person is an aboriginal or a non-aboriginal. It is a basic human 
characteristic. We cannot keep giving money to people and expect 
them to have pride and self-respect. It is incredibly destructive to 
the soul of a human being. It would happen to anybody, aboriginal 
or non-aboriginal, who is subjected to this.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16897"> 16897 </A></B>
<P>
	It is often said that the aboriginal communities have lost their 
pride and self-respect. Part of the responsibility lies in the fact 
that we have created this institutionalized welfare state, that we 
have continued to support people in this manner. It has done them 
a great disservice. Therefore we see the sad destruction of a 
beautiful culture and beautiful people. A person cannot get pride 
and self-respect by having someone give it to him. That person 
must earn it himself.
<P>
	Essential to this is having the ability to earn the funds to support 
yourself and your family and people. If you can do this, then from 
that you will develop the pride and self-respect in yourself and 
therefore the community around you. That is absolutely 
fundamentally important in my opinion.
<P>
	I spoke with an individual who is responsible for the B.C. treaty 
process in my area. This man was in charge of it. After listening to 
him for one hour on what they were going to do, I asked a very 
simple question: Will the negotiation of these treaties help the 
aboriginal on or off reserve who is part of that lowest 
socioeconomic group I spoke about earlier? He answered that he 
did not know.
<P>
	It is not good enough to pursue a course of trying to help people 
who are suffering from those tragic things I mentioned earlier when 
it is not known that it is going to help anybody. Why are we 
pursuing this course?
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps we are doing this to assuage a guilt complex we have 
from what has gone on historically. If that is the case, I think we 
should end it. It is not respectful to the aboriginal people and it is 
not respectful to us. We have to look forward to a new day, a new 
era, a new age when aboriginal and non-aboriginal people can have 
respect for themselves and each other, when we can all live under 
circumstances that we do not need to be embarrassed about.
<P>
	I have many concerns about the B.C. treaty negotiation process. 
First is the cost. It is going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to 
establish these treaties. Where is the money coming from? All 
levels of government do not have the funds to pay for this. It is a 
simple question for which I would like a simple answer. Where is 
the accountability coming from? These moneys are going to be 
given to groups of people with no accountability whatsoever. 
Accountability must be built into the system.
<P>
	One of the complaints I have is not politically correct to speak 
of. I have spoken to a number of aboriginal people who have come 
to my office complaining that large sums of money given to bands 
by the federal government have disappeared. The money has 
disappeared into the hands of band elders and band leaders. 
Nobody speaks for those aboriginal people who are not in that 
leadership. They need that money and they need it to work for them 
effectively and positively for the future. In too many cases that is 
not occurring.
<P>
	Second, there are a lot of questions surrounding the issue of 
giving the resource management to the aboriginal people. What
<P>
happens to the rights of the non-aboriginal people who also have 
interests in these areas? They talk about crown lands and the fact 
that these areas are going to be given over to aboriginal people. The 
fact remains there are a lot of non-aboriginal people who lease 
these areas from the federal government. What is going to happen 
to them?
<P>
	Also, look at the mismanagement which has taken place in some 
areas where aboriginal people have managed the resources. Look at 
the Stoney Creek reserve where large tracts of land were given out 
for timber rights and huge tracts of land were decimated.
<P>
	Look at the aboriginal fishing strategy on the west coast. The 
AFS has proven to be an unmitigated disaster. An individual's 
racial grouping cannot be used as a licence to trash and destroy a 
resource. Unfortunately part of the responsibility of the decimation 
in the west coast fishery lies at the feet of the aboriginal people. 
There is no question that non-aboriginals have been poaching too. 
However, a significant number of people within the aboriginal 
community have been using the AFS to destroy a precious 
resource.
<P>
	Who speaks for the aboriginal people who are law abiding, who 
respect the resource and who are interested in preserving that 
resource for future generations? Absolutely nobody speaks about 
them. A number of aboriginal people have approached me and said: 
``These aboriginal people are using the AFS for their own gain at 
the expense of us who are trying to manage and use the resource in 
a sustainable fashion''. This has to be said. Where are the 
environmental safeguards that are going to take place when whole 
resources are being taken over and given to a group of people?
<P>
	Third, what are the rights of the non-aboriginal people who live 
near lands that are being given to the aboriginal people? I have 
significant concerns in my own area. Many municipalities have 
mentioned that they have their own municipal plans that deal with 
the future of their area. There are a number of areas that-

of time remaining.

cardiopulmonary resuscitation, better known as CPR.

<P>
	Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Canada 
and the leading cause of death among older women. More than 
60,000 Canadians die every year from heart attacks and strokes.
<P>
	The basic skills of CPR can be learned in as little as four hours, 
yet fewer than 3 per cent of all Canadians can perform it. Therefore 
Health Canada and the Heart and Stroke Foundation, together with 
the Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance, the Canadian Ski 
Patrol, the Royal Lifesaving Society of Canada, and the Advanced 
Coronary Treatment Foundation encourage all Canadians to take 
the time to learn CPR.
<P>
	On behalf of the members of the House, I would like to support 
the initiatives of CPR awareness month and urge all Canadians to 
familiarize themselves with CPR. We should all know that a few 
hours of training could save the life of someone we love.

riding of Yellowhead is home to Canada's royal family of rodeo, 
the Hay family from Mayerthorpe.
<P>
	This family has a long and distinguished career in professional 
rodeo. Fred, the dad of the family, busted broncs until 1983, and his 
son Rod is a four-time Canadian finals rodeo champion. Now his 
brother Denny is continuing the Hay family winning tradition by 
capturing the first ever CFR saddle bronc title in Edmonton 
recently. It was a lifelong dream for Denny to win the national title. 
He began busting broncs when he was just eight years old. Now 
Denny and his brother Rod are off to compete in the national finals 
rodeo in Las Vegas, the only pair of brothers from Canada ever to 
compete in this world class event.
<P>
	I am sure all members will join me in wishing Denny and Rod 
lots of luck when they take on the world's best. Good luck, Denny 
and Rod.

	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of 
the proposals made yesterday by the Prime Minister, Quebecers 
can now see for themselves that the federal government has no 
intention of responding to the legitimate aspirations of the people 
of Quebec.
<P>
	It has become obvious that Ottawa never intended to renew 
federalism, as the proposals which have been put on the table 
amply show. Quebecers will never accept to have the wool pulled 
over their eyes in such a manner, and they will reject these empty 
proposals outright.
<P>
	Quebecers who voted no at the last referendum, but who wanted 
real changes, will be even more disappointed  and will feel 
betrayed once again by a prime minister who could not care less 
about their aspirations. As for those who voted yes, these proposals 
only confirm what they already knew. Ottawa's proposals will 
never meet Quebec's expectations, Quebecers bar none know it full 
well.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
NDP federal caucus calls on the Liberal government to realize that 
it cannot save Canada if it is busy undermining its foundations at 
the same time.
<P>
	Recognizing Quebec's distinct society when the socioeconomic 
and institutional realities that make Canada distinct from the U.S. 
are being harmonized or rationalized out of existence is a tragic 
irony. Talking about vetoes and sovereignty is a cruel joke when we 
have abandoned real control of our lives to the global marketplace 
and the money speculators, not to mention that the veto proposal 
completely misunderstands western Canada and should have 
recognized B.C. as a region. Finally devolution of training as a 
facade for federal offloading and the privatization of labour market 
strategies is further cause for cynicism.
<P>
	The Prime Minister should give Canadians something to believe 
in other than the bottom line mentality and they will be in a better 
frame of mind to deal with what Quebec and the rest of Canada 
need to do to keep Canada united.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week's Campaign 2000 report of a drop in the number of poor 
children in Canada is good news, but there remain nearly 1.4 
million children who do not have the adequate food, shelter, 
clothing, and social environment their peers enjoy.
<P>
	Poverty is a serious threat to the growth, development, and social 
well-being of children and therefore merits the continuing attention 
of all levels of government. Therefore I have introduced a private 
member's motion to encourage the government to create a special 
Canada children's future fund. This is to ensure that the elimination 
of child poverty remains at the forefront of our national agenda 
even during tough economic times.
<P>
	I look forward to the full support of the House. All children 
deserve a secure and stable tomorrow, for they hold in their hands 
the future of our nation.

	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the

the execution of Ogoni playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa by calling on 
the assembled heads of government to speak out with one voice in 
the face of flagrant violations of democratic principles and basic 
tenets of justice.

	Following up actions with words, the Prime Minister pushed for 
an unprecedented suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth 
in the face of its flagrant violation of human rights and yet another 
example of the utter contempt held by General Abacha's regime for 
world opinion.
<P>
	In light of this, I urge my colleagues in the Government of 
Canada to take this condemnation one step further by sending a 
stern message to the Government of Nigeria by cancelling all of its 
oil imports and imposing economic sanctions.
<P>
	In light of these events, the citizens of the world must also send a 
message to multinational companies such as Royal Dutch Shell that 
they are responsible for more than simply maintaining the bottom 
line of their balance sheets. These companies must adopt 
environmental standards for their operations, especially in 
societies where opposition to their operations is repressed.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 17 a group of maritimers met in Truro to discuss the 
concept of economic and political union of the maritime or Atlantic 
provinces.
<P>
	Business people, academics, labour leaders, and even a few 
politicians agreed that union is an old idea, going back to 1807, 
whose time has finally come. We must join together to eliminate 
wasteful duplication and provide lean government with cohesive 
policies for all Atlantic Canadians. We must join together to create 
new economic opportunities for our region and renew a sense of 
pride in our people. We must join together so that our voice is truly 
heard at the national level and our concerns are understood and 
respected.
<P>
	The Truro meeting is only a beginning. An Atlantic union must 
be driven by the people of Atlantic Canada, not the politicians. The 
Prime Minister has shown that Confederation is not static. Changes 
can and must be made to improve the operation of our institutions 
and the quality of life for our people.
<P>
	Opinion polls over the last number of years show that the people 
of Atlantic Canada consistently support union. They are ahead of 
the politicians on this issue now, as  they have been in the past. We 
would serve them poorly if we did not make every effort-

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1982, as a result of the unilateral patriation of 
the Constitution, Quebec lost its veto, a right it had as one of the 
founding nations of Canada. Since them, every Quebec government 
had demanded that the federal government rectify the situation.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister offering us today? Crumbs. A mere 
bill, which could be struck down by the next government, creating 
a regional veto right which completely dilutes Quebec's claims. 
And there is more. It will be possible to amend the Constitution 
through a national referendum and sidestep Quebec's National 
Assembly. This is a far cry from the pre-1982 situation when the 
National Assembly had a constitutional veto right.

Quebecers will be satisfied with mere symbols which bring about 
no change whatsoever?

Americans subsidize their dairy farmers to the tune of $3.6 billion,

managed products. They have asked for a NAFTA panel to rule in 
their favour.
<P>
	If the Americans win, our supply managed farmers will face 
open competition overnight and Canadian dairy and poultry 
producers may be devastated. Two billion dollars' worth of dairy 
quotas will become worthless, thousands of farmers could be 
forced out of business, and many rural communities would be 
severely affected.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of International Trade to be proactive rather 
than reactive and initiate a negotiated settlement, point out the sky 
high American subsidies and offer to reduce some of our tariffs in 
return for subsidy reduction in the United States.

	I ask the government to negotiate, because too much is at stake

many of my constituents, especially in  the districts of Cudworth, 
Wakaw, and Humboldt, regarding pornography.

	I have received many little white ribbons in recognition of 
WRAP week, ``White Ribbons Against Pornography''. The letter I 
received from Lana Reding explains it best. Lana wrote: ``We feel 
that not enough is being done to protect families against abuse and 
pornography, especially our children, who are our future. In our 
church, St. Michael's Parish, we pinned white ribbons on our 
parishioners and they returned them the following week. Also our 
town of Cudworth declared that October 22 to 29 be recognized as 
WRAP week. There is far too much pornography on TV, in 
magazines, and books, exposing our children to sex, violence, and

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister hastily announced measures 
with which he intends to meet his referendum commitments. In 
fact, he is trying to fool the public, but Quebecers will not be fooled 
by these cunningly worded resolutions on the distinct identity of 
Quebec, any more than they will be by the sham veto he proposes.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Considering that 
the cabinet committee on constitutional change only recently 
started its work and that the timeframe for unemployment 
insurance reform has again been changed as a result of his 
statement yesterday, will he acknowledge that his improvised 
announcement is intended to counter increasingly overt criticism of 
his leadership and his failure to deliver the goods?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we acted quickly. I had a text when I spoke to Canadians 
on the Tuesday and Wednesday of the last week before the 
referendum. What I did today was keep the promises I made to the 
Canadian people and especially to the people of Quebec, that is 
take steps to recognize Quebec as a distinct society and ensure that 
in future, there will be no changes in the Constitution without the 
consent of Quebecers.
<P>
	During the past four weeks the committee has had time to review 
everything I mentioned at the time, and that is what I delivered.
<P>
	As for unemployment insurance reform, it will come. The bill 
will be tabled Friday, and the Leader of the Opposition will have all 
the details. However, as we have said on many occasions in this 
House, we decided that we would respect jurisdictions and that 
there was no longer any need for the federal government to be 
directly involved in manpower training programs. We intend to 
make the money available to clients who are our responsibility so 
they can receive these services from their provincial government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps it would be useful to recall that the man who just 
spoke is the main artisan of the forced patriation of the 1982 
Constitution and of the demise of Meech Lake.
<P>
	We know that nearly half of Quebecers supported sovereignty in 
the referendum and that many others voted for a thorough overhaul 
of the federal system. That being the case, what makes the Prime 
Minister think that Quebecers will be satisfied with a mere 
resolution that is meaningless as far as Quebec's distinct identity is 
concerned?

<B><A NAME="16902"> 16902 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Leader of the Opposition feels that a resolution of 
the House of Commons is not enough, he should tell the House 
that as soon as he is premier of Quebec, he will support a 
constitutional amendment recognizing Quebec as a distinct 
society. If he does, I will assume my responsibilities as Prime 
Minister and discuss it with the provincial governments.
<P>
	I am sure that if the Leader of the Opposition wants to entrench 
the concept of distinct society in the Constitution, the provincial 
Premiers will recognize his request. I think we could have a 
constitutional amendment very quickly. It could be done in a matter 
of months.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, </B><B>BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I ever take on the duties referred to by the Prime 
Minister, I would consider it an insult to my position and to 
Quebecers to accept a solution that is unacceptable. Even his ally, 
Mr. Johnson, would refuse.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister expect Quebec to take seriously a 
resolution that falls far short of the proposal in the Charlottetown 
Accord which was rejected in no uncertain terms by Quebecers in 
the 1992 referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I and my party are in favour of recognizing Quebec as a 
society that is distinct because of the French language, the culture 
that is specific to Quebec and the fact that in Quebec we have 
always had a civil code based on the Napoleonic Code. So everyone 
knows this is a fact that can be easily recognized in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	However, today it seems quite clear that the Leader of the 
Opposition is not interested in having Canada recognize Quebec as 
a distinct society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his last 
minute improvised announcement, the Prime Minister remained 
true to himself in proposing to recognize Quebec as a distinct 
society, purely symbolically, through a simple parliamentary 
motion, which will give Quebec neither special status nor 
additional power.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister seriously think he is satisfying 
Quebecers, nearly 50 per cent of whom voted for sovereignty in the 
last referendum, with a simple resolution of the House of 
Commons symbolically recognizing the distinct nature of Quebec 
but without any additional power? Is this not an insult to their

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the insult will come when the Bloc Quebecois 
votes in this House, based on what we see today, against the notion 
of distinct society for Quebec. If the Bloc Quebecois really wants it 
to become a constitutional proposal, they should pressure the future  
head of the Government of Quebec to pass a resolution in the 
Parliament of Quebec, and then we will see it is passed, and 
convince the provinces to pass it.
<P>
	However, if the current Government of Quebec-or the January 
government-does not want Quebec to be a distinct society under 
the Constitution, there is nothing I can do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all 
due respect for the Prime Minister, I have strong doubts that the 
future Premier of Quebec will agree to something Mr. Bourassa 
turned down at the time.
<P>
	After hastily tabling his proposal, without awaiting the report of 
the phoney committee headed by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs and without consulting his partners in English Canada, how 
does the Prime Minister think he will convince Quebecers of the 
seriousness of his actions? Will he admit to badly playing his last 
card, which looks oddly like a two of spades?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can hardly wait for the member for Roberval to rise in 
this House and vote against the distinct society. For the first time 
we have an opportunity to speak clearly, not in the context of a 
thousand things, but on a very clear issue-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> It is a sham.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice): </B>-a very clear issue: Is Quebec 
a distinct society because of its language, its culture and its Civil 
Code?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The Napoleonic Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I am not ashamed to admit I 
know that Quebec's Civil Code dates back to the Napoleonic Code. 
If it offends the Leader of the Opposition, too bad for him. It is a 
fact of history. I can hardly wait to rise in this House and vote for 
Quebec's recognition as a distinct society, and I will watch the 
Leader of the Opposition vote against it, with a smile on my face.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too have reviewed the Prime Minister's November 27 
statement on unity measures and find the lack of content almost 
unbelievable.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	Canadians inside and outside Quebec want fresh thinking. They 
want realism, not symbolism. They want a fundamental change in 
the way the federation operates. Instead the Prime Minister has 
offered them the tired old thinking and formulas for failure that 
doomed the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords and almost 
lost the referendum on October 30.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is this all there is, 
recycled amending formulas, hollow symbolism from failed 
accords and lip service to decentralization? Is this  really the best 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16903"> 16903 </A></B>
<P>
the Prime Minister of Canada can offer on the subject of national 
unity?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made a speech in Montreal that was very clear. It was in 
written form and I am pleased the leader of the third party read it. It 
is exactly what I promised.
<P>
	I said that the Quebec people because of their language, culture 
and the civil code are different from the rest of Canada. I have no 
problem with that.
<P>
	I am offering a possibility for the rest of Canada to have 
something to say in the evolution of Canada as proposed by the 
leader of the third party who talked about regions in his document 
called ``New Confederation'' and said that all regions were entitled 
to equal status in constitutional negotiations. That is exactly what 
we offered the four regions of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> We will 
have a lot more to say on that tomorrow, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The contents of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords were 
flawed because the process for developing the contents were 
flawed. Meech Lake and Charlottetown were top down, closed 
door, politician driven approaches to change which failed to carry 
the judgment of Canadians because Canadians were not involved.
<P>
	Yet in coming up with this package the Prime Minister has not 
only ignored the lessons of Meech Lake and Charlottetown. He has 
taken a huge step backward. He involved fewer Canadians in 
developing this Quebec package than the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown gang did in theirs.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister following any recognized process at all, or 
is he just making this stuff up as he goes along? If there is a 
process, why is there no meaningful role in the process for the 
provinces or the people of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made some commitments in Montreal on behalf of the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	Perhaps the leader of the third party does not agree with what I 
said. Of course it was at a time when he was offering subsidies for 
Quebecers to move out of Quebec. That was his solution to national 
unity.
<P>
	We want to fulfil our commitments and get back very quickly to 
dealing with the real problems of the country: jobs and growth. 
However, because the leader of the third party cannot attack the 
government on the substance of the operation of the nation, he 
would like to discuss the Constitution around the country. That is 
not our intention. It is to deal with the economy and job creation 
and dispose of these commitments within weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister ignores questions about the lack of 
content in his package. He ignores questions about the flawed 
process. Maybe he will answer a  question about the strategy 
behind the package, which is bizarre to say the least.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has apparently decided to build a case for 
national unity on the concept of distinct society and a constitutional 
veto, two areas where there is little public or provincial support. He 
has chosen to ignore the one area where there is a real desire for 
change both inside and outside Quebec, namely the realignment of 
federal and provincial powers.
<P>
	Is the symbolic tinkering with manpower training the 
government's only response to Canadians' demand for a major 
realignment of federal-provincial powers? Is that all there is?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the announcement I made on manpower training 
yesterday there was a very big move of clarification. It is a 
complaint that was mentioned by all the premiers over the last two 
years. However, we had to wait for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who will soon be tabling his bill on the 
reforms to the unemployment insurance program, before 
suggesting any reforms in that field.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	I have discussed the strategy with the premiers and with this 
caucus. I know the Reform Party's position on this strategy is 
exactly the same as that of the Bloc Quebecois.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in an 
attempt to enlist the support of the premiers in English Canada, the 
Prime Minister was forced to render Quebec's recognition as a 
distinct society meaningless, so as not to violate the principle of 
equality for the provinces.
<P>
	This is so true that the so-called right of veto was offered to all 
regions of Canada, while responsibility over manpower training, 
which has yet to be defined, will be offered to every province.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister recognize that he was forced to render 
Quebec's recognition as a distinct society both meaningless and 
useless, so as to make it acceptable to the rest of Canada, which is 
so attached to the principle of equality for the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make it clear to the hon. member that the Prime 
Minister represents all Canadians, not just English-speaking 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16904"> 16904 </A></B>
<P>
	I also want to tell him that Quebecers rejected the very 
ambiguous separatist proposal. Now his party must comply with 
the will of the people, which means it must work within Canada.
<P>
	As for the regional veto proposal, it was accepted by all 
Canadian premiers a long time ago. It makes perfect sense to me 
that Ontario, with 40 per cent of the country's population, should 
get such a veto, as well as two provinces representing a majority in 
western Canada, and likewise in eastern Canada. Such a proposal 
does not belittle anyone.
<P>
	I think that, in Canada, we must all co-operate, and this is what 
we are proposing to do with this offer. I can see the despondency of 
Bloc Quebecois members who are about to vote against a distinct 
society status for the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Prime Minister put the whole burden of the proof on the 
back of the Quebec government, considering that the premiers of 
British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba have serious reservations 
about his proposal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member just criticized me for trying to propose a 
regional veto, because some provinces would like a veto for each 
and every province.
<P>
	What we have done was to impose on the federal government a 
technique to use our own veto right. If Quebec no longer has a veto 
right as it thought it had once, it is because the PQ government of 
the time opted for a formula different from the Victoria proposal 
and, in doing so, eliminated the veto right that Quebec was seeking.
<P>
	I can understand the despair of Bloc Quebecois members, who 
can see that we are solving two problems at once, in that we are 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, while also taking action to 
prevent any constitutional change without Quebec's consent. This 
is a commitment that all members of this House will soon be 
making. It will quite something to see the Bloc member oppose a 
motion seeking to make it possible for Quebec to have a veto right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1992 both the Liberal Party and the Reform Party fought for 
national referendums on constitutional change. The current Prime 
Minister was successful in having the Liberal Party pass a 
resolution that stated: ``The Liberal Party of Canada stands for the 
principle that the Constitution belongs first to the people and that 
the people must have a say in how the Constitution is changed''.
<P>
	Why then has the Prime Minister, instead of giving the people of 
Canada a say through a national referendum, decided the 
legislative assemblies, the direct notice of government and 
provincial governments can have a veto over federal constitutional 
change?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not at the stage of changing the Constitution. We 
are saying we are changing the way we, the federal government, 
will use our veto powers.
<P>
	The House of Commons has a veto power. We say which way we 
will use it. The Constitution remains the same. The amending 
formula is the same and there is no proposition at this time to 
change the Constitution.
<P>
	If the Government of Quebec were to say it is willing to change 
the Constitution to have a distinct society, as it is written in the 
Constitution at this time, we must have the consent of seven 
provinces, representing 50 per cent of the population.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question was not answered. Why has the federal government not 
given the people of Canada a say in these kinds of changes through 
a national referendum on its own ratification?
<P>
	I point out to the Prime Minister that we asked him this question 
about his Verdun speech on November 1. The Prime Minister said 
to the leader of the Reform Party: ``The hon. leader of the third 
party should take time to read my speech. I said it would be a veto 
for the people of Quebec''.
<P>
	Since the people of Quebec voted against separation, why has the 
Prime Minister turned around and instead of giving the people a 
veto, given a veto to the future premier of Quebec, the separatist 
Leader of the Opposition?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the Reform Party there is a reality. Is the Government 
of Quebec a legitimate government? Like the government of any 
other province it as been elected and I have to respect that reality.
<P>
	I would rather have another government, which would be 
possible the day the Reform Party supports this party rather than 
supporting the Bloc Quebecois in the House all the time.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
immediately following the Prime Minister of Canada's 
announcement, the provinces of Canada voiced reservations on 
both the so-called right of veto and the scope of resolution on the 
distinct character of Quebec. It was obvious that the premiers of 
English Canada had not been forewarned of this initiative by the 
federal government.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister have the gall to present his 
initiatives of yesterday as the end result of his referendum promises 
when, immediately following his  announcement, a number of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16905"> 16905 </A></B>
<P>
provinces in English Canada, including British Columbia and 
Alberta, voiced serious reservations about the federal plan?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fact that they have reservations does not mean I spoke 
to them. I am simply saying that I made commitments in my 
capacity as Prime Minister during the referendum campaign, 
saying that I would deliver the goods. I have said that, in the past, I 
and my party have recognized Quebec as a distinct society and that 
we would recognize it as such in the future. That is what we shall 
do in the very near future.
<P>
	We are taking steps, and that is the commitment I have made, not 
to change the Canadian Constitution without the consent of 
Quebec. There will be legislation on this, in Parliament. I am most 
anxious to see how the critic will vote, whether she will vote 
against the decision of this Parliament not to change the 
Constitution without the consent of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand that the Prime Minister, as he did in 1980 following 
the referendum, is in the process of acting unilaterally, attempting 
to present not only Quebec but the other provinces as well with a 
done deal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am working within the federal jurisdiction. I am the 
Prime Minister of Canada. I invite the members of this Parliament 
to make a decision on the distinct society and on the right of veto 
for the four regions of Canada, within the capacities of this 
Parliament. There is nothing mysterious in that.
<P>
	We, the members, are the ones who will all have to make up our 
minds a few days from now. When everyone has voted, then it will 
be a done deal, yes. The members of this Parliament, the large 
majority, thanks to the Liberal Party of which I am the leader, will 
have voted in favour of a distinct society and to ensure that the veto 
will be shared with the four regions of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is creating a cloud of confusion on the 
issue of a constitutional veto. Could he clarify for the benefit of his 
own members, as well as ours, exactly what he means when he 
talks about giving a veto to Quebec? Is he talking about giving a 
veto to the Government of Quebec or is he talking about giving a 
veto to the people of Quebec through a constitutional referendum? 
Will he make it crystal clear what he means?
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I mean that the people of Quebec have a parliament and an 
assembly where they have people  elected. They will vote, just like 
the people of Alberta will vote, through the members of their 
legislature.
<P>
	We say it is a desire of the House that we not proceed without the 
approval of the four regions of Canada, as the hon. member is 
asking in his program to recognize the four regions of Canada. 
Quebec will vote on that. There might be a referendum, there might 
not be a referendum, but under the Constitution when we amend the 
Constitution it is always by a resolution of a legislative assembly 
and the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us get this straight. When the Prime Minister talks 
about giving a veto to Quebec he has just said that what he means is 
giving a veto to the Government of Quebec. Will he confirm that in 
other words he is proposing to give the separatist government of 
Quebec a constitutional veto over the Constitution of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have never seen so little respect for democracy in my 
life.
<P>
	We are giving a veto. The veto is ours. We say we will not 
impose on the people of Quebec or the people of Canada an 
amendment to the Constitution that does not have the consensus of 
Quebec, Ontario, the west and the east. This Parliament will decide 
and we will establish the conditions.
<P>
	However, we have this notion that suddenly a great friend of the 
leader of the third party is the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. They 
used to have breakfast together; now we see them in the same bed. 
Now to see him disappear is a bit disappointing. The reality is there 
is a legitimate government in Quebec and it exists according to the 
Constitution of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, through his initiative announced yesterday, the Prime 
Minister is offering Quebec a mere resolution of this House, in 
which the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society is simply a 
symbolic recognition of an actual situation. They are telling 
Quebec that it is distinct but, in fact, this changes nothing in terms 
of power.

resolution will give Quebec no special status or additional powers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society should 
eventually be enshrined in the Canadian Constitution, and the 
courts will interpret it as they see fit. We in the government cannot 
make decisions that are up to the courts. For the moment we have 
instructed the Canadian Parliament, the executive branch of 
Canada's  government, to take this reality into account. This is

already spoken with the provinces and, as I said yesterday, I am 
sure that, if the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois want 
recognition as a distinct society to be enshrined in the Constitution, 
the provinces will be happy to oblige, because, like me, they want 
Quebec to remain a part of Canada.

<P>
	Does the Prime Minister share the opinion of his Minister of

to save Canada, to the effect that the proposed recognition as a 
distinct society does not in itself involve new powers for Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what has always surprised me is that all PQ members in 
the National Assembly voted against Meech. Every last one of 
them.
<P>
	It happened when the Leader of the Opposition decided to turn 
his back on his friend, the then Prime Minister, to oppose the 
Meech Lake agreement. I myself was not even a member of this 
House at the time, so I do not know why I am being blamed for so 
many things. Of course, it is easy to make accusations. The hon. 
member should ask Mr. Parizeau and the other PQ members then 
sitting in the National Assembly why they voted against Meech.
<P>

the consistent support she has given to making the tax system more 
efficient and fair over the last two years.
<P>
	In fact, it is two years ago this week that I announced a series of 
major initiatives to attack the underground economy. They are 
specifically: more co-operation with the provinces, including 
agreements on exchange of information; more co-operation with 
industry associations, again with respect to information and also 
assistance in our efforts; more service for ordinary Canadian 
taxpayers; more publicity for people who unfortunately break the 
law. I am happy to say these have resulted in substantial 
improvements on the revenue side. Over those two years these

	The sum total of this Prime Minister's consultation process was 
this: an interim report from the national unity dream team; a couple

<P>
	The Prime Minister's style is often likened to that of Louis St. 
Laurent but I think Louis XIV maybe is more like it. The Prime 
Minister did not consult with Canadians. He did not consult with 
the premiers. He did not even properly consult with his own caucus 
who are watching this show today before announcing the Quebec 
package. They know it and we know it. They have been talking to 
us. What is worse is that the government does not trust the 
Canadian people to give them the final word on these measures.

Commons on its proposals? Will it then give the Canadian people a 
direct and final say on the Quebec package?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

on behalf of all Canadians one week before the referendum to do 
something. This is extremely important after what the Canadian 
people said at that time. Thousands of Canadians came from across

remain in Confederation. They want to keep this country together.

Reform Party would acknowledge and receive. At the same time, 
we would want to do that in full consenting agreement with the 
provinces. We want to work with the provinces because we share 
one fundamental objective which is to help people get back to work 
and be employed.
<P>
	I hope that when the hon. member's leader becomes the next 
leader in the Government of Quebec he is prepared to live up to his 
commitment which is to get away from any of these other 
discussions and focus on the question of jobs. If he is prepared to 
focus on jobs so are we and we think we can work together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that 
the government says it will keep the money, that it will, in fact, not 
transfer any responsibility, and that it will continue to control the 
content, standards and results, how can it call its initiative a 
decentralization? There is a contradiction here between the 
statements and the facts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is so full of 
misinformation and contradiction. It really is quite remarkable and 
amazing how one person can be so wrong so many times.
<P>
	The reality is that we said we want to find additional resources to 
help people get back to work. The whole point of putting this in the 
context of a major fundamental restructuring of the entire 
employment insurance program is to find the resources to help 
people get to work and to work with the provinces, communities 
and businesses to make that happen.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	The problem is that the hon. member is not interested in getting 
people back to work. She is simply interested in dealing with a 
bunch of abstract constitutional issues. More important, she simply 
wants separation. She does not want employment for people in 
Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
insist upon an answer to the questions I asked earlier in question 
period.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows that the provinces of Canada already 
have a say in constitutional change through the amending formula. 
The people of Canada do not have a say. The Prime Minister has 
promised repeatedly over the past three years to give the people a 
say through referenda on constitutional change. Why is he backing 
down on his promise to have national referenda on constitutional 
change?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not very complicated. A vote will be held in the 
House of Commons as quickly as possible. We will then return to 
our work on jobs and growth. It will be easy. We will vote and then 
we will return to the real problems of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
Prime Minister wanted to have a real agenda on jobs and growth he 
should have presented one instead of presenting the bill on 
constitutional change.
<P>
	The people of Quebec voted against separation. The Government 
of Quebec is ignoring those results and continuing to pursue 
separation. Why is the Prime Minister in bed with the separatists 
promising them a veto on constitutional change instead of the 
people of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not want Canadians to suffer further discussions, 
committee hearings, commissions and referenda on every little 
comma in the Constitution. They do not want to hear about it.
<P>
	I understand that the Reform Party is confused. Reformers want 
to talk about it because their own agenda for the politics of Canada 
has gone down the tube. Let them boil in their own juices.
<P>
	The vote on the Constitution will be held very soon. After that 
we will be addressing other very important problems. On Friday we 
will table a very important reform with respect to jobs and growth. 
I hope that the Reform Party, rather than asking questions, will vote 
for it so that Canadians can benefit from the program in the near 
future.

	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Today the hon. member for Skeena stars in an advertisement on 
the government's proposed fishing licence fees. How does the 
minister respond to allegations  that licence fees are being applied 
in a racist manner and that the Canada Oceans Act proposes the use 
of politically appointed boards to manage the fishery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is true. Half-page ads at $7,700 per ad have been 
taken out to support the Reform Party policy on the fishery, 
pondering up visions of the federal government being engaged in a 
``racist based fishery''.
<P>
	I have in my hand a copy of a letter written to the hon. member

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Right Hon. Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and everyone else will know that the western 
part of Canada is made up of two very distinct regions: the prairies 
of western Canada and the province of British Columbia, which is 
the third largest province in Canada. It is a province with a distinct 
history, a distinct geography and a distinct economy.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	In determining the regional veto powers, why did the Prime 
Minister ignore the people of British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are giving people of British Columbia more power 
than they have now. Because they represent 47 per cent of the 
population of the west, we are giving them a lot of power when we 
talk about the number of people.
<P>
	If the NDP government of British Columbia were not blocking 
people coming into British Columbia who want to move there 
because some might be on welfare, which is against the law of 
mobility in Canada, very soon B.C. would have more than 50 per 
cent of the population in the west. Then it would have its own veto.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BRITISHCOLUMBIATREATYCOMMISSIONACT">BRITISH COLUMBIA TREATY COMMISSION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-107, an act 
respecting the establishment of the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission, as reported (without amendment) from the 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was speaking about the aspects of the rights of 
non-aboriginal peoples living in areas adjacent to areas where land 
claims are currently under negotiation.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	There are some very grave concerns in my riding of 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca and other western communities about 
what happens when a municipality in the future puts forth a 10 or 
15-year plan for the surrounding area and another group working 
independently within its midst is able to completely change the 
entire demographic of that area? This is but an example taking 
place all across the country. Nowhere among these treaty rights is it 
stated what the rights of non-aboriginal peoples are in areas 
adjacent to the treaty areas.
<P>
	Furthermore, a lot of these negotiations are taking place behind 
closed doors and away from the eyes of the people who will be 
affected by the decisions made by both the provincial and federal 
levels of government.
<P>
	It is grossly iniquitous that these decisions and negotiations take 
place behind closed doors, in private and in camera. They must be 
made full knowledge to the public. It is the aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals who will be affected by these treaty negotiations. 
Therefore that has to be built into these negotiations but it is not.
<P>
	More than 50 per cent of aboriginal people live off reserve. How 
do these treaty negotiations affect those individuals living off 
reserve? Many aboriginal peoples living in urban areas suffer tragic 
levels of substance abuse, violence and sexual abuse. It is tragic to 
see the lives these individuals endure.
<P>
	I ask those here in the House how these negotiations actually 
affect the lives of these people? How does it improve their lives to 
be able to dig themselves out of the sad situations they have found 
themselves in? How does this give them the ability to stand on their 
own two feet and take care of themselves? I have never heard an 
explanation to this question regardless of whom I asked who was 
involved in the treaty negotiations.
<P>
	It is fundamental for any person, aboriginal or non-aboriginal, to 
take care of themselves that they have the skills to do this. One of 
the roles of government can be to provide these skills and 
opportunities to enable people to take care of themselves.
<P>
	I wonder if these land claims will actually do that. I cannot see 
that happening. For many of the people the earning power they 
would require to earn money and fulfill the lifestyle they require 
simply cannot be done on many of the areas being claimed today.
<P>
	We support good skills training for aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals alike. We support good social programs where 
accountability has been built into the system. We support social 
programs that address good counselling for the people who are 
suffering. We support the elimination of the Indian Act, a 
paternalistic and racist act.
<P>
	Above all, if there is one principle that should override 
everything, it is equality for all people. If we do not have equality 
for all of us how can we have equality for any of us? It is 
fundamental that we approach these negotiations with that 
fundamental principle in mind. It is something that Canada and 
Canadians have stood for through their entire history and 
something that Canadians have died for to give us that right today. I 
hope we do not abrogate that responsibility to our past by engaging 
in activities that make sure some people are more equal than others.
<P>
	We support the hereditary activity of aboriginal peoples: the 
hunting, fishing and trapping under the treaty negotiations taking 
place. It is a fundamental right of the aboriginal peoples. However, 
we do not support utilizing those hereditary rights to be 
manipulated in such a way that would enable resources to be 
destroyed.
<P>
	We support self-government for aboriginal people but at a 
municipal level. At a municipal level it gives them, as it gives all of 
us, the ability and right to determine destinies as individuals and as 
groups.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	We cannot have completely autonomous states. That would 
result in the balkanization of Canada. The worst case scenario is 
that we have hundreds of small, autonomous non-functional states. 
That is the ultimate possibility that exists in these treaty 
negotiations. It is important that we recognize this idea is fallacious 
and cannot occur.
<P>
	Everyone in the House wants to ensure the tragic situation that 
many aboriginal people find themselves in is changed now. They 
cry for help. It is a cry of desperation that must be answered.
<P>
	It does not work to treat individuals in a paternalistic fashion. 
They must be treated in the same fashion as we would treat 
anybody else, as equals. We must provide these people with the 
skills and ability to stand on their own two feet. By doing this they 
would develop pride within themselves, pride in their communities 
and pride between people.
<P>
	If we can do this we would go a long way toward developing a 
more peaceful, tolerant society between  aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals. Sadly the course that has been taken, rather than 
bringing people together is causing deep divisions and rifts 
between aborigi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16910"> 16910 </A></B>
<P>
nals and non-aboriginals. This is sad because there is much that can 
be learned from all of our cultures. The aboriginal culture is a 
beautiful culture and we need to learn much from it.
<P>
	It is time we moved ahead toward a new era of respect for others, 
respect for ourselves and equal treatment for all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to oppose Bill C-107, an act to 
establish the British Columbia Treaty Commission.
<P>
	Bill C-107 is a fine piece of legislative engineering in theory. 
The is are dotted and the <I>t</I>s are crossed. It has been translated in 
both official languages. It has been printed and distributed in 
incomprehensible legalese. However, there are three important 
issues that call this legislation into question. First, 23 per cent of 
the Indian nations are not involved, which constitutes 31,682 
individuals.
<P>
	Second, the public at large, which constitutes the majority of 
British Columbians, 3 million people, is left out of the 
negotiations. There is no room for its input into the process, nor are 
there provisions for a grassroots referendum of all British 
Columbians to ratify any negotiations. These two issues must be 
addressed. They are vital to the continued well-being of the people 
and the economy of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	Third, no substantive amendments can be made to help correct 
the above mentioned deficiencies in this legislation.
<P>
	Let us look at each one of these points. Twenty-three per cent of 
the B.C. Indian nations are not in the B.C. Treaty Commission 
process. These include the Okanagan Tribal Council, consisting of 
Indian bands from Osoyoos, Penticton, Upper and Lower 
Similkameen and Okanagan, and the Upper and Lower Nicola 
Indian bands and the Nicola Valley Tribal Council.
<P>
	In other words, the Indians in my riding do not recognize the 
B.C. Treaty Commission as facilitators of land claims. The Indians 
within the Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt riding have been 
actively stepping outside the law to attempt to claim jurisdiction 
over land.
<P>
	Currently they are threatening violence over the Green Mountain 
Road. They have been digging trenches along the road and are 
wearing camouflage fatigues in true Oka and Gustafsen Lake style. 
This form of confrontation is not new to the Indians in my riding. 
Over the past couple of years numerous incidents such as the Apex 
ski resort blockade have shown that formal civil negotiations  
outlined as the duties of the B.C. Treaty Commission are redundant 
and irrelevant to the Indians in my riding.
<P>
	Currently they are in court fighting the B.C. government over 
ownership of Green Mountain Road. They say they will enforce a 
blockade of the road, win or lose. They claim they are willing to 
fight and die for this road. The rest of my constituents feel the same 
way the Indians do. In a survey conducted over the summer, 72 per 
cent of those responding were opposed to the continuation of the 
B.C. treaty process.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	This fall I approached the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development a number of times to encourage him to 
come to Penticton to help resolve this situation. On October 23 I 
wrote the minister on humanitarian grounds to tell him that a 
dispute between the B.C. government and the Penticton Indians 
was escalating. A roadblock was being threatened. In the letter I 
asked him to go to Penticton on October 28, not as a negotiator, not 
as a mediator, but as a sign of good faith to the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to try to get these people back 
to the negotiating table.
<P>
	I did not receive a letter or a response from the Minister of 
Indian Affairs until today, November 28. He said that it would be 
inappropriate for him to become involved, despite the effect this 
dispute is having on the communities in my riding. He said he will 
leave it to the province to negotiate with the Penticton Indian 
bands.
<P>
	This is pure nonsense. This is pure balderdash. The abdication of 
the constitutional responsibility by this government, which is 
responsible for Indians and land reserved to Indians, is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	To make matters worse, today I also find out that the Minister of 
Indian Affairs this past weekend was in Kamloops, a three-hour 
drive from Penticton. The minister did not even have the courtesy 
to talk to the mayor of Penticton, to the Penticton Indian band, or to 
any of the provincial people in the area. This again is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I have a letter from the minister to the mayor of Penticton dated 
August 21, 1995. In the letter he makes it clear that this road is still 
federal property, not the property of the province or the Indian 
band. So why will the minister not get involved? The Minister of 
Indian Affairs is running out of excuses, and he always has them.
<P>
	When there is a roadblock up, he says he will not come to 
Penticton when there is a roadblock up. When the roadblock is 
down, he says he will not come to Penticton when there is nothing 
to talk about because there are no roadblocks. When there is a court 
case going on, the Minister of Indian Affairs says he will not come 
to Penticton because there is a court case going on. But when there 
is no court case on the table, the minister still refuses to come to 
Penticton and talk to the people and get the negotiation back on the 
tracks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16911"> 16911 </A></B>
<P>
	The only thing I have not heard from this minister is that he 
cannot come to Penticton because he has to go to the parliamentary 
dining room for a sandwich. I do expect I will get that excuse as 
well.
<P>
	The third problem with Bill C-107 is that the Reform Party 
would like to make a number of amendments on behalf of their 
constituents. I can bring to the table two deficiencies, which I have 
previously spoken about. One example that comes to mind would 
be an amendment to make the Union of British Columbia 
Municipalities a fourth negotiating power alongside the federal 
government, the B.C. government, and the B.C. summit. This 
would provide a forum for the interests and concerns of millions of 
British Columbians excluded from the current process.
<P>
	With such a large proportion of B.C. territory up for grabs, the 
interests and concerns of the grassroots British Columbians must 
be heard and must be addressed.
<P>
	Making an amendment of this nature is impossible. Bill C-107 is 
based on a 1992 agreement between the federal government, the 
B.C. government, and the B.C. Indians. This agreement is 
absolutely cast in stone and it contains absolutely no amending 
formula. All legislation that enacts the provisions of the agreement 
is therefore closed to amendments as well. No amendments are 
possible to the bill.
<P>
	What has happened to our parliamentary democracy? As 
member of Parliament for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, one 
of my primary responsibilities is to review, debate, and if necessary 
amend legislation based on the wishes of my constituents. Our 
whole parliamentary process is set around these very important 
functions.
<P>
	Bills go through three separate readings, a committee hearing, 
and a final report stage in the House of Commons to ensure that all 
members of the House and members of the public have had time to 
analyse legislation for faults.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	There are a number of opportunities for members of Parliament 
to bring forth amendments based on the concerns of constituents 
and the Canadian public. The process is then repeated in the Senate. 
This process is not perfect. Governments can refuse amendments. 
This Liberal government is particularly noteworthy in this regard. 
Governments can also rush legislation through the House without 
adequate debate. In this regard, the Liberal government's track 
record is appalling and a disgrace to the parliamentary legacy of 
our forefathers.
<P>
	Despite the lack of respect the Liberals have for our 
parliamentary democracy, this system can be made to work. 
However, with Bill C-107 there is no opportunity for members of 
the House to offer amendments to this piece of legislation. I must 
ask, why are we even bothering to debate this legislation? The 
concerns I have  for this bill are falling on deaf ears. It is shocking 
that the Liberals have the gall to even present this bill in the House. 
It might as well have gone straight over to the Governor General 
for his approval.
<P>
	Bill C-107 usurps the power of Parliament in a most 
undemocratic manner. Parliament has become just a rubber stamp 
for the whims of this Liberal government. The elected members of 
the House are powerless to do their jobs. Every piece of legislation 
must be open to amendment by elected representatives. This is the 
very essence of our democracy. The alternative is a Liberal 
dictatorship.
<P>
	It is time for this government to restore some honour to the 
House by removing this bill from the Order Paper. The three treaty 
signators must go back to the negotiating table to make a new 
agreement, which will allow the interests of all British Columbians 
to be heard.

<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand before the House 
today to address pressing issues on criminal justice, specifically 
Bill C-78, the Witness Protection Program Act.
<P>
	There is an urgent need for legislation of this nature. I can relate 
to that on a personal level. For the past 22 years I have been a 
police officer in the city of Calgary, serving my constituents as well 
as the city in general. A good portion of that time has been devoted 
to the investigation of major crime. I have gained practical insight 
about how valuable witnesses are in the conduct of an 
investigation.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that certain witnesses need to be 
protected from potential harm, particularly when their testimony 
relates to organized criminal activity such as drugs and alcohol, 
tobacco smuggling operations, and trafficking or other conspiracies 
to commit violent capital crimes.
<P>
	The decision for one criminal to turn in other criminals can be a 
difficult one, not only for police departments that have to handle 
this individual but also for the criminal himself. If justice is to be 
served, we must take strong measures to protect from any potential 
harm those witnesses who step forward. They may come from one 
of two categories: they may be active criminals themselves or they 
may have inadvertently been caught in some criminal act in some 
fashion, unknowingly.
<P>
	Simply put, without the testimony of those individuals who 
come forward to present their knowledge or experience of a 
criminal activity or conspiracy to a police officer and eventually to 
a court there would be no investigation, no charges, and ultimately 
no convictions.
<P>
	Violent and organized crime is on the rise in Canada. I do not 
think this government understands that. No longer can politicians 
live in denial of this reality. Wherever there is a dollar to be made 
illegally, the criminal element will organize to beat the law.
<P>
	A prime example of this organized criminal activity is 
motorcycle gang violence and the resulting turf war spilling out 
into the streets. We see that in Toronto and  in Montreal. There is 
little to do on the part of this government right now to change a lot 
of that.
<P>
	It is no secret in law enforcement circles that the Hell's Angels 
are in an all out war with the Outlaws motorcycle gang over control 
of the lucrative drug trade, prostitution, and a mass of contraband 
smuggling and distribution business. The recent spate of bombings 
and killings in Montreal and Toronto continues as kingpins make 
money and people die. The carnage must stop if law and order is to 
be restored on Canadian streets.
<P>
	It is extremely unsettling that this government would not 
acknowledge the new reality of organized criminal activity in our 
country. Furthermore, this do-nothing government has jeopardized 
the security of law-abiding citizens by burying their heads in the 
sand and hoping that crime will disappear.
<P>
	Consider that the budget for this witness protection program in 
Canada will accommodate approximately 80 to 100 individuals in 
any given year. That is very small. The budget established by the 
Solicitor General of Canada, a mere $3.4 million, is fundamentally 
inadequate, given the resources required to penetrate the culture of 
organized crime and to properly identify and recruit criminals 
willing to inform on their own kind.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The RCMP would intensify their efforts in this regard if more 
resources were available. My chief concern is not only the witness 
protection funding deficiencies, but also the lack of vision on the 
part of the Solicitor General. Instead of funding special interest 
lobbies who advocate criminal rights, the Solicitor General might 
instruct his fat cat colleagues to consider the safety of the public for 
a change.
<P>
	Perhaps if the minister were to rescind his gold plated pension 
and convince others in the government to do the same, the 
government could then find the funds to give the RCMP the tools 
they need to get the job done. But those pensions are near and dear 
to the hearts of the government side.
<P>
	Bill C-78 certainly is a step toward strengthening the RCMP 
witness protection program as it exists presently. However, there 
were some problems with the legislation before this bill came into 
being, which have given rise to the amendments we are proposing 
here today. The first is the absolute authority of the RCMP 
commissioner in the decision making process in the following 
areas: (a) to determine whether a witness should be admitted into 
the program; (b) to terminate the protection of the witness if in the 
opinion of the commissioner it is warranted; (c) to disclose the 
identity and the location of the witness or the protectee; and (d) to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16913"> 16913 </A></B>
<P>
make arrangements with other law enforcement agencies, 
attorneys general of the provinces, or other provincial agencies.
<P>
	With respect to the agreements that are struck between the 
parties involved in the witness protection program, I  wish to point 
out that as it stands with this bill there is no resolution mechanism 
or appeal procedure for agencies, agents, and protectees to air their 
concerns beyond the commissioner. It is a crucial that a resolution 
mechanism become part of this bill. I know personally of 
disagreements arising between law enforcement agencies and the 
RCMP, which ended abruptly upon the decision of the 
commissioner. Take for example the concerns expressed by two 
witnesses who came before the standing committee on justice, one 
of whom was a serving police officer representing dozens of police 
agencies and officers across the country.
<P>
	As it stands, the individual witness under protection is restricted 
in taking up matters of concern regarding the conditions of 
protection to the public complaints commission but not to the 
Solicitor General's office. I submit that this process is totally 
inadequate.
<P>
	Most police departments have an informant control officer who 
regulates the handling of an informant for the appropriate 
department. This type of arrangement allows a process of appeal in 
the event of an unsatisfactory decision on the part of the 
commissioner and would be available to agreements between 
individual police agencies and the RCMP via the informant control 
officer. I submit that this provision would make the program much 
more effective, thus enabling agencies greater flexibility in their 
investigation of organized crime.
<P>
	I have had an opportunity to visit various parts of this country 
and specifically this province. Organized crime has a firm grip in 
certain areas, and the police agencies can do little or nothing about 
it. One such area several Reform MPs visited was the area of 
Cornwall and the reserve of Akwesasne, where there is organized 
smuggling and it is being distributed across this country.
<P>
	A lot of people do not understand the effects of drug smuggling 
as it applies to their own lives and their own communities. Drugs 
that come through areas such as the Akwesasne reserve at Cornwall 
and are distributed across the country do make it onto the streets of 
our communities and into our schools.
<P>
	I would strongly urge members to support this particular bill, 
which brings forth more accountability to deal with crime of that 
nature.
<P>
	That is not the only area in the country that is subject to the will 
of the organized criminal. Until we get some real firm legislation 
and a strong commitment on the part of the Solicitor General to 
increase the funding in this particular area to combat the organized 
syndicate, we will not gain any headway and the streets of our 
country will not be any safer.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
heard my colleague talking about his motion and I cannot help 
comparing it to a remake of an old B class movie.
<P>
	What are we debating exactly? A bill and amendment motions 
which, after all, will not prevent anybody from sleeping soundly 
tonight. As a matter of fact, Bill C-78 is so boring that I find it 
surprising that there are still some hon. members around still 
awake.
<P>
	The solicitor general has invented nothing. He simply follows 
the international trend. Other countries have protection programs 
for witnesses. Programs in place in the United States, in the United 
Kingdom and in Australia have inspired the solicitor general for his 
Bill C-78. As usual, Canada is trailing behind other countries. Yet 
again it has failed to show leadership or innovation.
<P>
	What is the purpose of Bill C-78? It proposes the establishment 
of a program operated under the commissioner of the RCMP for the 
protection of witnesses and informants as well as related or 
associated persons who might be at risk. The protection may 
include relocating the person, providing him or her with some 
accommodation, a new identity, as well as counselling and the 
necessary financial support for that purpose.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 moved by the member for Calgary Northeast is by 
far the best suggestion made by the Reform Party in a long time. 
Unfortunately it is not new, since it had already been moved by the 
Bloc Quebecois during clause by clause study of Bill C-78 by the 
justice committee. It is well disguised but the principle remains the 
same.
<P>
	I had proposed to amend the Witness Protection Program Act so 
as to prevent the Commissioner of the RCMP from being the judge, 
jury and sole executioner of the program proposed by the Solicitor 
General.
<P>
	The idea behind our main and related motions was that the 
Solicitor General was to be entirely responsible for the program. 
This is one the numerous problems with Bill C-78. This legislation 
provides that the program will be managed by the Commissioner of 
the RCMP, the same commissioner who determines the 
beneficiaries and the amount of protection they will be given.
<P>
	How are the authorities who operate the program accountable for 
their actions? The RCMP both manages the program and is 
responsible for it. The RCMP is accountable unto itself. It is the 
judge, the jury and the executioner at the same time.
<P>
	Not only that, the government wanted to give the commissioner 
judicial privilege. Fortunately, because of our protests in 
committee, it did not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16914"> 16914 </A></B>
<P>
	I tried to understand, but to no avail; the explanations given by 
the Office of the Solicitor General were as nebulous as they were 
convoluted.
<P>
	As an aside, I wish to point out the deplorable effort made by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General to clarify the 
question for the justice committee. When he appeared before the 
committee, the parliamentary secretary did not know how to 
answer my questions, especially those concerning the problem of 
codefendents. Unable to answer my questions, the member 
mumbled a few words before letting his officials do the work for 
him. The member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
appeared to be out of his depth.
<P>
	The problem with an indictment dealing with two or more 
defendents is that the Witness Protection Program can be used as a 
negotiation tool.
<P>
	Let us take the case of two accomplices charged with the same 
murder. If we assume that proof beyond doubt is readily adduced, 
but lacks a key element to bring about a guilty verdict, the 
testimony of one of the accomplices could prove crucial to the 
proceedings. The Crown cannot afford to weaken the credibility of 
the judicial system if neither of the defendents can be compelled to 
testify against the other one.
<P>
	The Crown's alternative is to offer one of the accomplices a 
reduced sentence or other benefits, in exchange for pleading guilty 
to a lesser charge.
<P>
	The other benefits which can be offered, in addition to a reduced 
sentence, may vary from one judicial district to another.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	They generally deal with the length of the sentence and the 
conditions of confinement. In return, the first accomplice will 
testify against the second one, and instead of two acquittals, the 
Crown will gloat it got two guilty verdicts. But there is a catch. 
With Bill C-78, the Crown will have another present to offer 
criminals in return for their co-operation.
<P>
	Both individuals in my previous example are, I believe, equally 
morally reprehensible. By offering the protection program to one 
of them, but not to both, our judicial system will once again apply 
double standards. A murderer could be protected by the program 
while the accomplice he helped convict will languish in prison. The 
public will not soon forget the Karla Homolka case.
<P>
	To get back to the motion of the member for Calgary Northeast, I 
remind the House that it is based, more or less, on principles 
presented in committee by the Bloc Quebecois. I submitted several 
amendments myself, several of them specifying that the solicitor 
himself should be responsible for the witness protection program 
and not the commissioner of the RCMP.
<P>
	The Reform Party did not support any of these amendments and 
today, they have the gall to make believe it is their idea. Since 
imitation is a form of flattery, I thank my colleagues of the third 
party. In spite of the Reform Party's opportunism, especially that of 
the member for Calgary Northeast, I will vote for motion No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the 
member for Saint-Hubert that the bill as tabled by the solicitor 
general stresses the importance of guaranteeing sources and 
witnesses the best possible protection.
<P>
	Among the changes that should strengthen the program, we find 
a clear definition of the eligibility criteria for witnesses and a more 
transparent program management structure that would require 
greater accountability from all those in charge. I want to repeat, to 
be sure the situation is quite clear, that we will not support the 
Reform Party motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to add that pursuant to the RCMP Act, the Solicitor 
General can provide advice to the commissioner of the RCMP 
concerning matters of policy. The commissioner or his delegate is 
in the best position to make these decisions concerning the day to 
day running of the witness protection program.
<P>
	Since 1984 the RCMP have provided protection to witnesses to 
such a high professional level that there has never been an 
individual killed or seriously injured while under their protection.
<P>
	As a result of the bill, this highly effective program will operate 
in a much more open and transparent manner, as I have just 
indicated to the hon. member for Saint-Hubert, thereby ensuring 
that all participants are aware of both their rights and their 
obligations under this program.
<P>
	In conclusion, we will not be supporting this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley East, or West. 
You look like the fellow from Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
only the beard. Regional disparities: I have no hair and he has 
some.
<P>
	Speaking to Bill C-78, the witness protection program, I must 
say that I support this bill. It is nice to finally get the government to 
move in a direction where even the victims in this country are 
getting some support from the government. That is not much to be 
said for a lot of the other crime bills in this country.
<P>
	By the way, this bill originally came up in a private member's 
bill from one of the Liberal backbenchers. I really think that 
because an individual in the House was pushing it the government 
decided to move ahead and try  to take the glory. I want to give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16915"> 16915 </A></B>
<P>
some appreciation to that Liberal member who initially brought up 
the private member's bill that was dropped.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Currently we are looking at several amendments, which I will 
get to in a moment. There is no national bill for witness protection. 
The RCMP and local forces may have their own, but very secretive, 
with limited access to information as far as what the contents are. 
Again, victims have little or no knowledge of what these bills are 
and what rights they have. It is high time they did.
<P>
	We know little of the programs. In fact, when we attempt to get 
information in this country about witness protection there is very 
little acknowledgement from the RCMP or any other policing 
agency of what is available.
<P>
	One of the Liberal members who usually talks while I am 
speaking says there is a reason for that, but the fact is if this were 
clear legislation then victims would have a little more knowledge 
of what is due to them. It is high time this government got serious 
about letting victims know what is available to them, without 
disregarding their interests.
<P>
	In this country we have seen provincial courts criticize the 
RCMP for their witness protection. We have seen courts in this 
country order protection for individuals. There was one very large 
drug seizure case where the individuals had to go to court to get 
protection. That should not be necessary in this country. It should 
be made available to them, not through order and mandate in the 
courts.
<P>
	In 1993-94 we see that we spent $3.5 million on witness 
protection. I think that is very light. If we are going to assist in 
trying to prevent crime, or at least trying to rectify criminal 
situations and incarcerate people for wrongdoing, we have to put 
more support on the end of witness protection. This bill does that.
<P>
	If the government needs money, which they do, they can take 
some of it from the fines and the other revenues they get from other 
policing activities, so it would be possible to finance some of this 
business. As I understand it, the RCMP welcomes this, which is 
good.
<P>
	There are two amendments we are seeking in the bill. With the 
inclusion of the first amendment there would be one more level of 
appeal, not only for the protectee, who can now appeal his case to 
the public complaints commissioner, but also for police agencies, 
which for the first time are granted a level of appeal beyond the 
commissioner or the minister.
<P>
	As you know, there is an absolute authority granted to the 
commissioner, as my colleague from Calgary has said, but it bears 
repeating. This is an important aspect of the bill. It has to be 
changed.
<P>
	The commissioner has exclusive authority in the following four 
areas: to determine whether a witness  should be admitted to the 
program; to terminate the protection of a witness if the 
commissioner believes it to be warranted; to disclose the identity 
and location of the witness or protected person; and to make 
agreements with other law enforcement agencies or attorneys 
general. With our amendment to clause 5, we allow some further 
avenues for the individuals in the program.
<P>
	Certain witnesses need protection. Unfortunately, some of the 
witnesses who need protection in this country are also criminals. 
However, if we are going to get at the root of the problem in this 
country, we have to afford even those individuals some protection 
if they come forward in particular cases such as cocaine smuggling 
and so on and so forth. While I dislike protecting criminals, in this 
particular case I believe it is necessary. I believe it should also 
apply to smugglers.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Witnesses receive the same protection as the criminal if they 
come forward. Unfortunately, victims know very little of their 
rights. They know very little of what is afforded them in terms of a 
bill such as this or in terms of any other legislation under criminal 
law. Victims should be read their rights. Their rights should be 
publicized, including rights such as being informed of the details of 
the crown's intention to offer a plea bargain; being informed of 
their rights at every stage of a process, including those rights 
involving compensation from the offender; and being informed of 
the offender's status throughout the whole criminal justice process.
<P>
	If we are going to move in the direction of affording victims 
their rights in these areas, then victims must be afforded the 
knowledge of what is in a witness protection act.
<P>
	We know that other countries have witness protection acts, such 
as Australia and the United States. There are problems with the 
American act. The advocacy groups that are responsible for witness 
protection make it very difficult for the crown to have access to a 
witness. We must be careful when we are legislating laws for 
individuals who come forward to put their lives on the line. We 
must guard them, but we cannot overprotect them and prevent 
justice from taking its proper course.
<P>
	I will be voting for this bill and the two amendments. If the two 
amendments are not accepted I will still support the legislation. It 
is necessary to move the government in a direction on behalf of 
people who are trying to help curb crime in Canada.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-78, an act to provide 
for the establishment and operation of a program to enable certain 
persons to receive protection in relation to certain inquiries, 
investigations or prosecutions, as reported (with amendment) from 
the committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to take part in the debate this afternoon. I would like 
to begin by doing something I rarely do, which is to compliment 
the members of the third party for their support of the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Do not get carried away.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> We are just being friendly.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I want to particularly commend the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I am astounded that they even heckle me when I am saying nice 
things about them. It is probably because they are in shock.
<P>
	This legislation has been a necessity for some time. The witness 
protection plan in the past has basically operated under principles 
and guidelines laid down in RCMP internal policies. There is no 
question that this kind of activity is much better and much more in 
the public interest when it is covered by legislation passed in the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	It is tragic to think that we are debating this bill today in the 
aftermath of yet another tragic occurrence in our country. I am 
speaking of the shooting yesterday in Cartierville, Quebec, of the 
young female police officer who was shot in a community police 
station. She was the mother of three children and had just returned 
from maternity leave. The youngest of her three children was only 
eight months old.
<P>
	I do not know if there have been more developments today. Last 
night I watched the news along with our colleague, the member for 
Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, who is very concerned about this 
tragedy that has taken place in her riding. There are no known 
witnesses. This happened in a busy mall, but we all know that 
things can happen that people may not see or hear.
<P>
	With a program like this and with the attendant publicity the 
passage of this bill will create, we can hope people will come 
forward, even if they are frightened, as many people are, to get 
involved with the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Our colleagues from the other party have raised some legitimate 
points, which they need to have answered. Even with the legislation 
replacing a mere policy program, it is extremely important, if this 
program is to work, that access to the information must be very, 
very limited.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley East talked about victims and 
the need for victims to know certain things. I believe the victims 
can well know about the process, about what the policy is and about 
what the legislation is, but that could be part of a government 
information program or it could be part of public education that 
victims rights groups would get involved with. However, in the 
actual day to day administration of the program itself, common 
sense must rule. Only a very small number of people can or should 
be apprised of who exactly is in the program, where these people 
are located, and all of the attendant facts necessary to make sure the 
program works.
<P>
	I take this rare occasion of amity between the government and 
those on the other side to explain that it is not a question of wanting 
to deny victims their rights to know; it is much more a question, as 
is the whole basis of this legislation, that we want to ensure that 
witnesses come forward and give their testimony in a court of law, 
which will lead to the conviction of those who have committed 
offences and will add to the deterrent factor. In other words, it is to 
ensure that this legislation takes its place as part of the 
underpinning of our system of justice. This is a very sensitive area. 
It may well be the most sensitive area in the entire federal realm of 
legislating vis-à-vis the justice system.
<P>
	Part of the difficulty, as with many of our developments in the 
criminal law in this place, is that a  lot of people in the public at 
large garner their information about programs such as this from 
popular television programs. What happens on popular television 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16917"> 16917 </A></B>
<P>
programs and what happens within our various police departments, 
including the RCMP, is not necessarily the same.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Consequently, as the hon. member for Fraser Valley brought up, 
there is a lot of misinformation out there. People want to know 
more. It is the duty of members of Parliament and of government 
without being patronizing, without attempting to block the public's 
right to know to get out the message that some things being 
publicized would be counterproductive to the system of justice and 
to the system of government.
<P>
	There is no question that secrecy in many cases is the enemy of 
democracy, but there are exceptions to that rule. In something such 
as the witness protection program, we all have to agree that a level 
of confidentiality in the protection of those witnesses who are 
doing their very best to help in the protection of the public is 
absolutely essential.
<P>
	I do not have a very long time to address this matter but I also 
wanted to speak briefly on the question of cost in this legislation. 
Again, what we have here is very much of a bargain, particularly 
within the normal costs of federal government programs. At the 
moment, the cost of the RCMP source witness protection program 
is $3.4 million. No additional costs are expected as a result of 
introducing this legislation. The average cost per case is $30,000 
and in actuality 60 per cent of cases cost less than $20,000.
<P>
	It is difficult to say how many persons may be in the program at 
any given time because the numbers do change daily. They change 
with the expiration of protection agreements and the elimination of 
threats to safety. At any given time, there are 80 to 100 people, 
including family members, in the program.
<P>
	We all realize how important a program such as this is to our 
justice system. I want to compliment our colleagues in the third 
party who are supporting this, or in the words of their whip, any of 
those who wish to support it. We appreciate that support.
<P>
	This country's criminal justice system is one that works very 
well. It is the subject of a lot of brick bats, a lot of criticism from 
time to time but in general as a law professor of mine used to say, 
under the universal theory of rough justice, in 80 per cent of the 
cases things work out.
<P>
	The witness protection program may give us a betterment of 
those odds. Certainly all of us on this side of the House, as I know 
all on the other side, are committed to a criminal justice system 
which is fair and which protects Canadian society at large. This 
legislation will be a great help in ensuring that end. I support it very  
strongly. I congratulate members of the third party for their support 
as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address the amendments to Bill C-78. This bill came before the 
justice committee. As a member of the justice committee I heard 
witnesses address their concerns about the bill.
<P>
	One of the concerns I want to address and which this amendment 
focuses upon is the enormous degree of vulnerability of many of 
the witnesses who come under the 14 or 15 witness protection 
programs across Canada. We heard testimony indicating that these 
witnesses are very vulnerable. For some of them, their lives are in 
danger. They have received threats yet they want to do the right 
thing and provide the evidence to ensure that the justice system 
works and that those who are involved in organized crime and in 
criminal activities are brought to justice. Some of the testimony we 
heard from the witnesses raises serious concerns in this area.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I have the brief submitted by Mr. Barry Swadron, a lawyer who 
acts on behalf of witnesses who have challenged the program 
because of the violation of what they believe to be the agreement 
the police forces have made with them. He states: ``By the time 
protected witnesses get to lawyers, it is often to undo harm that 
could have been avoided had they consulted lawyers earlier. Police 
officers often discourage about to be protected witnesses from 
retaining lawyers with respect to proposed arrangements. A 
number of protected witnesses have been advised by police 
authorities that a lawyer will not be able to help them. We have 
been told that police officers pressure witnesses not to consult a 
lawyer. Indeed the negative pressure has on occasion been 
prohibition''. He concludes by stating that this is reprehensible.
<P>
	The committee heard testimony on this bill indicating that the 
agreements witnesses enter into in many cases are not upheld. They 
are not provided with the protection. They are not provided with 
the benefits they need. This new bill was scrutinized by those 
witnesses to determine whether or not there were checks and 
balances to ensure that they had recourse should their handlers not 
fulfil their end of the agreement.
<P>
	Mr. Swadron goes on to say in his brief: ``Swadron Associates 
have received dozens of telephone calls from across Canada and 
beyond from the types of persons described above''. He is talking 
about the protectees. ``They are of both sexes, various ages and 
from many walks of life. A substantial number have become our 
clients. We advise some. We negotiate on behalf of others. 
Sometimes we must resort to litigation where police forces are 
sued in order to obtain the contractual benefits that these protectees 
have entered into''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16918"> 16918 </A></B>
<P>
	He also states: ``You would be amazed at the hardships faced 
by these individuals. They experience the worst type of cultural 
shock. Not only are they forced to forge new beginnings in strange 
surroundings, but also to erase their much more familiar past. The 
degree of assistance they receive from police authorities varies 
significantly. Every aspect of daily living that you and I take for 
granted has for them been inexorably altered. Even attending to 
basic needs such as arranging accommodation, obtaining health 
care, getting a driver's licence, opening a bank account, or placing 
children in schools becomes insurmountable''.
<P>
	When we examined this bill we examined it from many 
perspectives and points of view. I was most concerned about 
whether or not the bill provided adequate checks and balances for 
the very sensitive and vulnerable position many of these witnesses 
find themselves in.
<P>
	As I said earlier, many have been threatened. They fear for their 
lives and those of their spouses and children. They are very 
susceptible to the manipulation of the handler. Unless the handler is 
very conscious about the duties and responsibilities that they must 
discharge to the protectee under the agreement, often the 
conditions of the agreement are violated. Then the protectee is left 
in an extremely vulnerable position where they either have to seek 
their own remedies or seek the support of legal counsel if they wish 
to pursue what they consider to be benefits that have been withheld 
from them. As Mr. Swadron says, it creates an enormous problem 
within the witness protection programs.
<P>
	Mr. Swadron referred to Bill C-78 as a police protection program 
rather than a witness protection program. He centred on what was 
at that time clause 19 of the bill. Clause 19 has been withdrawn and 
was done so by the government. Of course, we on this side of the 
House support that withdrawal because what clause 19 provided for 
was the protection of the RCMP. If the RCMP could simply raise 
the defence of having acted in good faith, then no protectee could 
sue the government successfully. That was withdrawn because of 
some of the concerns which were raised by witnesses and some of 
the concerns I am raising today and which the amendment to which 
we are speaking addresses to some extent.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Clause 19 was withdrawn so that if there are areas of culpability 
in terms of discharging the requirements of any agreement, there is 
no legal barrier that would interfere with the right of the protectee 
to seek litigation in order to establish what they consider to be 
benefits from the agreement.
<P>
	I am very much in favour of the withdrawal of clause 19 which is 
no longer in the bill. However, I also have great concern about 
some of the testimony provided. The commissioner alone has 
absolute power and authority to determine not only what witnesses 
enter into the  program but the conditions of the agreement as well 
as the right to rule on any concern a protectee might have.
<P>
	I support this amendment. It would provide the means whereby 
individuals can address the minister who can then be held 
accountable by the elected representatives of the House as to how 
these contracts are administered. I support the amendment and I 
will be supporting the bill.
<P>
	I hope all hon. members will consider the testimony we have 
heard before the committee and the concerns I have raised with 
regard to the extreme vulnerability of the witnesses. We must 
ensure there are reasonable checks and balances within the 
legislation to protect them from abuse.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, it never ceases to amaze me how little the 
government side knows about what is happening in the world of 
crime. In spite of the fact that we see all these documents and 
newspaper clippings and initiatives which have been started by the 
government, it never seems to want to really address the problem.
<P>
	One of the headings in a newspaper not too long ago was: ``Guns 
replace cigarette smuggling''. Who does the smuggling? Who 
smuggles guns, cigarettes, booze, and the like? No one but an 
organized criminal group. They are in it to make money.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	As I mentioned before, several Reform MPs, and I know Liberal 
members went to the same area, went to the Akwesasne reserve and 
the city of Cornwall. It is interesting to note that the police task 
force initiated to combat smuggling is afraid to patrol the river in 
the evening for fear of being shot at by organized criminals who 
have literally taken over control of the river to move their 
contraband. That takes place mostly during the evening and the 
night. They are organized criminals who need special treatment. 
When we talk about protecting witnesses, witnesses from this area 
are afraid to come forward for fear of reprisal. They know the 
police cannot protect them adequately.
<P>
	This is happening right across the country. Ipperwash is another 
place. The police are reluctant to properly police the area of 
Bosanquet and Ipperwash because it may end up having a 
confrontation with an organized criminal group. We can have all 
the witness protection programs we want, but if there are not 
adequate funds to deal with it, it is another matter. We will not be 
protecting witnesses.
<P>
	That is happening in the country, not just in Ipperwash and not 
just in Cornwall. We can look at other areas including metropolitan 
areas such as Toronto and Vancouver. Organized criminal groups 
have control in many areas, whether or not we want to admit it. It 
will take extraordinary means to combat it. Power is given to the 
police including under the witness protection act as mentioned 
here. Funds must be available to take care of it, if the government is 
serious about it. I do not believe the Liberal government is serious 
about fighting crime at all. It would do something more about it if 
that were the case.
<P>
	People are living in fear in their own homes. This is what 
combating crime the Liberal way has done. They have to bar 
themselves in their own homes to protect  themselves from 
criminals who have control of the streets. That is not the way to 
fight crime. When it is in an organized fashion even this legislation 
falls short because many police departments have their hands tied.
<P>
	My second amendment deals with the submission of the annual 
report on the operation of the program as it applies to the preceding 
year. There are enabling sections in the legislation to have the 
report placed before Parliament. However we are without any 
provision for having the report sent before the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs to be reviewed. It does not mention the 
content of what the report should include. I believe the report is 
ridiculous. If there is a budget of $3.4 million as the government 
has so slated, there should be some content in the report and some 
subsection to specify precisely how the money is to be spent.
<P>
	Many times members have stood on both sides of the House and 
talked about accountability. It is a nice word, but it seems as though 
a regulation has to be in place before somebody actually becomes 
accountable. Members on that side who were in opposition years 
before railed time and time against the government of the day on 
accountability and responsibility. All this amendment is suggesting 
is that there made more accountability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> There is the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> That is right. It is a question of accountability. I 
agree with my colleague that they do not want to be accountable.
<P>
	I present an opportunity to members of the House to learn from 
past mistakes to make sure the bill does not miss its mark. The 
following information should be included in the annual report.
<P>
	First is the number of agreements entered into and the law 
enforcement agencies involved. This is important, given the fact 
that there have been disputes in the past between law enforcement 
agencies and the RCMP in this area before the legislation was 
thought of.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Second is the number of applications made. Is everyone who 
makes an application accepted or are some turned down? That 
information should be made available.
<P>
	Third is the average amount spent on each arrangement. There is 
a budget of $3.4 million. Approximately 100 protectees were in the 
program in the past. Will that continue? Will the number rise? 
When we look at organized crime as it is manifesting itself in the 
country, it will undoubtedly rise. Where will the extra money come 
from to protect the individuals who apply?
<P>
	Fourth is the number of agreements terminated and the reasons 
for termination. This has been a dispute in other agencies or other 
police departments. The commissioner has the final say on who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16920"> 16920 </A></B>
<P>
comes into the  program and who does not. That information 
should be made available to the committee.
<P>
	Fifth is the number and types of offences committed.
<P>
	Sixth is the total amount of money spent from the consolidated 
revenue fund.
<P>
	Seventh is the co-operative measures taken between the RCMP 
and other law enforcement agencies with respect to witness 
protection. Many joint force operations are taking place in the 
country. There are so many joint forces that it is impossible for one 
agency to effectively combat organized criminal activity without 
joining forces with others. This information should be made 
available. It is the other law enforcement agencies that often have 
the objections if the RCMP commissioner is the only one who has 
the final say on the agreements.
<P>
	The last point is the number of foreign witnesses admitted to 
Canada who have become part of the protection program and the 
number of Canadian witnesses relocated outside Canada.
<P>
	None of these proposed amendments is unreasonable. Upon 
review by the hon. members of the House I am confident they will 
see that the amendments are designed to bring about more 
accountability in the bill and the decision making process of the 
commissioner.
<P>
	Given the rise of organized and violent crime the government 
should be doing everything in its power to ensure that the citizens 
of Canada are protected to the fullest. I urge all members to vote 
not based upon partisan considerations but rather on the best 
interests of their constituents and in favour of the amendments 
presented.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second motion of the Reform member stresses other shortcomings 
of Bill C-78.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say that Motion No. 2, standing in the 
name of the hon. member for Calgary Northeast, is redundant in the 
first subsection. I will explain. The hon. member would like the 
annual report required under clause 16 of the bill to be transmitted 
to the Solicitor General and either tabled in the House or referred to 
the justice committee. However, according to Standing Order 
32(5):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reports, returns or other papers laid before the House in accordance with an 
Act of Parliament shall thereupon be deemed to have been permanently referred 
to the appropriate standing committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This means that once the report of the commissioner has been 
tabled in the House it is immediately referred to the Standing 
Committee on Justice. The member of the Reform Party does not 
have to worry. It is already in the Standing Orders and therefore 
subsection (3) is superfluous.
<P>
	Subsection (4) tries to define much more precisely the work of 
the commissioner. He would have to give a lot of details in the 
report that he must submit to the Solicitor General every year.
<P>
	Clause 16 of Bill C-78 requires that the commissioner submit a 
report on the operation of the program to the minister, who in this 
case is the Solicitor General. The clause is quite vague as to the 
content of this report.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	All the bill says, and I quote, is: ``a report on the operation of the 
Program during the preceding fiscal year''.
<P>
	Things cannot be put more succintly. The bill does not provide 
any satisfactory answer to many questions that I think are obvious.
<P>
	What the government has given us is nothing more than 
Canada-wide legislation that will be administered by the RCMP 
and to which provincial and local police authorities will have to 
adapt.
<P>
	Today, we still do not know how co-ordination between the 
different police groups will be ensured, because Bill C-78 is silent 
on this issue. In fact, the silence of this bill is most certainly its 
main characteristic. What concerns me is not what is in the bill, but 
what was omitted.
<P>
	A series of questions remain unanswered. Once the bill has been 
passed by Parliament, how long will it take to put the program in 
place? What budget will be allocated to the program? How does 
this amount compare with the current budget? How many people 
are expected to benefit from the program each year?
<P>
	It is all fine and well to want to protect informers, but we should 
know how much this is going to cost. Indeed, we do not even know 
which envelope the Solicitor General intends to take the money 
from.
<P>
	As we know, the witness protection program will be a kind of 
contract between the RCMP and the protectee. Let us examine the 
respective rights and obligations of the parties to this agreement.
<P>
	The commissioner's obligations come down to almost nothing. 
As indicated in clause 8 of the bill, he only has:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to take such reasonable steps as are necessary to provide the protection 
referred to in the agreement to the protectee;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is all. So, I hope that he will take the necessary steps. But 
what kind of steps are they? Only the commissioner will know 
because, once again, the bill does not explain what these steps will 
be. Thus, these ``reasonable'' steps are the only obligations the 
commissioner will have to fulfill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16921"> 16921 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the protectee, he must first provide the information or 
evidence required by the inquiry or the prosecution that has made 
the protection necessary. Second, the protectee must keep his or her 
hands clean,  that is refrain from activities that constitute an 
offence against an act of Parliament. Shoplifting could be in this 
category.
<P>
	Last, he or she must accept and give effect to reasonable requests 
and directions made by the commissioner in relation to the 
protection provided to the protectee and the obligations of the 
protectee.
<P>
	If the protectee deliberately contravenes his or her obligations 
under the protection agreement, the commissioner may terminate 
the protection, provided that the protectee can make 
representations concerning the matter.
<P>
	This bill puts things very succintly. I suppose that to correct 
these flaws, some practices are going to evolve allowing the RCMP 
to completely evade the power of supervision of Parliament.
<P>
	This is the danger with poor legislation. Police forces create their 
own rules without any respect for the law. In fact, they are the ones 
who actually write it as circumstances change. I ask you this: When 
are we going to see the federal government assume its 
responsibilities and legislate in a detailed and precise fashion so 
that those who must enforce these laws know how to proceed?
<P>
	Since the motion of the member from Calgary Northeast tries to 
fill some gaps, we are going to support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, even if the hon. member 
opposite raised several issues, we will not support the motion as 
tabled by the third party.
<P>
	But the hon. member still raised some points. We should remind 
Canadians, in particular the hon. members opposite, that the 
commissioner may terminate the protection provided if, in his 
opinion, the witness provided false information, omitted to provide 
important information, or deliberately failed to meet his 
obligations under the protection agreement.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I think that the hon. member did point out some issues, such as 
the cost of producing an annual report. Normally, information 
would be provided on costs and on the number of participants in the 
program. Of course, certain criteria will established.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In reference to the member of the third party, we on the 
government side will not be supporting this motion. However, it is 
not necessary to enact a provision requiring the annual report to be 
referred to the justice and legal affairs committee.
<P>
	Reports which concern matters relating to justice and legal 
affairs are presently referred to the justice and legal affairs 
committee.
<P>
	With respect to the motion which specifies the content of the 
annual report to be tabled by the solicitor general before 
Parliament, many pieces of legislation require the tabling of an 
annual report without listing the specific information the report 
should contain.
<P>
	The list of items provided in this motion is extremely helpful and 
will be referred to the commission for its consideration. It is 
important that care be taken to ensure that the information included 
in the report does not inadvertently compromise any witnesses in 
the program or the program as a whole.
<P>
	Members of the justice and legal affairs committee will have the 
opportunity to review and assess the first report to ensure that the 
appropriate balance has been achieved in terms of informing the 
public without compromising the integrity of the program.
<P>
	Therefore we will not be supporting the opposition motion 
presented to us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a a new 
member of the House, having been here only two years, it is always 
discouraging and dismaying for me to see not only in the House but 
in committee when the minister, through his parliamentary 
secretary or through his own directive, indicates what he wants the 
committee or the House to do, and everyone else on the 
government side simply follows suit regardless of the impression 
the amendments make on their own common sense.
<P>
	It is dismaying for me to hear that the government is not going to 
support this amendment regardless of the common sense that it 
makes, regardless of the protection that it might provide in terms of 
checks and balances for the witnesses who are dragged into this 
system because of circumstances, perhaps in many cases beyond 
their own control. The government side is not prepared to honour 
the checks and balances that would protect the vulnerability of the 
witness entering into this program.
<P>
	Let me tell members how vulnerable those people are. They 
come into the program because their life or the lives of their 
children may be threatened. They know that unless they abide by 
the wishes of their handler he or she can have an enormous impact 
on pulling the protection program out from under them.
<P>
	What we are asking for in this amendment is simply a degree of 
accountability on the part of the commissioner who will be 
administering the program. Having served 14 years with the 
Mounted Police I know the commissioner never knows anything 
about things that often happen at the grassroots level because the 
only channel of communication he has are the reports he reads 
from people who prepare the reports at the grassroots level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16922"> 16922 </A></B>
<P>
	Consequently there are many things that could happen and are 
happening to these witnesses according to the testimony we have 
heard which places them at enormous vulnerability, where their 
grievances are not met and where they have absolutely no recourse. 
They ought to  have a reasonable degree of recourse through their 
elected representatives who would review the program on an 
annual basis with these requirements. What does the commissioner 
have to provide for in his report to the solicitor general? What is it? 
Practically anything he wants unless there are some type of 
guidelines, the type of guidelines provided for in this amendment.
<P>
	We do not want to know the names or the places of residents or 
any other factor that would place the witnesses in a vulnerable 
situation. Absolutely not. That is not the purpose of this 
amendment. What we want to do is have a degree of accountability 
in greater depth than a casual report from the commissioner. We 
see these kinds of reports. They have been submitted to the 
minister, whether from SIRC or some other statutory requirement.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	They simply say what they want to say and withhold whatever 
information they want simply because there is no statutory 
requirement to provide that information. This amendment would 
go a long way to establish a reasonable check and balance on a 
program that involves innocent people and places them in very 
vulnerable situations. I support this amendment and I will be 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	When we create these sorts of bills we ought to ensure citizens 
are provided the greatest degree of protection possible and not 
those who administer the program.
<P>
	I urge all members to seriously consider and support this bill. It 
provides the reasonable checks and balances this kind of program 
ought to have.

	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development), Lib.):</B> moved that Bill C-109, an act to amend the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Companies' Creditors 
Arrangement Act and the Income Tax Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I talk specifically about the 
amendments to the Bankruptcy Act, Bill C-109, it is important to 
go back and have a little history on how the bill evolved.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	I hope later today we will hear from our colleague, the member 
for Dartmouth, because in opposition he was our critic for 
consumer and corporate affairs and had a tremendous hand in 
crafting this bill on bankruptcy and insolvency. It is a complex bill 
because it includes a lot of provisions affecting the bankruptcy and 
insolvency area.
<P>
	This bill contains almost 100 pages and has provisions affecting 
procedures in consumer bankruptcies and proposals, landlord 
compensation where leases are disclaimed in reorganizations, 
liability of directors and stays of action against directors during 
reorganizations. It includes the whole area of protection of trustees 
and receivers against personal liability for pre-appointment 
environmental damage and other claims, workmen's compensation 
board claims, the dischargeability of student loan debts.
<P>
	Also included are the licensing and regulation of trustees and 
their liability in relation to other activities related to business, the 
requirement that bankrupts pay part of their income to the 
bankruptcy estate, securities, firm bankruptcies and international 
solvencies, and so on.
<P>
	I have gone over those issues because it is important to 
understand this is a very complex area but vital in terms of making 
sure the environment is good for creating opportunities for 
business men and women to get involved in risk taking. It is also 
very important that we deal with the issue in terms of protecting the 
consumer.
<P>
	The amendments we are putting forward today are a further 
striking of a balance between rehabilitation and obligation. In other 
words, the emphasis in the bill is to make sure we do everything we 
can to help preserve jobs and the businesses that create them. 
Rather than automatically having a situation in which people lose 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16923"> 16923 </A></B>
<P>
their businesses, we create an environment in which we can 
actually help them through and that before they become bankrupt 
we take every measure possible to help them through difficult 
circumstances.
<P>
	The amendments to the bill we are dealing with today are further 
refinements of the bill from 1992. This was a commitment we 
made. When the last bill was approved in 1992 we said that three 
years later we would have a review. We have listened to people 
from across Canada, from business groups and consumer groups. 
These amendments reflect the recommendations the study group 
proposed.
<P>
	I will deal specifically with the amendments: ``The maintenance 
of income support benefits, such as GST tax refunds, that allow 
families and individuals to meet their essential needs''. Under the 
proposed legislation these benefits are exempt from seizures 
unintended to reimburse creditors.
<P>
	``The priority status for provable claims by divorced or separated 
spouses for spousal or child support payments''. Previously 
spouses were not considered creditors.
<P>
	``Debtors to meet their obligations where a sexual or physical 
assault charge resulted in penalties''. The amendments make these 
judgements non-dischargeable and allow support for assault 
victims to discontinue.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The bill also has a further refinement in the area of student loans, 
tighter control of premature student bankruptcies intended to 
discharge responsibility from student loans. In recent years the 
federal government has lost over $60 million per year in loan 
defaults as a result of early student claims of bankruptcy. The 
proposed changes will make student loan debts non-dischargeable 
for 24 months following termination of studies, recognizing that 
some students experience real economic difficulties. The 
amendments complement a variety of repayment options during 
that 24-month period including no repayment in situations of 
hardship.
<P>
	Also individuals can make recompense from a portion of surplus 
income deemed to exceed a minimum cost of living. This provision 
provides for a regularized repayment schedule and encourages 
bankrupt individuals to make their best effort to reimburse their 
creditors.
<P>
	Under directives from the superintendent of bankruptcy, trustees 
will have powers to establish rates and terms of a conditional 
discharge. This will save court costs and will allow for a 
personalized arrangement between a bankrupt individual and his or 
her creditors. Also spouses can make a joint consumer proposal 
where their financial relationship requires a co-ordinated 
repayment effort. These new provisions streamline the proceedings 
and save costs.
<P>
	There is more time for creditors to review debtor proposals and a 
quicker response from the courts to those proposals. The old 
waiting period for creditors would be extended from 30 days to 45 
days. The courts would have 15 days to indicate whether the 
proposal had been accepted as opposed to the current response 
period  of 30 days. Otherwise the proposal would be deemed to be 
accepted. There is also a provision for counselling for persons 
related to the debtor.
<P>
	That essentially represents the essence of those amendments in 
terms of the individual. We also have further amendments relating 
to businesses, farmers and fishermen. We feel confident that the 
House will support all of these amendments, certainly because of 
the participation of the advisory group.
<P>
	Over the next little while the House has to deal with the whole 
issue of creating confidence in the marketplace. I personally do not 
like dealing with the whole issue of bankruptcy and insolvency. 
Even though the bill is there to protect and to make sure that people 
are treated fairly, I believe there is a very high level of anxiety in 
the marketplace right now. One of the things we must do as 
members of Parliament is make sure that we somehow work at 
creating an environment where the confidence level in the business 
community is returned to what it used to be.
<P>
	It is only when people have confidence in the marketplace and 
confidence in themselves that they take the risk that generates 
production and job opportunity which eventually creates a 
condition in the marketplace where bankruptcies are minimized. In 
the last couple of years, even though bankruptcies have really 
remained constant, the bottom line is that we still had too many. 
The quarterly releases on the number of bankruptcies tend to send a 
shiver right through the marketplace. It is a domino effect. It has an 
adverse impact on the confidence of the entire marketplace.
<P>
	It is hoped this bill will assist in giving individuals and business 
men and women every opportunity to avoid or get around having to 
go through that dreaded experience of bankruptcy and insolvency.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	I hope we can get the support of all members for the speedy 
passage of this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the remarks made by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood about Bill C-109. This is a bill whose 
full-blown title is an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act, the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	It is quite bulky, as my hon. colleague pointed out, and it is 
difficult to read, which is understandable since the 1992 reform had 
been 13 years in the making, that is to say from 1979 to 1992. The 
government finally tabled the famous bill that had taken all that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16924"> 16924 </A></B>
<P>
time to prepare, the act of 1992 that Bill C-109 now seeks to make 
substantial changes to.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member opposite when he says that 
bankruptcy is a problem, a complex problem. A balance must be 
struck between the responsibility all of us have to pay what we owe 
and the hope to be able, even when deep in debt, to have a decent 
living and perhaps manage to pull through, whether we have put 
ourselves in this difficult financial situation or it is the result of a 
business venture we started that did not do too well.
<P>
	According to the minister's release, this bill contains more than 
70 amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. In the little time we have 
had to examine this legislation, I managed to review the principles. 
There are three, at the beginning of the bill, relating to consumer 
bankruptcies. For example, debts will now be repaid from excess 
income, that is to say income over and above the minimum cost of 
living.
<P>
	But nowhere in the bill is this concept of minimum cost or 
standard of living defined. I guess that it will be up to the 
Superintendent of Bankruptcy, somewhere in Canada, to 
determine-arbitrarily at times, I am afraid-what this minimum 
will be. Take Quebec for example. I do not know if the same thing 
applies in other provinces, but surely it must. In Quebec, we have 
the Code of Civil Procedure, and section 553 et seq. provide that a 
portion of someone's salary cannot be garnished. Therefore, if the 
superintendent for Quebec decided to ignore what section 553 says 
about part of someone's salary being exempt from seizure in 
Quebec, I sincerely wonder-and I am not being facetious-who 
would be encroaching on whose jurisdiction then?
<P>
	That has not been set out in the bill. I understand that is not its 
role, but that is an ambiguity that is likely to create uncertainty for 
some people and also-and I hope this will not be the rule-to 
open the door to abuse, to lead to abuse.
<P>
	There is another principle here, the obligation for the debtor to 
discharge his or her financial responsibilities relating to alimony 
for his or her spouse and children or relating to damages awarded 
by the courts to compensate for a physical or sexual assault. I 
cannot but commend that. Frankly, this is a provision that, in my 
opinion, is absolutely fundamental, and I commend the Minister of 
Industry for it. He is showing concern for his fellow citizens who 
might have been victims of some highly reprehensible acts. 
Otherwise, the offender could say: ``It is very simple, I go bankrupt 
and we forget all about the harm I have done to you''. I endorse 
without any reservation that provision in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	A third point is that it will be impossible for students to get rid of 
their student loan debts before two years after completion of their 
education. Need I say I do not agree?
<P>
	Not too long ago, we had before us the budget implementation 
bill. If memory serves, it was Bill C-76.  We talked about students. 
We raised the level of their financial contribution to their own 
education by providing additional loans. The issue gave rise to a 
rather heated debate in the House. Some said that students would 
end up with debts of $28,000 or $30,000 or more.
<P>
	We thought the government was not being reasonable in that bill 
because the students had their talents nipped in the bud in that they 
were being put in a state of virtual bankruptcy the moment they 
entered the labour market. Our remarks did not fall on deaf ears, as 
demonstrated by this bill in which the Minister of Industry tells us 
that students are actually overburdened, but they will not be 
allowed to file for bankruptcy, at least not before two years.
<P>
	I cannot agree with this. True enough, we should always keep a 
proper balance between the obligation to pay one's debts and the 
right to lead a meaningful life. All Canadians have both this duty 
and this right. Fortunately, one provision in this bill makes it at 
least possible to have some cases examined on their merits. In 
some cases, students could avoid paying back their loan in full.
<P>
	There are underlying social principles in this legislation. This 
bill also includes another provision that deals with the overall 
enforcement of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, and I am 
talking about the trustees.
<P>
	Since the new legislation came into force in 1992, it has not been 
easy in the province of Quebec. We had some quasi-fraudulent 
bankruptcy cases that caused a lot of stir. For example, Zoom 
Informatique was dealt with very harshly by the courts because of 
the actions of the trustees involved in the case. We also heard of a 
lawyer named Sirois who went bankrupt, a bankruptcy involving 
$1.6 million which was highly contested. Mr. Sirois was the father 
of the Bankruptcy Act that we are about to modify today. He was 
also a bankruptcy expert in Quebec.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the bankruptcy authorities really got raked over 
the coals on television, during some very popular and highly rated 
CBC television programs such as <I>Enjeux</I>, which examined these 
fraudulent bankruptcy cases.
<P>
	I think that the problem will remain, even though we try to 
licence and regulate the trustees in this bill, because in the mind of 
the people the problem lies with the fact that the profession of 
trustee is not legally recognized as a corporate body, as is the case 
with the Ordre des avocats du Québec, the Canadian Bar 
Association, the associations of architects and professional 
engineers, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, all professional 
associations that are legally recognized and can perform peer 
reviews at any time in order to preserve a degree of dignity for their 
profession.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it seems that trustees in bankruptcy do not form a 
profession. Recently, I noticed that, pursuant  to the provisions of 
the Bankruptcy Act, a code of ethics for trustees had been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16925"> 16925 </A></B>
<P>
published in <I>The Canada Gazette</I>. It dealt with sections 54(30), 
(31), (32), (33), (34), etc.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Sure, these are great principles and I have nothing against them. 
Except that the enforcement of these sections of the code of ethics 
is never monitored unless a complaint is filed because the 
Superintendent of Bankruptcy is overloaded. He cannot do it on his 
own although this legislation is now giving him the authority to 
commission inquiries. If an association of trustees in bankruptcy 
were created, mandated primarily to protect the public interest and 
empowered like the other professional associations to issue 
licences, then we could have something valid.
<P>
	This bill almost gives quasi-judicial powers to the trustee. The 
trustee almost becomes a public officer. According to the 
documents we were given, the bankrupt person must reimburse 
what he or she owes with his or her income considered to be in 
excess of the minimal cost of living. Whatever that is, as I said 
earlier.
<P>
	This clause provides for a regular repayment schedule and 
encourages the bankrupt person to do everything possible to repay 
his or her creditors. Great! Under the supervision of the 
Superintendent of Bankruptcy, who is already overloaded, we can 
immediately see from what is happening in the bankruptcy sector 
that the trustees will have the power to set the rates and the terms of 
a conditional discharge, the power to decree or decide, that is a 
quasi-judicial power.
<P>
	According to the Bankruptcy Act that was replaced in 1992 and 
to the one which is now in force, the trustee acts in the interest of 
the creditors. The trustee does not have to be impartial in dealing 
with a bankruptcy. The trustee is primarily a representative of the 
creditors, not the bankrupt.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it is totally different in practice. Someone who is 
in dire financial straits decides, on the recommendation of a friend 
or a relative, to consult a trustee he knows well and tells him: 
``Look. I want to make an assignment, would you look after my 
case?'' It is not in the interest of the trustee who has a reputation for 
kindness, who is an expert in public relations, to ruin his own 
reputation. So, unless the creditors he is supposed to represent 
under the authority of his legal mandate are opposed to it, the 
trustee will continue to be rather lenient with the bankrupt, which is 
fine, but unfortunately, he will do it at the expense of the creditors 
who, more often than not, will end up licking their wounds.
<P>
	The bill adds another dimension to the treatment of bankruptcy 
cases. For example, in the distribution or collocation order, greater 
importance is now given to the environmental aspect. We can 
imagine a situation where a contaminated building is in the 
possession of a trustee;  the assets would first be used to 
decontaminate the ground.
<P>
	I have some difficulty with this clause in combination with 
clause 18 modifying the existing act-so it is not something 
new-which provides: ``The trustee may, with the permission of 
the inspectors, divest all or any part of the trustee's right, title or 
interest in any real property of the bankrupt''. It could be that, if the 
trustee becomes aware that the land has no realizable value, he will 
get rid of it and pass on his responsibility to decontaminate the site 
to someone else. It is not clear in the bill. It was just to put a 
damper on my pleasure at finding this provision in the bill.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government could have taken the opportunity 
to include, in the distribution and collocation order, the salaries of 
employees present at the time of the shut-down of a corporation, 
for example.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	That was the reason behind my colleague from Portneuf's 
tabling of a private member's bill. The bill was passed at second 
reading in the House before being sent to a committee. That was 
the last we heard about it since. I saw the Minister of Industry of 
the time in a fit of ministerial pique when he realized that the bill 
had been passed. Maybe this is why the bill is being dragged out in 
committee. I do not know. Nevertheless, the bill has never come 
back here.
<P>
	It went along the same lines and was in the same spirit as the 
decontamination clause, except that the last employees, thanks to 
whom the company had lasted so long and who had kept supporting 
it during a not necessarily easy winding up period, had priority over 
the decontamination of the site. And the moment a trustee in 
bankruptcy comes in and shuts the company down, he fires them all 
and does not owe them anything. In the priority of claims, they 
come far behind the banks; the seven big banks that made $4.3 
billion in net profit last year.
<P>
	I was listening to the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood, 
and we all know how attached the Liberals are to big banks. We 
could see it when Liberal Party's list of contributors was made 
public. This bank gave $250,000, that one $250,000 and so on, all 
to the tune of a quarter of a million dollars. Those poor banks 
netted only $4.3 billion last year. Of course, it was impossible to 
table a bill on bankruptcy without protecting their interests first. 
This is what the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood wanted 
us to swallow, like a candy coated pill. But basically, when we read 
between the lines, the security involved is that of the poor big bank 
which showed a net profit of only $4.3 billion last year.
<P>
	And yet banks never lose. This is not a bill for the banks. Good 
for them if they get something out of it like any citizen. But the bill 
should have been written first  and foremost with the protection of 
the general public in mind. There are seven banks for 31 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16926"> 16926 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians. It seems to me that there is no comparison. Even if we 
take into account the hundred or so American and Canadian trust 
and leasing companies, there are still a lot more people than 
financial institutions in our society.
<P>
	I really have the impression that the bill's purpose is to protect 
investors, that is major banks, leasing companies, rather than to try 
to help ordinary Canadians who are often affected by a bankruptcy, 
those who end up losing a few weeks' or a few months' pay if not 
their shirt. The government did not display much concern for these 
people in this legislation, despite all the enthusiasm shown by the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood in praising this bill.
<P>
	I am also delighted to see in the bill that small businesses will no 
longer be forced arbitrarily to declare bankruptcy, that factors such 
as the possibility of recovery, job losses, etc. will have to be 
considered. I think it is just great.
<P>
	But if the Minister of Industry wanted to be realistic and if 
arbitrary business closures because of bankruptcy or insolvency 
were his main concern, and it shows in this bill, what is he waiting 
for to introduce meaningful legislation based on some of the 
principles in the Quebec legislation on agricultural zoning?
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, we had the political will to say: ``Enough is enough. 
Farmland will not be parcelled out any more. If you decide to buy a 
large piece of land, you will have to live with it. You will not be 
able to sell it off in small parcels''. Today, corporate raiders as they 
are called come along and buy businesses that often play a vital 
role in our economy.
<P>
	Take the case of Canada Packers, who had been in Canada and in 
Quebec for at least 125 years, more precisely in 
Pointe-Saint-Charles. Then comes some professional auctioneer 
who buys everything for $500 million. He starts by selling 
separately the various components of economic activity of the 
company: beef production, $25 or $50 million, followed by egg, 
poultry, milk and oil production. He sells everything, often to 
competitors in that same sector.
<P>
	Without any scruples, he puts 1,500, 2,000 or 3,000 heads of 
family out of work. His net profit is made up of the equipment, 
capital assets, land, buildings, etc. He heads back to England and 
kisses us good bye. More often than not, he does not have to pay 
any tax, or if he does, the federal government usually finds out too 
late. He has already gone home and no longer has any assets in 
Canada, so the government can always try to collect.
<P>
	You might say that this is not a case of insolvency when it 
actually happens. True, but it becomes one afterwards. So, the bill 
would deal appropriately with such situations. At least, this is the 
way I see it. If the  minister is short of ideas, he should come to 
Quebec. When we had to deal with the parcelling out of businesses 
that were doing relatively well, we did some thinking and came up 
with the agricultural zoning act.
<P>
	It is not easy to comment on a bill which has some 100 pages and 
is made up of bits and pieces, this in just three days. I could do a 
more thorough review if I had a week. I am convinced that this bill 
will not make it past the next stage, not necessarily because it is a 
bad bill, but because it goes too far in some cases and not far 
enough in others. What is being done to students here I have a hard 
time living with, but I agree with the provisions concerning 
damages to a person resulting from sexual assault or wilful 
negligence
<P>
	There is one other clause in the bill which I shall address very 
quickly, the one which says more or less that the spouses must 
make a joint proposal if their financial relationship requires 
co-ordinated repayment on their part. These new provisions will 
make it possible to rationalize procedures and reduce costs. I am 
not sure I have properly understood all this. I will admit honestly to 
you that I could not find it in the bill, not because it is not there, but 
because the bill is too bulky to find it among all the 
cross-references and annotations that are very hard to follow.
<P>
	But is it possible that a decision has been made to encroach on 
Quebec law? We know divorce is a federal matter, but marriage is a 
provincial one. Is the decision now being made to interfere in 
matrimonial regimes in Quebec or elsewhere, in other provinces, 
saying for example that if a husband is not solvent but his wife 
works, they will both be put in the same pot, both will go bankrupt, 
pay the trustee and make the major banks happy by paying off their 
creditors? Is that what the plan is?
<P>
	If that is the intent, it is a disquieting one. This would put an end 
to matrimonial regimes, or at least meddle rather too seriously and 
perhaps somewhat too harmfully in the area of marriage in Quebec. 
Relationships within a marriage are sacred in our province, and we 
have-as the Prime Minister has been saying ad nauseam-been 
living with the tradition of a Napoleonic code since around 1806.
<P>
	I therefore feel that the Bloc members will not be able to 
subscribe in any way, if such is the intent of the legislator in this 
case, to this encroachment I perceive in the provinces' 
constitutional jurisdiction over marriage.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	You are signalling that my time is almost up, Mr. Speaker. I still 
have some time left. We go on and on, but you can see that we are 
well intentioned. Someone said: Hell is paved with the 
well-intentioned. I do not know where that comes from.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And it is red.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16927"> 16927 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> True, Hell also happens to be red.
<P>
	My point is, he ends on an upbeat note. He says: ``There will be 
counselling for persons related to the debtor''. I cannot wait. I 
cannot wait for someone to tell the manager of the credit union or 
the manager of the National Bank or the TD Bank or any other 
bank: ``Look, we raised $20,000 by selling the assets of the 
bankrupt, but his wife and children are taking it very hard; the poor 
things cannot cope. So I am going to take $5,000 to pay for 
counselling''.
<P>
	They are going to cause a backlog in the courts with this clause. 
Does anyone seriously think that creditors will forego a chance to 
get their money back and instead pay for counselling for the 
relatives of a bankrupt debtor? I doubt it. This is wishful thinking. 
But it is an interesting point and I must say I did not expect to find 
this in a bill dealing with bankruptcy and insolvency.
<P>
	They say that the proposed amendments harmonize Canadian 
practices regarding bankruptcy and insolvency with those of our 
international trading partners. This harmonization will simplify 
co-operation between countries in the case of the restructuring or 
insolvency of a multinational corporation and will help 
enforcement of Canadian regulations on the distribution of assets, 
creditor ranking and voidable transactions.
<P>
	I do not want to get involved in private international law at this 
point, but it was said in your basic course in Canadian private 
international law, which is after all based on international 
agreements, that the disposition of immovable goods is determined 
by their <I>lex situs</I>, their location. While as far as individual rights 
are concerned, the law of the country of residence prevails. As far 
as movable goods are concerned, the law of the owner's country of 
residence prevails.
<P>
	I cannot see how, unilaterally, through the Minister of Industry 
and this bill to amend the bankruptcy legislation, the federal 
government could come and change internationally recognized 
rules developed outside of Canada, under an agreement between 
several countries. Unless, of course-in which case, the wording of 
the bill is incorrect-it was intended to apply only the bankrupt's 
property found on Canadian soil. That would make more sense.
<P>
	Another clause puzzled me, namely the one providing that 
farmers and fishermen whose principal occupation is fishing or 
farming will not be subject to petitions in bankruptcy, even if their 
principal occupation is not their sole source of income. Farmers 
and fishermen used to be liable under the law to petitions in 
bankruptcy when they ventured outside their traditional line of 
work to supplement their income during the off season. This bill 
will ensure that they no longer face bankruptcy each time they 
become technically insolvent.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the bill does not say much about the reasons why 
this kind of provision was included. I hope  that government 
members who will be speaking on this bill, to explain it to us, will 
be able to elaborate on the motives that underlie the decision to 
include such provisions in the bill.
<P>
	That is about all I had to say at this stage of consideration of the 
bill. I am not blaming anyone. As you can see, I am not criticizing 
too strongly the government's position. I just find it unfair as it 
relates to students. Also I think it is a mistake to fail, as it does, to 
address the situation of those workers who, often, supported the 
business till the very end, when it finally declared bankruptcy, 
when, more often than not, the president and directors of the 
company are long gone. They have run off to Switzerland, as is 
fashionable these days. Low income workers, those who have 
worked hard to earn a living, cannot run away. They are forgotten 
in all this.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I urge the government to show more willingness to co-operate 
with the opposition to achieve a position that will be effective in 
maintaining this balance between the duty to pay one's debts and 
the need to survive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour to make comments about Bill C-109, a bill dealing 
with the bankruptcy and insolvency of certain businesses and 
individuals. One thing that appears in the bill is a demonstration of 
humanitarianism during bankruptcy.
<P>
	This is a particularly meaningful amendment to the bankruptcy 
act. In 1992 there was an amendment to that act. That amendment 
took place 40 years after the initial bankruptcy act was enacted; 40 
years of unamended legislation. In 1992 a three-year review clause 
was introduced which brings the act to our attention now, which is 
too short a period of time. Not enough experience was obtained as a 
result of the amendments made in 1992. Now the proposal is that 
the next amendment take place seven years hence. That makes 
really good sense.
<P>
	What is the bankruptcy act all about? It is supposed to protect 
three categories. The first is consumers. We want to protect that 
group. We want also to protect the creditors who have loaned 
money to other people. We want to protect the economy. 
Bankruptcies are disruptive to individuals, to industry and to the 
economy in general.
<P>
	We want to protect the consumer in the sense that he or she 
should not enter into debts which he or she cannot afford to repay 
or that somehow he or she has not planned to repay properly.
<P>
	How big is this problem of bankruptcies in Canada? I have a 
statement of September 1995 which I will go through to give a 
perspective of how big this problem is.  I start with Newfoundland. 
In September bankruptcies amounted to $32.1 million; in Nova 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16928"> 16928 </A></B>
<P>
Scotia, $59.7 million; in Prince Edward Island, $3.9 million; in 
New Brunswick, $35.2 million; in Quebec, $1.52 billion; in 
Ontario, $1.932 billion; in Manitoba, $32.3 million; in 
Saskatchewan, $49.475 million; in Alberta, $294 million; in 
British Columbia, $275.1 million; in the Northwest Territories, 
$1.97 million; in Yukon $29,267.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Let us put that all together. Bankruptcies in Canada in September 
represented liabilities of $4,268,000,000. That is a significant sum 
of money. That is what we are talking about when we deal with 
bankruptcies. That is one month. It is not a small issue we are 
dealing with here.
<P>
	There seems to be a psychosis developing. We have a 
government that has incurred debt upon debt. It calls it deficits 
from year to year. As that deficit accumulates from one year to the 
next, it becomes a debt on the present year. The deferral of these 
payments keeps adding up, until now it is $567 billion. That is the 
debt the Canadian government has incurred on behalf of the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	We look at the government and say if it is all right for the 
government to keep on borrowing money, maybe we can do the 
same and so we have credit cards. I do not know how many of us 
here in the House have more than one credit card, but I dare 
presume there are a number of people who do. My colleague says 
he does not. He has one. It is probably so big that he can buy a car 
on the basis of his credit card. He is probably not the only who can 
buy a car on his credit card.
<P>
	People have added debt upon debt and they follow the example 
of government. The other day the Conference Board of Canada 
made an observation that the individual Canadian has a debt load 
probably larger than it should be.
<P>
	We have at least a threefold issue being dealt with here in 
bankruptcy: the individual consumer, the creditor who has lent this 
money or provided service or material, and the economy on a larger 
basis.
<P>
	This bill is trying to reach an equilibrium that encourages 
rehabilitation, so that individuals or a company or corporation that 
finds itself in a situation in which they cannot repay their debt will 
be able to reorganize, restructure in such a way that they can 
rehabilitate themselves and again become a contributing element in 
our economy. We have to compare that rehabilitation over and 
against the obligation they have to pay off the debt they have 
incurred on behalf of someone else, on behalf of themselves, or on 
the basis of a director of a particular company.
<P>
	If a business goes bankrupt, how does it affect the economy in 
which we live? The first thing that happens is taxes go down. We do 
not collect the amount of taxes we ought to.
<P>
	My colleague from the Bloc indicated very clearly how 
disruptive it is to the employee of a company that goes bankrupt. 
The individual does not have a job any more. This has an effect on 
the family structure. It puts stress and strain on the relationship 
between husband and wife, between the parents and the children, 
between the children and their parents and it becomes increasingly 
complicated. It has an effect on the mortgage payments they have 
to make, the credit card bills they are responsible for, and a chain 
reaction develops.
<P>
	Therefore, what seemed to be one case becomes a multiplication 
factor that finds its way in a variety of cases all the way through to 
the grocery store, the furniture store, the clothing store and so on 
down the line.
<P>
	In Canada we need an economy that builds, that grows, that 
develops. This will not happen in a situation in which people are 
fearful that their business is going to go down. In one month we see 
liabilities of $4 billion being accumulated. That is very extensive. 
This is no small issue that has to be dealt with.
<P>
	I will deal with some of the provisions of the bill. The bill deals 
in a variety of areas with very technical issues. Two-thirds of the 
bill, as I understand it, have to do with technical amendments that 
try to harmonize the provisions of this legislation with the 
legislation that exists with the provinces and in other areas. It 
comes to grips with issues such as international creditors and 
bankruptcies on an international basis, securities firms and how 
they operate, and it brings into focus more accurately the situation 
as it exists between those people who are earning their livelihood in 
part from farming and fishing and in other parts from other kinds of 
income they might have.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	The old act stated that persons who declare bankruptcy, if their 
sole income is from farming and fishing, can declare bankruptcy in 
that particular area. In today's economy there are many people 
whose main income comes from fishing but it is not sufficient for 
them to earn a living and they have to supplement their income. In 
other cases people have a professional job and they have a hobby 
farm. Sometimes they will declare bankruptcy on the one side but 
not on the other. This bill brings those things into reality and 
harmonizes and balances them.
<P>
	I would like to speak on the humanitarian aspect of the 
legislation. There is one aspect in particular about which I would 
like to speak, and that has to do with the situation where a divorce 
has taken place and an individual is obligated to make support 
payments to the  spouse or children. Some of these individuals 
decide to declare bankruptcy rather than make the support 
payments. If 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16929"> 16929 </A></B>
<P>
they declare bankruptcy they will no longer be liable for the 
support payments. This bill deals with that issue. It states that the 
obligation for support payments of either a spouse or children are 
part of the liabilities, as is the case with a mortgage or a loan. In 
fact the bill goes so far as to say that support payments are a 
priority on the list of creditors to be paid. That is a very 
humanitarian approach, which is necessary.
<P>
	The bill adds another clause, which is equally significant to the 
one I have just referred to, and that has to do with difficulties that 
arise because of an assault. On that basis, the person declaring 
bankruptcy is liable and a creditor can make a claim.
<P>
	The third area has to do with student loans. At the present time 
there are a number of students who are experiencing great 
difficulty in making their student loan payments. They graduate 
from university or from some other post-secondary institution 
where they have incurred an extensive debt and they find they 
cannot make the payments. They have no prospects for a job, at 
least not immediately. They look at the situation and say: ``There is 
an easy way out of this. I will declare personal bankruptcy and then 
I will no longer be liable for the debt. It will all be over. After 
having lived the good life and behaving myself, my credit rating 
will be built up again, this will not be held against me, and my debt 
will be discharged''.
<P>
	That will no longer be possible under this bill. Students who 
incur a loan and who plan to escape from paying that loan by 
declaring bankruptcy will still be liable two years after the date on 
which their bankruptcy has been declared and accepted. Two years 
from that date they are still liable to make their student loan 
payment. At that point a new provision kicks in, which suggests 
that if the student is still having difficulty and cannot meet their 
financial obligations, other arrangements can be made. I believe 
that is a fair and equitable provision.
<P>
	The other point I want to raise has to do with the situation where 
creditors and debtors cannot agree and they fight with one another 
as to what is a reasonable settlement in terms of the portion of the 
debt that can and should be paid by the person who has declared 
bankruptcy. The bill provides for a mediation process and 
mediators so that these people do not have to go to court and incur 
expensive legal costs. Rather, mediation can take place and the 
matter can be settled out of court as expeditiously as possible. I 
think that is an excellent provision in this particular piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	The other elements in this legislation that we want to commend 
at this point have to do with the recognition that there are certain 
international insolvencies that take place. At the present time it is 
difficult to move across boundaries. You have to move assets, 
papers and things like this across borders and cases cannot be heard 
in  another country. The legislation now provides for those hearings 
to take place within the country where the insolvency takes place or 
they can be heard where the individual resides.
<P>
	Another area the bill deals with has to do with securities firms 
that go bankrupt. These are particularly difficult and highly 
complicated situations. These are securities firms ranging all the 
way from brokerage houses to houses that deal with only mutual 
funds and the complications that can arise in those situations. This 
is where I think the bill is somewhat deficient. There are 
clarifications that need to be made in this bill as to just exactly how 
those kinds of bankruptcies can be resolved and dealt with. The 
length of time it takes to deal with some of the details here is rather 
substantive. In the meantime, many things could have changed and 
probably have changed.
<P>
	It becomes very necessary for us to recognize that while this bill 
has some very positive things in it, there are some deficiencies in it.
<P>
	When we go into the technicalities of the bill, the bill has done 
some things I really found rather humorous when I looked at them. 
In the existing act it states that there is a two-day time frame in 
which to present a particular proposal. In the new act it states that it 
is going to change to three days. In another instance three days 
becomes five days. In another situation 14 days becomes 15 days. 
In another instance 15 days becomes 14 days. In another situation 
90 days becomes three months. In other cases three months 
becomes 90 days.
<P>
	When I asked the people who put the bill together why they did 
this, they said they wanted to be consistent so that it would be very 
specific. I asked a question about the old bill, which stated 90 days, 
and the new proposed bill before us states three months. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I both know that three months are not necessarily 
90 days; it could be more or less than 90 days. In that instance, we 
need to recognize that the apparent consistency is lacking. Perhaps 
the people in the committee should look at this in some detail and 
say let us be consistent: if we are going to use days then let us use 
days and if we are going to use months then let us use months, but 
let us not confuse it by moving back and forth. It is not a reasonable 
thing to do. That is one area we need to look at.
<P>
	The other thing the bill does, which I found very interesting, is 
there is no such thing as a man or a woman in this bill. There are 
only creditors and the people who are bankrupt. This is very 
interesting. I guess in order to be politically correct we no longer 
speak about men and women. We now speak about creditors and 
bankrupts. I do not know how significant this is, but there it is. A 
whole bunch of money and a lot of time has to be spent to change 
the legislation so that it becomes politically correct by taking 
gender references out of the particular legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16930"> 16930 </A></B>
<P>
	I think I am getting very close to the end of my time for today. 
I would like to touch on the area of directors' liability, but rather 
than starting halfway through here I will stop my intervention at 
this point and defer the directors' liability portion to the next 
opportunity I have to rise in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.39 p.m., I must 
now proceed to some deferred votes. The member for Okanagan 
Centre will certainly have 20 minutes remaining in his time 
allocation if he chooses to continue to speak when the bill returns 
to the House.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you were to seek it, I believe you

Liberal members voting nay.

clarification from the hon. government whip. I want to be sure that 
we are all at the same page and that the question is on the 
amendment to Motion No. 1.

on the amendment to report stage Motion No. 1.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I could help the House, the 
division is on the first question which is on the amendment to 
Motion No. 1.

amendment to report stage Motion No. 1 and now we are voting on 
the report stage Motion No. 1 itself.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We had completed voting on 
Bill C-100. If I follow the schedule given to me earlier, we are now

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ABORIGINALLANDCLAIMSCOMMISSION">ABORIGINAL LAND CLAIMS COMMISSION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of establishing a new independent aboriginal land claims 
commission, as recommended in the 1994-95 annual report of the Indian Claims 
Commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to 
present to the House this motion, which seeks to bring action on the 
recommendation of the Indian Claims Commission.
<P>
	The motion seeks the approval of the House to begin the 
discussion that will eventually lead to the establishment of a new 
Indian Claims Commission and process. I am also pleased this 
motion has been made votable, because this means the members of 
the House will now have the opportunity to formally respond to the 
incredible and excellent work the current Indian Claims 
Commission has been doing.
<P>
	Before beginning my formal remarks today, I want to thank the 
Indian Claims Commission for all its efforts in meeting the 
challenges of its difficult mandate and for preparing the 
groundwork for the next step in this important and evolving 
process. I am particularly grateful to claims commission co-chair 
Mr. Dan Bellegarde and to Mary Ellen Turpel whose legal and 
research work I borrowed for some of my presentation today.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The idea of a new claims process and policy is not a new one. As 
I will demonstrate later in my remarks not only did former Prime 
Minister John Diefenbaker advocate for an independent land 
claims process, so too did the Liberals as recently as the 1993 
election.
<P>
	However, as is also obvious it appears the current Prime Minister 
and the Liberal cabinet have to be reminded of their famous red 
book commitments and be pushed into keeping them. Most of this 
became very clear to me this summer during the unrest throughout 
Canada and particularly because of the events which took place at 
Gustafsen Lake in British Columbia and at Ipperwash in Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16947"> 16947 </A></B>
<P>
	As I listened to those news reports, watched the events unfold on 
my television screen, read the details in the newspapers and as I 
talked to concerned individuals across Canada it became clear to 
me these were not just  isolated incidents. Each had a similar 
message and each was echoed by other events unfolding elsewhere 
in British Columbia, as well as in New Brunswick and other parts 
of Canada.
<P>
	What I and other Canadians were seeing were the expressions of 
long withheld emotions centred around the meaning and 
importance of land and jurisdiction over land held by aboriginal 
people form coast to coast. These emotions fueled by frustration 
and anger led to occupations or roadblocks which led to the 
involvement of the police and the exclusion of the legitimate land 
claims process.
<P>
	In late summer I called on the Minister of Indians Affairs and 
Northern Development to get involved not just in the specific 
disputes under the eye of the media but also in the general approach 
to land claims resolutions that will have the ability to resolve 
differences before tensions erupt.
<P>
	I wrote to the minister and I even questioned him in the House 
about the possibility of beginning the process that would lead to the 
establishment of a new independent land claims policy and 
process.
<P>
	I was disappointed when the minister responded by saying he 
had to wait because he needed more direction. The process to begin 
finding that direction can be begin today. It has been clearly 
outlined by the Indian claims commission in the 1994-95 report. 
With this motion I hope the House will tell the minister to get busy, 
to get at it.
<P>
	The process, I remind the minister, cannot be dictated by the 
federal government. It must be worked out and jointly agreed on 
with the First Nations. Arthur Durocher, writing on land claims 
reform for the Indian claims commission, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are many problems associated with the present land claims policies and 
processes. Claims are backlogged and there is a general dissatisfaction on the 
part of the First Nations. Changes have to be implemented as soon as possible 
because the longer the impasse drags on, the more difficult it will become to 
break. It is important that any changes that are done be done in consultation and 
in partnership with the First Nations. There has to be sufficient political will by 
the federal government to make any process viable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In concurring with that statement, the support of the House on 
this motion will be very useful in securing action on this political 
will at this important time.
<P>
	The Indian claims commission in the 1994-95 report came out in 
July of this year just as some of the land disputes were at their peak. 
I was surprised therefore when I heard very little comment from the 
government or the media about the Indian claims commission 
report itself.
<P>
	If nothing else, the message from the commissioners at the 
beginning of the report should have alerted all of us to the 
importance of the matter in front of us. I will quote from that 
message:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ICC is mandated to find better ways of handling land claims. To this end 
we have used our considerable experience to identify problem areas and 
recommend solutions that will assist in creating a more expedient, fair and 
equitable land claims policy and process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Everything that we have learned as a commission to date indicates that it is 
imperative to commence the process of reform immediately. The return of 
native land is central to any real progress on the wide range of problems that 
face First Nations today. Meaningful self-government and true economic 
self-sufficiency are dependent upon an adequate land base. It is time for a fair 
and equitable process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	The commissioners recognized the need for immediate reform of 
the process. Now it is time for Parliament to do the same.
<P>
	The frustration felt by aboriginal people throughout Canada has 
existed for a long time. I am reminded of the comments of former 
Assembly of First Nations Grand Chief Georges Erasmus, who was 
quoted in the introduction to a book on the subject, <I>Drum Beat</I>, 
published in 1989. Erasmus notes that for generations in Canada 
governments have treated aboriginal people as a disappearing race 
and that they have administered aboriginal policy accordingly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yet we have not disappeared; we have survived, as we have done since long 
before the appearance of the Europeans, against no matter what odds. 
Unfortunately, to the present day, governments have been unconscionably slow 
in coming to terms with the fact that we will always be here, and that our claims 
for justice, land, resources, and control over our own affairs will never go away, 
and they must be fairly and honourably dealt with.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is now a widely accepted view that the current land claims 
process is not working well and that the pace and conditions for the 
resolution of land claims conflicts are inadequate.
<P>
	As Mary Ellen Turpel tells us in her work for the claims 
commission, claims resolutions in the past 20 years have seen a 
massive increase in litigation over claims even though almost 
everyone involved in the claims recognizes litigation is not the best 
method for addressing land disputes.
<P>
	The rise in court challenges is a byproduct of a failed dispute 
resolution process in the claims area and has served to reinforce an 
adversarial approach on the part of the crown and the First Nations 
in dealing with these disputes.
<P>
	It appears, Turpel says, the First Nations and the federal 
government are headed toward further confrontation and hostility. 
The only remedy is a reworking of federal claims policies and the  
establishment of an appropriate and effective process for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16948"> 16948 </A></B>
<P>
resolution of disputes between First Nations and government over 
lands and resources.
<P>
	Turpel is writing in the claims commission's proceedings report, 
special issue No. 2, dealing with land claims, issued in 1994.
<P>
	In that same report, the commission co-chairs Dan Bellegarde 
and James Prentice say very clearly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Much discussion concerning the reform of the specific claims policy has 
taken place over recent years; little of fundamental importance has been 
accomplished. There is an urgent need for reform of the specific claims process 
to provide a fair and accountable land claims process for First Nations and 
indeed for all Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we are to avoid further violence and bloodshed over unsettled land claims 
in Canada we must act now before the next confrontation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was written in September 1994, before the loss of life 
occurred at Ipperwash. Obviously action toward a resolution must 
begin, as the commissioners and others have been arguing, 
immediately.
<P>
	It should be noted that the Indian Claims Commission was 
created in 1991 partly in response to the need for a fair land claims 
process, but it was acknowledged by everyone that the creation of 
the commission was an interim step only. The time has come, as it 
acknowledges, to go beyond the interim measure.
<P>
	The commission is what has been referred to as a soft 
adjudicative tribunal in that the recommendations of the 
commission are not binding on the parties but rather are only 
advisory in nature. This means that at the completion of an inquiry 
the parties are not bound by the recommendations of the 
commission. In the end the federal government still must respond 
to the findings of the inquiry and the recommendations of the 
commission, and has only recently begun to do so.
<P>
	In the case of a band within my constituency boundaries, the 
Canoe Lake Band, the response to its inquiry took the government 
more than 18 months to produce. The motion in front of us today 
suggests the government should take action on the 
recommendation of the claims commission's most recent report.
<P>
	Before we run out of time in the debate today I will outline these 
recommendations. Recommendation No. 1 is the important one. It 
says that Canada and the First Nations should develop and 
implement a new claims policy and process that does not involve 
the present circumstances wherein Canada judges claims against 
itself.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The commission says the present system involves a fundamental 
flaw; Canada must judge claims against itself. This is a manifest 
conflict of interest especially when Canada stands in a fiduciary 
relationship toward the claimant First Nation.
<P>
	It is imperative, the commission says, that an independent 
claims body be established to perform at least the initial 
assessment of the validity of First Nations land claims against 
Canada. Mary Ellen Turpel notes in her work: ``A full appreciation 
of the federal government's fiduciary obligations, which represent 
a considerable and serious duty to act in the interests of the First 
Nations, has been the glaring omission in the claims process''.
<P>
	In the absence of a new policy, the claims commission brought 
forward five other recommendations which must be implemented 
in order to make the existing but temporary process more fair. The 
commission's second recommendation is to put fairness into the 
current policy.
<P>
	The 1994-95 report says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When First Nations submit specific claims to Canada they are encouraged to 
include for consideration the legal opinion of their lawyer along with their 
historical research. However, when Canada communicates its decision to accept 
or reject the claim, it relies on solicitor-client privilege and refuses to disclose 
its legal opinion from the Department of Justice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The claims commission says that Canada has an obligation to 
provide that legal opinion.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To do less fails to meet the requirements of the fiduciary relationship, a 
relationship that has been found to exist by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
cases such as Sparrow. The substance of Canada's legal opinion must be 
exposed to full public scrutiny if justice is to be done and seen to be done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canoe Lake report was not responded to until 18 months had 
passed. The commission notes in its third recommendation that 
situations like this are unacceptable. In calling for a response 
protocol, it says this type of response is fair to neither the claimant 
First Nation nor to the people of Canada.
<P>
	Recommendation No. 4 deals with mediation and suggests that 
government council engaged on matters before the commission 
should be given the same broad mandate to consider, recommend 
and negotiate settlement it would have if acting for the government 
in litigation over the same claim.
<P>
	The commission notes that from its inception the commission 
has vigorously sought to advance mediation as an alternative to the 
court and inquiries, both of which tend to be adversarial in nature.
<P>
	Unfortunately, it says, one of the greatest obstacles in the 
settlement of specific claims is that the Department of Justice 
typically regards its own legal opinions as being determinant on the 
questions of whether an outstanding lawful obligation exists on the 
part of the government.
<P>
	If the lawyer concludes that no such obligation exists, the 
government assumes there is no place for mediation. Since 
mediation is essentially consensual and both parties must request 
it, an opinion unfavourable to the claim ends the prospect for 
mediation before it can even begin.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16949"> 16949 </A></B>
<P>
	The commission is aware that some claims might qualify for 
reconsideration based on factors outside the legal opinion, but 
there is no authority for counsel representing Indian affairs to do 
so without access to mediation measures as suggested by the 
commission.
<P>
	The fifth recommendation deals with the need to identify and 
review all claims that were rejected based on the ban of 
pre-Confederation claims that was lifted in 1991. The commission 
wants the government to take the lead and begin the reviews and 
not leave the onus on the First Nations to ask for a review of the 
claims that were rejected prior to the alteration of the specific 
claims policy in 1991.
<P>
	Most important, the sixth recommendation of the commission is 
that Canada stop insisting on the express extinguishment of 
aboriginal rights and title as part of the settlement of specific 
claims. The commission says this is grossly unfair since the claims 
policy is not meant to deal with aboriginal title and/or rights, and 
Canada ought not to insist on their extinguishment as part of the 
settlement of a specific claim.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	This measure has been supported in the recent fact finding report 
written by Mr. Justice Hamilton, entitled ``A New Partnership'', in 
which he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Aboriginal people seek the recognition, not the surrender of their aboriginal 
rights. They are prepared to have the extent of their future rights to land and 
resources spelled out in a treaty. They are prepared to recognize the rights of 
others.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Liberals have also agreed with this, at least the Liberal 
Party, ahead of the government. The red book says that ``in order to 
be consistent with the Canadian Constitution, which now 
recognizes and affirms aboriginal and treaty rights, a Liberal 
government will not require blanket extinguishment for claims 
based on aboriginal title''.
<P>
	Prior to the general election in 1993, the leader of the Liberal 
Party, now the Prime Minister of Canada, said in Saskatoon: ``A 
Liberal government, in consultation with aboriginal peoples, would 
undertake a major overhaul of the federal claims policy on a 
national basis''.
<P>
	In the red book, that now famous catalogue of Liberal promises, 
the Liberals acknowledged that if aboriginal communities are to 
become self-sufficient they must have an adequate land and 
resource base upon which to grow. That is why a Liberal 
government is committed to overhauling the land claims policy in 
ways that will make the process ``more fair, more efficient, and less 
costly''.
<P>
	Two years after the election, it appears that we have to push the 
Liberals into meeting their own promises-not just the claims 
commission, not just aboriginal people from coast to coast, but the 
House of Commons as well. If the Liberals have failed to deliver on 
this promise and if we must push, then push we will, because this is 
one promise that is worth fulfilling.
<P>
	I want the House to know that prior to putting this motion on the 
Order Paper and having it called for debate today I took the issue to 
my own party at its national convention in October of this year. I 
am pleased to say that support for a new claims commission had 
the unanimous support of delegates attending the national 
convention of New Democrats. They, like me, consider the issue to 
be of critical importance to our nation.
<P>
	The Grand Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ovide 
Mercredi, played a crucial and important role during the land 
occupations this past summer. The grand chiefs and the chiefs of 
the AFN have been doing a fantastic job in preparing for a new land 
claims policy and process. I ask the Minister of Indian Affairs to 
ensure that the AFN is central to any decisions that are made in this 
regard.
<P>
	I conclude my remarks today by again referring to the work of 
Mary Ellen Turpel, who says that consensus for an independent 
claims commission is evident but that concentrated effort and good 
will are needed to take the proposal for such a commission from the 
stage of political consensus to one of policy implementation in a 
legislative framework. It cannot be done unilaterally by 
government. Implementing these proposals will require a process 
whereby First Nations leaders and federal ministers come together 
over a short period of time to decide on an implementation strategy 
to draft the protocol and develop legislation and resolutions.
<P>
	Because of lack of time I did not talk about the expiration of the 
mandate of the joint working group and the good work the joint 
working group completed. However, I must say that this is the type 
of process that needs to be reactivated with a broader mandate.
<P>
	I will quote Mary Ellen Turpel one last time:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The agenda for land claims reforms is stalled at present. This is a tragic 
situation, given that so many options are available for immediate progress and 
all parties in the political process have identified a common set of problems and 
made a commitment to reform. If we continue to delay the process of land 
claims reform, we face further hostility as the prospects for an enduring 
peaceful relationship between First Nations and the crown grow dimmer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Today, at the beginning of the debate on this votable motion, I 
thanked the chiefs for their patience and their unending 
commitment to their people. I thank the Indian Claims 
Commission for their excellent work in moving this critical issue 
forward. I urge all members of the House to support the motion so 
that the Minister of Indian Affairs and the government know that it 
has the support for change, which must be made sooner rather than 
later. I ask that I be given the opportunity to close this debate when 
that time comes.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to respond to the motion by 
the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake and to debate 
the claims policy and the establishment of a claims commission.
<P>
	The government has been looking for ways to promote a 
commission that would be fair and would be seen to be fair to all 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians who are affected by the 
settlement of land claims.
<P>
	The hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake has been a 
strong advocate in the House of policies aimed at resolving the 
outstanding issues relating to the claims process. We have listened 
to his advice and are looking forward to hearing what the Reform 
Party has to add.
<P>
	As for the Liberal government, our approach to the claims 
process was spelled out in our 1993 election platform. In the red 
book we placed aboriginal issues at the centre of the public policy 
agenda. We devoted one of the eight chapters in <I>Creating 
Opportunity</I> exclusively to aboriginal issues and raised the 
awareness of the impact of other policies on aboriginal Canadians 
throughout the document.
<P>
	We promised the role of our government would be to provide 
aboriginal people with the necessary tools to become self-sufficient 
and self-governing. We also said that our priority would be to help 
aboriginal communities in their efforts to address the obstacles to 
their development and help them marshal the human and physical 
resources necessary to build and sustain vibrant communities.
<P>
	We promised our government would build new partnerships with 
aboriginal peoples based on trust and mutual respect. A fair and 
effective land claims process is essential for those objectives. The 
resolution of the claims must be a priority for all Canadians.
<P>
	Both aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians require certainty 
with respect to land rights so that we can get on with the building of 
the economy, creating jobs and growth, and making our 
communities better places for our children.
<P>
	In the red book we acknowledged that the current process for 
resolving land claims could be improved. We said a Liberal 
government would implement major changes to the current 
approach, and we have been working toward that goal.
<P>
	We have been working alongside the Assembly of First Nations 
to find a better way to proceed with the resolution of claims. The 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has received 
several suggestions. Among them is a proposal for an independent 
Indian land claims commission, as recommended in the annual 
report of the Indian Claims Commission and as  advocated by the 
hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	We on this side of the House have no objection to such an 
independent commission. In fact, in the red book we stated that ``A 
Liberal government would be prepared to create, in co-operation 
with aboriginal peoples, an independent claims commission to 
speed up and facilitate the resolution of all claims''. This shows 
that we do not oppose the principles outlined in the hon. member's 
motion.
<P>
	However, I would like to point out to the House a key phrase of 
the commitment from the Liberal policy platform. It is that we 
would create the independent claims commission in co-operation 
with the aboriginal peoples. Building a consensus among the 
aboriginal peoples will require time, and we cannot act unilaterally. 
We cannot impose a solution that will be supported by some but not 
by others.
<P>
	One of the major issues at stake is whether a new independent 
claims commission will be a court-like system with binding 
judgments or a mediation system with functions similar to those 
the Indian Claims Commission now performs.
<P>
	Another issue is whether we can find a better way to bring 
matters to the attention of the commission. As hon. members are 
aware, under the current system a claim must be rejected by the 
Indian affairs department before the matter is brought before the 
commission. The minister has invited the Assembly of First 
Nations to provide substantive comments on concrete proposals for 
change. In co-operation with the First Nations, we are examining 
how the claim policies can be overhauled within the climate of 
financial restraint that affects us all.
<P>
	The Assembly of First Nations has embarked on a project that 
will involve developing terms of reference for a joint Canada and 
First Nations review of the Indian Claims Commission. We will 
have to reach a consensus on these and other issues before we can 
reform the current system. We need directions from the First 
Nations on what kind of system they want.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	In the meantime, the government has taken the steps required to 
make sure the system now in place works as efficiently as possible. 
When we look at what has been accomplished in the past few years, 
it becomes quite clear that the current system can be used more 
effectively than it had been before the red book commitments 
regarding claims process reforms were made.
<P>
	Consider these figures: After 1990-91 the total cumulative 
settlements for specific claims numbered only 43. By 1994-95 we 
have more than tripled that figure to 142. Since taking office this 
government has settled 45 specific claims. In 1994-95 we settled 
18 different specific claims, for a total of nearly $79 million. That 
is money that will go into aboriginal communities. It will create  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16951"> 16951 </A></B>
<P>
jobs for aboriginal as well as non-aboriginal people. It will improve 
living conditions and it will make aboriginal people partners in the 
development of a strong and dynamic Canadian society.
<P>
	Today we are involved in negotiations on another 90 specific 
claims or are in the process of reviewing another 240 claims 
submitted by the First Nations. We expect that by the end of the 
1995-96 fiscal year we will have settled another 20 to 30 specific 
claims and we will also continue to receive further claims, which 
will have to work through the current system until a better system 
is devised in co-operation with First Nations.
<P>
	I am certain the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake appreciates these points. He wants what is fair for aboriginal 
people in Canada, as does this government.
<P>
	[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.]
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak in support of the motion standing in the 
name of the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake.
<P>
	The motion reads as follows: That, in the opinion of this House, 
the government should consider the advisability of establishing a 
new, independent aboriginal land claims commission, as 
recommended in the 1994-95 annual report of the Indian Claims 
Commission.
<P>
	Anyone who has followed the issue of aboriginal land claims in 
Canada for a number of years will realize it is a matter of 
astonishing complexity. The First Nations were here in Canada 
before European immigrants came to settle the land, as we used to 
say. The aboriginal peoples occupied certain lands. In the past 10, 
15, 20 or 30 years they have started to realize certain rights to those 
lands still existed, and various First Nations started filing land 
claims.
<P>
	It stands to reason that people living in often difficult social and 
economic circumstances should want to establish a land base where 
they can develop their potential, improve their situation and 
maintain their identity as a nation, as a people.
<P>
	It is therefore entirely normal that the various First Nations 
should file these claims. Now it so happens that certain things have 
been accomplished, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs told us a few moments ago that certain 
claims had been settled with First Nations. Claims are now being 
negotiated, and it is expected that a number of claims will be 
settled within the next few years.
<P>
	However, it is a fact that the existing mechanism is not perfect. 
The process is very slow. Some very relevant questions are being 
asked about the impartiality of the system, because under the 
present system, various  aboriginal peoples and communities file a 
claim, which is then examined by the appropriate federal 
authorities.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	The federal government is almost in the situation of being a 
judge while, at the same time, having fiduciary responsibilities 
toward various native peoples. I think the government is, in a way, 
in a conflict of interest situation, where often, because of political 
imperatives, it cannot easily ensure quick claim resolution of 
claims, in my opinion.
<P>
	Clearly, at this point, the process becomes blocked, despite the 
best intentions of the government, and I do not doubt them. But I 
imagine that if, as proposed by the member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake, we could set up an independent native 
territorial claims commission, we could clarify the whole process. 
We could clarify it for all Canadians, and we could clarify it for the 
various first nations.
<P>
	I think it is important to clarify the process not only for the 
native populations, but for the people of Canada. Since becoming 
more closely involved with native issues, because I sit on the 
House Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development, I have been talking with my constituents in my 
riding and in my region. I realize that most people are sympathetic 
to the claims of native peoples, but are often critical because they 
consider the claims at times exaggerated and not in keeping with 
what they consider reality.
<P>
	We often see maps in the paper, of either Quebec or Canada, 
depicting native territorial claims. If we superimpose a map of the 
land claims made by the various First Nations in Quebec on a map 
of the province, we can see that their claims cover almost all of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I think that this is likely to cause many people to fear and be 
concerned about legitimate native demands, and even to reject 
them. People feel that their claims are out of all proportion to the 
populations involved.
<P>
	The various native communities in Quebec may number 50,000, 
60,000 or 65,000 people, depending on how you count them. 
People are asking how 60,000, 65,000 or even 80,000 natives can 
claim the Quebec territory and, in a way, challenge the rights of six 
or seven million Quebecers now living on this territory.
<P>
	This is the kind of situation that could easily lead to prejudice 
developing. Just look at what is reported in the press and listen to 
open line programs. Aboriginal land claims are often opposed on 
the grounds that they are viewed as undue and unfounded.
<P>
	I think that this situation ought to be resolved as quickly as 
possible. At the rate settlements are reached these days, according 
to the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development himself, I think that this issue is 
not about  to disappear; it will remain hot and red for quite some 
time. If we take too long to resolve the situation, there is risk of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16952"> 16952 </A></B>
<P>
rejection reaction on the part of non-natives in Canada. In addition, 
decisions might be made at the political level that do not fairly 
reflect the legitimate demands of aboriginal people.
<P>
	It is important that the federal cabinet and the Liberal 
government fulfil the promises made in the red book in 1993, when 
they stated clearly that ``the current process of resolving 
comprehensive and specific claims is simply not working. A 
Liberal government will implement major changes to the current 
approach. A Liberal government will be prepared to create, in 
co-operation with aboriginal peoples, an independent claims 
commission to speed up and facilitate the resolution of all claims''. 
This is precisely what the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake and the Indians Claims Commission 
are asking for.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	The federal government should act as quickly as possible for the 
good of all Canadians and for the good of the aboriginal nations 
that live on Canadian territory and have valid claims to parts of that 
territory.
<P>
	Everyone agrees. Earlier, the parliamentary secretary to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development said: ``We 
will probably do it in the future. We do not know yet what will be 
the nature of the commission. However, I think we have been 
talking for two years under the present government, and previous 
governments have also dealt with these questions.
<P>
	Therefore, in the interest of Quebecers, Canadians and all the 
different aboriginal nations, I think it is important that the 
government examines as quickly as possible the possibility and the 
urgency of creating a commission like that one so that at long last 
Canada and Quebec can solve the problem of aboriginal claims 
because it is vital for the native people. It is vital for them to keep 
their identity, which is to important. It is crucial to preserve the 
identity of a people. To preserve that identity, the territorial claims 
must be settled to that these people can have the necessary basis for 
their economic, cultural and social development. 
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake in my home province for bringing this motion forward.
<P>
	It is always a pleasure to speak to issues involving Indian people. 
I spent two years on an Indian reserve at Wollaston Lake in 
northern Saskatchewan, so I have a pretty clear idea of what 
barriers exist for the aboriginal people living in and around these 
communities. My constituency of Yorkton-Melville has five 
Indian reserves which I represent in the House. Therefore I have  
more than just a passing interest in the subject of Indian land 
claims.
<P>
	The motion we are debating asks the government to ``consider 
the advisability of establishing a new, independent aboriginal land 
claims commission as recommended in the 1994-95 annual report 
of the Indian Claims Commission''. I read the annual report 
referred to in the motion and the commission's recommendation 
No. 1 states: ``Canada and the First Nations should develop and 
implement a new claims policy and process that does not involve 
the present circumstances wherein Canada judges claims against 
itself''.
<P>
	The last time I spoke in the House on Indian land claims was 
during the debate on Bill C-33 regarding the Yukon land claims in 
June 1994.
<P>
	The Reform Party is way ahead of the government in the area of 
aboriginal affairs policy. I would like to bring everyone up to date 
on the progress we have made.
<P>
	In June 1994 I was one of several Reform MPs who had the 
privilege of participating in the Reform Party's aboriginal affairs 
task force. We met with many native people and even made a trip to 
Norway House in northern Manitoba. Mainly the concerns were 
about self-government, mismanagement of band funds, patronage 
and nepotism, and land claims.
<P>
	In October of this year the leader of the Reform Party and 
Reform's aboriginal affairs critics released the party's aboriginal 
affairs task force report. The report was prepared following many 
public meetings held all across the country, but mainly in western 
Canada. Our task force met with native and non-native people. We 
were disappointed that for the most part Indian leaders boycotted 
the Reform Party's meetings.
<P>
	Now, after the release of our 14-point plan, the aboriginal leaders 
are complaining that we did not consult them. Every band in 
western Canada was invited to the meetings and the vast majority 
of Indian leaders refused our invitation.
<P>
	I am sorry that I do not have time to outline the Reform Party's 
complete 14-point plan in the House today, but here is what our 
task force report said about land claims:
<P>
<B>(1925 )</B>
<P>
	Point number one: Indian treaties will be fully honoured 
according to their original intent and in keeping with court 
interpretation.
<P>
	Point number four: Land claim agreements and self-government 
agreements will be negotiated under the principle of equality for 
and among all persons. Settlement of land claims will be negotiated 
publicly. All settlements will outline specific terms, be final and 
conclude within a specific time frame. Final settlements will be 
affordable to Canada and the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16953"> 16953 </A></B>
<P>
	Point number five: Individuals residing on settlement lands will 
have the freedom to opt for private ownership of their 
entitlements.
<P>
	Point number six: Property owners forced to defend their 
property rights as a result of the aboriginal land claims will be 
compensated for the defence of the claim.
<P>
	A few weeks ago I was on a CBC Saskatchewan radio phone-in 
show discussing and debating the merits of our proposed aboriginal 
affairs policy. After I got home, I got a call from a woman, a native 
elder from a nearby community. She was positively excited about 
our ideas. She said that she wanted to start getting a petition signed 
supporting our new approach.
<P>
	Here is how her petition reads: ``We, the undersigned citizens of 
Canada, who also happen to be of Indian ancestry, draw attention of 
the House to the following: That we oppose in principle the 
government's approach to self-government and land claim 
settlements which would entrench forever a top down, 
paternalistic, race based system of government for Indian people 
run by bureaucrats, band leaders and tribal council leaders for the 
primary benefit of the bureaucrats, band leaders and tribal council 
leaders, not necessarily the individual members of the band; 
furthermore that we support in principle the Reform approach for 
self-government and land claim settlements which would give each 
individual Indian person real choices about how we want our 
money to be paid to us, how we want our benefits, entitlements and 
services to be delivered to us and whether we want our land to be 
owned and managed by the band or owned and managed by 
ourselves privately. Therefore your Indian petitioners request that 
Parliament move and support legislation which will protect the 
treaty rights, equality rights, democratic rights and property rights 
of each individual Indian band member, thereby giving us the right 
to opt for private ownership of a share of any land entitlements and 
the right to opt to receive our money and benefits directly from the 
government or through the Indian self-government''.
<P>
	Is it not very interesting that that comes from the native people 
themselves? This petition is being circulated by an Indian elder 
among aboriginal people in my constituency. It is clear we cannot 
continue the way we have been.
<P>
	It is clear from everything I have seen during the two years I 
lived and worked on an Indian reserve in northern Saskatchewan 
that more money is not the solution. In fact more handouts simply 
perpetuate the problem. Whenever handouts, compensation or any 
benefits are given to anyone in society without that person being 
held accountable and responsible, it will eventually harm the one 
receiving it. That harm will spread like a cancer to the rest of 
society.
<P>
	It does not matter whether the person or group receiving the 
handout is native or non-native, welfare has failed wherever it has 
been tried. Now native  communities and native people are feeling 
the full effects of receiving handouts with no accountability, 
handouts given with no clear stated objectives and handouts given 
with no means by which to measure progress. The Reform Party's 
recommendations are made with the sincere intent to correct the 
colossal mistakes of years past.
<P>
	Now we come to the motion we are debating this evening. Our 
task force was silent on the process by which land claims would be 
settled. It follows that we need to establish some kind of an 
independent commission to accomplish this goal. After reading the 
annual report of the current Indian claims commission it is clear 
that the current system is not very effective. There seems to be a lot 
of overlap and duplication which creates much bureaucracy and a 
colossal waste of money with little being accomplished.
<P>
<B>(1930 )</B>
<P>
	The other aspect we must consider is the overall direction the 
Liberal government is headed in using the current settlement 
process which ultimately confers special status, special 
entitlements and creates separate enclaves based solely on race. It 
is not a policy and process based on equality; this is a policy of 
apartheid.
<P>
	Before an independent aboriginal land claims commission could 
be effective, the negotiating principles have to change. We would 
argue that the principles espoused by the Reform Party's aboriginal 
affairs task force are a good place to start. As long as the 
negotiating principles can be changed so our starting point is 
accepted by all Canadians, then I would have to agree with the 
Indian claims commission recommendation.
<P>
	It does not make much sense for the department of Indian affairs 
to be negotiating agreements and then also to be the final arbiter for 
the Government of Canada. I have to agree there is an obvious 
conflict of interest. Therefore, it is obvious we need some kind of 
independent process.
<P>
	What choices do we have for an independent land claims 
process? We have an independent aboriginal land claims 
commission which I suppose would replace the current Indian 
claims commission as proposed in the motion we are debating 
today. We have a treaty ombudsman as recommended by Mel 
Smith, Q.C., a constitutional expert, in his recent book, <I>Our Home 
or Native Land?</I>, or we have the court system.
<P>
	Until we have reconstructed our fundamental negotiating 
principles for dealing with land claims and until these fundamental 
negotiating principles have the support of the majority of people in 
Canada, I do not think it is possible to say which option is the 
preferred one.
<P>
	This having been said, I would like to give my qualified support 
to the motion put forward today by my hon. friend from The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake. After all his  motion just says that this 
House ``consider the advisability of''. If this House considers the 
advisability of replacing the current land claims commission with 
an independent body, just maybe we will be able to have a full 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16954"> 16954 </A></B>
<P>
public debate about the terms of reference of this new independent 
aboriginal land claims commission.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of establishing a new, independent aboriginal land claims 
commission, as recommended in the 1994-95 annual report of the Indian Claims 
Commission.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I appreciate the way the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake has phrased this motion. We are 
considering the advisability.
<P>
	The hon. member knows this is a complex issue. He knows we 
cannot act precipitously. He knows there are many different 
perspectives and that First Nations themselves have some 
reservations about how an independent claims commission would 
affect the claims process.
<P>
	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
been discussing these issues with the First Nations. We hope a 
consensus will be reached but in the meantime the debate over the 
hon. member's motion will help this House focus on some of the 
issues involved.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of the process now in place. It 
is a process that has been used successfully in the past although 
there is certainly room for improvement. At present, there are six 
steps to processing a specific claim.
<P>
	In the first step the First Nation submits a claim along with 
supporting documents to the specific claims branch of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. The 
branch then determines whether the claim meets the submission 
criteria of the policy.
<P>
	Second, the submitted research contained in the supporting 
documents is analyzed and verified for completeness. The 
department works with the First Nation to prepare a historical 
report and analysis. Both parties must agree on the report. This is 
what is known as the research step, and it can take a long time to 
complete.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	The third step is acceptance or non-acceptance of the claim. The 
specific claims branch of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development obtains legal opinions on the claim and a 
decision is made to accept or not accept the claim for negotiation. 
If the claim is accepted, we move on to the fourth step: negotiation. 
The specific claims branch negotiates with the claimant First 
Nation on the value of the losses and prepares an authority to settle.
<P>
	In the fifth step, the specific claims branch and the claimant First 
Nation agree on compensation and provision for settlement and 
agreement in principle is struck. The agreement is drafted by the 
Department of Justice and First Nation lawyers into a formal 
settlement agreement. Finally, the settlement agreement is ratified 
and implemented.
<P>
	This is a long and painstaking process. There is a fast-track 
procedure for claims less than $500,000 in which some of the six 
steps are shortened.
<P>
	Where does the Indian Specific Claims Commission come into 
play? If in the course of these steps Canada turns down the claim, 
the First Nation has a number of options: it can withdraw its claim; 
it can move to litigation; it can present new documentation and 
legal arguments; or the First Nation can request a review of the 
department's decision by the Indian Specific Claims Commission. 
The commission has been established to resolve such disputes and 
it can subpoena records and witnesses. It can help the government 
and claimant First Nations arrange mediation.
<P>
	The commission's 1994-95 annual report indicates an 
involvement in mediation of five claims. The commission also 
pointed out in this report that it had received 98 requests, 42 of 
which were in progress. The commission reported eight completed 
inquiries.
<P>
	Let me tell members about one case where the ISCC was 
instrumental. In the Chippewas of the Thames inquiry, the Muncey 
land claim, the First Nation had rejected settlement twice before 
the commission became involved. The original point of contention 
about the surrender of land was resolved early in the ISCC process 
and a fresh settlement agreement was negotiated and ratified on 
January 28, 1995.
<P>
	Let me briefly explain how the commission works. If the 
department has not accepted a claim, the commission can make 
recommendations on whether the First Nation has established that 
Canada has an outstanding lawful obligation. If the department has 
accepted the claim, but the First Nation disagrees with the 
compensation criteria, the commission can recommend which 
compensation criteria should apply to the negotiation and 
settlement of the specific claim.
<P>
	There are five steps the Indian Specific Claims Commission 
goes through. First, it receives a First Nation's request for a review 
of the Department's decision. Second, it decides whether or not to 
review the decision. Third, the ISCC gathers all relevant 
information from the First Nation and Canada in relation to the 
specific claim, including the opinions of experts. The ISCC will 
also go into the claimant community and record the testimony or 
information of the members of the First Nation. Fourth, 
representatives from both the First Nation and the government 
argue their case by setting out their interpretation of facts, legal 
views, and conclusions. Finally, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16955"> 16955 </A></B>
<P>
the commission makes its  recommendations based on the existing 
specific claims policy.
<P>
	The commission does have some limitations. It cannot consider 
a claim based on unextinguished aboriginal title. These matters 
would be the subject of a comprehensive claim under a separate 
policy.
<P>
	What is the value of the commission? First, it provides an 
opportunity for a body other than a court to review Canada's 
decision. Second, the commission has been successful in bringing 
both sides together with an impartial, neutral third party as a 
mediator. The mediator has no decision making power, but he or 
she does have the power to direct and interpret the exchange of 
information. This influences perceptions, preferences and demands 
of both parties and it often implies possible lines of agreement.
<P>
	This is the system that now exists. The system has its challenges. 
First Nations have expressed a concern that the commission is 
named by the government and therefore, in spite of the best 
intentions, cannot shake off the appearance of bias. The process is 
cumbersome. The commission intervenes only after a First Nation 
has been turned down by the department.
<P>
	We will explore many options in the course of debating the 
motion from the hon. member. However, what we must bear in 
mind is that no changes should be made without the concurrence of 
the First Nations.
<P>
	The minister has been consulting with the First Nations and I am 
very confident that a consensus will be reached. In the meantime, 
this exploration of the issues arising from this motion is most 
welcome.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It being 7.44, the House stands adjourned until 2 p.m. tomorrow, 
pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.44 p.m.)
