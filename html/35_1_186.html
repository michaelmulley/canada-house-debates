	The House resumed from March 28 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial 
Administration Act and other acts in consequence thereof 
(exempted crown corporations) be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think you would find unanimous consent for the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That notwithstanding any order of this House, any recorded division to be 
taken on Bill C-263 later this day be deferred until Tuesday, April 25 at 5.30 
p.m.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When Bill C-263 was last 
before the House the hon. member for St. Boniface had 
approximately five minutes remaining in debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to continue my address on the bill presented by the hon. 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. As previously 
stated, I believe that the objectives of the bill are well intended. 
My colleagues and I are in favour of ensuring adequate 
accountability for all crown corporations. However, the 
proposed bill has a number of shortcomings which I will 
continue to review today.
<P>
	The last time I spoke on the bill I examined some of the 
reasons for exemptions. Exemptions reflect some of the very 
special sensitivities in the relationship between the government 
and these particular corporations. Each has been created by a 
special act which carefully outlines a very specific mandate. For 
some the act sets out requirements for the administration of 
resources. This becomes of particular importance in ensuring 
the accountability among these crown corporations which 
provide, for example, grants. A case in point is the Canada 
Council.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is of paramount importance that the Canada Council be 
permitted to freely select recipients of grants and that this be the 
public's perception. I am of the opinion that the artistic value of 
a work is not a political issue and that it is inappropriate for the 
government to set conditions in this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Similarly, I believe strongly in protecting the mandated 
freedom of the CBC in areas of programming and journalistic 
independence. This freedom led to the provision that the CBC 
also be exempted from part X in 1984.
<P>
	I recognize that the hon. member deliberately left out the CBC 
in order to remove, as much as possible, contentious issues. My 
concern is that the reasons for granting exemption from part X 
for other corporations, such as the Canadian Wheat Board, 
present issues which may be viewed as equally contentious, 
especially by Canadians or groups of Canadians these 
corporations serve.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Should we not first hold comprehensive consultations with 
the affected parties to examine these issues in depth?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It appears to me the bill fails to recognize as much as it should 
that the unique mandates of the affected corporations require 
more serious consideration in developing an appropriate 
accountability framework.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11650"> 11650 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly there are reasons for some of these corporations to be 
agents rather than non-agents of the crown. There are also 
reasons why their employees are not public servants. Bill 
C-263, in my opinion, does not deal with the importance of 
these reasons sufficiently clearly.
<P>
	Experience over the last 10 years has shown that generally 
there may be merit in bringing other corporations under a 
modified form of accountability framework similar to the 
regime now in place for the CBC. Bill C-263 does not provide 
for these modifications which I believe are necessary.
<P>
	I am confident that additional efforts will be made by this 
government to balance improvements in accountability for 
exempt crown corporations with the desirable degree of 
independence. In fact, the bill assists us in doing this.
<P>
	Owing to the reservations and inconsistencies in the approach 
reflected in Bill C-263-and I do not say that unkindly because I 
recognize that the hon. member did not have all of the resources 
available to him-I must declare that I cannot recommend 
support for this bill as presented in the House. However, I wish 
to state that, notwithstanding my opposition to the bill, the 
government is committed to sound financial management for all 
of its crown corporations. Improvements can always be sought 
and we will make them.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	We recognize that the situation for the exempt crown 
corporations named in the hon. member's bill is unique and that 
the bill fails to adequately deal with that fact. This does not 
mean that we are blindly opposed to a re-examination of how to 
best ensure appropriate accountability.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board will therefore 
communicate with his colleagues responsible for these 
corporations asking them to review once more the opportunities 
to improve the accountability system now in place for each of 
them. This examination process would be done on a case by case 
basis respecting the special needs of each corporation's 
mandate. It would include examining the need for changes to 
legislation paralleling the model for CBC if appropriate.
<P>
	There are several ways to deal with this. I am confident that in 
partnership with the directors and managers of crown 
corporations, the government will continue to demonstrate a 
strong commitment to managing the corporations effectively 
and efficiently with due regard for all of the best and most sound 
principles of accountability to the taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-263 ensures that the federal government is 
accountable to the Canadian taxpayer. I feel strongly that 
members from all sides of the House should rally in support of 
Bill C-263 so that we can honestly say that we have tried to 
respond to the wishes of the people who sent us here.
<P>
	As members know, in the 1993 fiscal year crown corporations 
incurred losses totalling some $57 million. Their net borrowing 
from the Government of Canada amounted to $14.2 billion. 
Crown corporations received $4.6 billion from government 
through budgetary appropriations.
<P>
	Our task in this Chamber is to ensure that every government 
department and agency be accountable for every tax dollar 
spent. I dare say that everyone in the House wants to be able to 
say to the people at home that we are responsible to the people 
who ultimately pay the bills: the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The auditor general has a key role to play in this regard. In 
many cases, which I will refer to in a moment, the auditor 
general has not only made available the exact facts and figures 
concerning the activities and performance of the federal 
government but the auditor general has been able to improve 
such activities and performance levels by dissecting and 
evaluating agencies and departments.
<P>
	No shame is involved in the work performed by the auditor 
general. The auditor's detection of poor performance and 
recommendations is seen by Canadians as routine and to be 
expected. Canadian firms large and small perform audits on 
their activities and performance. Often audits show they are on 
the right track with objectives and sometimes they must swallow 
tough medicine to cure ailments detected in their business by 
such audits.
<P>
	This is a fact of life and it should apply to government as well. 
Canadians expect their government to follow the good business 
practices followed in the private sector.
<P>
	No one can deny the performance of auditors general in recent 
history. In fact progress has been made. The auditor general has 
the power to follow up on his recommendations. The result has 
been that in many cases Canadians are realizing better value for 
their tax dollars because of the efforts of the auditor general.
<P>
	With reforms instituted in 1984, most crown corporations 
have operated within the accountability framework established 
under part X of the Financial Administration Act. Part X of the 
act requires each crown corporation to submit an annual report. 
The annual report, in addition to its financial statement and the 
auditor's report also presents information on how well the 
objectives of the corporation were reached during the reporting 
period. Second, crown corporations are expected to submit a 
corporate plan and third, budget summaries for tabling in 
Parliament. These are good measures. In my view these 
requirements are basic and simple. They are not unreasonable 
and yet we have a system in government in which crown 
corporations are not required to do these basics.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11651"> 11651 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Canadians expect their tax dollars to be spent within this 
framework of accountability. When Canadians hear of money 
being spent by the federal government without the above criteria 
being met they become quite naturally suspicious.
<P>
	There are good reasons for Canadians to feel this way. The 
Financial Administration Act could easily be made applicable to 
crown corporations listed in Bill C-263. There are 49 crown 
corporations. Bill C-263 deals with five which are exempted 
from the Financial Administration Act: the Canada Council, the 
Canadian Film Development Board, Telefilm Canada, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the International Development 
Research Centre and the National Arts Centre.
<P>
	Bill C-263 would move these crown corporations under the 
supervision of the auditor general. This is an absolute necessity 
considering the amount of dollars consumed by these five 
agencies.
<P>
	The CBC is not included in Bill C-263. The reason for this is 
that Canadian Broadcasting Corporation provisions for the 
Financial Administration Act were incorporated into the 
Broadcasting Act in 1991. In short, the CBC is already subject to 
the accountability requirements of Bill C-263 and the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	This latter point is important for members of the House to 
note. The CBC is the recipient of about 70 per cent of all 
government funding provided to crown corporations that are 
exempt. This means Bill C-263 is finishing a job already 
accomplished by Parliament. Since 1991 the CBC has adjusted 
to the accountability requirements of part X of the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	Hon. members may agree with my observation that the CBC, 
more than any other exempt crown corporation in Bill C-263, 
was most insistent about the idea of critical importance of an 
arm's length relationship to the government. The CBC has not 
had the difficulties it anticipated in adapting to these 
accountability requirements. The CBC has been operating 
within this framework for the last four years without too much 
difficulty.
<P>
	I remind colleagues that the auditor general already performs 
financial audits on the five corporations in Bill C-263. 
However, these audits do not permit the auditor general to 
comment on the appropriateness of the activities of the five, nor 
is the auditor able to comment on the extent to which each fulfils 
its mandate.
<P>
	As it stands now these are not value for money audits. This 
must be a necessity for these five corporations. Value for money 
audits are done every five years. They are different from annual 
audits in that they comment on corporate management, goals 
and objectives.
<P>
	It is fair to say the boards of the exempt corporations should 
welcome the value for money audits in much the  same way 
private sector enterprises welcome their annual audits in which 
their forecasting and business plans come under the scrutiny of 
their shareholders and an auditor.
<P>
	It is not unthinkable that the board members would look on 
the audits as helpful to their own work as well as a positive 
accountability measure, something that has been missing in 
many of these crown corporations within the framework of 
government operations.
<P>
	It has been 10 years since this accountability framework for 
crown corporations was established. Exempt corporations have 
now had a decade to review and analyse effects of the Financial 
Administration Act on the independence of non-exempt crown 
corporations. By now it is highly likely the crown corporations 
exempted from the act would conclude that the Financial 
Administration Act poses no real threat to them. The CBC is an 
illustration of this. Provisions of the Financial Administration 
Act were incorporated into the amended Broadcasting Act in 
1991.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	It is reasonable to require the five crown corporations to 
prepare a business plan so that annual reports can allow the 
Canadian people, the taxpayers, the funders of these programs, 
to monitor and gauge the performance of these five.
<P>
	There have been some cases in which crown corporations' 
annual reports differ from the business plan objectives, even 
though there are no provisions for exempted crown corporations 
to invite the auditor general to conduct special examinations. 
The audit is released only to the board of directors, not to 
Parliament. It must be released to Parliament. It must come 
under the scrutiny of all members of Parliament so we can 
ensure taxpayers' money is being accounted for.
<P>
	Providing the corporations with the option of inviting the 
auditor general to do an audit is not good enough. If the auditor 
general's office were involved in the corporation on a regular 
basis, business plan objectives would not deviate from 
objectives stated in the annual report.
<P>
	We all agree that in times of restraint such as we have now 
those who spend taxpayers' dollars must be more aware than 
ever that they are answerable as to how the dollars are spent. 
Part X of the Financial Administration Act has been so effective 
for other crown corporations, it seems reasonable, logical and 
simply common sense to bring the five crown corporations 
outlined in Bill C-263 into line as well. I urge all members of the 
House to support Bill C-263.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the debate 
today on Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial Administra-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11652"> 11652 </A></B>
<P>
tion Act, sponsored by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	I as well endorse the objectives of the bill to increase the 
accountability of exempt crown corporations to the taxpayers of 
Canada. At the same time I have reservations that this proposal 
is the best approach to the question.
<P>
	Let me deal with the proposal to make the officers and 
employees of the Canada Council, the National Arts Centre and 
the International Development Research Council part of the 
public service of Canada.
<P>
	On February 27, 1995 the Minister of Finance introduced a 
historic budget to the House. Part of the announcement was the 
need to reduce the size of the public service by some 45,000 
positions over the course of the next three years. That is a major 
undertaking which will require a great deal of effort to manage 
with both wisdom and compassion.
<P>
	These three corporations have approximately 850 employees 
combined; roughly 230 in the Canada Council and 280 in the 
National Arts Centre and 340 in IDRC.
<P>
	Adding 850 positions to the size of the public service at this 
time is swimming against the current. For this reason, if for no 
other, I cannot support the bill as presented to the House.
<P>
	I share the point of view expressed early in the debate by the 
hon. member for La Prairie that broad brush legislation of the 
sort reflected in Bill C-263 is not the only approach that can be 
taken to this issue. There are other approaches that can and have 
been taken recently to strengthen the accountability of our 
crown corporations.
<P>
	One such approach is improving the quality of corporate 
governance. I am referring to the role of the board of directors 
whose responsibility it is, to put it simply, to manage the 
mangers. In this respect I invite the attention of the House to the 
final report of the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal and agency review released on February 16, 1995, the 
same day as the budget.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of the review announced in the February 1994 
budget was to review the continuing usefulness and the currency 
of the mandate of the federal government, several hundred 
agencies, boards and commissions.
<P>
	Among the measures adopted by the government in the final 
report to streamline the appointment process were decisions to 
reduce the size of the governing bodies of a number of agencies 
including crown corporations.
<P>
	Accountability for taxpayers' dollars is a key consideration 
for these exempt corporations. In this regard it is worth noting 
the review concluded reductions in governor in council 
appointments will take place in three exempt corporations, two 
of which are identified in this bill.
<P>
	The board of governors of the CBC will be reduced from 15 to 
12 members. The board of trustees of the National Arts Centre 
would be downsized to eight members from the current eleven. 
The governor in council position of secretary will be eliminated 
in Telefilm Canada. The agency review taken as a whole will 
result in the elimination of some 589 governor in council 
appointments.
<P>
	As well, the final report and agency review revamped the 
tenure provisions of the appointment process which would make 
it easier for the government to remove under performing 
individuals holding full time appointments, including officers 
of crown corporations appointed by the governor in council. 
Incumbents of these positions will now serve at pleasure. The 
government is committed to improving the appointment 
process, including appointments to the board of directors of 
crown corporations.
<P>
	That is a commitment of the red book. Those were the 
recommendations in the report commissioned by the Prime 
Minister and submitted by Mr. Gérard Veilleux. ``Unfinished 
Business, a Report on the Appointment Process to Boards of 
Directors of Crown Corporations'', was released by the Minister 
responsible for Public Service Renewal last July. That was the 
focus of a conference held in October by the President of the 
Treasury Board for the chairpersons and chief executive officers 
of crown corporations.
<P>
	The subject matter of that conference will perhaps reinforce 
the message to the sponsor of this bill that there are other 
avenues to improving the accountability regime for all crowns, 
including the exempts beyond the legislative approach.
<P>
	The October conference, ``Corporate Governance: Improving 
the Effectiveness of Crown Corporation Board of Directors'', 
sponsored four workshops for participants. The first of these 
was on the development and approval of strategy.
<P>
	This group explored the importance of the development and 
approval of specific strategies, the challenge of linking the 
development of strategy to the corporation's mandate, the 
relationship of the board to management and the factors which 
contribute to a board's success.
<P>
	The second workshop was on the subject of board 
composition and evaluation. Discussion in these groups centred 
on the roles of the chairperson and the CEO, the selection and 
evaluation of board members, the functioning of the 
appointment process, board self-evaluation, the orientation and 
education of directors and all related communications issues.
<P>
	The third workshop dealt with balancing the corporate agenda 
and the public good. Groups discussed the trade-offs between 
meeting the commercial financial objectives and achieving the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11653"> 11653 </A></B>
<P>
mandated public policy objectives, all within the constraints 
imposed by the accountabilities of a public enterprise.
<P>
	The final workshop addressed meeting the information needs 
of the board. Participants examined the information needs of the 
board from a variety of perspectives, including the often unique 
perspectives of the exempt crown corporations referred to in 
Bill C-263.
<P>
	Work is continuing in these areas. Options for an education 
program for newly appointed directors of crown corporations 
are under review, which will strike the balance needed between 
the fiduciary responsibility of directors and the public policy 
role of the crown corporation.
<P>
	The auditor general maintains an ongoing brief in this area as 
well. All of these measures are designed to increase the 
accountability of crown corporations, including the exempt 
crowns.
<P>
	I invite the attention of members to the program review 
decisions announced in the February budget.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget states that the government will undertake a 
fundamental review of its support and mandates of the CBC, 
NFB and Telefilm Canada. Strategies and mandates that were 
developed under radically different circumstances must be 
re-examined in light of today's technological possibilities and 
the evolution of both the audio-visual industry and the domestic 
market.
<P>
	That and similar opportunities may be the more appropriate 
avenues for the hon. member to pursue his very worthwhile 
interest in improving the accountability of the exempt crown 
corporation. Such an approach will preserve the flexibility and 
the accountability regime for those crown corporations which 
require a degree of independence from the direct ability of the 
government of the day to intervene in their policy and 
administrative decisions.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-263 has as its goal the bringing of five crown 
corporations under the accountability provisions of the 
Financial Administration Act which now applies to all other 
crown corporations. The corporations this act seeks to include 
are the Canada Council, the National Arts Centre Corporation, 
the Canadian Wheat Board, Telefilm Canada and the 
International Development Research Centre.
<P>
	Hon. members have listened to earlier discussions on the 
merits of having all crown corporations operating under a sound 
system of control and accountability. I can only add my support 
to those expressions of interest that crown corporations should 
be appropriately managed, but I cannot support Bill C-263.
<P>
	The objective of good government management of crown 
investments is neither a mountain of bureaucratic rules and 
regulations nor a flawed system that fails to provide the 
adequate tools to evaluate corporate performance. Appropriate 
accountability must balance control against an adequate degree 
of empowerment for corporate managers to do their jobs 
effectively and efficiently. After all, crown corporations have a 
real and valuable public policy purpose.
<P>
	I am sure all hon. members would wish to ensure that 
important publicly owned institutions such as the Canada 
Council, the Canadian Film Development Corporation and 
others are held accountable for the results they achieve and the 
money they spend. I am equally certain hon. members would not 
wish to see the mandates of these corporations compromised, 
mandates that Parliament carefully protected in corporate 
enabling legislation. Or is that the case with this particular bill?
<P>
	Perhaps the real agenda here is to remove from these 
particular crown corporations their arm's length quality, their 
ability to act at arm's length from the government. Perhaps the 
real agenda is to stifle the creativity which is part of the Canada 
Council, part of Telefilm Canada and part of the National Arts 
Centre. Perhaps the real agenda is to suppress the work of the 
International Development Research Centre or to prevent the 
wheat board from performing its mandate which has been so 
valuable particularly to the western provinces.
<P>
	What is appropriate accountability for these corporations? 
That is the real question. Clearly, the present system of laws, 
regulations and government policies affecting crown 
corporations has evolved considerably. It can provide both 
Parliament and the government with much useful information 
and the assurance that crown corporations are being well 
managed.
<P>
	The Auditor General reports to this House on a regular basis 
on crown corporation matters. Indeed, the Auditor General is the 
auditor or the joint auditor for 35 out of 48 of these corporations, 
including four that are part of this bill: the National Arts Centre, 
the Canada Council, the International Development Research 
Centre and Telefilm Canada.
<P>
	Moreover, Treasury Board reviews the operations of crown 
corporations. It deals with resourcing issues for those 
corporations that are exempt from part X of the Financial 
Administration Act but nevertheless require government 
appropriation.
<P>
	Of prime importance also is the fact that each crown 
corporation by law has an appropriate minister. The 
corporations are accountable through their ministers to 
Parliament. These ministers must table a number of important 
accountability documents relating to their crown corporation, 
such as annual reports, summaries of corporate plans, operating 
and capital budgets.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11654"> 11654 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Stepping back for a moment and looking at appropriate 
accountability in a broader context, I believe the fiscal 
challenges which the government is currently facing necessarily 
will affect the way it manages crown corporations. There will be 
an even greater need to find ways of delivering public policy in 
an efficient businesslike manner than there is at present.
<P>
	Reducing or at least more carefully controlling the size of the 
public service would appear to be part of the solution toward 
meeting this need. Interestingly, I note that Bill C-263 would 
actually add to the size of the public service by adding those 
employees of the Canada Council, the International 
Development Research Centre and the National Arts Centre to 
the public service of Canada. This appears to be going in the 
opposite direction from that which the proponents of smaller 
government usually follow.
<P>
	I might add that it also runs counter to the general philosophy 
of empowering crown corporations to be separate employers and 
to take direct responsibility for their personnel matters. This 
responsibility must be carried out fairly and efficiently in the 
best interests of the corporation.
<P>
	It is one important example of how the use of crown 
corporations with their corporate structure based on the private 
sector model can remove layers of red tape in decision making. 
Less red tape in personnel administration and human resource 
management is one advantage of the crown corporation forum 
which may prove to be an increasingly attractive way of 
improving the efficiency with which certain government 
programs could be delivered. The focus will increasingly be on 
the expertise brought to bear on those directly responsible for 
the day to day running of those corporations, the expertise of the 
board of directors.
<P>
	The public has demanded transparency and accountability 
from all government institutions. Foremost, the public expects 
integrity from those officers charged with the responsibility of 
running these institutions. In the early months of this 
government the Prime Minister made this value central to both 
the letter and the spirit of our actions. The quest must be for 
financial responsibility and common sense in the way all 
government institutions are run and held accountable.
<P>
	We have seen a number of studies in the area of corporate 
governance in the past few years, including work done by Peter 
Dey for the Toronto Stock Exchange. What we know is that the 
public has effectively been expressing its frustration at being 
left out or ignored in both the process and structures of corporate 
governance in the private sector. Boards of directors and 
corporate managers are experiencing an upsurge in public 
sentiment for democratization that has affected many other 
aspects of the daily lives of Canadians everywhere: our families, 
our communities,  our courts and our schools, in addition to 
private corporations.
<P>
	The modern business corporation is now seen by many as both 
an economic institution and a social institution. This is closer to 
how our crown corporations have always been viewed in their 
quest to balance efficient and businesslike operations with the 
public policy agenda.
<P>
	The growing public expectation creates pressure for more 
formal rules and regulations, values and ethics for both the 
process and the people who influence corporate decision 
making. The government is acutely aware of the changing scene 
in corporate governance. It has undertaken a number of 
important initiatives in this area as they relate to crown 
corporations, including those named in Bill C-263.
<P>
	The Treasury Board Secretariat jointly with the Conference 
Board of Canada and the Canadian Centre for Management 
Development developed and published an introductory 
document on the roles and responsibilities of directors of crown 
corporations to provide important guidance on appropriate 
accountability for directors. It has been well received since its 
publication in July 1993.
<P>
	In an effort to focus more attention on the goal of improving 
sensitivities in the area of corporate governance, a training 
conference was held this past fall for CEOs and chairs of crown 
corporations to improve the performance of crown corporate 
boards. One of the four major themes discussed was the 
challenge of balancing the corporate agenda and the public 
good.
<P>
	These initiatives demonstrate that careful attention is being 
paid to the evolution of accountability issues surrounding crown 
corporations using an open process of consultation. Developing 
a new statutory accountability framework for the five crown 
corporations named in Bill C-263 should follow the same sort of 
consultative process. It should not be insensitive to the 
particular needs of those crown corporations affected or their 
many significant stakeholders among the Canadian population.
<P>
	I can only suggest that the bill presented by the hon. member 
for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt while demonstrating 
concern for the interests of Canadian taxpayers does not equally 
meet the test of public consultation to which this government is 
much committed. I urge hon. members to vote against it.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to follow the member for Windsor-St. Clair. She has 
already indicated to the House that we on this side applaud the 
intent of Bill C-263 but continue to regard the proposal from the 
member for Okanagan-Simikameen-Merritt as fatally 
flawed.
<P>
	The bill's central proposal, and I am sure we have all reviewed 
this carefully, is to remove the exemption for five crown 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11655"> 11655 </A></B>
<P>
corporations from part X of the Financial Administration Act 
which sets out a generic  accountability regime for crown 
corporations. These five agencies are the Canada Council, the 
National Arts Centre Corporation, the International 
Development Research Centre, Telefilm Canada, and the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	There are a number of problems with this bill. In attempting to 
convert the employees of the three exempt crown corporations 
to public servants, there is the possibility that these employees 
would come under the workforce adjustment policy. When we 
consider the overall efforts of this government to downsize, this 
seems to be an unnecessary complication. It would add 
approximately 800 more civil servants if this bill were to pass.
<P>
	I will pick specifically the International Development 
Research Centre. At the time Bill C-24 was proposed back in 
March 1984 this matter was raised as a question in the House by 
the then member for Capilano. A response was given by the then 
Prime Minister, the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
<P>
	The enabling legislation passed in the early 1960s allows up 
to 21 governors of the IDRC, which include the chairman and 
the vice-president, to be non-Canadian citizens and nationals of 
other countries. The purpose was to promote a research centre 
on north-south issues by way of example which would follow 
Canada's lead in the area of international development.
<P>
	At the time Bill C-24 was before the House it was intended 
that the IDRC remain independent of the policy direction of the 
Government of Canada. For this reason it was named in clause 
85(1) of the bill as an exempt crown corporation.
<P>
	This effort by the hon. member from the Reform Party would 
attempt to turn the clock back. While we can applaud some of 
the positive features of the member's proposed bill, the overall 
effect would be negative.
<P>
	There are other elements of Bill C-263 which trouble me. 
These are the consequential amendments to other legislation in 
the bill to make the officers and employees of the Canada 
Council, the Canadian Film Development Corporation, or 
Telefilm Canada as it has come to be known, and the National 
Arts Centre Corporation to be part of the Public Service of 
Canada. Frankly, recent experience suggests that this is taking 
measures in the wrong direction.
<P>
	I am reminded of the trials and tribulations of the Government 
of New Zealand in the early 1980s with its massive debt and 
deficit situation. Drastic measures were proposed in a number of 
areas to deal with that awesome challenge.
<P>
	One initiative was a complete restructuring of the New 
Zealand public service from the way deputy ministers are 
appointed and held accountable to the decentralization of 
departments. Sufficient time has now elapsed from the initial 
turnaround efforts to allow a dispassionate assessment of the 
measures put in place. There is a wide consensus now in New 
Zealand and  among knowledgeable observers of public 
administration in many western countries respecting one very 
beneficial element of that initiative by the New Zealand 
government.
<P>
	I refer to the introduction of legislation to make each 
department of government a separate employer under the 
collective bargaining regime established for the public service. 
This single measure is given credit for a major element of the 
success of the reform package. It has allowed individual 
managers to tailor the workforce to the specific mandate of each 
revamped agency and significantly reduced the inertia and 
rigidity in the service. If anything we ought perhaps to be 
exploring the merits of establishing more separate employers, 
not fewer.
<P>
	While New Zealand no doubt had very difficult choices to 
deal with, I think most members would agree that Canada as 
well has significant debt and deficit challenges on its agenda. 
The effort by New Zealand to deal with the matter is a clear 
demonstration that the government's intention to achieve more 
flexibility in the management of its affairs is the way to go. 
Attempting to bring these agencies and their workers within the 
general purview of the government flies in the face of our 
attempts to downsize, to improve efficiencies and to do a better 
job with the resources Canadians give us through taxes on their 
hard won labours. It requires that we be responsible with those 
resources.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Introducing greater rigidity into the system as the bill is 
proposing would seem to be the wrong policy instrument for our 
present ills. No doubt the intention of the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt is to enhance the efficiency 
of these crown corporations. In this respect I suspect the 
opposite effect will be achieved.
<P>
	The hon. member's proposals to integrate the employees of 
these agencies into the monolithic structure of the federal public 
service would unravel a very delicate compromise achieved 
between the government and the cultural communities over 10 
years ago with the passage of Bill C-24.
<P>
	These organizations have developed their strengths by 
cultivating their distinct corporate cultures over the last few 
decades. The erosion of those identities by declaring the officers 
and employees part of the public service would at best be 
unfortunate. I suggest it would be a backward step.
<P>
	It risks undermining the longstanding confidence they enjoy 
from their partners and clients in such practices as peer evalua-
<P>

<B><A NAME="11656"> 11656 </A></B>
<P>
tions and the reputations individuals have achieved resulting 
from their mobility within cultural industries.
<P>
	For these reasons I respectfully recommend to all members 
that Bill C-263 be defeated.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate. Seeing 
no member rise, the mover of the motion, the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, has given notice to the 
Chair seeking the floor under right of reply.
<P>
	Again I must advise the House that if the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt speaks it will close debate. 
In fact no one else will be able to speak afterward and I will put 
the question immediately following his last intervention, which 
will be no longer than two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, Christopher Columbus was a man of 
vision. He did not accept the status quo. Many times people told 
Christopher Columbus that he was wrong in what he was doing, 
that he should not even attempt to look beyond or explore past 
the horizon, and that if he dared to do so he would surely fall off 
a flat earth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Do you mean there were Reformers back then 
too?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> The naysayers with whom Christopher Columbus 
dealt obviously were Liberals. Christopher Columbus was 
probably the first Reformer.
<P>
	Bill C-263 challenges the status quo as did Christopher 
Columbus. However, unlike Christopher Columbus the ideas in 
Bill C-263 are not as radical. They are not a form of radical 
change but rather are a form of necessary change to Parliament 
and to the operations of government and of all crown 
corporations.
<P>
	The accountability framework we are asking the five 
exempted crown corporations to be moved into is the framework 
all other crown corporations come under. There is no reason why 
they should be exempted.
<P>
	It is a real shame hon. members of the House did not bother 
reading the reports of the auditor general from 1989 to 1991 
wherein he expressed concern about the subject. I refer to 
section 4.100 of the 1991 auditor general's report which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Office strongly supported the strengthened legislative framework for 
Crown corporations, and has continually urged that those Crown corporations 
that were exempted from Part X of the FAA be brought into line with its 
accountability provisions. It is important that Parliament have assurance that 
appropriate accountability provisions apply to all parent Crown corporations. 
When exemptions are granted, means should be found to ensure adequate 
control and accountability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I urge all members to support Bill C-263.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>

	The House resumed from April 6 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-69, an act to provide for the establishment of 
electoral boundaries commissions and the readjustment of 
electoral boundaries, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When the House 
adjourned, the hon. member for Mercier had fifteen minutes 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
debate drew to a close a few weeks ago, I made certain 
references in connection with this extremely important question 
put before the House by the Bloc Quebecois: that Quebec should 
have at least 25 per cent of the members in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11657"> 11657 </A></B>
<P>
	I felt obliged to remind the House that this minimum fell far 
short of the kind of recognition the people of Quebec could 
expect. I recalled that, in 1965, the man who became Premier of 
Quebec in 1966 published his book <I>Égalité ou Indépendance</I>. 
This was Daniel Johnson, father of the Leader of the Official 
Opposition in Quebec, whose own father was an Irish immigrant 
and did not speak French. Daniel Johnson, born of an Irish father 
and an Irish mother who settled in Quebec, became the Premier 
of Quebec, and it was this man who, after having been a member 
and a minister, gave his party a fresh start when he said: ``The 
French Canadian nation must have equality within Canada, 
otherwise, it will be perfectly legitimate to look for ways to 
make Quebec a full-fledged State''.
<P>
	After pointing out that the French Canadian nation was open 
to all and that, when people came from another country, they 
could choose to become part of it as they could choose to be 
English Canadians, he concluded: ``I will explain why and how 
French Canadians are trying to identify with the State of 
Quebec, the only one where they can claim to be masters of their 
own destiny and can use to achieve the full potential of their 
community, while the English Canadian nation tends to make 
Ottawa the centre of its community life''.
<P>
	This text was a milestone in our history, in the history of 
Quebec and Canada. Since that time, Quebecers no longer refer 
to themselves as French Canadians-people do in the rest of 
Canada and, as you know, we are very proud of what has been 
achieved by French Canadians outside Quebec who are coping 
under extremely difficult situations. But in Quebec, we now call 
ourselves Quebecois and the vast majority of the population 
identifies itself as such.
<P>
	Electoral boundaries readjustment is an opportunity to 
consider that the Quebec people have a right to minimum 
recognition, whatever their choice will be, and based on the 
historical importance of Quebec, Canada should support this 
principle.
<P>
	If the rest of Canada had only given some indication that it 
was prepared to recognize the Quebec people, our recent history 
would have been quite different. If we go back to the minimum 
demands made by Premier Bourassa during the talks on Meech 
Lake and if we go back to the rejection of the Charlottetown 
accord, we find the same desire for minimum recognition, and 
the position that the Quebec people are entitled to certain 
guarantees.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	However, in recent history-let us say, until the 1960s-it 
was equality that the people of Quebec sought. There were 
others, besides Daniel Johnson. There was also, it will be 
remembered, André Laurendeau, who was appointed by the 
Prime Minister of the time, Lester B. Pearson, to head the Royal 
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. André 
Laurendeau also desperately sought equality from coast to 
coast, with the focus on  Quebec naturally, for the French 
Canadian nation, for the Quebecers of his time, as other French 
Canadians regularly did in this period of history.
<P>
	André Laurendeau tried to convince Canadians. He succeeded 
in convincing many of the commissioners working with him. 
Unfortunately, he failed to convince Prime Minister Trudeau, 
who could have implemented the recommendations of the 
report, which, like many others, ended up on the shelf.
<P>
	This episode, like a lot of others, reminds us that, for 
Quebecers, who have the possibility of a different future, the 
choice offered by Canada has always been: ``Be a province like 
the rest or else''.
<P>
	The reality of history is that, once again, it was not the French 
Canadians nor the Quebecers who did not want to build a Canada 
which included not only an adequate but an appropriate place for 
Quebec. Why? Some accuse us of focussing on the past; the truth 
is the opposite. Why do they not level the same accusation at 
those who refused to accord Quebec a real place? Why did they 
refuse to do so? Perhaps they refused because the French 
colonists were from France, and France had been conquered and 
had decided to give up in the war in the colony. Are they not the 
ones who continue to treat the descendants of the French 
colonists not as French stock but as a conquered people? 
Otherwise, they would recognize what the world recognizes: 
that all the characteristics of a nation and of a people may be 
found here, in this land.
<P>
	Any dictionary definition of the words people and nation fits 
those living in the territory of Quebec like a glove. We are a 
people; we are a nation. If the rest of Canada had not been 
focussed on the past and had really wanted to build a new 
country, it would have acknowledged this, because what counts 
for Quebecers and Canadians is building a future.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	We must give ourselves the means to ensure the survival of 
our people and their cultural, social and economic development 
in the future. It is essential that Quebec develop its people, its 
culture and its economy according to its own dynamics and 
identity.
<P>
	That is why the majority of Quebecers will opt for 
sovereignty. It must be noted that, for many of them, it will not 
be the first choice because Quebecers, who used to be called 
Canadiens or ``Canayens'', feel at home throughout the land but 
had to confine themselves to Quebec, where they could develop, 
as Daniel Johnson, Sr. used to say. In fact, it is important to 
realize the extent to which the first French Canadians were 
scattered throughout the territory, and the evidence is still there.
<P>
	It is also important to realize that French Canadian women, 
who had the highest birth rate in North America between 1870 
and 1960, saw, with breaking hearts, their children and young 
families leave for the United States. This is not very well known, 
but, for over 100 years, 10,000 French Canadians left every year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11658"> 11658 </A></B>
<P>
because they  could not ensure their own development in the 
Province of Quebec and because Canada, Western Canada was 
closed to them.
<P>
	And while French Canadians were leaving for the United 
States at the rate of 10,000 per year, there was a 
``Canadian''-as my former professor Michel Brunet used to 
say, using the English spelling of the word-immigration policy 
allowing immigrants from the British Isles and Europe to settle 
in Western Canada for a nominal sum. According to figures that 
appeared in <I>Le Devoir</I> in 1928, the cost of moving to western 
Canada was $968 for a French Canadian family with ten children 
but only $48 for a British immigrant.
<P>
	If one wants to prepare for the future, one must look at the 
past. For Quebec, the past involved a search in difficult 
conditions by French Canadians either in the other provinces or 
in Quebec. There was an almost desperate search for our 
legitimate place as French Canadians and later, in the 1960s, as 
Quebecers, because we clearly developed an identity as 
Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We have maintained that this quest, which for some is still 
ongoing, could be realized in a small way through the 
amendment put forward by my colleague. Again, whatever 
happened in the past, we must live side by side. If it is still 
possible to convince my colleagues and the Canadian people 
that there is a Quebec people who want an equal partnership, 
there must be signs not only from this side but also from the 
other side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment on what the member for 
Mercier said, a member whom I regard as a separatist while she 
claims to be a sovereignist. This separatist member of 
Parliament spoke of the people of Quebec with great pride, and I 
appreciate her pride in Quebecers, because I too am proud of 
them.
<P>
	I must say right away that I am myself a fourth generation 
Franco-Ontarian. To the separatist member who just spoke, I 
say, Madam, that that did not prevent me from-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must remind the House 
that all remarks must be put through the Chair and not directly to 
another member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Thank you for calling me to order on this 
very important matter. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Mercier is very proud to show her allegiance, her patriotism. But 
I think that her patriotism is slightly out of place. She seems to 
forget that she belongs to the larger Canadian nation, that it is 
because of Canadian unity that the provinces and territories 
were able to develop and the two official languages of Canada 
were able to develop, not because there were people muttering in 
one region or another of the country, only looking inwards and 
only concentrating on petty local concerns.
<P>
	Francophones outside Quebec have done well and been 
successful. I think I am a case in point. I did well financially, at 
school, in the elections, in politics. Never, ever, have Canadians 
outside Quebec, or inside Quebec for that matter, hindered my 
success. In fact, it is this national attitude that made me to want 
to succeed, to want to remain a part of this country.
<P>
	The member for Mercier kept referring to Canadians who left 
the country and settled in the U.S. I must point out to her that 
most of those who did that were from Quebec. It is interesting to 
note that the member for Mercier uses the term Canadians when 
talking about negative things and Quebecers for positive ones; 
only Quebecers can do good.
<P>
	I must say right away that everyone in Canada does good. If 
we are to become even stronger as a nation in the future, become 
a wealthier nation and achieve a level of education envied the 
world over, it will be through Canadian unity, not through this 
desire to separate and this constant infighting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. member 
that our future would be much brighter and our prosperity much 
more certain if the rest of Canada stopped refusing to recognize 
what Quebec demanded as a people, because these repeated 
refusals have led to crises which are an expression of the will of 
that people and nation.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	You cannot silence a whole nation. The issue will always 
resurface because the right of nations is a fundamental one. 
Democracy is based on that right. Canada's prosperity would 
indeed be much greater. It could have been much greater if 
Quebecers had been recognized as a people and a nation, instead 
of denying that reality. This is true today and it will still be true 
tomorrow, for the only uncertainty which exists is linked to the 
possibility that you may reject our decision as a people. This is 
the only uncertainty; there are no other ones.
<P>
	Sure, we can talk about prosperity and about the future, but do 
recognize that we are a people and a nation, and that the decision 
will be ours. In any case, you cannot overlook that basic reality.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether it is simply Monday 
morning or whether it is my tolerance and my patience wearing 
thin as day after day in the House we listen to this little band of 
separatists as they stand in the House to talk about destroying 
the country.
<P>
	There is nothing more divisive or nothing more destructive to 
the country today than to listen to this group stand every day to 
say that it wants to be a separate nation within Canada. The 
strength of the country is in the participation of all provinces 
and all peoples, not the separation this band talks about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11659"> 11659 </A></B>
<P>
	They do not have the support of the majority of the people of 
Quebec. Only when they soften their separatist stand and talk 
about some sort of mushy sovereignist association can they even 
get anywhere close to a 50 per cent vote in the polls.
<P>
	This band of separatists should be ashamed as they stand in 
the House. They collect their paycheques every month from the 
Government of Canada, from taxpayers in western Canada, as 
they stand here to talk about destroying the country. They should 
be ashamed of themselves. Perhaps they should consider going 
back to their ridings and staying there until they develop a 
different attitude, a Canadian attitude, before they show their 
faces in the House of Commons. The Parliament of Canada 
represents all people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, we were elected by our fellow 
citizens to discuss an extremely important issue to them, namely 
their recognition as a people and a nation. In fact, this issue is so 
important that, over the last 30 years, it has been very 
time-consuming and has kept us from dealing with other major 
concerns.
<P>
	You cannot overlook that reality. You can claim that we are a 
small minority, but the fact is that we are not. We represent a 
people and a nation similar to many others in the world, which 
seek, peacefully, to be recognized and which have sought that 
recognition since the very beginning. This is what we are telling 
you, and we are also telling you that you will keep hearing about 
it. So, you better watch, listen and understand that this people 
and this nation have a right to exist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris: </B>Go home.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> No, I will not go 
home. Mr. Speaker, that should be translated. I find it despicable 
to be told to go home while, as the representative for my 
constituents, I reflect on our history, pointing out that we want 
prosperity but that prosperity will only be possible if we are 
treated as equals.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	This is a despicable and unacceptable insult. If you think that 
this is how you will make your country prosper, you are grossly 
mistaken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to begin with, I find myself wondering whether the real 
issue being debated is Quebec's borders or the electoral 
boundaries to be set by the new commissions.
<P>
	Firstly, much has been said in this House and in the 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs on the subject of the 
new electoral boundaries, especially for northern Ontario and 
more specifically for my riding, Cochrane-Superior. The fate 
of my riding, and of northern Ontario in general, depends on the 
recommendations the commission will make.
<P>
	First off, it must be said in this House that all Canadians, 
wherever they live in Canada, have the right to fair and equitable 
representation. Obviously, these two words are charged with 
meaning. In particular the word ``equitable'' is defined in 
Larousse to mean ``in accordance with justice''. Fair 
representation is the most important point which must guide us 
in this debate, and this means that rural regions in Canada 
should always have direct access to their members of 
Parliament. It is not enough for members of Parliament and their 
constituents to communicate with each other by telephone or 
fax, because this will ultimately depersonalize all that Canada 
represents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House affairs committee was somewhat conciliatory 
when it permitted the new commissions to be set up to accept an 
amendment wherein the same commission may depart from its 
application to the rules when considering the economies, the 
traditional and natural boundaries and rural characteristics of a 
territory, and the access to means of communication and 
transportation.
<P>
	The commission may in its wisdom go beyond the 25 per cent 
quota when we talk about the population. This means that a 
riding may have less than the 25 per cent permissible quota in 
relation to the quotas of a specific province. This is the case for 
my riding of Cochrane-Superior and the riding of 
Timiskaming-French River.
<P>
	In future it will be almost impossible to reach the quota of 
97,000 people in a riding in northern Ontario and for that matter 
in most ridings in northern Canada. Suffice it to say that once the 
commissions and the hearings are set up, my colleagues from 
northern Ontario and I will fight to the end along with many 
concerned citizens and organizations to save the riding of 
Cochrane-Superior. This is not only for the sake of saving a 
riding but also saving a voice of rural Canada in Parliament.
<P>
	In general across Canada there are 13 ridings with 100,000 
square kilometres and more. Cochrane-Superior has 351,000 
square kilometres with 41 organized main communities. It 
stretches from the border of Quebec to the east and goes west to 
the riding of Thunder Bay-Nipigon, which is some 425 miles.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In 1994 I logged 23,000 kilometres in order to try to serve my 
constituents as best I could. It would take 18 hours non-stop to 
go around the riding of Cochrane-Superior. To divide it into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11660"> 11660 </A></B>
<P>
four as was  recommended, annexing the four parcels to existing 
ridings, would simply mean that in most cases those ridings 
would double in size and 16,000 people would be added per 
riding.
<P>
	In other ridings, namely the urban ridings, a member of 
Parliament can attend a function at either end of the riding in the 
same day, in many cases within the hour and in some cases 
within minutes. That is not to say that urban members of 
Parliament have it easy. We in northern Ontario recognize those 
ridings have a much larger population and those members 
therefore spend more time with constituents. A member of 
Parliament should be accessible to his or her constituents no 
matter what.
<P>
	In large rural ridings many people feel isolated and that is why 
there is a need for the member of Parliament to meet with his or 
her constituents. Those people also have to be heard and 
counted, and they need to feel they are a part of this country, that 
not everything is being decided by the urban ridings. 
Handicapped people and the elderly, given the long distances 
which they have to travel in rural ridings, practically have no 
chance of meeting their member of Parliament unless he or she 
visits them. To further increase in size rural ridings would mean 
disaster for many Canadians living in those ridings, especially 
in isolated areas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like to read to you a summary of an 
extremely interesting conversation I had with a public servant: 
``An electoral district is much more than a geographic division 
for electoral purposes. An electoral district represents an 
economic, social and cultural group of several thousand people. 
An electoral district is as much a tool for grouping common 
interests as it is a means of expressing the identity, lifestyle and 
shared values of its inhabitants. From this perspective, the 
electoral district should be given the same status as a town, a 
province or a country. Any substantial change in the boundaries 
of the electoral district could cause major economic and social 
changes in that area. The boundaries of existing electoral 
districts must be revised equitably and changes must not upset 
their economic and social equilibrium''.
<P>
	I have two concrete examples to illustrate my point. Let us 
consider first of all the selection of candidates. If my riding 
were split in four and annexed to the four neighbouring ridings, 
without fail, the chances of the party nominating a person from a 
rural region as a candidate would be about nil, if he or she were 
competing against a potential candidate from an urban region or 
larger town with many supporters and able to sell membership 
cards, etc. People from rural regions, in the true sense of the 
word, would have very little hope of ever being elected to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The second example I want to mention concerns rural regions 
and their economic relationship with Canada. We are rich in 
natural resources. The viability and vitality of our economy 
depends on those natural resources, and the rest of Canada 
should appreciate our contribution.
<P>
	I could also draw a comparison with New Brunswick and 
Prince Edward Island. Obviously, we cannot rewrite the 
Constitution Act, 1867 and the agreements concluded at the 
time, under which New Brunswick was guaranteed ten ridings 
and Prince Edward Island four ridings. However, together these 
two provinces have more or less the same area and population as 
northern Ontario.
<P>
	At the present time we have eleven electoral districts, while 
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have fourteen. This is 
an example of inequity. As I said before, it would be very 
difficult to change this without amending the Constitution Act, 
1982. My point is that we should at least recognize the fact that, 
compared with other regions in this country, northern Ontario is 
under-represented and cannot not afford to lose another seat in 
Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a huge geographic misunderstanding. This 
misunderstanding will not be resolved for many years to come. 
The fact that rural Canadians represent a minimal part of the 
population of Canada is not a good enough reason them not to be 
justly and adequately represented in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the previous speaker from Cochrane-Superior for his 
remarks, not because I necessarily agree with them all but 
because they were on the topic of the bill which has been sadly 
lacking in this debate.
<P>
	This is a debate about Bill C-69, an act to provide for the 
establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries, specifically to scrap the 
process under way last year to redraw our boundaries based on 
the 1991 census and establish a whole new process.
<P>
	We are now winding up a parliamentary debate on this that 
started over a year ago which in our view has yielded only 
minimal improvements to the electoral boundaries process.
<P>
	The motion that had initiated this bill had asked the procedure 
and House affairs committee to examine methods of capping and 
reducing the size of the House of Commons, to improve the 
process by which boundaries commissioners are selected, to 
consider how the boundaries commissions conduct their work 
and to consider the involvement of the public. In three of these 
areas there were some minor improvements. However, the bill 
fails to address the already excessive and growing numbers of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11661"> 11661 </A></B>
<P>
members in the House of Commons. That  failure in particular 
prevents our party from endorsing the bill.
<P>
	The changes made to the boundaries process while useful for 
future census in our view do not justify scrapping the 
commission or rejecting the reports of the existing boundaries 
commissions.
<P>
	While we are opposing this bill members of the Bloc 
Quebecois have been opposing this bill for an entirely different 
reason, one to which I will address my remarks.
<P>
	The Bloc position on this entire process for bills C-18 and 
C-69 has been very inconsistent. It supported going through this 
process and then opposed it again.
<P>
	Initially the concern was about boundaries. Now the concern 
is about Quebec's not having a guaranteed 25 per cent of the 
seats. Under the formula coming forward I will point out what 
we are actually talking about in terms of substance. We are 
talking about the demand from the Bloc Quebecois that Quebec 
be guaranteed 25 per cent of the 301 seats we will have out of 
this redistribution; in other words 75.25 seats. Quebec will get 
under the formula 75 seats. This is probably the most verbiage 
we have expended in the House over one-quarter of a seat.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not entirely sure this position is not changing again. Over 
the Easter break we learned from the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois that apparently Quebec now wants 50 per cent of the 
seats. The position keeps shifting.
<P>
	I want to address it seriously because there has been much 
misinformation and many misstatements made about this. I will 
outline the facts. The Bloc has made at least four assertions 
which need to be challenged, assertions of fact, assertions 
directly related to the bill and to the issue of 25 per cent of the 
seats.
<P>
	The first and most obvious Bloc assertion is that this kind of 
guarantee could be achieved without a constitutional 
amendment. We know that is not the case. This was a provision 
of the Charlottetown constitutional accord opposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois which I will talk about later. It was in that accord 
precisely because it required a constitutional amendment.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1867 lays out the formula for the 
redistribution of seats in the House of Commons every 10 years. 
That formula is contained primarily in section 51. Section 52 
makes it clear that while the number of seats in the House can be 
changed, the House is not free to amend its formula in a way that 
would depart from the proportion of population among the 
provinces. Section 52 makes clear that principle is protected.
<P>
	Furthermore, under the Constitution Act of 1982 under 
section 42(1)(a) the amending formula is explicit that changing 
the proportion of seats in the House can only be done with a 
constitutional amendment approved by Parliament and by 
two-thirds of the provinces representing at least 50 per cent of 
the population.
<P>
	The second incorrect Bloc assertion is that under existing 
constitutional formula only New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
Island are guaranteed certain representation in the House of 
Commons. This is also not true. Section 51(a) of the 
Constitution Act of 1867 makes it clear all provinces are 
guaranteed in the House of Commons at least the number of 
seats they have in the Senate. That was a provision added in 
1915.
<P>
	Obviously under that provision it has an immediate effect on 
the representation of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, 
whose seats would fall below 10 and 4 respectively if that were 
not there. It also applies to all provinces. Quebec is in effect 
guaranteed 24 seats by that provision, many more than New 
Brunswick or Prince Edward Island, although Quebec has many 
more seats.
<P>
	As well, the Constitution Act of 1982, section 41(b), the 
amending formula, makes it clear this particular provision as it 
relates to any of the provinces can only be changed with 
unanimous consent. We are all aware of the difficulties in 
getting unanimous consent. I will talk later about some of the 
things we would like to see. Clearly that is not in the cards today 
if for no other reason than all governments in the country realize 
they could never get the support of the Government of Quebec 
for any step, for any constitutional change, for anything positive 
or negative.
<P>
	Another point where the Bloc is not correct in claiming that 
only New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are protected is 
there is an additional grandfather clause in section 51 of the 
Constitution Act of 1867. It is not an especially protected 
section but it guarantees to all provinces the representation they 
had in the House of Commons in the mid-seventies, a provision 
my party does not support and a provision that can be changed 
through an act of Parliament but which this bill does not change. 
Under that provision Quebec is guaranteed the 75 seats it has 
today. Were it not for that provision Quebec's share would 
probably fall by one or two seats.
<P>
	The third Bloc assertion in this debate that has not been 
correct is that the demand Quebec be guaranteed 25 per cent of 
the seats in the House of Commons is one of the historic 
demands of the province of Quebec. I found this particularly 
interesting. I worked for the no side in the constitutional 
referendum. An argument frequently made both inside and 
outside Quebec was that this provision of the Charlottetown 
accord guaranteeing Quebec 25 per cent of the seats had in fact 
not been a historic demand of the province of Quebec and had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11662"> 11662 </A></B>
<P>
really just come out of the hurried negotiations in the  summer of 
1992. I decided to do a little bit of research and confirmed that 
was the case.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps we have overlooked something, but I cannot find any 
record of a major Quebec actor demanding a guarantee of 25 per 
cent of the seats in the House of Commons prior to the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	I would say that there are some origins, which may be in the 
Victoria conference proposal. In 1971 the Victoria 
constitutional agreement proposed that every province that at 
the time had at least 25 per cent of the population be guaranteed 
a constitutional veto indefinitely. This would have given 
Ontario and Quebec a veto over any changes to the Constitution. 
Of course it was ironic that that accord also failed, partly 
because of the attacks by the Parti Quebecois and the separatists 
in Quebec at the time. But ultimately, the accord was rejected by 
Quebec federalists as well.
<P>
	Once again, the fact of the matter, as far as we can tell, is that 
this is not a historic demand, although like so many things in this 
country it has become a demand from the very separatist 
element that rejected it in the first place, much in the way certain 
versions of the Confederation agreement are now endorsed by 
the separatists who rejected that agreement at the time.
<P>
	I want to get to the fourth Bloc contention, that somehow the 
failure to give Quebec a guaranteed representation in the House 
of Commons represents a violation of the agreement of 
Confederation. It is particularly interesting how it can represent 
a violation of an agreement that never existed. There never was 
any such provision in the Constitution of 1867.
<P>
	In making this argument the Bloc Quebecois has pointed out 
the fact that in the old Canada, the union of the two founding 
provinces we hear so much about, the union of 1841 to 1867, 
Quebec had 50 per cent of the seats and there was a dual 
premiership, as members will recall.
<P>
	Confederation came about because that arrangement broke 
down. It was completely unworkable to have the principal 
House where the guaranteed number of seats is invariant to 
population and where there will be some kind of equal marriage. 
It did not work. It brought about Confederation. And if 
Confederation were ever to fail for Quebec, as the separatists 
suggest it will, then of course the rest of Canada would never 
enter into an agreement that would recreate a union that already 
fell apart in the 1800s.
<P>
	It is important to remember what the agreement of 1867 did. It 
did not guarantee Quebec a percentage of seats in the lower 
House, as we had had prior to 1867. It had three separate 
elements that dealt much more creatively with the concerns of 
Quebec and with the other regions and the new partners of 
Confederation.
<P>
	First, it created the House of Commons, where representation 
would be on the basis of population, a principle understood in 
every democratic country in the world.
<P>
	Second, it created a federal system. This is something we 
should not forget. Colleagues in the Bloc always say that 
Quebec's power at Confederation fell from 50 per cent to 35 per 
cent. In fact it did not. Its share of the seats at this level of 
government fell from 50 per cent to 35 per cent, but the most 
important feature of Confederation was the creation of a federal 
system and the creation of the province of Quebec as a separate 
legal entity. The Confederation agreement gave Quebecers local 
autonomy through their provincial legislature over a number of 
exclusive provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	I should add that my party is opposed to the historic attempts 
of the federal Liberals to undermine those exclusive provincial 
jurisdictions. Those jurisdictions should be respected, and in 
our view the federal spending power should not be used in a way 
that intrudes upon those exclusive competencies.
<P>
	Third, the agreement of 1867 created the Senate. It created a 
separate chamber, one of the purposes of which was to provide 
guaranteed representation for various regions of the country. I 
have spoken on this many times, as members will know. That is 
in fact the chamber where regional representation for Quebec 
and for other provinces was to be guaranteed.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	That part of the accord has not worked out the way the regions 
of this country would like it to work out. One of the things that 
constantly mystifies us as western Canadians is the demand of 
Quebec separatists to abolish the upper chamber, rather than 
make it the very basis of regional representation that we in the 
regions of the country want against the enormous population 
weight of Ontario. That is rejected time and time again, although 
it is a feature of virtually every democratic federation in the 
world.
<P>
	The history of that, I should point out, is quite interesting. 
Quebec was originally guaranteed 33, a third of the seats in the 
upper House. Later, as this country grew, as western Canada 
entered, that guarantee fell to 25 per cent, since we recognized 
four regions. Today, of course, we have seats for Newfoundland 
and the territories, which are outside of the original regional 
agreement.
<P>
	There has been a guarantee in this Parliament for Quebec to 
have a certain representation. That representation is guaranteed 
in the Senate. Our provinces in the west would like to see that 
chamber become more effective. We would like to see ourselves 
guaranteed effective representation as well. That is the way to 
address this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11663"> 11663 </A></B>
<P>
	Members will recall that the Charlottetown accord was 
rejected through most of the country. The Bloc Quebecois, 
which suddenly finds it is fond of the 25 per cent guarantee in 
the Charlottetown accord, forgets that that guarantee was part of 
a package-not just the whole accord, but specifically part of a 
package of reforms to both the Senate and Commons.
<P>
	These reforms were rejected for a number of reasons, not 
simply because of the issue of departure from representation by 
population but also because of the expansion of the size of the 
House of Commons, an expansion that would have gone 
dramatically to 337 members overnight and would have moved 
even more quickly into the future. That was one reason for 
rejection, something we are now replicating with this act, 
although not as badly.
<P>
	Of course it was also rejected because of the obviously 
inadequate provisions as they related to the Senate, the failure to 
guarantee election to the upper House, the failure as well to 
guarantee effective powers for that body to protect the various 
regional interests that chamber is supposed to secure.
<P>
	I do not want to go on too long because I have talked at length 
over the past year about this bill. We remain opposed to the 
provisions of this legislation, to the idea that we should scrap the 
existing boundary commissions and start from scratch. The few 
worthwhile improvements here can certainly be deferred to the 
1996 census. We would save the taxpayers $5 million.
<P>
	I do want to emphasize that in opposing this bill we in no way 
endorse the obstructionist tactics of the Bloc Quebecois, who 
are opposing this bill for entirely different reasons related to the 
separation of Quebec. The 25 per cent guarantee they have 
demanded for Quebec and the rationale they have used to back 
that demand simply do not stand up to factual scrutiny.
<P>
	I should add in closing that it is increasingly clear that the 
reason the members of the Bloc Quebecois are so interested in 
guaranteeing a certain number of seats for Quebec in the House 
of Commons is that I think they are coming to realize that 
Quebec will be here in the House of Commons by the time the 
next election comes around and will be here for many more 
elections after that. We look forward to that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened in particular to the last part of the MP's 
speech. He knows his Canadian history. He knows the recent 
history of Quebec since Charlottetown and Meech. English 
Canada has said no to Quebec several times.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Does he not think that the people of Quebec, one of Canada's 
founding peoples, have a legitimate claim to this 25 per cent 
guarantee? I think that Quebec's request is quite modest. There 
is almost unanimous support for it, and I fail to understand why 
the hon. member from western Canada wants to completely 
ignore, under false pretexts, Quebec's legitimate request. I 
sincerely hope that he will explain the reason why.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my 
speech, I support the principle of representation by population 
in the House of Commons. It is a democratic principle enshrined 
in the Constitution.
<P>
	In fact, Quebec could end up with close to 25 per cent of the 
seats in the House after the proposed redistribution.
<P>
	In addition, when the hon. member talks about post-Meech 
Quebec, one thing is clear to me, and that is that Quebecers want 
to keep their Quebecois and Canadian identity and it is only 
within a federal state that both will be possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the debate concerns Bill C-69, which is comprehensive 
in its scope but nevertheless has a precisely defined mandate, 
and that is concerned with electoral boundary redistribution. It 
is not a place to re-examine or to start again debates that were 
conducted in other arenas in which I and other hon. members had 
the privilege of taking part. It is not a reprise of the 
Charlottetown accord debate or of other debates relating to what 
was called the statut constitionnel particulier for the province of 
Quebec or any other special arrangements. There may be a case 
for these special arrangements, but it is not a matter germane to 
the discussion today.
<P>
	What we are concerned with here is a change, a reform, if you 
wish, a modernization of the process of establishing electoral 
boundaries in Canada. It is correct to say that we are somewhat 
undeveloped in constitutional terms in our attitude toward the 
electoral processes and in the timid way in which we move up to 
the necessary and inevitable constitutionalizing of the electoral 
processes. In some other constitutional democracies, some more 
ancient than our own, others much more recent, the process is 
fully constitutionalized and there is a role for Parliament that in 
some senses we seem to be abdicating here. There is no 
particular problem in Parliament itself establishing electoral 
boundaries, provided it is governed by a code of constitutional 
principles, ideally in the constitution itself, and provided there 
is a full and effective power of judicial review. The progress 
toward full equality and participatory democracy in the United 
States has been achieved in just that way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11664"> 11664 </A></B>
<P>
	More recently, in the post-World War II German constitution, 
the constitutionalization of the electoral processes is achieved 
in the constitution, in electoral laws and in a substantial series of 
decisions by the courts.
<P>
	I do believe that this will come to pass in Canada, that the 
courts will recognize that the electoral processes go to 
constituent power, which is a pre-constitutional power but it is 
the basis on which constitutional government operates: fair, 
open, and honest elections, open to public scrutiny in all aspects 
of the processes.
<P>
	I think the best way is to draft it into the Constitution itself 
and certainly have an active, vigilant constitutional court that 
has the sophistication not to be afraid of electoral issues, as for 
many years our own courts were. They are not difficult to 
examine. The issue of basic fairness and the probity of the issues 
have been discussed and examined by supreme courts as diverse 
as those of Germany, the United States, Japan and India. The 
process works.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	What has been done is that a very strong committee of the 
House-I call it that in the language that the courts use but it is a 
strong committee-which happened to have excellent 
representation from the main opposition party, the second 
opposition party and government members, made a long 
examination of this issue and has brought forward a bill.
<P>
	It does not touch the issue of whether one province should 
have 25 per cent representation in the House. It would not have 
been germane to its mandate. In any case, I would have thought 
that with the evolution of constitutional democracy in Canada 
such an issue now could only be decided by full participatory 
democracy with the assent of the Canadian people expressed in a 
popular referendum vote. The Charlottetown process at least 
established that principle and I think all parties wish to work 
with it.
<P>
	I listened with great sympathy and admiration to the 
arguments advanced by members of the second opposition party. 
However, I feel this was not the arena in which to discuss 
limitations or increases to the size of the House other than those 
that followed logically and inevitably from the census figures, 
which is one of the vines that we have in terms of the electoral 
process as it now stands.
<P>
	What has been done here is that an attempt has been made to 
open up the process of the establishment of electoral boundaries 
by looking to the issue of who makes the decisions. If it is 
constituent power it goes to the power of Parliament itself and it 
is probably a power more awesome than that of the judges. Yet to 
date, it has been exercised by commissioners who were 
appointed on the discretion of the government of the day and 
answerable to nobody other than their own conscience in so far 
as the courts have not, as I have mentioned, exercised a review 
control in Canada.
<P>
	What has been done in this bill is a compliment to the 
collegial atmosphere in the committee on this particular point. 
A system has been set up where while the executive retains the 
power of appointment-at least Parliament does-there is a 
process of public advertising and consultation. There is the 
obligation to consult with the leaders of all the parties. Does it 
go far enough? We shall see. However, it is certainly an advance 
on the present system.
<P>
	I say that having served as an electoral commissioner myself. 
I was asked by the then Speaker of the House, Madam Sauvé, if I 
would serve as the electoral boundary commissioner because 
she wanted to get it out of politics. It is not a job that gets any 
particular awards but it is something to do in the spirit of public 
service. This is fine but it is still a system without controls. That 
is why the present proposals are an advance.
<P>
	If we look again at the reports of recent boundaries 
commissions, the justifications are at best skeletal, a few lines. 
They do not really explain the why or how and on what basis and 
what criteria the decisions were arrived at.
<P>
	In this particular bill which the committee has brought 
forward, the boundaries commissions are now required by law to 
provide three alternative maps for every constituency in which 
they report. They are required to provide a justification for their 
choice of opting for one rather than the other two.
<P>
	Again I think it is a significant advance. It may be that one 
could have gone further, but in the nature of the committee as it 
was operating and the desire to build a consensus, the chairman 
of the committee felt this was the way to go. I think it is a good 
choice. Therefore, I am optimistic about the progress that will 
be made when this bill is adopted. We do need an open process. 
We also need as much public participation as possible and a high 
degree of scrutiny.
<P>
	I think there is still a role for the courts. I would like to see this 
in the same way the justice ministry has financed litigation 
involving the Official Languages Act. Maybe test cases could be 
taken up when issues of electoral boundaries come up that raise 
constitutional principles: Is the principle of equality of 
representation adequately recognized in what the commissions 
have done? There are constitutional principles that can control 
this. Courts in Japan, India and other countries have little 
difficulty in applying them and the road would be open here.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	This bill is an example of a committee interpreting its 
mandate in a full respect for criteria of relevance. It has not tried 
to go beyond the mandate as defined. It recognizes that other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11665"> 11665 </A></B>
<P>
problems, cognate as they may be, are to be handled in other 
bills. Therefore, I think it is a significant advance.
<P>
	It does not, I repeat, replay Charlottetown. The Charlottetown 
accord was quite decisively voted on by the people of Canada 
and is now in the dustbin of history. Parts of it were interesting 
and valid and may be worth bringing back but that is a matter for 
debate elsewhere and on another occasion, not here.
<P>
	While I appreciate the eloquence of the hon. member for 
Mercier and the contributions he made to the debate, I do not 
think it really bears too much on the mandate of the committee.
<P>
	I appreciated the remarks of the hon. member for Calgary 
West. On many of the matters he has raised a great deal of 
research has been done by him and by others. There are points 
that I might share with him but again, I do not feel that for this 
particular bill this is the occasion to get into these matters.
<P>
	I take pride as a member of the committee concerned. It 
worked very well. It is an attempt to replace a system that was 
somewhat arbitrary in the sense that the commissioners were 
selected by a process in which there was no real review. They 
were not required to provide criteria for their decisions. In 
essence we had situations where decisions could be, as was said 
of Lord Eldon's chancellorship ``an inequity as long as the 
chancellor's foot''. That is not good constitutionalism.
<P>
	This is a good step forward. It is on that basis I commend it to 
the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member opposite, in referring to the speech by 
the hon. member for Mercier, indicated his interest in what she 
said and, in turn, I may say I was very interested in the way the 
hon. member opposite used examples from other countries and 
went back in history to support his argument.
<P>
	I would be interested to know whether he was aware that, at 
the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Hungarians within 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire were in a situation quite similar 
to that of present-day Quebecers in the Canadian federation. In 
other words, they were an unhappy minority. They rebelled and 
were defeated, but subsequently, the Austrians, who were the 
ruling majority in the Empire, decided to negotiate and in the 
process recognized the so-called double monarchy, a structure 
in which both peoples, the minority and the majority, enjoyed a 
certain level of equality to defend interests they might or might 
not have in common.
<P>
	In the same century there was another situation very similar to 
ours, and I am referring to the Norwegians who were not happy 
about being part of the kingdom of Sweden. They were an 
unhappy minority. Like the Hungarians, they rebelled, and were 
defeated. Subsequently, the Swedes agreed to negotiate and 
recognized a status also referred to as a double monarchy, which 
also included a parity structure that was different from 
Parliament but nevertheless a parity structure. I may recall that, 
in the twentieth century, both  Hungary and Norway became 
independent. They were recognized as independent states.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member opposite whether he feels-and 
he may not agree-that in this Parliament, representation should 
be based on population?
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Does he agree there are two founding peoples here and at what 
level would he see a parity structure that would recognize that 
fact, or does he deny there are two founding peoples in this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his remarks. I am quite familiar with the history of 
the Austro-Hungarian empire and its particular constitutional 
theory. I make reference to it in a number of my books and am 
very often quoted by learned Quebecers in the debate on the 
development of the quiet revolution.
<P>
	Nevertheless, all of the facts must be examined. The 
Austro-Hungarian empire was not a developed democracy as we 
know it today. We must also recognize that the dual monarchy 
was, in a way, intolerant of the rights of other minorities. The 
claims of the slavic minority were not recognized, which gives 
us cause to look at the failure of the Austro-Hungarian empire, 
in view of its defeat in the first World War.
<P>
	Comparisons may be made between Canada and the 
Austro-Hungarian empire of the 19th century, and in particular 
the Ausgleich agreement, as it is known in German, of 1867. 
However, very very few of them may be made. As to whether the 
Canadian constitution can accommodate a situation similar to 
that of the Austro-Hungarian empire of the time, I would like to 
point out that the federal system is very flexible and capable of 
accommodating many different constitutional arrangements.
<P>
	The prerequisite today, however, is that these claims be 
approved by popular vote. This is the fundamental reason for the 
failure of the Charlottetown accord. Under these circumstances, 
should the question arise in the future, yes, our federal system 
can accommodate any constitutional variation, provided it has 
been submitted to and approved by a popular vote.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
deference to the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, I will not 
ask a question outside the scope of the bill, but rather one within 
its scope.
<P>
	He made some comment about the constitutionalizing of these 
provisions. One thing that is being kept in the bill which is in the 
existing legislation is the variation of 25 per cent from the 
quotient for the size of populations of electoral districts. He will 
also know that in this bill not only do we keep that variation in 
normal circumstances, but we continue to leave open the possi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11666"> 11666 </A></B>
<P>
bility of extraordinary circumstances where those variations 
will get much larger.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that in the United States the 
general direction I think it is fair to say has been partly imposed 
by the courts over time. In the House of Representatives ridings 
are created that are almost equal in population, of course with 
their peculiarities which we would not necessarily allow here.
<P>
	On the question of variation, as an academic expert I would 
like him to inform the House why we have gone in the direction 
of allowing very large variations in Canada, whereas the United 
States with a country of similar size has been able to create 
constituencies that are virtually equal in size. Would he like to 
see our country consider moves in that direction in the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Calgary West for the very thoughtful question. He will know 
that we discussed this matter in committee and on some of these 
points our views were closer than the report of the committee 
might indicate.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The United States constitution, in its evolution, is assisted by 
the fact of equality of representation in the Senate, so that 
Americans do not have to justify to the extent other countries do 
disproportionately large electorates for some states and 
disproportionately small electorates for others.
<P>
	The United States Supreme Court has said, at least Mr. Justice 
Douglas has said, that equal things are to be treated equally, 
according to the doctrine of equality before the law, but unequal 
things do not have to be treated with the same canon of legal 
equality. Putting it this way, I can see the case, as a city member, 
made for country constituencies, that a lesser number of voters 
should be tolerated. I can see the case for going to 15 per cent. I 
had some problems with the 25 but I recognize that in 
committee, a consensus emerges and one accepts it.
<P>
	We are not yet in the same situation as Japan where the 
supreme court had to rule on a situation where the electoral 
districts in Tokyo had five times the number of electors as the 
districts in the neighbouring country regions. Obviously that is a 
disproportion that cannot be tolerated.
<P>
	Where do we draw the line? The committee, with some 
accommodation from urban members like myself and the hon. 
member opposite, tried to recognize the special quality of life of 
country constituencies and that perhaps a lesser number of 
electors was required. The 25 per cent has to be seen in that 
light. However, it would be simpler if we had a Senate with 
equal representation or something of that sort. The reform of the 
Senate is a subject on which the hon. member and I have many 
views, but it is, again, not a matter for this discussion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to speak again at the third reading 
stage of this bill on behalf of the official opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois, the sovereignist party in Ottawa, on an issue as 
important as the act to provide for the establishment of electoral 
boundaries commissions and the readjustment of electoral 
boundaries.
<P>
	I would like to explain in very simple terms to the people 
listening to us that this bill establishes regulations for future 
federal elections.
<P>
	At first sight, this bill might seem of little interest to Bloc 
members. English Canada provinces could settle the matter 
among themselves since, when the next federal election is held, 
Quebec will probably be a sovereign country.
<P>
	However, in October 1993, I was elected-I reiterate this fact 
because I know that my colleagues across the way like to hear 
it-first, to look after Quebecers' interests and, second, to 
promote sovereignty in Ottawa, as I often do.
<P>
	However, in fulfilling the mandate of looking after 
Quebecers' interests, Bloc members must be vigilant. It is 
because of this vigilance that we are denouncing this bill, which 
goes against Quebecers' interests.
<P>
	The process that led to the drafting of Bill C-69 went through 
Bill C-18, which was tabled in this House over a year ago. Bill 
C-18 suspended the electoral boundaries readjustment process 
then in progress for 24 months before a new debate on 
redistribution could start.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Reform Party objected to that bill and its 
proposed 24-month suspension. Nevertheless, the House, as we 
know, passed Bill C-18.
<P>
	However, when the bill went to the other House, the hon. 
senators did the job that Reformers had initiated in this place. 
The other House included in Bill C-18 an amendment providing 
that a new bill must be tabled by June 1995 at the latest, or else 
the old legislation and the commissions suspended by Bill C-18 
would be reinstated.
<P>
	The bill before us has two objectives, the official objective 
and the unofficial one, which is just as important if not more so: 
to reduce as much as possible Quebec's political weight in this 
House.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Of course the strategy has changed. Since Lord Durham 
tabled his report, English Canada, the federalists have taken a 
different approach. The approach may be a more subtle one, but 
the ultimate goal has remained unchanged: the assimilation of 
Quebecers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11667"> 11667 </A></B>
<P>
	How can this be achieved? By failing to recognize Quebec, 
the people of Quebec, as a founding nation, by not recognizing 
its distinctiveness, by quashing their every demand and 
legislating to reduce the political weight of Quebecers in Ottawa 
by increasing the number of members from outside Quebec, 
members who will vote against Quebec and put Quebec in its 
place at the first opportunity.
<P>
	But history has taught us that one does not have to come from 
outside Quebec to vote with the English Canada majority and 
against Quebec in particular. We need not think back very far 
indeed to realize that. I can see it happen regularly since coming 
to this place. I saw it again with my own two eyes during the vote 
at report stage, when Liberal members from Quebec ignored 
Quebecers' wishes and defeated a motion presented by the Bloc 
Quebecois to ensure that a minimum of 25 per cent of seats in the 
House of Commons go to Quebec.
<P>
	Yet, this was a very simple motion and it read as follows: 
``Notwithstanding the foregoing, when by application of this 
subsection the number of members to be assigned to the 
Province of Quebec is less than 25 per cent of the total number of 
members in the House of Commons, the Chief Electoral Officer 
shall assign at least 25 per cent of the total number to the 
Province of Quebec''.
<P>
	Quebec's influence on decisions made in this House will not 
start to decline in 100 years, but immediately. In the next federal 
election, Quebec will no longer have the same decision-making 
influence, it will be smaller. The figures speak for themselves. 
Our numbers will be reduced, falling below the 25 per cent level 
of representation we have always had in this House. Never in the 
history of Quebec have members from Quebec opposed a motion 
to protect Quebec's legitimate rights, to protect its political 
weight within the Canadian federation.
<P>
	What are we, members from Quebec, here for? What have we 
been elected to do? Every member from Quebec in this House, 
regardless of political affiliation-whether red, blue, yellow, 
whatever-was elected by Quebecers to look after Quebec's 
interests. This motion to ensure a 25 per cent minimum was 
designed to protect Quebec's interests and that is why we 
presented it.
<P>
	We and all these other members have the duty to protect 
among other things Quebec's political and decision-making 
influence. The federal government ignored Quebec in this bill. 
The same way, Quebec will ignore Canada before long. When I 
see the government and the third party, the Reform Party, hand 
in hand, joining forces against Quebec, I know it is high time 
that we pack up and leave.
<P>
	The Bloc motion would have guaranteed one quarter of the 
seats to one of the two founding nations of Canada, while also 
complying with the traditional and legitimate requests of 
Quebecers to preserve minimum political leverage within the 
Canadian federation. The  attitude of the Liberal members is 
hypocritical. Barely three years ago, these same Liberals 
defended Quebec's right to 25 per cent of the seats in the House 
of Commons. Back then, they formed the opposition. It is 
strange how time changes things sometimes.
<P>
	Given that attitude, many of the positive aspects of this 
legislation are eliminated. Members worked hard to come up 
with a bill designed to improve the whole redistribution process. 
However, their efforts were vain, since the government ignored 
some very important recommendations.
<P>
	Had some specific provisions been included in it, this 
legislation could have sent an ultimate message to Quebecers. 
Instead, the government preferred to team up with the Reform 
Party to once again put Quebec in a vulnerable position. 
Nevertheless, as I said earlier, there are some positive aspects to 
this legislation and I will list a few.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	For example, after a decennial census, the changes to the 
electoral map will be followed by a readjustment five years 
later, so as to avoid drastic changes in the electoral districts. 
This is a good change which fulfils a need.
<P>
	The population of each electoral district will be allowed to 
vary by more or less 25 per cent from the electoral quota for the 
province. This is a minimum which, I think, had to be included 
in the bill.
<P>
	Provincial commissions will have to hold public hearings 
before starting their work. Again, this is in response to a 
legitimate request made by constituents from every riding.
<P>
	In determining electoral district boundaries, the provincial 
commissions will have to consider the community of interest, 
the size of each district, as well as foreseeable geographic 
changes. In a riding such as Berthier-Montcalm, which I have 
the honour to represent, the need for such criteria is obvious. 
Otherwise, we end up with ridings of 50, 52 or 60 
municipalities. There has to be at least a certain sense of 
belonging and the bill ensures that this is the case.
<P>
	Provincial commissions will have to submit three draft maps 
and hold new hearings if necessary. Again, this is very good.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
mentioned, something had to be done. I am referring to the 
member's comments because he put the finger on an extremely 
important aspect of the issue. He said the following: ``It seems 
to me that it is not simply a question of ensuring adequate 
mathematical representation but of ensuring adequate 
representation''. These are two very different matters. Equity 
cannot be measured mathematically. If it could, we would fix 
the problem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11668"> 11668 </A></B>
<P>
on our calculators and save a lot of money. But when a riding is 
as small as six blocks of Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver versus 
55 or 60 municipalities, like my riding, Berthier-Montcalm,  
should other criteria not be taken into consideration to ensure 
that the citizens of these ridings are as well represented in 
Parliament as those of urban downtown ridings in big cities?
<P>
	The suggested changes addressed this issue, but, as I said 
earlier, the snub on Quebec that this bill contains is totally 
unacceptable. In fact, and I will close on this note, Bill C-69 
gives no mandate in this area and it could easily have given one 
to some parliamentary committee. I think that it is not the means 
to resolve the problem of Quebec's dwindling representation in 
the House of Commons that is lacking.
<P>
	Worse yet, Bill C-69 gives no guarantee that the continual 
reduction in the number of members in this House from Quebec 
will be halted. On the contrary, the bill maintains the formula set 
out in section 51 of the British North America Act, which results 
in a weakening of Quebec's influence within federal 
institutions.
<P>
	You will understand that, as long as the people of Quebec have 
not made a decision on their future, which will certainly be in 
favour of sovereignty, it is very important that Quebec 
maintains adequate representation within federal institutions.
<P>
	I disagree with some of the comments which the Reform 
member made and I think that, given that we are here to defend 
the interests of Quebec, we are here to play to win from within 
the system and we will do everything possible to guarantee 
Quebec minimum representation, and demanding 25 per cent is 
a way of guaranteeing Quebec a minimum impact on decisions 
made in this House.
<P>
	We are not demanding this because they say we are going to 
lose the referendum, on the contrary, we are going to win it. 
However, I think that, at the very least, a member who represents 
the interests of Quebec had an obligation to present this motion, 
to guarantee Quebecers the 25 per cent we have always had since 
Confederation and which we will lose in the next election 
because of a Liberal government that failed to make any 
provisions for this in the bill.
<P>
	All Quebecers, whether or not they agree on sovereignty, 
agree that Quebec should at least keep 25 per cent. And since 
everyone likes Quebecers or at least that is what they say, we 
should be able to get unanimous consent in this House.
<P>
	I want to ask the Liberal members from Quebec and the 
government to rescind the previous vote so that we can have a 
bill that reflects the unanimous demands of Quebecers, 
including Quebec federalists with their stuffed beaver policy, as 
some radio commentators refer to Daniel Johnson's policy.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Even Liberal members from Quebec-and I see some 
members across the way who were in the National Assembly 
before and are very much aware of Daniel Johnson's political 
allegiance-even Mr. Johnson said yes, Quebec should have at 
least 25 per cent. I think Quebecers are unanimous on this.
<P>
	I am sure there is some formula we could use in this House to 
rescind the vote at the report stage and include the motion 
presented by the Bloc Quebecois. I think that, all things 
considered, after everything we read in the papers and all the 
pressure on the Liberals across the way in connection with the 
Bloc's motion, which was entirely legitimate, I am sure there is 
some way to rescind this vote and guarantee 25 per cent of the 
seats for Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a question for the hon. member.
<P>
	How does he see the role of members from Quebec who 
support this bill? Does he think that members from Quebec who 
support this bill are defending Quebec's interests?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer this 
question without commenting-I think there is a rule about 
this-on how Liberal members from Quebec voted.
<P>
	However, as I said in my speech, if a member from from 
Quebec who was elected by Quebecers is truly here to defend 
their interests, that member cannot do otherwise but vote in 
favour of this motion which would guarantee 25 per cent of the 
seats. We did not ask for the moon. We did not ask for 
exceptional powers. We wanted this bill to recognize the fact 
that Quebec was one of the two founding peoples. It was that 
simple. It was easy to do. They could have put it in the bill.
<P>
	I think the Liberals from Quebec understand this. They could 
have put it in the bill if they had done some lobbying, something 
Liberals are very good at. The members from Quebec could have 
lobbied their own caucus and their own ministers to include in 
this bill a clause mandating a group of parliamentarians to find a 
way to let Quebec have 25 per cent of the seats as requested by 
us, the Bloc Quebecois and by all Quebecers. But they did not. I 
think the answer to the question from the hon. member for 
Québec-Est is clear. I think the interests of Quebec demanded it 
and that they failed to act accordingly.

one clause in the act. However, without the amendment we 
would have to suspend the program. Bill C-75 would increase 
the total amount of loans guaranteed under the act over a 
five-year period from $1.5 billion to $3 billion. Before I get into 
the question of why we want to make this change, I will tell the 
House a little about the FIMCLA program.
<P>
	This program has been around for 50 years. It started with the 
Farm Improvement Loans Act passed in 1943 and came into 
effect in 1945. It was the first guaranteed loan program in 
Canada and was followed by student and small business loans. It 
is probably the most successful of all those programs.
<P>
	At first the farm improvement loan program was intended to 
help tenant farmers get access to funding to improve their farms 
or farm living conditions. The guarantees were needed. They 
could not offer the land as security since they were tenants. 
Therefore they were unable to get bank loans. Over the years it 
has been a very popular program especially in western Canada, 
becoming increasingly popular throughout the nation.
<P>
	Now farmers use the program to get loans of up to a maximum 
$250,000 for a wide range of farm improvement programs and 
projects such as acquisition of additional breeding stock, more 
land, improvements to buildings, fencing projects, irrigation, 
improved waste disposal facilities, et cetera. It could also be 
used and is being used to try alternative farming methods, 
whether organic farming or any other type of alternative method 
that farmers are now so aggressively pursuing in the 
diversification of their operations.
<P>
	In addition, the program facilitates access to credit for farmer 
owned marketing co-operatives for activities that add value to 
the agricultural production. For example, a co-op could borrow 
up to $3 million under FIMCLA to build a juice plant, or 
something with vegetables or any other type of co-operative 
dealing with further value adding and processing of agriculture 
products.
<P>
	Loans to co-operatives must be approved by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. Under this program borrowers 
benefit from interest rate savings of about 0.5 per cent and a 
lower equity requirement usually around a minimum 20 per 
cent.
<P>
	The program is very popular and is becoming even more 
popular every year. Five years ago the department began to 
encourage credit unions and caisse populaires to make the 
program available to their customers as well. This has added 
about 600 new designated lenders throughout the country.
<P>
	In towns which may only have one bank or one credit union or 
no bank or no credit union, farmers often had to drive to another 
town to get financing. With this change they suddenly had a lot 
more lenders to work with. In addition, we have seen sustained 
lower interest rates, higher farm equipment sales and an 
improved farm debt situation in the last few years.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the number of loans registered under the 
program has more than tripled from about 4,800 in 1990-91 to 
nearly 18,500 in 1994-95. The value of those loans has climbed 
from just under $82 million per year to $515 million per year. 
This year we expect the loans to reach $550 million, bringing a 
five-year aggregate to $1.4 billion. We expect that to remain 
constant for the years ahead. At a level of a $3 billion cap we 
will now be allowed to continue to offer the program. Most of 
the new growth has taken place in Quebec and Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Not long ago there was only a single lender using the program 
in Quebec. Now the giant Caisse Populaire Desjardins 
movement has become a major participant and Quebec has the 
third highest number of loans of any province. Similarly in 
Alberta, which has the second highest number of loans, the 
Alberta treasury branches have become a significant lender 
under FIM-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11670"> 11670 </A></B>
<P>
CLA. However, Saskatchewan is still the biggest user of the 
program.
<P>
	This new growth has caused the government to propose this 
amendment to increase the cap. If we do not, as I said before, the 
program could reach its $1.5 billion cap in June of this year and 
then we would have to suspend the program for about two years.
<P>
	In preparation for this amendment we have consulted with the 
people who are most closely involved in the FIMCLA program, 
including major farm organizations like the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture as well as commercial lenders.
<P>
	I would also like to address the inevitable question of why we 
are increasing the cap on this program by $1.5 billion at a time of 
government restraint. I want to make clear this amendment does 
not in any way represent $1.5 billion in new spending. Over the 
last 30 years the program costs have averaged slightly over $1 
million a year. It is a loan guarantee, not a loan of the actual 
money.
<P>
	The 25-year net loss rate under FIMCLA has been about 1 per 
cent. If we look at other government programs it shows the 
dedication to repaying loans and the low loss in those loans in 
the agricultural community over the years, a record it can be 
proud of. This loss was a bit higher in the 1980s for obvious 
reasons but we expect it now to stay at less than 1 per cent in the 
foreseeable future.
<P>
	The government has made a commitment to provide farmers 
with the tools they need. FIMCLA is one such tool, an 
inexpensive tool that offers a considerable amount of assistance 
to the agri-food sector. It supports adaptation, diversification 
and encourages regional development and job creation.
<P>
	The government has recently increased the cap on small 
business loans to a total of $12 billion for the same reason. Here 
again we are asking for the assistance to increase the cap on the 
Farm Improvement and Marketing Co-operatives Loans Act.
<P>
	At this time I urge all members in the House to support the 
amendment which will double the cap on loans under the Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Co-operatives Loans Act and 
enable this low cost support to farmers to continue. I look 
forward to the support of all members in the House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-75, which we are debating this afternoon, is neither very long 
nor complex. It may, in fact, be summarized in a single, very 
simple, clause, which provides that the maximum of guaranteed 
loans will increase from $1.5 billion to $3 billion.
<P>
	As my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-food, has just pointed out, this refers 
merely to loan guarantees. The government is not injecting an 
additional $3 billion or $1.5 billion into the agricultural 
sector-far from it. Bill  C-75 is therefore simply an 
amendment to the Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Cooperatives Loans Act.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I must say that, when I read the title of this bill, I thought it 
was rather long. Like the Prime Minister, I counted the words. 
There are 16 words in the name of the act. There could, in my 
opinion, have been a lot fewer.
<P>
	The amendment, therefore, is aimed at doubling the amount 
and the number of loans guaranteed under the terms of this act. 
The amendment simply increases the cap of guarantees for loans 
given by banking institutions in response to increased demand. 
The current cap is $1.5 billion, and with the adoption of Bill 
C-75, the limit will increase to $3 billion. For many farmers, 
this increase means greater access to financing.
<P>
	Even though the bill concerns loan guarantees and not the 
investment of new money, an important question arises: Will 
taxpayers be bearing the costs of this increase directly? 
Although we are talking about loan guarantees, the risk of non 
payment remains, and, in the end, all taxpayers will have to foot 
the bill.
<P>
	According to data from the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-food, losses due to non payment or non reimbursement 
represent more or less one per cent of the total loan guarantees. 
Therefore, the cost of the program will be relatively low. 
Nevertheless, one per cent of $3 billion could end up costing 
Canadian taxpayers $30 million.
<P>
	Therefore, for the good of the farmers, the Bloc Quebecois 
will support the increase in the cap from $1.5 billion to $3 
billion by supporting Bill C-75. In the present context, it is 
almost impossible for the provinces to gain a little more 
autonomy from the federal government. The only solution in the 
short term, and it is only for farmers, I repeat, is to allow the 
government to go ahead with Bill C-75.
<P>
	However, I must point out that our support is based solely on a 
concern that farmers get the financing they need and are entitled 
to. Apart from this vital aspect, it is as clear as spring water that 
we cannot allow duplication to pass without comment. I wish to 
draw the attention of all my colleagues and especially you, Mr. 
Speaker, to the fact that Bill C-75 involves duplication from two 
levels of government, as I will explain to you.
<P>
	The basic question we must ask ourselves is not only whether 
the limit provided for in the act to amend the Farm Improvement 
and Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act is high enough but 
whether the program as a whole is relevant. According to 
Agriculture Canada figures, the demand for loan guarantees is 
growing. It is this excessive demand that justifies the limit 
increase.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11671"> 11671 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know as well as I do that the cost of farms 
has risen, as has the cost of buildings, of extensions. The cost of 
farm machinery such as tractors and combine-harvesters has 
gone up and even doubled in the last 10 years. The cost of 
digging manure pits keeps going up. I think that increasing the 
limit was justified.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I will not deny the importance for farmers of having access to 
financing in order to improve or expand their facilities. All the 
more reason to make their lives easier and allow them to meet 
their needs in a single place. More and more, Quebec favours the 
single window concept at all levels. In Quebec, there are now 
three organizations in place to help Quebec farmers who need 
financing.
<P>
	Last weekend, I met with several farmers including my friend 
Bertrand Lacroix of Second Street in Disraeli, who explained to 
me how complex our situation is. On the one hand, you have 
Quebec's Société du financement agricole, which a few years 
ago was called the Office du crédit agricole and which comes 
under Quebec jurisdiction. On the other hand, you have the Farm 
Credit Corporation, which comes under federal jurisdiction. 
Thirdly, since there are 12 words in the bill before us this 
afternoon, an act to amend the Farm Improvement and 
Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act, from now on I will use the 
acronym AAFIMCLA. You can see how complex this is. We are 
really asking for it.
<P>
	I am far from proud this afternoon of supporting this bill on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. Our accumulated deficit exceeds 
$550 billion. While the deficit for this fiscal year will be close to 
$40 billion, the government is increasing duplication and 
overlap. This is a good example of overlap within the same 
government. At the federal level, farmers can borrow either 
from the Farm Credit Corporation or under the Farm 
Improvement Loans Act. Why not consolidate all that? I am sure 
tens of millions of dollars would be saved each year this way. 
Not only would this government save tens of millions dollars 
each year, but it would be much more efficient. It is even worse 
for Quebec farmers, who have a third choice in the farm finance 
corporation.
<P>
	Saturday afternoon, the farm producer I was visiting told me 
that he had had to shop around in order to finance his new 
facility. He applied for all three and came to the conclusion that 
the program that best suited his expansion needs-I am not 
saying that it would be the same for everyone, but for him-was 
the one offered by the Société de financement du Québec. 
Another time, the Farm Credit Corporation could prove to be a 
better choice. In this instance, he told me that he had weighed 
the three programs against one another and that the best deal was 
that of the Société de financement agricole, formerly known as 
Quebec Farm Credit Bureau.
<P>
	The bottom line is that a great deal of money is totally wasted 
on programs administered by three separate agencies. In their 
next budget, the various provincial  governments, particularly 
Quebec and Ontario, which are two large provinces, will 
probably have to follow our finance minister's lead and hit their 
taxpayers hard. They will have to account for moneys spent, in 
my view, wastefully on duplication. In Quebec, we know what 
duplication is. We have been aware of this for quite a while, and 
that is why we would rather have our own tool box, with all the 
tools required to develop fully, freely and completely.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	If the three programs I just mentioned are different, is it not 
because appropriate resources are scattered in three different 
places? What if the resources allocated to the other two agencies 
were made available to the Société du financement agricole? I 
would bet that it could provide new programs. It would be what 
we call a single window.
<P>
	The province may have set criteria and standards of its own, 
which are not in line with what the federal government had in 
mind. Let us assume, for example, that the Quebec farm finance 
corporation's standards are higher that those set in bill C-75 for 
whatever reason. By setting separate standards, the federal 
government is once again interfering in provincial areas of 
responsibility.
<P>
	Rather than moving to my next point, Mr. Speaker, I could 
stop here, and let you have the floor to call statements by 
members, and I could continue after oral question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Certainly, dear colleague. I thank you for 
letting me take the floor, as the saying goes.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), we will now 
proceed to Statements by Members.

took place in the heartland of America. The bombing of the

witnessed at the provincial legislature in Prince Edward Island

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, not 
only has the ``No'' side nothing to offer Quebecers in the 
upcoming referendum, but more importantly, the Liberal Party 
in Quebec has begun to shun Quebec's traditional claims.
<P>
	Federalists have offhandedly dismissed four of the five 
conditions set during the Meech Lake negotiations, at the time 
considered to be a bare minimum by the Liberal Party, and now 
propose to promote Quebec's development and to define its 
place in the Canadian federation through obscure administrative 
agreements.
<P>
	Administrative agreements have never been used to 
acknowledge a people's existence or to grant them the powers 
they need to develop. The Liberal Party is not proposing ``quiet 
affirmation'' but more a strategy of ``quiet resignation''.

Hutu refugees by Tutsi government soldiers.
<P>
	Previous, smaller group killings of Rwandan refugees have

Saturday's massacre would occur. Yet once again, the world and 
the United Nations stood by, only able to watch helplessly as 
these events unfolded before our eyes.
<P>
	In this 50th anniversary year of the United Nations, events 
such as this make it critically vital that international 
communities work together to agree to reform United Nations 
structure and procedures to enable the UN to respond effectively 
at short notice so that atrocities such as the tragic massacre 
witnessed this weekend will become a thing of the past.
<P>
	In the meantime, the international community should ensure 
that those responsible for perpetrating this horror are identified 
and punished. Only in this way can it be made clear that the 
world cannot and will not accept such behaviour.

the former Yugoslavia possess inalienable rights of freedom and

government must be held accountable for the actions of its army 
and justice must be served.

Nothing exemplifies this lack of representation more than the 
growing smuggling problem.
<P>
	The Liberal solution to smuggling announced last February 
has failed to stem the tide of guns, alcohol, drugs and tobacco 
streaming into Ontario. Smuggling accounts for the vast 
majority of cases involving the criminal use of firearms in 
Ontario and it facilitates the illegal use of drugs. It has cost 
thousands of jobs in the distilling industry and the government 
has lost billions of dollars in revenue.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last Friday when he visited the Valcartier military 
base, the Prime Minister said that Quebec City lost the G-7 
Summit because the Canadian flag is not flown from the city 
hall.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I want to ask 
him whether he does not think it was rather petty to disqualify 
Quebec City just because of a flag?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Halifax was selected on the merits of its location. The 
first economic summit was held in Quebec at Montebello. The 
second summit was held in Toronto, and we decided to have the 
third one in Halifax, in the Maritimes where occasions like this 
one are few and far between. At the time, we received 
representations from a number of people from Quebec City and, 
as I said at the time, it is not very pleasant when the mayor of a 
city in

<B><A NAME="11676"> 11676 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec comes to ask favours from the Canadian government 
and refuses to show the flag of his country, the Canadian flag. 
When the Prime Minister of Canada was about to invite 
international leaders to Quebec City, the mayor was not 
prepared to show that he himself was a Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, no one in Quebec is asking favours from anyone, 
and especially not the mayor of Quebec City in his capacity as 
mayor. We pay taxes here. We pay taxes. This is our money you 
are spending, and we want our fair share. And we are certainly 
not seen as begging favours from the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> It costs us $30 billion in taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to understand that this 
petty and mean decision on the part of the Prime Minister to 
disqualify Quebec from hosting the G-7 summit was inspired by 
the same desire to get even that permeated the government's 
actions on MIL Davie, manpower training and cuts in transfer 
payments for social programs, to punish Quebeckers for 
supporting the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see the Leader of the Opposition is easily upset, but 
despite the lack of courtesy shown by the mayor of Quebec, we 
support the interests of Quebec City, which is borne out by the 
fact that throughout the world at this very moment, Canadian 
ambassadors are trying to get the 2002 winter games for Quebec 
City, in spite of the mayor of Quebec City.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if the Prime Minister thinks all sovereignist 
mayors in Quebec are discourteous, since there are quite a few 
of them, that means there are quite a few discourteous mayors in 
Quebec. There are quite a few people in Quebec who are 
discourteous, in that case, and they will show it when all 
sovereignists join in making the referendum this fall a victory 
for sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> We will win that one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Are we to conclude from what the Prime 
Minister said in Valcartier that his only strategy now is to scare 
Quebeckers before the referendum that will be held shortly?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition wants a referendum as 
soon as possible. That is not what he told Parizeau last week. If 
the Leader of the Opposition wants to win the referendum, the 
question should be very simple and very clear. Ask Quebeckers: 
Do you want to stay in Canada? And we will all vote yes, 
including the Péquistes.

Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Last September, Michel Robert, spokesperson for the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee told the 
Sub-committee on National Security that he did not know what 
had become of Grant Bristow. The <I>Toronto Star</I> has uncovered 
him in Edmonton, complete with a new identity, a new house, 
two cars and an income of $3,000 a month, compliments of the 
Government of Canada and Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Before providing Mr. Bristow with a new identity and sending 
him into hiding once again, would the Solicitor General 
acknowledge that Mr. Bristow must appear before the 
Sub-committee on National Security in order to fully clarify his 
role in the racist group Heritage Front and his infiltration into 
the entourage of the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has never been confirmed that Grant Bristow is a 
CSIS source or was a CSIS source. As a result I do not think 
there is anything further I can add in reply to the hon. member's 
question.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the Solicitor General abdicate his 
responsibilities with regard to Grant Bristow's role as a CSIS 
source, when a report by the review committee considers that 
Mr. Bristow exceeded the mandate of a CSIS source.

	Why is the Solicitor General making such an effort to hide 
Grant Bristow?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think my hon. friend is mistaken. The report of the

confirm that Grant Bristow was a source of CSIS. It did however 
confirm that CSIS did a good job, a proper job and a necessary 
job investigating the Heritage Front.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow the federal cabinet will do something it has never 
done before. It will issue a cabinet directive overturning a CRTC 
decision on direct to home satellite television at the specific 
request of Power Corp.
<P>
	In fact Power Corp. went so far as to say that it would 
withdraw its bid if the cabinet did not rule in its favour. It is 
amazing what one can accomplish when one has friends or 
fathers-in-law in high places.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. If the government felt 
so strongly about opening satellite television to competition, 
why was it not done through the appropriate channels and why is 
Power Corp. running the show?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry the usual critic is not here. Perhaps she 
would understand the process a little better. The hon. member 
will know-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have been away for a little while and 
probably have forgotten that we do not make reference to when 
members are here or not here. I would ask the hon. minister to 
keep that in mind when answering.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Actually, Mr. Speaker, I am never quite sure 
when the members are here or when they are not here.
<P>
	The hon. member should be aware the concerns the 
government expressed about the order the CRTC issued last 
summer were precisely along the lines of the question he puts. 
The CRTC authorized the consortium to initiate a direct to home 
satellite service in Canada without issuing a licence and without 
any public transparency process, by issuing an exemption order 
which has the effect, as the hon. member should know, of 
creating a monopoly in this service in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	If the Reform Party is in favour of a monopoly in services and 
opposed to a transparent licensing system then let it say so. That 
seems to be the implication of the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> I guess, Mr. Speaker, I 
get to see arrogance in its visual form.
<P>
	The Reform Party favours open competition and a firm policy 
that safeguards the best interest of the country and Canadians. 
However, if questions are being raised about the propriety of the 
deal the government has no one to blame but itself. Power Corp. 
said jump, and the cabinet and the Prime Minister asked how 
high by using special powers to overturn the CRTC original 
decision. This was all being done behind closed doors. Certainly 
consumers may benefit in the end but the end does not justify the 
means.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the minister. Will he assure 
the House that any further decisions on the direct to home 
satellite industry will be taken in full public view and not behind 
closed doors at special cabinet meetings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is hard to avoid being accused of arrogance when the 
member's question is full of factual errors.
<P>
	The reality is that we invited the panel of experts to conduct 
an open and transparent process. All the submissions received 
by the review panel were publicized with time for public 
response to the submissions, unlike the issue of the exemption 
order in the first place.
<P>
	If cabinet decides that it will accept the recommendations of 
the review panel it would do so in a statutory and transparent 
way by referring such an order to the House of Commons and to 
the Senate for review over a period of 40 days. That is what the 
law provides. It is entirely open and entirely transparent. If we 
decide to do so, the member and other members of his party will 
be most welcome to make their submissions well known both on 
competition as well as on the future of DTH services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the 
cabinet's unprecedented use of special powers to overturn a 
CRTC decision, which contradicts the red book promise of open 
government, the federal government is now becoming more 
powerful and more secretive.
<P>
	For instance, the regulatory efficiency act will give the 
cabinet power to exempt companies from regulations through 
special private compliance plans. The potential for abuse is 
staggering. Canadians should be driving the country's agenda, 
not cabinet and special interest groups. The system must be 
transparent.
<P>
	Will the government scrap the regulatory efficiency act 
immediately and keep power in the hands of Parliament where it 
belongs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again the preamble to the question misses the point of 
what is proposed in the issuance of a direction to the CRTC. Yes, 
it is the first time but the act was passed only a short time ago; it 
is one of the first opportunities to exercise the power. However it 
is very carefully circumscribed in the Broadcasting Act. 
Therefore it is important for us, if we make that choice, to do so 
in a way that complies with the act, that is transparent and that is 
open. This is the essence of what we are trying to accomplish 
with respect to the order.
<P>
	As far as the regulatory efficiency act is concerned the 
member is entitled to engage in debate about it, but he should 
understand that one of the objectives of the act is to ensure that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11678"> 11678 </A></B>
<P>
we reduce the burden particularly on small and medium size 
business in order to make the economy grow.

business then let it say so.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
the Prime Minister undertake before this House not to take 
advantage of the probable election of a Liberal government in 
Ontario to review the GST without Quebec's consent?

with regard to the GST, we are looking for a way to replace this 
tax. We wrote in our red book that we wanted to replace it.

government keeps telling Canadians that everything is okay yet 
in light of Moody's downgrade it should be obvious it is not.
<P>
	If the government's fiscal plan is so good, then can the Prime 
Minister tell us why since the government's first budget interest 
rates have risen by more than 400 bases points? Why have 
five-year mortgage rates risen more than 2 per cent costing 
homeowners an extra $300 per month on a $100,000 mortgage? 
Also, why has the dollar lost over 20 per cent of its value versus 
the yen and the mark?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fundamentals of our economic policies have been 
recognized as being very good.
<P>
	Again this morning the IMF predicted the best level of growth 
for Canada this year. Inflation in Canada is among the lowest in 
the world. Of course there is some increase in interest rates due 
to circumstances that are not necessarily under our control.
<P>
	We are working to reduce interest rates. We have seen the 
Canadian dollar grow in value a bit lately and interest rates are 
going down. The economic policies of the government will 
produce the result we want and will create the jobs that are 
needed for our economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, some of 
those are short term goals that certainly do not fit a long term 
fiscal plan which must deal with the problems of Canada.
<P>
	The Prime Minister should recognize that since the 
government came into power, higher interest rates have 
hammered the housing industry. Resales for March were down 
42 per cent from a year ago. At the same time a rising inflation 
rate of some 2 per cent for the month of March is forcing the 
Bank of Canada to continue to keep interest rates relatively 
high.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that his government's 
weak fiscal policy is forcing the Bank of Canada into the 
impossible position of trying to support the dollar, contain 
inflation and bring down interest rates all at the same time?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the weekend the governor of the bank said that the 
policies of the government are on the right track and that the 
budget is the right one.

April 12, to cut the Canadian government's credit rating. 
Moody's decision is based on a hard look at the inadequate 
spending and deficit cutting measures, in the middle-term, 
which are contained in the budget.

cut announced by Moody's confirms the official opposition's

its fiscal policy in spite of the terrible state of public finances, 
preferring instead to transfer its deficit to the provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the very next day the value of the dollar increased on 
international markets, while interest rates decreased.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Does the Prime Minister realize that if the 
government's credit rating is cut in spite of the sustained 
economic recovery, it is because Moody's was not fooled by the 
wait-and-see policy of its government, which is content to rely 
on short-term economic recovery, which passes its deficit on to 
the provinces, and which lets the $550 billion debt grow by the 
minute, instead of tackling the real problems? This is the real 
situation.
<P>

report indicating that Canada's economic performance is one of 
the best in the world. Three weeks ago, when I was in

be loaned the money to cover the costs.
<P>
	How does the immigration minister intend to pay for the

department, which really does not impact the bottom line.
<P>
	The fact is that the landing fee is the best way of ensuring that 
settlement for immigrants and refugees continues. It is the best 
option of a series of alternatives that were certainly not as 
progressive.
<P>
	I would like to know on any given day where the Reform Party 
stands on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the truth be known, the collection services of this government 
are disastrous. It cannot even look after the sponsorship 
agreements.
<P>
	Only this minister could see the logic in expanding a 
bureaucracy to administer loans to finance a tax to offset 
runaway immigration costs when the money does not go into the 
immigration department at all.
<P>
	Why did this minister choose to expand the size and cost of his 
immigration empire and impose a new tax when he could have 
easily cut the number of immigrants who require settlement 
services and make those who need them pay their own way like 
other countries do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, now we get to the true 
Reform agenda, hiding behind some fictitious tax.
<P>
	It is not going to increase the so-called empire. If the member 
does his parliamentary homework, he will note that in the 
estimates there are no such increases that the member speaks of. 
We already collect a transportation loan from refugees.
<P>
	He talks about payback. Let me tell the hon. member that 
since 1951 refugees have paid back the transportation loans of 
$3,000, $4,000, $5,000 to the tune of 97 per cent. There is no 
increase in the bureaucracy.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the heritage minister. Recently, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11680"> 11680 </A></B>
<P>
the president of Power DirecTv issued an ultimatum to the 
government saying: ``If you do not take any action by April 24, 
we will have to cancel  our plans''. This means that the federal 
government intends to overturn a CRTC decision by order in 
council.
<P>
	Can the heritage minister tell us whether there is any 
justification for his government's eagerness to bulldoze the 
CRTC on the issue of satellite TV other than to please the 
government's friends who are legion at Power Corporation?
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as the member knows, it is a concern we also have 
regarding the information highway.
<P>
	On numerous occasions, we have stated that we favour a 
competitive system. It is not very clear whether Bloc members 
are for or against competition or for a transparent satellite 
broadcasting licensing system; however, it is clear that nearly 
all the comments on the report presented to the government on 
April 6 have been positive. Probably the most significant critics 
came from Power Corporation, which was not very happy with 
the report.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the heritage 
minister.
<P>
	How can the minister deny that there is now a possibility for 
Power DirecTv to do like Expressvu and broadcast via satellite? 
This is to abide by the CRTC's ruling.
<P>
	Why then prevent Expressvu from broadcasting and make it 
go through a different process just for the sake of pleasing Power 
DirecTv?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the hon. member, when she thinks about it, 
will realize that it is better to have a process in place such as that 
for licensing other concerns which is transparent, open to public 
discussion and debate, and open to appeal, rather than the 
indirect method of an exemption order that was applied by the 
CRTC in this case. One of the reasons we referred the matter to 
the panel of experts was in order for them to look at the question 
of what the process was and whether it was an adequate process.
<P>
	I think in the end the hon. member will agree that the 
application for licensing, if indeed we introduce the order 
proposed by the panel of experts, is one which will give an 
opportunity to everyone meeting certain qualifications which 
are very consistent with those that apply to cable television 
operators for example. It will provide funding for Canadian 
culture and other endeavours to be pursued by everyone 
interested in providing this kind of service.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	A month ago Bell Canada announced the elimination of 
approximately 10,000 jobs. Recently we were informed of 
financial difficulties at Unitel which could lead to more layoffs. 
In light of these developments, what is the government's 
position on competition in the Canadian telecommunications 
market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again I want to restate the commitment the 
government has in this sector broadly to competition as being 
the best means of ensuring that we have the lowest prices, the 
broadest possible choice, and the greatest range of innovation.
<P>
	This is a sector which perhaps of all sectors is one of the most 
globally competitive. It is one of the ones that is most important 
as a component to costs in Canadian business and therefore a 
competitive structure is one that commends itself to us.
<P>
	At the same time of course we share the concerns that I am 
sure the hon. member is representing in realizing that a lot of 
firms are going to go through adjustment periods and perhaps in 
many cases will be downsizing. I believe it is a temporary 
phenomenon. In time the number of jobs created in the 
information technology sector is going to far outweigh the 
number of jobs that are lost in the short term adjustment period.

deducting $100 from their welfare cheques despite the fact their 
sponsors have reneged on their signed guarantee of full support.
<P>
	Will the immigration minister be supporting the province of 
Ontario in its defence, especially in light of the $700 million 
that this abuse costs Canadian taxpayers?

<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

November we were very clear about the plan with respect to 
family sponsorships.

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11681"> 11681 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister has still not done what he said he would, to 
institute a system of bonds for sponsors to cover these costs. 
Since the province of Ontario has been able to identify those 
who are abusing the system will the minister now enforce the 
sponsorship contracts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the member who is 
misinformed. The action is certainly under way.
<P>
	We said very clearly we wanted to bring under control the 
roughly 14 per cent of family class sponsorships that do fail, 
keeping in mind the overwhelming majority of immigrants who 
come here on family sponsorships play by the rules.

<P>
	The Rwandan army has committed a real carnage on Saturday 
when it opened fire with automatic weapons and grenades at the 
Kibeho refugee camp. According to several sources, the army 
killed several thousand Hutu refugees.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Foreign Affairs tells us whether his

asking for an end to this kind of behaviour, in Kibeho and 
elsewhere?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Canadian government condemned in the most 
vigorous way the massacre just described by the hon. member. 
We immediately asked Ambassador Dusseault to go to the camp, 
inquire and report as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are 
the incidents which happened at the Kibeho refugee camp likely 
to lead the government to reconsider its help and support to the

rumours that circulate as to the diversion of Canadian help by 
Rwandan authorities?
<P>

</B>Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that this ruthless behaviour on the part 
of the army puts in jeopardy all the efforts made over the last few 
weeks to bring about reconciliation between the various groups 
and factions.
<P>
	Clearly, we will have to review our position at this time, 
because we thought that the good faith and the efforts of the

waiting impatiently for the report of Ambassador Dusseault and 
we will act according to the recommendations he will make. I

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
	I understand the minister of public works consulted with the 
Minister of Transport about transferring $26 million from the 
federal strategic highway improvement program allotted for the 
bypass at Wentworth Valley in Nova Scotia. It is well known as 
being one of the most dangerous stretches of road in the country.
<P>
	Where were the funds transferred? To the minister's own 
riding of Cape Breton, of course, for the construction of a tourist 
road. How can the minister justify such a blatant conflict of 
interest to Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the hon. member recognizes the allocation of 
funds for highway construction, even though in part it may come 
from the federal government, is a provincial responsibility.
<P>
	I want to assure my hon. colleague the negotiations with the 
province of Nova Scotia, as is the case with many other 
provinces across the country, are ongoing and there are 
reallocations which take place from time to time. However, 
whatever reallocations are made are always on the basis of those 
negotiations with the provinces, which are ultimately 
responsible for not only the spending of the money but also for 
the route selection.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fleur-de-lis trail, which the minister is sort of talking about, 
does not come under this funding program. The agreement was 
changed by the minister of public works and the Minister of 
Transport. The auditor general of Nova Scotia is saying they 
cannot justify the change that was made.
<P>
	How can the minister sacrifice the safety of Canadians for the 
tourist trade in Cape Breton?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is usual to answer a question asked by a member who 
knows better.
<P>
	The reallocation of funds under this agreement and any other 
agreement comes as a result of requests from provincial 
governments. It does not just occur in Nova Scotia; it occurs on a 
regular basis. The extent to which provinces exercise their 
jurisdiction for spending money on highways and determining 
where those highways should go is something the hon. member 
should know.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11682"> 11682 </A></B>

	Life insurance polices classify flying, racing, boating, 
snowmobiling and hot air ballooning as hazardous sports. Since 
hundreds of Canadians die or are injured every year in gun

ensure gun activities are classified also as hazardous sports by 
life insurance companies in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, such decisions are taken by the 
insurance companies. He should take it up with them. It would 
not be appropriate for the government to decide on 
classifications and appropriate risk assessments. That is a 
private sector decision which insurance companies make.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, during 
the March 27 meeting of federal Liberals from the Bourassa 
riding, which the Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs 
attended, the president of the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party, 
Denis Coderre, made some derogatory remarks regarding 
immigrants and refugees, to the effect that there should be a law 
providing for the deportation of sovereignist immigrants.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he tell us whether 
Mr. Coderre's remarks are indicative of the government's new 
policy on immigration, despite the fact that he himself declared 
yesterday that hatred, ethnic nationalism, religious fanaticism 
and racism would not be tolerated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question 
is surprising, since a member of the party to which he belongs, 
the Bloc Quebecois, has already suggested that immigrants in 
the Province of Quebec be denied the right to vote in the 
referendum. In light of this, it is quite singular that the hon. 
member raises the issue.
<P>
	Mr. Coderre qualified his statement after the fact and I 
consider the matter closed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> But, Mr. Speaker, 
apologies were in order.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. Does he 
intend to demand a public apology from not only Mr. Coderre 
but also his Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs, 
because he was there when Mr. Coderre made his remarks and he 
did not feel it was important, as a member of the government, to 
immediately dissociate himself from them?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, his words are being taken out of context. The Liberal 
Party has always been recognized as the pro-immigration party 
in Canada. In my speech last night to international

Canada's values, which include tolerance. This is one of the 
qualities that our party has prized for a very long time.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Transport Canada is undergoing the commercialization 
or privatization of many parts of its government transportation 
holdings. This includes air traffic control, air navigation 
equipment, airports and CN Rail. Also being considered are the 
Canadian ports, the St. Lawrence Seaway and possibly even 
parts of the coast guard.
<P>
	Given this high degree of planned privatization and the need 
for the public to understand and accept this process, does the 
Minister of Transport not agree the only way to ensure this is to 
order an open and transparent public inquiry into all aspects of 
the Pearson development contract process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a winding and torturous road to get to that 
question. I thank the hon. member for listing the objectives of 
Transport Canada.
<P>
	I do not want to comment on matters that are before the other 
place, but I understand there is some consideration being given 
to an inquiry there. I want to emphasize the importance the 
government attaches to getting to work at Pearson, developing 
the premier airport in Canada.
<P>
	There can be all kinds of reasons in the minds of some to delay 
the work that has to be done at Pearson. As far as we are 
concerned the time has long past since we should have begun the 
work of putting thousands of people into the construction

project at Pearson International Airport, making it the kind of 
crown jewel of our air system it should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have never questioned the right of the government to 
cancel the Pearson contract. With that right goes an obligation to 
the Canadian taxpayer to show the need for the action, the cost 
of the action and where the government will get the money for an 
alternative.
<P>
	Using the government's own figures, cancellation will cost a 
minimum of $500 million if the rule of law is followed and the 
crown construction option will cost another billion.
<P>
	Where will the government get this $1.5 billion not in the 
Liberal's latest budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has come directly to the point with his 
supplementary question.
<P>
	There is no question that if we continue the process that some 
are on at this point, as the hon. member says, it could cost 
Canadian taxpayers $500 million without a nail being driven or 
an inch of asphalt being laid.
<P>
	The point is the Government of Canada has made known its 
position. We are prepared to pay up to $30 million for 
reasonable out of pocket expenses to compensate those people 
who were involved in the process, many of them third party not 
directly involved in the process that led to the granting of that 
final contract.

<P>
	Today the book by Ben Wicks, ``Born to Read'', was launched 
on Parliament Hill, reminding us all of how important and how 
serious the problem of illiteracy is Canada. However, it is not 
evident by the actions of the government that it takes this 
seriously.
<P>
	There are some seven million people in Canada who have 
difficulty or extreme difficulty reading. Because national 
literacy groups are still on year to year funding and not core 
funding it is very difficulty to plan.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister comment on this important day and 
commit to allowing literacy groups to have long term funding, 
not on a year to year basis to solve this problem?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, education is more a problem for provincial 
governments but we have national programs to help.
<P>
	There was a specific problem coming from the federal 
government for that program which is financed on a yearly 
basis. Everybody knows the government is facing some difficult 
budgetary problems. I will look into the matter and see what can 
be done.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am

	<B>Mrs. Shirley Maheu (Saint-Laurent-Cartierville, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of presenting a petition from 
several residents in Quebec and more particularly the group 
Affordable Textbooks Now.
<P>
	As the result of the increasing cost of textbooks which are 
needed for student studies, many people are forced to effectively 
break the law because they are photocopying in part or in whole 
many of the textbooks for which they are not in a position to pay.
<P>
	Therefore they request that Parliament put an end to the GST 
on textbooks and take into account the high price of textbooks 
when allotting money for educational funding.

[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 133-<B>Mr. Simmons:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the search and rescue program, what action will the government take 
in response to the Auditor General's 1994 findings about the ``lack of action on many </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11686"> 11686 </A></B>

and rescue service standards-are lacking'', (<I>c</I>) ``expanded use of volunteer and other 
resources should be pursued'' and (<I>d</I>) ``greater use of other federal resources for search 
and rescue is possible''?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I 
am informed by the Departments of National Defence and 
Transport as follows:
<P>
	(a) Relating to the federal government's area of 
responsibility, the system for directing the operation of SAR 
activities and resources is well established. There has also been 
good progress in developing principles and plans for managing 
the federal portion of the national SAR program. With reference 
to provincial and territorial governmental involvement in the 
national SAR program, progress has naturally been slower as the 
provinces and territories assess the value of their involvement in 
the co-operative program such as SAR. The federal government 
will continue to display leadership in this area.
<P>
	(b) Since the original recommendation of the Auditor General 
(AG) in 1992, the Department of National Defence (DND) and 
Transport Canada have consistently maintained that they 
disagree with the AG recommendation for time-based SAR 
service standards. Both departments have developed suitable 
service standards and they do not judge that time-based service 
standards provide an accurate or effective indicator of program 
performance.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard responds to 6,000 to 8,000 search 
and rescue incidents, of all types, per year. The existing system 
includes coast guard, other government vessels, the Canadian 
Marine Rescue Auxiliary, and vessels of opportunity.
<P>
	The present levels of service indicate that, on average, 90 per 
cent of lives at risk in marine distress incidents are saved by all 
responders, private and government. Thus, the Canadian search 
and rescue system compares favourably with systems of other 
countries.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard has published many standards for 
search and rescue. These standards pertain to operations, 
co-ordination and planning and performance. The standards 
apply to the rescue co-ordination centres and sub-centres, 
primary and secondary vessels, the Canadian Marine Rescue 
Auxiliary, and other components of the coast guard search and 
rescue system.
<P>
	The Canadian Coast Guard has established levels of service 
(LOS) for search and rescue which focus on quality and extent of 
service and the effectiveness of response, based on the actual 
probability for effecting a rescue. On the basis of these LOS 
criteria, it should be noted that the comparable results between 
the whole Canadian marine search and rescue system and that of 
the United States for the period 1986 to 1990 are 90.5 per cent 
versus 80.3 per cent.
<P>
	The departments involved in search and rescue are currently 
enhancing and integrating their information systems in order to 
improve performance reporting and analysis. Until recently they 
lacked an automated information system to provide timely data 
on the performance of federal search and rescue resources. In 
addition, further sophistication of analysis as to severity of the 
incident and the type of assistance provided continues to be 
required for decisions on levels of service, acquisition and 
management of resources.
<P>
	A new computer information system called SISAR is 
currently in use by the Canadian Coast Guard and the 
Department of National Defence. This new system, which 
captures accurate and consistent data on search and rescue 
incidents, establishes an information base which will provide 
essential information for consideration in the decision-making 
process concerning the search and rescue program.
<P>
	(c) In 1978, the Canadian Coast Guard established the 
Canadian Marine Rescue Auxiliary (CMRA), an all volunteer 
force. It started with four members in Nova Scotia; by last year 
it has expanded to five separate associations in all areas of 
Canada with some 3,300 members and 1,200 vessels. Last year, 
these volunteers responded to some 1,800 search and rescue 
incidents-about 25 per cent of the total. The Canadian Coast 
Guard is continuing to support and expand the capability of this 
effective group of volunteers.
<P>
	In 1992, the Canadian Coast Guard's Laurentian regional 
office was given a mandate to develop an approach to promote 
the co-operation of local resources to provide search and rescue 
services on inland waters, advise local resources and ensure 
technology transfer for search and rescue training, equipment 
and expertise. The Laurentian regional office set up a successful 
pilot project in the Lac St. Jean, Quebec area which is being used 
as a model for other coast guard offices across the country.
<P>
	The federal government of Canada places a high value on the 
contribution of volunteer SAR organizations such as the Civil 
Air Search and Rescue Association (CASARA) and the 
Canadian Marine Rescue Auxiliary (CMRA). In the face of 
increasing fiscal restraint, the participation of volunteers in the 
national SAR program becomes increasingly important. To 
illustrate, the government provides $800,000 per year and the 
services of 12 Canadian forces training and support personnel to 
assist in training CASARA volunteers. Specialized SAR 
equipment is also provided for installation on CASARA aircraft. 
The federal government search and rescue officials will 
continue to pursue every opportunity to use volunteers in search 
and rescue activities.
<P>
	(d) The interdepartmental committee on search and rescue 
(ICSAR) was formed to co-ordinate federal involvement in 
search and rescue activities. Currently, the federal government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11687"> 11687 </A></B>
<P>
actively pursues a policy of interdepartmental co-operation to 
enable utilization of  federal resources for search and rescue and 
to provide a cost effective SAR service.
<P>
	The search and rescue system maintains an inventory of all 
available federal resources in each search and rescue region. By 
law, all vessels have to respond to distress situations. The 
Canadian Coast Guard has primary search and rescue vessels 
and by policy, all other coast guard vessels are now assigned 
multi-tasking duties to cover primary search and rescue and 
other program duties in certain search and rescue areas. Further, 
some federal resources such as the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, the Department of National Defence and the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police vessels carry out search and rescue 
operations as tasked by rescue co-ordination centres.

	(c) It is estimated that this relocation will result in savings of 
$1.4 million to 1.7 million per year for 10 years, based on an 
estimated net reduction of some 7,050 square metres at a market 
range of between $200-$250 per square metre.
<P>
	The tender for this requirement closed on January 26, 1995.

	Public Works and Government Services' analysis concluded 
that none of the six bids submitted met the technical 
requirements set out in the lease tender call. The financial

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FARMIMPROVEMENTANDMARKETINGCOOPERATIVESLOANSACT">FARM IMPROVEMENT AND MARKETING 
COOPERATIVES LOANS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion. That Bill 
C-75, an act to amend the Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Co-operatives Loans Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to pick things up exactly where we left off 
approximately 67 minutes ago. We were replying to the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture on Bill 
C-75 which will raise from 1.5 billion to 3 billion dollars the 
maximum amount of government guaranteed farm loans.
<P>
	As I had to split my speech in two, I should perhaps remind 
members that the bill before us seeks to amend the Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act. I will 
now continue reading my text exactly where I left off at two 
o'clock, about 67 minutes ago.
<P>
	Let us say, for example, that the Quebec Société du 
financement agricole keeps a very close watch on the rate of 
increase of farmers' indebtedness and that, in so doing, it 
modifies its standards and criteria. It would never have the 
necessary leeway to implement its decisions because a federal 
agency would once again meddle in its affairs and muddle up the 
initial goal of the Quebec government. The federal 
government's eligibility criteria do not necessarily reflect 
provincial priorities.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Federal agencies compete with provincial agencies, which 
may have stricter criteria, and I must say that the provinces are 
in a better position to know the real needs of their citizens. In 
any case, they are certainly in a better position than the federal 
government, which has to enact general policies that must be 
realistic and applicable from coast to coast.
<P>
	The thing that we must remember is that, once again, instead 
of eliminating overlapping and giving the provinces their own 
tools, the Liberal government has decided to keep everything 
under its control. By maintaining this overlapping, the federal 
government gives itself the opportunity to intervene in the 
management of our agricultural sector in Quebec.
<P>
	It should also be emphasized that it is very strange that this act 
is administered by the department instead of the Farm Credit 
Corporation. Even if the programs are different, the Farm Credit 
Corporation already arranges loan guarantees. That is a striking 
example of administrative duplication. This is not duplication 
between government levels but in fact duplication within the 
same government.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, wish that the government would 
give to the provinces the financial resources that belong to them. 
As the Prime Minister said earlier in answer to a question from 
the Leader of the Opposition, Quebec is not begging but merely 
asking for what it is entitled to.
<P>
	Provinces will thus be able to take over the administration of 
programs like the one Bill C-75 deals with. It must be clearly 
understood that we are not against the bill as such but we firmly 
oppose the overlap and duplication it perpetuates, whether in the 
same government, that is the federal government, or between the 
federal government and provinces. We believe the bill is 
relevant but we regret that it maintains duplication.
<P>
	I would now like to submit some statistics found by our 
researchers about FIMCLA or Bill C-75. First I wish to remind 
the House that since February 1988 when the above amendments 
came into force, over 65 000 loans totalling some $1.5 billion 
have been granted under the act.
<P>
	I should also remind you that the province which benefits the 
most from the act is Saskatchewan, followed in second place by 
Alberta and third by Quebec. I believe Ontario comes in fourth 
place in terms of utilisation of the act but I must remind you the 
rural Ontario enjoys a high standard in terms of agriculture and 
investment needs. To this day, some 10 loans have been granted 
under the act for co-operative projets with a total added value of 
$14.2 billion.
<P>
	In 1994-95 for example, 17,000 loans totalling some $475 
million have been granted under the act. Again in 1994-1995, 
the average loan is $27,000 and the five-year average is 
$22,000.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	In the last 25 years, net losses incurred under the act have 
accounted for 1 per cent of all guaranteed loans each and every 
year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11689"> 11689 </A></B>
<P>
	I would now like to talk to you about interest rates. I think that 
interest rates are reasonable and favourable to farmers. The 
maximum interest rate that lenders can set is the prime rate plus 
1 per cent in the case of variable rates. Or, if you prefer, the 
variable rate is equal to the prime rate plus 1 per cent, so it 
changes like the tide. If interest rates go up, the interest rate paid 
by farmers on loans guaranteed under this act will go up as well. 
Conversely, if interest rates go down, the interest rate paid by 
farmers will also go down.
<P>
	However, if the farmer wants a fixed rate for five years, the 
rate will be the prime rate at the time he negotiates his loan plus 
2.25 per cent. But it must not go beyond a fixed five year period. 
According to the statistics I am quoting to you, in 1991, some 
683 rural lenders such as caisses populaires and credit unions 
were accredited as lenders under this act.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, caisses populaires were treated 
inequitably in the past, because the caisse populaire network 
plays an extremely important role in Quebec. Often, it was less 
profitable for the large banks to do business in rural areas, so 
they withdrew to the major centres. They left rural communities 
to the caisses populaires, making it difficult for our farmers to 
borrow money since the caisses populaires were not even 
accredited.
<P>
	How could the central government, with its so-called respect 
for institutions, have the nerve not to accredit the caisses 
populaires? Only large banks had this privilege, because, as we 
know full well, the caisses populaires never make financial 
contributions to political parties, be it the Bloc Quebecois or any 
other political party.
<P>
	You see, since they were not major contributors to election 
funds, they were simply relegated to that kind of loan. It is a 
disgrace. Fortunately, staunch nationalists such as the Parti 
Quebecois members, whose courage I must salute, pressed and 
reasoned the the federal government into recognizing credit 
unions as lenders for the purpose of this loan guarantee.
<P>
	While accounting for 25 per cent of the total Canadian 
population, Quebec is only the third largest user of loans 
guaranteed by the federal government at seemingly interesting 
interest rates under this act. Why do Quebec farmers not use this 
window? Because it is not well known at all. So, with your 
permission, I will try to describe it as briefly and simply as 
possible.
<P>
	First of all, I must tell you that this act does not apply to 
anyone who wants to start a farm business. If you want to buy a 
farm with a view to eventually becoming an independent farmer, 
this act is not for you; you have to go either to the Farm Credit 
Corporation, which is a federal institution, or to the Société du 
financement agricole, which is a Quebec institution.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The bill before us this afternoon is for farmers who wish to 
make improvements, expand their facilities, buy out a 
neighbour, those who want to build extensions, for example an 
addition to a hog house, build a road across their farm to get to 
the wood at the other end of the property, install an electric 
generator in a hog house or refinance and consolidate all their 
debts in a single loan. That is what this kind of loan is for. It 
could also be used to buy cattle, install a new grain silo or buy 
the neighbour's silo to move it to your land. As you know, the 
cost of building a manure pit or buying tractors, rotary mowers 
or combine-harvesters is always on the rise.
<P>
	Of course, the government is not guaranteeing loans of less 
than $2,000. As you know, in 1995, we cannot afford to create 
paperwork costing more than the benefit provided. There is also 
an upper limit. For farmers, the maximum is $250,000, while in 
the case of agricultural co-operatives, it is $3 million.
<P>
	Some purchases are not eligible, such as short term goods. 
Under Bill C-75, piglets weighing 35 or 45 pounds would not be 
eligible because such a purchase is for a short term of about five 
or six months. Consequently, it would not be eligible. The same 
is true in the case of repairs to the family home on the farm. Such 
an expense would not be eligible. Nor would the purchase of 
quotas. A dairy producer interested in buying a quota to generate 
a more substantial income would not qualify.
<P>
	So, under that bill, a farmer can borrow up to $250,000 and an 
agricultural co-operative up to $3 million. The loan guarantee 
must cover the maximum of 80 per cent of the loan. We cannot 
guarantee more than 80 per cent of the assets bought. In the case 
of a farm expansion, the maximum period provided to repay the 
loan is 15 years, while it is 10 years for any other product or 
good. It goes without saying that, if the product bought will only 
last four years, the maximum period provided to repay the loan 
will not be 10 years but four.
<P>
	Let us now look at payments. Payments could be made on a 
monthly basis, but at least one payment would have to be made 
each year. If someone says: ``I only want to pay every two 
years'', that would not be possible under this bill, since a 
minimal payment is required every year.
<P>
	I have already addressed the issue of interest rates, so I will 
recap briefly. If you talk about the variable interest rate, the 
floating rate, that is the prime rate plus 1 per cent. If you choose 
the fixed rate, that is a lot more costly. A fixed rate is only good 
for 5 years and is equal to the prime rate plus 2.25 per cent.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to take a minute or so to talk about the 
registration fee and the administration charge.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11690"> 11690 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Farmers who ask for a loan under the Farm Improvement and 
Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act must make a payment of 
one-half of 1 per cent, or 0.5 per cent of the total amount of the 
loan. This money is paid to the Receiver General for Canada so 
that the loan guarantee can be examined. Over and above this 0.5 
per cent, the lender can also add $250 or one-quarter of 1 per 
cent of the amount, whichever is less, as long as it does not 
exceed $250,000.
<P>
	As was said earlier, this also applies to co-operative 
agricultural societies, and there are quite a few of these in 
Quebec. The Co-operative Society of Disraëli, a town located 
not far from my area, contracted a loan a few years back when it 
built silos in order to produce feed. This loan was guaranteed by 
the federal government.
<P>
	A co-operative agriculture society can therefore get up to 
almost $3 million at the same interest rate as the one mentioned 
earlier for farmers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-75. But again, I want 
to make it clear that we support this legislation so that our 
farmers can receive the financial resources they need to expand 
and so that they can get from the federal government the 
guarantees to which they are entitled, since they pay taxes just 
like any other worker in Canada and particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	But, as I said a few moments ago, we do have some objections 
concerning duplication and overlap.
<P>
	During the four days of recess in the week after Easter, I 
visited several farmers who are friends and colleagues of mine. I 
told them that I was going to speak on this bill today. A very big 
majority of farmers, although not all of them, said to me that 
they were not familiar with this act. This is certainly why 
Quebec is only the third most important user of the services 
provided under this act among the ten Canadian provinces, even 
if Quebec farmers alone account for more than 17 percent of 
farm production in this country.
<P>
	Saskatchewan, a province with a small population base, ranks 
first because the program was well advertised in that province. 
Mr. Fernand Fillion, a hog producer in Lyster, told me that, 
before building his new hog house, an investment of well over 
$1 million, he examined the services provided by the Société de 
crédit agricole du Québec, the Société de financement agricole 
in Quebec and under this act. He realized that the loan provided 
by the Société de financement agricole du Québec was the most 
profitable option in his case.
<P>
	Farmers have three options: they can borrow money through 
the Société de financement agricole, the Société de crédit 
agricole du Québec, or under the Farm Improvement and 
Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act. Why not save money 
through the single window approach? Farmers would not have to 
knock at three different doors, and travel to as many as three 
cities to meet with civil servants who cost the government a lot 
of  money. It is always the same taxpayer who pays for this kind 
of inefficiency and duplication.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	When we, members of the Bloc Quebecois, visit people in our 
rural areas, our concessions, our municipalities, our small 
towns, and tell them about all this duplication, they understand 
easily and quickly why we have a $40 to $45 billion deficit every 
year.
<P>
	We could easily save millions. I have a perfect case of 
duplication within the government. Just last week, a farmer was 
telling me: ``We would like to deal exclusively with the Quebec 
Minister of Agriculture because he is the one that we know. We 
do not even know who the federal Minister of Agriculture is and, 
when he comes to see us, he has great difficulty talking to us in 
our own language''. It is not a bad thing, of course, but it must be 
understood that Quebecers are a lot closer to their provincial 
government than to the federal government.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture is constantly telling us that his 
ultimate goal is to help farmers. If he really wants to help 
farmers, why not make things easier for them by having a single 
window and using the money that the government will save this 
way to lower interest rates? It would not cost a penny more and 
farmers would be a lot happier.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to invite the Minister of Agriculture to 
take a week off and to come and visit with farmers in rural 
Quebec. Among the 17 or 18 Liberal members who represent 
Quebec in this government, there are certainly a few who come 
from rural ridings. I am sure they are not all city members from 
the West Island. There must be a few among them who have seen 
a cow up close and who have been in a hog house. Let them come 
and visit. There is the Prime Minister, whom I know very well 
and who represents the beautiful riding of Saint-Maurice. There 
are fine farms in his riding. I invite, for example, the Minister of 
Agriculture to visit the riding of Saint-Maurice and to ask 
farmers what they want. In Saint-Maurice, which is different 
from the riding of Frontenac, there must be some federalists, 
since they elected the Prime Minister. So, that is where the 
minister should go.
<P>
	I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, farmers know that they are 
being had by this government. Monday morning, I met a farmer 
who told me-because he had watched the debates of the 
opposition day concerning cuts in agriculture, being himself an 
industrial milk producer-that he thought he would lose 
approximately $4,000. And it is the last thousand dollars that is 
profitable, not the first.
<P>
	You know, Mr. Speaker, in a cow barn, it is not the first cow 
that is milked in the morning that is profitable, but always the 
last. Indeed, the last one is all profit. With this 30 per cent cut in 
the industrial milk subsidy, the government is taking away from 
the farmer this last cow  which brought him his $4,000 at the end 
of the fiscal year.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11691"> 11691 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	He did not need to convince me, of course, but the dairy 
producer's concern was that in August the price of dairy 
products would be increased. By increasing the price of dairy 
products, and this is a proven fact, we will diminish 
consumption, which, in turn, will entail a reduction of the quota. 
So, I get the picture, Mr. Speaker. I am explaining these things to 
you and I am sure you understood them before I started speaking 
about them. And you may share my point of view that we should 
try to work not for us, but for our farmers, once and for all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I listened to the debate I asked myself why we are 
here, why we have heard, as we have so often in the past, of 
amendments to particular bills or new legislation being 
introduced.
<P>
	I would criticize the government for dodging what I think is 
the big issue. If I talk about the farm improvement loans act, I 
will not be specifically critical. By and large it has been a good 
program, as has been mentioned today. Especially in my 
province of Saskatchewan it has been very well received and 
very well used. The parliamentary secretary to the minister is 
absolutely correct. The default rate is not very high when one 
considers the amount of money lent through that program.
<P>
	As I said before, perhaps the big picture or the issue is being 
dodged or avoided to some extent. I refer to what my colleague 
from the Bloc had to say. For obvious reasons the member from 
the Bloc has different plans, different hopes and aspirations for 
his province than I do for mine. I find myself agreeing very 
much with what he said today when he talked about the 
duplication and the overlap of these types of programs.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan if farmers wanted to borrow money with 
some sort of government assistance or help they could look at 
this current program, the farm improvement loans act, small 
business loans, the Farm Credit Corporation or, only in 
Saskatchewan, the Agriculture Credit Corporation of 
Saskatchewan. A farmer has his or her option of four different 
areas or wickets, as my friend from the Bloc said, from which to 
borrow this money. I ask myself why. I see no reason for four 
different bureaucracies to get the same end result.
<P>
	If I look back on the motion I put forward which is before the 
House now, one of the basic pillars my motion is built on is to 
reduce duplication and overlap and to bring the services that 
cannot be privatized into the lowest or the most local department 
for delivery of programs or services.
<P>
	I do not think anybody would deny farmers need access to 
capital for the financing of their endeavours just as any other 
business does. Because of the unique characteristics of 
agriculture with its exposure to unique risks, the private 
financial services industry has at times been reluctant to provide 
the services farmers and agri-food businesses need. The unique 
risks the farming industry faces are related to being very much 
at the mercy of mother nature and the fact that for the most part 
we produce perishable goods that must be moved quickly to 
market and sold.
<P>
	In our integrated global trading environment where food and 
non-food products are shipped across our borders, our oceans, 
our skies and our land, a natural disaster such as a drought, a 
flood or a hailstorm in one part of the world could create 
shortages that farmers somewhere else must fill.
<P>
	The international agricultural marketplace can thus be very 
volatile and is affected from year to year by price hikes and price 
drops, by supply gluts and supply shortages. These unique facts 
of life that farmers face create unique financial needs that some 
financial services provider must fill.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Our discussion about farm financing should centre around 
asking the simple question: How can our society and our world 
best serve the financial needs of the agriculture industry and 
thus ensure that we have a safe, stable, affordable, and abundant 
food supply?
<P>
	Generally, farmers and agri-businesses have proven over the 
years to be good borrowers to meet the terms and conditions of 
their loans on time and in full. As the parliamentary secretary 
has mentioned, that is the case in this program.
<P>
	There have been years in which an onslaught of unfortunate 
disasters has occurred that has stretched farmers' income and 
expenditure balance sheets to the very limit. At times like these, 
provincial and federal governments have stepped in with 
emergency aid because the public's interest for a stable food 
supply has been put at risk.
<P>
	I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, after spending my entire life in the 
farming industry, that no farmer wants government handouts. 
No farmer wants government to be his full time partner in 
business. We have said over and over again in this House that 
farmers, just like other business entrepreneurs, want 
governments off their backs and out of their pockets. We want 
lower taxes and input costs. We want a streamlined and efficient 
regulatory process. We want governments to negotiate good 
trade deals and to open up access to marketplaces so that we can 
develop to our full potential as world competitors.
<P>
	What concerns me about legislation such as Bill C-75 is that 
government is stepping in and taking a role that the private 
financial services industry could and perhaps should provide. 
As long as this government or any government continues to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11692"> 11692 </A></B>
<P>
participate in this kind of  financial activity, I do not believe that 
the private sector will ever become motivated enough or 
competitive enough to provide the financial services the 
agriculture sector needs. Why should it?
<P>
	It also strikes me as ironic that the private sector would 
actually have the level of confidence in the federal government 
as its guarantor that it appears to have. I know the federal 
government will certainly have about $120 billion worth of tax 
revenue this year and that the $3 billion in loan guarantees that 
this act provides for is probably sound, even if it were all to be 
defaulted upon, which of course it will not be. This type of 
financial arrangement does raise the ironic question of how an 
organization that is $550 billion in debt and that will pay almost 
$50 billion this year in interest payments can be counted upon as 
a guarantor of anything.
<P>
	It is the government that is in debt trouble and in need of a bail 
out, not the the farmers or the lenders. We might have the cart 
before the horse in this case.
<P>
	Therefore I would assert that it is time to ask the question 
about what the proper approach to financial services for the 
agriculture sector is. Should government be increasing loan 
guarantee programs at this time? How can it really be a 
guarantor of premium quality when its own finances are in such 
bad shape? Should not the government rather be encouraging the 
private financial services industry to serve the agriculture 
industry?
<P>
	I believe there would be financial companies that would move 
into this service market, competition would be introduced, and 
farmers would therefore get good service. The government 
should clearly indicate to the private sector what it sees as its 
limits of involvement and then develop policy in that direction.
<P>
	There is no free lunch. As individuals, farmers, business 
people or whoever we are, we will all pay for the goods or 
services that we need. If we get what we need from the private 
sector we will pay in dollars. If we get it from the public sector 
we will pay in tax dollars. Mr. Speaker, it is a crying shame that 
my children and yours are going to have to pay back the $550 
billion debt that we now owe for services that we enjoyed. Debt 
is nothing other than deferred taxes and the intergenerational 
transfer of financial obligation.
<P>
	I ask you, Mr. Speaker, before this problem gets worse, might 
this Parliament not be the one that recognizes the importance of 
a clear and better division of responsibilities between the 
private and the public sectors, between paying by taxes or by 
dollars. Surely, we should not simply approve this bill or any 
other like it before asking how much it will cost, how are we 
going to pay, and is there a better way to do this. If generational 
stewardship and self-responsibility mean anything, surely we 
must ask these questions and seek the best answers.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Government must no longer be allowed to continue to grind 
along day after day, year after year, program after program as a 
self-contained and self-propagating industry, completely 
insulated from and oblivious to the long-term consequences of 
its actions. We either repair and fix our economic house now or 
our children are going to have to fix it-or it is going to have to 
be fixed for us by outside sources.
<P>
	At committee stage of Bill C-75, my Reform colleagues and I 
want to talk about these matters. We believe that there may be 
some amendments to this bill that would be in order. We will 
listen to what other members have to say, what the officials have 
to say. But rest assured that we will press forward and onward as 
Reformers in the last decade of this century and this millennium 
to ensure that our children are not saddled with the catastrophic 
results of irresponsible actions that we the parents take.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that the criticism of this 
amendment to Bill C-75 is not one that would see this act 
replaced. It is an act that could simply be consolidated, as I 
mentioned before, with the Small Businesses Loans Act, 
perhaps put under the auspices of the Farm Credit Corporation, 
if that is the most efficient and most effective way to do it, and 
get rid of the huge bureaucracies, as my colleague from the Bloc 
mentioned.
<P>
	There are three federal bureaucracies in Saskatchewan. I 
firmly believe that at least one and most likely two of those 
could be eliminated. All those types of lending guarantees that 
the federal government produces for the farm industry should be 
carefully examined. The big picture of this issue must be looked 
at, not simply a band-aid measure to make an amendment.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is correct in saying that if we do 
not make this amendment the program will have to be delayed 
for two years. However, we can do better than that simply by 
opening up what we believe and perceive to be a strangulation of 
the system by effectively not being prepared to look at 
consolidation and removal of duplication.
<P>
	As I mentioned, my colleagues and I will be preparing 
amendments for committee stage of this bill. We would ask that 
the government and the official opposition would support and 
work with us on any amendments that would make our system 
more cost-efficient and effective.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me start by saying that the level of interest in the 
agricultural community is very high with regard to this 
particular aspect of financing.
<P>
	The access to capital is probably paramount to achieving 
long-term success in agriculture, as it may apply to farm 
improvements, processing, distribution and marketing of farm 
products. The program has proven very popular with farmers. 
The five-year, $1.5 billion cap has almost been reached. 
Consequently, we have two choices: increase the aggregate load 
limit 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11693"> 11693 </A></B>
<P>
or suspend the  program. I would like to examine those two 
options in greater detail today.
<P>
	The first option is to increase the aggregate amount of loans 
that can be made under the FIMCLA program from $1.5 billion 
to $3 billion. In considering this option, one might ask how risky 
this program is and how many loans go into default. The record 
is really very good. The net claims rate-that is, the gross minus 
recoveries-is about 1 per cent, and has remained at that level 
fairly consistently over the last 25 years. There have been some 
blips. There have been occasions when it has risen as high as 1.5 
per cent. On that occasion in the 1980s, it was caused by high 
interest rates, low farm income, and land devaluation.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Since 1992 there has been a significant reduction in claims 
and the program now has a positive cash flow. This is expected 
to continue at least through 1997. There will be some extra costs 
associated with the higher aggregate limit, but measures will be 
taken to offset this. For example, an increase of only 0.25 per 
cent in the registration fee would be sufficient to offset these 
extra costs and maintain the current level of liability for at least 
another five years. For the average loan of $27,000, this would 
amount to an increase in costs of $67.
<P>
	The number of loans and any losses will continue to be 
monitored on an ongoing basis if the net claim rate is higher than 
anticipated. Program costs could be controlled. For example, 
the guaranteed level could be lowered from 95 per cent and loan 
eligibility could be limited or registration fees further 
increased. In other words, the aggregate limit can be increased 
at little or no cost to government, and should satisfy program 
demands for another 10 years. It is a positive measure that is 
supported by the agri-food sector and commercial lenders.
<P>
	The second option is maintaining the status quo, keeping the 
current aggregate limit to $1.5 billion and suspending the 
program once the limit is reached.
<P>
	In the first nine months of 1994-95, $422 million in loans 
were guaranteed under the act, bringing the five-year aggregate 
loan limit to $1.24 billion. If the current trend continues, the 
present $1.5 billion cap could be reached as early as June, at 
which time the program will have to be suspended. Since annual 
loan registrations are expected to continue in the $500 million 
range and the loans falling due are worth $80 million this year, 
$115 million next year, and $196 million the year after, the 
program would likely have to be suspended for about two more 
years.
<P>
	Since no new revenue would be generated from registering 
fees during this period, the program's contingent liability will 
be no different from the first option; that is, increasing the 
aggregate limit to $3 billion, along with an increase in the 
registration fee of 0.25 per cent. Should the status quo be 
allowed to  continue, long term program liabilities will likely be 
kept at today's estimate of $16 billion.
<P>
	FIMCLA is supported by farmers and their organizations, 
especially the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, as well as the 
lenders. I believe it would be a mistake to allow it to be 
suspended. The program has been an inexpensive way for the 
government to support the agri-food sector. The net loss rate 
over 25 years has only been about 1 per cent. Increasing the 
FIMCLA cap allows for this low cost support to continue.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask the House to support Bill C-75 by 
increasing the aggregate principal amount of loans that can be 
guaranteed. The program can continue to be offered to farmers 
and farmer owned marketing cooperatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure today to address this very 
important bill, Bill C-75, an act to amend the Farm 
Improvement Marketing Co-operatives Loan Act. This act 
facilitates credit on farm improvements for processing and 
distribution and marketing of farm products. I am sure we can 
all agree the bill is very important to the agricultural sector.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The program has been quite a success, giving many farms and 
marketing co-operatives a hand in improving or starting new 
operations. In the year 1994-95, FIMCLA, as the program is 
called, was used to facilitate more than 17,000 loans totalling 
some $475 million. The average loan size in 1994-95 was 
$27,000 and the five-year average is $22,000.
<P>
	It has been very advantageous to the agricultural group in 
Souris-Moose Mountain. My riding is concerned about the 
impact of recent GATT agreements and the World Trade 
Organization on the day to day lives and operations of our 
farmers.
<P>
	It is very important to take a look at some of the restrictions 
farmers in our area may face now that we have to make our grain 
forwarding and other export practices acceptable to world 
markets. To improve our opportunities we have to turn to value 
added products.
<P>
	I will tell the House about a group of people in my riding who 
have embraced this idea. A group of six farm families in 
Souris-Moose Mountain have formed a co-operative to begin a 
joint venture with a Holland firm to establish a nucleus hog 
breeding farm in Saskatchewan. It will be the first entry of 
continental European hogs into Canada in 37 years.
<P>
	With the assistance of the loan through FIMCLA the 
co-operative farm has been formed. The joint venture is 
positioned to address the new opportunities brought about by the 
World Trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11694"> 11694 </A></B>
<P>
Organization. The venture pioneers the process of the 
co-operative approach to improving the hog industry in 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Farm members will be provided with superior animals that 
will increase the productive capacity of their existing operations 
and improve the profitability of their hog operations. The 
co-operative will be the first to introduce the Dalland hog to 
North America. As well it will be the first artificial insemination 
facility for hog semen in western Canada.
<P>
	The co-operative will create spinoff employment and 
stabilize the incomes of farm members. Those in the Kipling 
area appreciated the opportunity to become partners with the 
agricultural sector in making sure the program moved forward.
<P>
	For example, the distribution of semen and the marketing of 
breeding animals require transportation. The needs of 
transportation will enhance the use of one farm member's 
existing trucking equipment, creating additional returns for 
him. The co-operative will require production, management and 
clerical personnel that will be supplied by farm families to 
enhance their farm incomes and to improve individual farm 
returns.
<P>
	The co-operative will be more than a primary producer of 
farm products. As a group they will market a product of high 
value to the benefit of their members. Their natural geographic 
advantage and lower cost of production make their product 
competitive in the North American market. This venture 
pioneers an innovative process of efficiently distributing new 
genetics to the North American hog industry and is very 
important to my riding.
<P>
	None of this would have been possible if FIMCLA had not 
been there to guarantee the loans to meet their needs and to meet 
their new ideas, the new and better ways of doing things. With 
due diligence and proper assessment techniques, FIMCLA 
guarantees do not have to carry a high amount of risk. The past 
record shows that. Over the last 25 years net losses under the act 
have approximated 1 per cent of total loans guaranteed. In the 
terrible years during the 1980s when interest rates were high, 
low farm income and land devaluation caused more defaults 
than usual. The program is an excellent one. This is why the 
current legislation is required. It is a safe and inexpensive way 
for the government to help farmers help themselves in changing 
times.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	As I drive around my riding talking with people I realize these 
sincere, bright, hard working individuals have hundreds of good 
ideas. Given a start, they could go far on their own. We need only 
to open the door for them.
<P>
	Furthermore, the amendment includes measures to offset the 
natural extra expenses that would come with an increase in the 
cap. The amount of offsetting needed is small. For example, an 
increase of only one-quarter of 1 per cent in the registration fee 
would sufficiently offset the extra costs and maintain the current 
level of liability for at least five years. For an average loan of 
$27,000 it would be $64.
<P>
	By not proceeding with the suggested amendment, lenders 
would have to stop and discontinue programs once the cap 
reached $1.5 billion. It would be irresponsible. Can we imagine 
saying no to the co-operatives in Saskatchewan I just 
mentioned? Can we imagine telling them that we understand the 
project will stabilize income, create employment and enhance 
Canada's exports but that some arbitrary cap says they cannot 
continue?
<P>
	That we must increase the cap is positive. It means the 
program is doing well. More people are finding out about its 
successes and are deciding to use it. It makes possible what once 
seemed impossible for them.
<P>
	With sustained lower interest rates and the improved farm 
debt situation approximately 600 new designated lenders and 
better marketing of the program have contributed to the success 
of FIMCLA. In simple terms, the aggregate limit can be 
increased at little or no cost to government and should satisfy 
program demand for the next 10 years.
<P>
	This positive measure is supported by the agri-food sector 
and commercial lenders alike. The program has become 
increasingly important to rural lenders such as credit unions that 
offer credit to farm producers. The Canadian Bankers 
Association and Credit Union Central in Saskatchewan support 
the proposed increase. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
and other major farm groups have been consulted and support 
the proposed amendment. It is inexpensive and supports the 
agri-food sector.
<P>
	Taxpayers are well served. Improvements made under the 
program contribute to the strength of Canada's economy and 
decrease dependency on government subsidies.
<P>
	I ask members to support Bill C-75. By increasing the 
aggregate principal amount of loans that can be guaranteed, the 
program will continue to be offered to farmers and 
co-operatives and will make a difference.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a couple of comments for the hon. member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain. We are seeing a classic case of the 
government trying to close the door after the horse has escaped. 
I get back to what I said a few moments ago. I would like the 
member to comment on my idea.
<P>
	Why could the government not support the idea of 
consolidating the three or four federal programs to offer lending 
assistance to the agricultural industry?
<P>
	It is well known that the Farm Credit Corporation exists. Why 
do we not remove the other two bureaucracies, the Small 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11695"> 11695 </A></B>
<P>
Businesses Loans Act and the Farm Improvement Loans Act, 
and put them under the umbrella of the Farm Credit 
Corporation?
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	It would seem a government guarantee to other lending 
institutions is a conflict in one way because we would be in 
direct competition with the Farm Credit Corporation. What does 
the member think about the idea of consolidation and removal of 
duplication?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to the questions posed 
and with regard to FIMCLA we must remember the bill would 
increase the cap from $1.5 billion to $3 billion. We have to 
maintain that and keep it as the essence of the drive.
<P>
	We have to review all government agencies, farm credit and 
the entire agricultural scene. With that in mind, I am sure the 
agriculture minister is looking at all available options.
<P>
	However, in relation to Bill C-75, I would not want us to delay 
very important action on behalf of the agricultural community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to clarify for my 
hon. colleague that my criticism is not against increasing the 
limit to $3 billion. I understand the need and necessity for it. My 
only concern was that we were using band-aid measures and we 
could do far more to improve the situation if we opened it up and 
looked at the whole picture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened rather intently to the hon. 
member. In his speech he expressed some concern about the 
capping provision. It is very important.
<P>
	Since the member has an agricultural background, I take very 
seriously his thoughts about the whole business of our running 
government, certainly in the agricultural sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on Bill C-75, an act to amend the Farm Improvement 
and Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act.
<P>
	I believe I am going to please the government by saying that 
its plan to increase loan guarantees to $3 billion is an excellent 
one. However, if it thinks the criticisms will be coming after the 
compliments, it is quite right. Let us first turn to the positive 
aspects. In fact, the change is only raising the guarantee ceiling 
for loans made by financial institutions, to keep up with the 
demand.
<P>
	According to data provided by the Department of Agriculture 
and Agrifood, the programm is very efficient since its cost is 
very low. It costs $1.5 million a year, which reflects losses due 
to loan default. We are talking about 1 per cent of guaranteed 
loans as a whole. This means that with a $3 billion ceiling, the 
annual cost should rise to $3 millions, which is quite acceptable.
<P>
	We are not against logic. According to data also obtained from 
Agriculture and Agrifood Canada, in 1994-1995, more than 17 
000 loans were made under the Farm Improvement and 
Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act, for a total of $475 million. 
The total value of guaranteed loans is getting close to the $1.5 
billion limit.
<P>
	The demand and the service provided fully justify the increase 
in the guarantee limit. We are not against this measure, which 
allows farms to have access to development funds without the 
government having to give grants, which come right out of 
taxpayers' pockets.
<P>
	However, a dose of constructive criticism will be good for this 
government which does not realize, or chooses to ignore, that 
overlap costs money to the taxpayers, who are already 
overtaxed, and that it could be avoided.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	In fact, this measure perpetuates the overlaps between the 
federal government department, the Farm Credit Association 
and Quebec. Through the Société du financement agricole, 
Quebec provides the same services as its federal counterpart. 
Yes, more overlap. In one ear and out the other. The population 
got the message, and most importantly, understood it. Overlap.
<P>
	And regarding the case that we are discussing today, we 
should specify that there is an overlap not only in activities, but 
also in the way things are done. Loan guarantees have their 
place, but they increase the debt load of businesses. Everybody 
recognizes the importance of evaluating a business's potential 
and its market before offering more loans. Too heavy a debt load 
makes a business unable to compete. That is why we maintain 
that Quebec is in the best position to identify which sectors of its 
economy are experiencing growth and to establish policies 
regarding access to credit.
<P>
	Obviously, these policies are geared to the development 
strategies elaborated in collaboration with the sector. In its 
latest annual report, the Société du financement agricole du 
Québec points out that it creates and develops new programs in 
collaboration with representatives of the financial and farming 
sectors. Quebec has established a tradition of consultation on 
farming issues with the États généraux du monde rural in 1991; 
the consultation committees which were formed during the 
Trois-Rivières Summit in 1992 following the consensus 
reached on the priorities for the agri-food sector's development 
in Quebec; and lastly, the Trois-Rivières Summit itself.
<P>
	Quebec has the expertise required to take the program under 
its wing, of course, with the corresponding transfer of funding. 
The federal government would save a department desperately in 
need of saving a great amount of money. Was the Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11696"> 11696 </A></B>
<P>
Agriculture and Agri-food not one of the hardest hit by the last 
round of budget cuts?
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is one of those hardest hit 
by downsizing. It does not make sense to maintain duplication 
and make cuts in areas where duplication does not exist. 
Inspection services will now charge a fee, although we have 
three overlapping inspection services. Where does the money 
come from to pay for these services? From the private sector, 
which ends up paying the price of duplication.
<P>
	The minister must be aware of the fact that officials who 
helped draft this legislation on farm improvement and 
marketing co-operatives loans admitted it was competing with 
equivalent programs in Quebec. For the benefit of those who 
may not be that familiar with the Société de financement 
agricole, I would like to comment briefly on its farm loan 
operations.
<P>
	This is taken from the agency's latest annual report. The 
Société de financement agricole authorizes and guarantees loans 
and credit openings. Farmers can obtain guaranteed loans up to a 
maximum of $800,000, while the maximum for loans at reduced 
rates is $200,000. The interest rate for guaranteed loans is based 
on the residential mortgage rate offered by financial 
institutions. Farmers now have the option of selecting a 
one-year, three-year or five-year term, at a rate locked in for 
the duration of the term selected.
<P>
	During the 1993-94 financial year, the Société de 
financement agricole granted 4,682 farm loans totalling $353.3 
million, which represents an increase of 12 per cent in the 
number of loans and 39 per cent in the total amount. Out of the 
total number of loans, 3,305 representing $279.6 million were 
granted at the reduced rates provided under the financing 
program.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Société de financement agricole authorized 
the transfer of existing loans, representing another $39.5 
million. The total amount of loans and transfers was $392.8 
million.
<P>
	In other words, Quebec already offers these services. It is in a 
better position to understand what is involved, thanks to a 
consultation model unique in North America. Agricultural 
partners in Quebec have given a lot of thought to sustainable 
regional development.
<P>
	The Société de financement agricole is closer to the farmers 
and to the markets. It is in a better position to develop a 
consistent credit policy based on economic development 
strategies identified by the parties concerned. If Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada lets the Société administer the loan 
guarantees to which Quebec is entitled, duplication will no 
longer be an issue.
<P>
	Bill C-75 may be worthwhile to farmers in the rest of Canada, 
but I have some reservations about the impact of this program in 
Quebec. Is the Canadian government going to say yes to a farmer 
whose loan request has just been turned down by the Société de 
financement agricole? If a project review was done by experts, 
is the federal government going to do another one? We are still  
stuck in the murky waters of federal duplication, lack of 
efficiency and interference.
<P>
	Furthermore, Quebec already faces duplication through the 
presence of the Farm Credit Corporation, which reports to 
Parliament through the Minister of Agriculture. In Quebec, we 
have shown that the Société de financement agricole is capable 
of managing the loan guarantee program. The rest of Canada 
could benefit from the expertise of the Farm Credit Corporation, 
which is the largest long term lender in Canada. A document 
provided by the FCC itself indicates that it has the human 
resources and expertise required for agricultural financing.
<P>
	In addition to providing traditional loans, the FCC can now 
finance diversification projects on the farm or value added 
agricultural businesses off the farm. In addition, the FCC can 
now administer programs and services jointly with federal 
agencies, provincial governments and other lenders.
<P>
	Our colleagues opposite will again tell us there is no 
duplication. Officials have said that Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada's program was not duplicating the activities of the Farm 
Credit Corporation, since it did not offer the same program. We 
are always hearing these arguments. Once and for all, will this 
government not understand that these arguments do not hold 
water? Let us look at the thing objectively. Since the industry 
seems to consider the program valid, why does the Farm Credit 
Corporation not use its own resources to provide it?
<P>
	The FCC has the capability, with a staff of over 760 people 
working out of six regional offices and 101 district and rural 
offices. The FCC loans portfolio includes some 55,000 accounts 
valued at $3.3 billion.
<P>
	It is therefore biased, dishonest and wrong to say that there is 
no overlap between the activities of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada and the Farm Credit Corporation. It has, I repeat, all it 
needs to offer the program elsewhere than in Quebec, where the 
Société de financement agricole can do the job.
<P>
	The federal government talks of single window here and 
single window there. However, when it comes to making it 
operational, it is another story.
<P>
	Here is the situation. The government takes a perfectly logical 
step.
<P>
	Under the terms of the act, once the $1.5 billion limit is 
reached, the government is no longer obliged to guarantee loans 
granted by lenders. This obviously prevents new loans from 
being accepted under the Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Cooperatives Loans Act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11697"> 11697 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	So we agree that it is necessary to amend the legislation to 
raise the limit of the five year loans to three billion dollars. We 
agree on the benefits of such a measure: it will make credit 
readily available to farmers and marketing cooperatives, for a 
wide range of farm improvement projects.
<P>
	Furthermore, borrowers will get good interest rates and 
requirements concerning their equity will be lowered. The 
program encourages investments in new kinds of machinery, 
new technologies and different agricultural ventures, as we see 
more and more in my riding where there is an ostrich farm, for 
example. On those points we agree with the government. But the 
idea loses much of its appeal because this government is unable 
to tap into existing and competent resources to manage the 
program.
<P>
	We have shown repeatedly, and not only today, that Quebec is 
in a better position to identify growth sectors in its economy and 
to implement credit access policies reflecting the development 
strategies established in co-operation with the community. Yet, 
with the Farm Improvement and Marketing Cooperatives Loans 
Act, the federal government competes with comparable Quebec 
programs.
<P>
	In Quebec, the Société du financement agricole has all the 
necessary expertise to manage the program. Elsewhere in 
Canada, wherever the Farm Credit Corporation has offices, 
there are also adequate resources for that program to be offered. 
So we are once again in the vicious circle of overlap and 
duplication where there is no logic.
<P>
	In spite of a drastic downsizing of the public service, the 
federal government is not restructuring its activities efficiently. 
There is still some useless overlapping within its 
administration. Today, we gave yet another example of that. The 
public will have to bear the consequences. So we say stop, 
enough is enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to speak in favour of amendments to the Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Co-Operatives Loans Act.
<P>
	As has been stated previously, we are seeking to amend the act 
in order to increase the aggregate principal amount of loans 
allowed under the act from $1.5 to $3 billion. The program has 
proved very popular with farmers. In fact, I have had 
considerable experience with the use of the farm loans act in my 
own farm operation.
<P>
	Consequently, as a result of this demand the present five year 
$1.5 billion cap has almost been reached. The Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Co-Operatives Loans Act is one of 
the best accepted programs in existence by the farm community. 
As is seen, it is used substantially.
<P>
	FIMCLA is a loan guarantee program designed to increase the 
availability of credit on reasonable terms to farmers and farmer 
owned marketing co-operatives. It  allows investments in new 
technology and equipment and covers a wide range of farm 
improvement projects.
<P>
	I would throw a note of caution that we have to be careful here 
and not just make guarantees for the banks. There is a 
commitment by the lending community here and there has to be 
a commitment to the farm community as well. We do not want to 
see the situation where the banks just use this program when 
they really do not need to use it to have a guarantee on the funds 
they are lending out. The objective then must be to put more 
capital into the system to assist farmers who otherwise might 
have difficulty in acquiring loans to get them from the lending 
community.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The improvements the moneys can be used for include the 
purchase of farm machinery, clearing land, installing irrigation 
or drainage systems, fences, construction or renovation of farm 
buildings and the purchase of livestock or farmland. The loans 
can also be used by co-operative associations for investing in 
value added production. This could include facilities for 
processing, distributing or marketing farm products such as 
washing or packaging plants. We have had a considerable 
amount of that kind of operation in my riding in terms of the 
potato industry.
<P>
	As well the loans can be used for alternate farming enterprises 
such as organic production. That is an extremely important 
point. Here is a production base that I think has a tremendous 
and an increasing potential. There is very definitely a niche 
market in terms of organic products and it will be increasingly 
so in the future.
<P>
	Sometimes it is very difficult for people in the organic 
production industry to get loans in the normal course of events. 
Extending the amount of money under the act should make it 
possible for those people in the organic production industry to 
acquire the necessary funds to meet their needs.
<P>
	It is important to note that the environmental impacts of the 
projects are considered. Environmental impact assessments are 
commonly used on the larger projects.
<P>
	Through the program, farmers get better interest rates than 
those normally available, usually .5 to 1 per cent below the 
prevailing rate. They are also allowed to borrow with a 
minimum equity of 20 per cent. This is extremely important 
especially to younger farmers getting into the industry or some 
of the higher risk farming operations.
<P>
	The act also facilitates access to credit in rural areas, putting 
investment power into the hands of producers and marketing 
co-operatives. It strengthens production and financial stability 
in rural Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11698"> 11698 </A></B>
<P>
	FIMCLA supports adaptation and diversification. It 
encourages rural development and sparks job creation. The 
program has become increasingly important to rural lenders 
such as credit unions and Caisses populaires that offer credit to 
farm producers. The Canadian Bankers Association, the Credit 
Union Central in Saskatchewan and la Confédération des caisses 
populaires Desjardins all support the proposed increase. The 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture and other major groups 
have also been consulted and support the proposed amendment.
<P>
	The program has been an inexpensive way for the government 
to support primary producers and the downstream industries. 
Historically the net loss in terms of lending under this program 
has only been 1 per cent. Any extra costs incurred under the new 
act will be offset by an increase in the registration fee paid by the 
producers and marketing co-operatives that benefit from the 
program. Taxpayers are very well served. Improvements made 
under the program contribute to the strength of Canada's 
economy and decrease dependency on government subsidies.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask members to support Bill C-75 by 
increasing the aggregate principal amount of loans which can be 
guaranteed. The program will continue to be offered to farmers 
and farmer owned marketing co-operatives. In so doing, we will 
be supporting one of the major wealth producing industries in 
this country. We will be ensuring that primary producers, where 
all the wealth generates from in terms of the farm production 
base, have the availability of capital under reasonable terms so 
that they can be the kind of wealth generating industry which so 
many other industries spin their wealth from.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak in support of Bill C-75, an act to amend the 
Farm Improvement and Marketing Co-Operatives Loans Act.
<P>
	I would like to begin by commenting on the importance of 
affordable financing for the agriculture community. I remember 
one of my first encounters with the banks and how without the 
farm improvement loan I would have been at the mercy of the 
fickle finger of finance. It is quite possible that without the loans 
act not only I but many farmers would not have been able to farm 
quite the same way we do today. I would like to expand on that.
<P>
	In 1973 I came back from Stelco and began farming. At that 
time I took out a farm improve loan in the amount of $5,400 for a 
165 Massey-Ferguson tractor and a four-furrow plough. I know 
the member for Malpeque wishes there were farm deals like that 
today but there are not. In our farming operations today we 
market 360,000 chickens a year, over one million pounds of 
meat. I still have that 165 Massey-Ferguson tractor. It is 
something that brings this home to me.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What would it be worth today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> I think it is worth about $7,000 or $8,000. I could 
make some money on it if I sold it but it is a very proud 
possession of mine.
<P>
	The program is designed to increase the availability of credit 
to farmers and farmer owned co-operatives at a reasonable 
interest rate to improve farm assets and strengthen production 
and financial stability.
<P>
	This act was amended in 1987 by increasing the maximum 
amount of outstanding loans for borrowers from $100,000 to 
$250,000. It introduced fixed rate loans and loan consolidation 
and refinancing. It expanded the scope of the act to allow for 
loan guarantees up to $3 million to farmer owned marketing 
co-operatives and for value added marketing, processing or 
distribution projects. It introduced a registration fee of one-half 
of 1 per cent of the loan amount.
<P>
	Since February 1988 when the above noted amendments came 
into effect more than 65,000 loans representing more than $1.5 
billion have been made under the act. Since 1990 over 55,000 
loans have been made to utilize the act. There are currently 10 
active value added co-operative loans totalling $14.2 million. 
Personally, I believe that value added marketing is the wave of 
the future. We will see this area grow significantly in the years 
ahead.
<P>
	Last year, this act was used to facilitate more than 18,000 
loans totalling more than $475 million. The average loan size 
for 1994-95 was $27,000 and the five year average is $22,000.
<P>
	Over the last 25 years, net losses under the act have 
approximated 1 per cent of the total loan guarantees. There are 
currently two one time fees paid by the borrower. The first is the 
loan registration fee which is forwarded to Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada of one-half of 1 per cent of the loan amount. 
The second is an administration fee which is paid to the lender, 
the lesser of one-half of 1 per cent or $250 on loans less than 
$250,000, or one-tenth of 1 per cent on loans of $250,000 or 
more.
<P>
	The maximum rates of interest which can be charged by 
lenders are prime plus 1 per cent on a floating rate basis and 
prime plus 1 per cent plus one-quarter of 1 per cent for each year 
of a term loan. For example, that would be prime plus two and 
one-quarter per cent for a five year term loan. For a loan of 
$27,000 the cost would be approximately an extra $67. 
Approximately 683 rural lenders, such as credit unions, have 
been newly designated as lenders under the act since 1991.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Under the existing act, once the five year $1.5 billion loan 
guarantee limit is reached, the federal government would no 
longer be in a position to guarantee loans made by the lenders. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11699"> 11699 </A></B>
<P>
This would make any further new loans under the act 
impossible. Therefore, it is essential to have  an amendment to 
the act which will increase the five year loan limit to $3 billion.
<P>
	Having shared with members how I view the importance of 
this program, I do not believe the major banks have shared my 
opinion. I do not believe the banks have made sufficient 
progress in improving access to capital for the agriculture 
community. In fact, it has been suggested that the banks 
discourage the use of this loan act in favour of loans which 
would bring the banks larger profits.
<P>
	More must be done to address the credit needs of agriculture. 
It is imperative. Just as the banks have been slow to finance 
small business, the same holds true for agricultural 
co-operatives. The banks have acknowledged though that they 
can do a better job of lending to agriculture and have taken a 
number of steps to improve this situation. However, we continue 
to receive the message from the agriculture community that 
more needs to be done.
<P>
	As a member of the federal Ontario Liberal task force on 
access to capital to small business, I heard a litany of anecdotal 
evidence indicating the banks' indifference to small business. 
As a farmer, I was quite aware that many of the concerns of 
small business were the same for agriculture.
<P>
	While it is difficult to document the validity of each 
individual claim, the volume of complaints certainly depicts an 
uneasy relationship with the banking institutions. I hope that 
situation will be improved now that we have the banks' attention 
with the levying of the temporary capital tax on large 
deposit-taking institutions in the finance minister's 1995 
budget.
<P>
	The government will be working with the banks to develop 
appropriate benchmarks for small business. I would define 
small business as including agriculture. We promised in the red 
book that we would take steps to increase capital availability in 
rural areas. We are keeping that promise with the passage of Bill 
C-75.
<P>
	I encourage all members of the House to indicate their support 
of the agriculture community by supporting this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, would my hon. friend from Ontario outline for me 
some of the impacts he can see in his area with regard to 
FIMCLA being increased from $1.5 million to $3 million? Are 
there different agricultural groups that would be able to utilize 
that funding? How would the cap feature impact on those groups 
at this time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, about three or four weeks ago I was 
up in the Collingwood area and I had a chance to tour an apple 
packing factory. It was busting at the seams. Business was really 
good. It has been very innovative. It is squeezing apples for 
apple juice. It has come up with a couple of combination ideas 
using carrots for carrot juice. It was actually getting to the point 
where it was exporting. However, it was busting at the seams and 
needed capital to expand.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that this is exactly what he is 
talking about. This apple factory is at the three year period and 
has to expand its business. It needs new machinery and needs to 
expand the building. There will be more jobs created from this.
<P>
	I hope that has answered the hon. member's question.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the 
income tax application rules and related acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to take 
the opportunity to present Bill C-70 to the House for second 
reading. It is an item arising out of the budget presented in 
February 1994.
<P>
	I will explain the process we go through with a major piece of 
legislation such as this one. Immediately after the minister 
presents the budget we have a debate on it and it is voted upon. 
Subsequently we introduce the budget measures act which 
incorporates many of the activities of different departments. It 
was begun last year and took up the time of the House of 
Commons in May and early June and of the Senate in June. It 
was finished before July 1.
<P>
	Subsequently in the public perception we began to deal with 
the budget for 1995 but we had not finished the work arising 
from the 1994 budget. Today we are continuing the work from 
last year's budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11700"> 11700 </A></B>
<P>
	Last fall we found out about the changes to the Income Tax 
Act, which is the second part of the work done in a budget. At 
first we have changes to departmental activities, including for 
example the Unemployment Insurance Act. Then we have 
changes to the Income Tax Act. Previously the House considered 
amendments to the Income Tax Act arising out of the business of 
the budget of last year. They were reviewed in the House of 
Commons last November and were reviewed in committee in 
December. A few witnesses appeared. We considered some of 
the changes offered by the opposition and decided to go ahead 
with the bill as it stood. It was then presented to the House, went 
through the Senate, and is now law.
<P>
	Because of the enormous number of changes made, we split 
the amendments to the Income Tax Act into two different 
sections. This is the second section. Bill C-70 represents the 
second set of amendments to the budget arising out of the 
February 1994 budget statement.
<P>
	They are a number of technical amendments which affect the 
income tax situation of those in the business world and 
corporations. In summary, the amendments implement certain 
measures announced in the budget of February 22, 1994 as well 
as other measures announced by the government in 1994.
<P>
	The measures are described, first, as debt forgiveness. It 
requires a debtor whose indebtedness is forgiven to apply the 
unpaid amount to reduce any tax losses and the tax cost of 
properties owned by the debtor. Any unapplied balance is 
brought into the income by individual debtors whose incomes 
exceed $40,000 and by corporate debtors that are not bankrupt 
or insolvent.
<P>
	Second, we are changing some of the rules by which we treat 
foreign affiliates. We expand the categories of income of foreign 
affiliates which must be reported as income of their Canadian 
shareholders.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It responds to a widely held view by Canadians. It was a 
perspective that we certainly heard about in the late eighties and 
early nineties when we were in opposition. Canadians saw the 
corporate world was able to transfer moneys to foreign affiliates 
and to avoid taxation in certain regimes which they considered 
to be too high. We took a very progressive step in our first 
budget, the budget of February 1994, to expand the rules and 
ways in which we were able to deal with foreign affiliates.
<P>
	Third, we now require financial institutions to report profits 
and losses on securities held in the ordinary course of business, 
on income rather than capital on a market to market basis.
<P>
	I was very much involved with the initial discussions that 
were held with industry when we announced the rules. I am very 
happy to say the relationship between the financial institutions 
and the government have greatly improved through numerous 
discussions.
<P>
	The industry felt at first that the tax measures were too 
aggressive and did not take into account some historical 
developments, particularly in the insurance industry. We argued 
very strenuously that the insurance industry should be 
understood. We held discussions not only in Ottawa but across 
the country. We listened to representatives of their associations 
and met with senior officials of individual companies. They 
pointed out that if we did not proceed with some care our 
evaluation of their securities and our treatment of their 
securities no longer being on the capital side but on the income 
side would greatly hurt their business.
<P>
	The insurance industry is very important to the country. There 
are more than 140 active insurance companies. We want to make 
sure we stabilize the companies and do not do anything negative 
to affect either their capital base or their income base.
<P>
	After several weeks of discussions amendments were 
suggested back and forth. I think all parties will agree that the 
rules as finally presented to the House a few weeks ago and now 
being expanded upon at second reading are fair to everyone.
<P>
	We must remember the purpose of the Government of Canada 
is to ensure that every corporate sector is taxed properly and 
pays its fair share. That is the demand of all Canadians. The 
insurance industry has responded admirably. It is more than 
willing to pay its fair share and now feels the rules and 
regulations we are developing are more appropriate to its 
business activities.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to publicly thank members of the 
insurance industry who have taken many hours to explain to me 
the nature of their business. Last year was my first year in the 
finance field on behalf of the Government of Canada. When that 
is the case we need a lot of kindness from people in the private 
sector to explain how they operate and the way new regulations 
or new tax regimes negatively affect their businesses. There was 
no element of hostility. I very much respect their willingness to 
spend time with me to ensure I understood their case.
<P>
	Fourth, in terms of funeral arrangements we are providing an 
exemption for interest earned on prepaid amounts under eligible 
arrangements entered into by individuals to cover their funeral 
and cemetery expenses. This is a combination of federal and 
provincial laws, rules and regulations that govern people who 
make such arrangements ahead of time.
<P>
	Through trust arrangements at the provincial level those 
funds are protected but because of the high cost of property, 
particularly in major metropolitan areas, we found that the 
limits originally being considered were not sufficient. The 
change is to accommodate the reality of how people are 
purchasing plots in cemeteries. We do not feel we are suffering 
in any way, shape or form an unnecessary financial burden. We 
are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11701"> 11701 </A></B>
<P>
dealing with the reality of the high cost of property. We did not 
want to put Canadian taxpayers, the industry or the non-profit  
sector in the field at risk through unfair tax rules. These 
amendments address the issue.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Fifth, we are permitting publicly traded real estate investment 
trusts to qualify as mutual fund trusts for tax purposes.
<P>
	Sixth, we are dealing with mutual fund reorganizations. It will 
allow a mutual fund corporation to convert into a mutual fund 
trust on a tax free basis and will allow tax free mergers of mutual 
fund trusts.
<P>
	Members of the House will know that the mutual fund 
business is one of the fastest expanding businesses in North 
America. Every effort has been made at the regulatory level to 
keep in touch with the industry and keep up to date with its 
changes.
<P>
	We have sought through the Income Tax Act several other 
initiatives in the securities industry to ensure the tax regime is 
fair to people in the mutual fund area and is current with 
established practices. As time goes on, if the industry continues 
to change as fast as it has, we will have to make future changes.
<P>
	Seventh, we are dealing with objections and appeals. This 
requires large corporations to specify in notices of objection to 
income tax assessments the issues under dispute and the amount 
of relief sought.
<P>
	The House may be familiar with the past practice of legal 
departments and taxation departments of corporations sending 
notices of appeal to Revenue Canada on a regular basis, 
indicating that they have an objection to the taxes being 
assigned by Revenue Canada. By making a general objection as 
they have in the past they have been able to wait for specific tax 
cases to come forward. Once the tax cases are registered they are 
able to re-examine their books to see if they apply. In theory that 
has caused the Government of Canada to have a great deal of 
liability each year in the corporate tax sector.
<P>
	We are seeking to limit the liability in the future within a 
specified time that we think will give the corporation a lot of 
time to review its tax assessment. The notice of appeal should 
specify exactly what is being appealed. It is no longer suitable to 
have a general appeal against the tax assessment. The 
corporation must specify exactly what it is objecting to and 
proceeding with, if necessary, through legal action. That will 
give Revenue Canada and the Government of Canada an 
opportunity to proceed without having to worry about 
innumerable court cases in the future.
<P>
	The eighth section deals with securities lending. This will 
permit investment dealers to deduct two-thirds of dividend 
compensation payments made in securities lending 
arrangements.
<P>
	The bill has a fairly broad range of measures. It complements 
the original budget speech, the budget bill introduced last year 
and the changes to the Income Tax Act dealt with in the fall of 
1994 that were finished in the spring of 1995. The bill introduces 
specific measures that are very compact including funeral 
arrangements. It establishes the principles of fairness long 
talked about by governments but rarely acted upon.
<P>
	The objections and appeals, the opportunities to challenge tax 
rulings and deal with the tax payable by foreign affiliates, are 
fair measures. The Minister of Finance has done an excellent 
job. He stated quite often that the government would not let up 
on bringing more fairness to the tax system. Those measures 
will be benchmarks of the new fairness in the Income Tax Act 
dealing both with corporations and individuals.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	When we have made major changes affecting an industry such 
as the insurance industry we have proceeded not only with a 
determination to make things fairer for the whole sector but we 
have been responsive to criticisms and to critiques. We have 
been willing to talk with these people and to talk to the 
executives of the different companies and to the associations 
and to respond when a point is well made.
<P>
	To have good tax law we have to be determined to be fair but 
we also cannot be stubborn and in the face of obvious mistakes 
hold to a position which puts companies at a disadvantage. I 
have learned a lot about the insurance industry as a result of 
these measures and I am hopeful we will continue to have these 
discussions in other spheres.
<P>
	The government welcomes the opportunity to open up this 
debate, to have second reading on Bill C-70, amendments to the 
Income Tax Act. We welcome comments from the opposition 
and its critique on what we are trying to do and its suggestions 
on how we can make the Income Tax Act fairer in the future.
<P>
	We also welcome the opportunity to hear from witnesses in 
committee both in the House of Commons and later in the Senate 
so that the views of professionals in the field can be heard, taken 
seriously and government can continue to refine the Income Tax 
Act to be fairer and more just to more Canadians and as we 
proceed over the years to make further amendments to ensure 
every Canadian is paying his or her or corporate fair share and at 
the same time finds the system just in the way they are treated 
and in the way other people are being treated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the government for giving us this opportunity, 
through Bill C-70, to speak not only on particular provisions of 
the bill, which enacts certain measures put forward in last year's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11702"> 11702 </A></B>
<P>
budget by the finance minister, but also to raise the whole issue 
of reviewing Canada's tax system.
<P>
	I can tell you right off the bat that the official opposition will 
not support Bill C-70 at second reading stage, not because of 
any specific measure, but because of the lack of significant 
action on the part of the government regarding tax loopholes and 
the review of the tax system the Bloc Quebecois has been 
requesting since the Liberals came to power, nearly 15 months 
ago.
<P>
	A little while ago, I listened to the secretary of state talk about 
an in-depth review of the tax system, of the openness of this 
government regarding the inequity and unfairness of the 
Canadian tax policy. Pretending to be concerned with equity and 
social justice, this government has done nothing to plug tax 
loopholes since it came to power.
<P>
	All this is contrary to what the red book said. The government 
no longer refers to the red book, which was waved at us month 
after month, because it is ashamed. It can no longer establish 
any parallel between its election promises and its action in the 
area of taxation. In fact, the red book contained many Liberal 
policy statements on tax fairness, pointing out to the fact that in 
this great country which prides itself on being fair from coast to 
coast, as the Prime Minister likes to say, there are totally unfair 
situations.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the red book mentioned a few. It said that 
some corporations had not paid a cent in income tax for years 
because of the previous government's laxness and the fact that it 
supposedly had many friends among big business, which was 
not the case of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party, too, had 
criticized the fact that, since 1984, personal income tax had 
increased much more rapidly than corporate income tax. If I 
remember rightly, according to what the Prime Minister said at 
that time, it wanted to correct all the unfairness and injustice in 
the tax system in the first two years of its mandate.
<P>
	Since they have been in office, the Liberals have not fulfilled 
their undertakings. They have not fulfilled the promises they 
made during the campaign in order to get elected.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Let me give you some examples of unfairness in the tax 
system. Let us take, for instance, the family trusts. It is not for 
nothing that, for the past 15 months, since our arrival here, we 
have been saying, over and over again, that the tax rules for 
family trusts are unfair to all the taxpayers in Quebec and 
Canada. It is no coincidence if we have been pestering the 
government about every second day since 1993 about family 
trusts. It is because this tax system is truly unfair to Canadians, 
from whom the government asks more and more sacrifices 
because its finances are in a sorry mess, while at the same time 
the richest Canadian families are allowed to accumulate capital 
gains year after year without paying any income tax for up to 80 
years.
<P>
	Even the tax experts are divided on that issue. Some work for 
the very rich Canadian families, others take a view more 
compatible with the interest of the general public. Some of 
these, for the last two to three years and even since the review, 
four and a half years ago, of family trusts and the 21-year rule, 
have sharply criticized the perpetuation of such a measure and 
the possibility to defer income tax on capital gains for up to 80 
years.
<P>
	As the official opposition, we have made this issue one of our 
favourite themes, especially since we obtained sketchy 
information from the private sector and some Canadian 
universities that lead us to believe that hundreds of millions and 
even billions of dollars could be recovered by abolishing certain 
privileges linked to family trusts. We know that those trusts 
have become a major means of tax planning for the wealthiest 
Canadian families, individuals and companies.
<P>
	We are not talking here about the principle of family trusts, 
which can be a good thing. We are not talking about the principle 
of family trusts, which may apply, for instance, to families with 
a handicapped child who will need to be taken care of in the 
future, even once his parents are dead. We are not against the 
whole idea, nor the administration of these trusts, but what we 
have been questioning since we arrived here, and even before, 
during the election campaign, is the fact that a millionaire can 
use this system to defer indefinitely taxes on his or her capital 
gains. We cannot accept that.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Finance give us in his last budget? 
He wanted to look good. He said: Since I cannot stand the 
official opposition complaining about such a blatant case of 
unfairness and injustice in the tax system, I will mention the 
words family trust in the budget speech to shut them up in the 
future. But he forgot that we have ears to listen, eyes to read and 
brains to analyze.
<P>
	When he brought forth his measure, saying that he would 
eliminate fiscal benefits for family trusts in 1999, he took us for 
something that we were not. He also took Quebecers and 
Canadians for something that they were not, because he knew 
very well that, by putting off to 1999 the necessary change only 
for family trusts, he was warning rich Canadian families four 
years in advance so that they could get ready and take out the 
hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars that they 
had put into these trusts and transfer them to other financial 
vehicles, other powerful tools of tax planning. We have not dealt 
in any way with all the tax loopholes that these rich families and 
all the big Canadian corporations can benefit from.
<P>
	Is that how the government sees social justice, and fairness in 
the tax system from coast to coast? Is this how the government 
shows its concern? This government has only one concern: to 
look good. It does not matter what the substance is; the impor-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11703"> 11703 </A></B>
<P>
tant thing is to look good. The last budget, like the previous 
budget and Bill C-70 before us, shows us this government's 
propensity for cosmetic  changes, for phoney tax reforms that do 
not change anything.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	One should also look at the tax agreements signed with 
countries considered to be tax havens. We in the opposition 
refuse to let the government get away with this. We have been 
hounding the government since the last election campaign so 
that, ever since the 1994-95 budget, the Minister of Finance 
tried to silence us, to stop us from denouncing the inequities and 
tax loopholes in these tax agreements by putting up a 
smokescreen.
<P>
	At that time, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> called the Minister of 
Finance, with good reason, the stand-up comic of Canadian tax 
policy. The minister presented things very dramatically but with 
such a lack of substance that, a few minutes after he delivered 
his speech, it was easy to see that nothing had changed with 
respect to tax agreements. Even the Auditor General of Canada 
said soon after the budget was tabled that, with the exception of 
some administrative adjustments allowing businesses to take 
advantage of tax agreements with countries considered to be tax 
havens, nothing had changed in the tax system in this regard.
<P>
	What does this mean, that nothing has changed? It means that, 
again this year, next year, and in two, three or 10 years from now, 
the Canadian tax system will still provide for this kind of 
agreement, which is not a bad thing per se but which makes a big 
difference when such agreements are signed with countries used 
to shelter billions in Canadian and U.S. dollars, and tens of 
billions of dollars in European and Japanese currencies.
<P>
	You know that such tax treaties enable certain Canadian 
businesses to open dummy subsidiaries offshore, carry out no 
business activities offshore, pay no tax or very little abroad, yet 
claim in Canada losses they did not even incur abroad, just for 
the sake of reducing their operating results in Canada and avoid 
paying their fair share to the Canadian tax authorities.
<P>
	We are not talking about small and medium size businesses, 
the vast majority of which do their corporate duty and pay their 
fair share of taxes, but large corporations which can take 
advantage of loopholes in the Canadian tax system that were 
plugged neither in last year's budget nor in the finance 
minister's latest budget and are allowed to remain, although the 
Liberal government claims to be concerned about fairness in the 
tax system.
<P>
	These tax treaties signed with 16 countries considered as tax 
havens are key to or at least instrumental in the federal 
government's improved performance in managing the Canadian 
tax system. Yet, the Minister of Finance continues to maintain 
that these are good tax treaties, that there is nothing wrong with 
these treaties and that, in this age of globalization and 
internationalization of trade, it is natural to sign tax treaties with 
other countries.
<P>
	We have always maintained that it is natural to have tax 
treaties and that, when businesses open subsidiaries offshore 
and pay taxes abroad roughly equal to what they would have 
paid in Canada, such treaties should be signed to prevent double 
taxation and ensure that the production system in which 
Canadian businesses operate is fiscally equitable, promotes job 
creation and so on.
<P>
	However, we are utterly opposed to signing with tax havens 
treaties which, in the opinion of the Auditor General himself, 
make no sense whatsoever. The internationalization and 
globalization arguments do not hold up when, by raising very 
little if any tax revenue from large corporations taking 
advantage of such tax loopholes, the fiscal position of Canada is 
not only threatened but made worse.
<P>
	The Department of Finance stopped releasing figures because 
they are too shameful. In 1991, the last year for which such 
statistics were available-as statisticians would say-the last 
year before the previous and the current government felt to 
ashamed of these results, no less than 77,000 Canadian 
businesses did not pay a cent in tax. But then again, we were told 
it had to do with the businesses' production cycle. That is 
understandable.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We can understand that a business may need to develop its 
products or services over a period of one, two or maybe three 
years before turning a profit, gaining a share of the market, or 
preserving a share of the market for a specific product. 
However, there is a problem when the production cycle lasts for 
a period of five, seven, ten or twelve years, during which the 
business does not pay any taxes but registers a profit every year, 
such as the banks which made profits of $4.8 billion last year 
while paying hardly any taxes.
<P>
	When I see that CN makes profits, pays its president a salary 
of $350,000 per year and grants him an interest-free loan of 
$400,000 to buy a house in Westmount, while at the same time 
acting in an inhuman if not barbaric fashion in the rail dispute, I 
wonder about this government's intentions and its election 
commitments regarding equity, social justice, the respect of 
rights, as well as fairness in general. Something is wrong 
somewhere. Incidentally, CN did not pay taxes either.
<P>
	There is a problem with taxation and these few 
measures-although we feel some are valid-are so minor given 
the scope of the flaws in the Canadian tax system, which has not 
been reviewed in 35 years, that we simply cannot support and 
praise the government for such minor initiatives.
<P>
	Among others, Mr. Séguin, a former Quebec revenue 
minister, says that, for 30 years now, the only changes to the 
federal tax system-I am not quoting him directly- were the 
inclusion of new elements or some minor reforms to that system, 
and that all this was essentially a top-loading exercise, in the 
sense that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11704"> 11704 </A></B>
<P>
new measures were  added to existing ones, thus turning the 
Canadian tax system into a monster.
<P>
	As a new member in the House, particularly as the finance 
critic, you do your very best to have a thorough grasp of all 
issues. And in order to do so, during the first months, in order to 
learn every aspect of the issues, you request a lot of 
documentation. I challenge you, Mr. Speaker, to try to read all 
the documents on Canadian fiscal policy. It is quite an ordeal 
when you consider all the explanatory notes, all the bills, all the 
related regulations, all the sub-regulations that have been added 
on. I challenge you to read all that within a ten-year period, and 
I will congratulate you if you succeed.
<P>
	In the United States, under Mr. Reagan, they had the same 
problem. We all remember that one of Mr. Reagan's constant 
refrains was a reformed and simplified income tax system, even 
if he was more favourable to businesses than to individuals, but 
the intention was there. He reformed the American tax system 
and simplified it at the same time. You can always question the 
fairness of this process, the propensity to favour corporations 
and high income earners instead of low and medium income 
taxpayers, but in the end the tax system was simplified. People 
can see exactly what the taxation levels are. They can see where 
the system is unfair.
<P>
	Here, we have to rely on experts or the members of the official 
opposition to scrutinize the tax system and tell the Canadian 
population what it really looks like. To point out to the Canadian 
people, for example, that 50 years ago, 50 per cent of all tax 
revenues were paid by individual taxpayers and 50 per cent by 
corporations. However, corporations nowadays account for 
around 17 per cent of all tax revenues and individual taxpayers 
make up the rest. We have to tell the people, because they will 
not hear about this from government members who tend to hide 
these things, just like the Liberal Party did during its first 
mandate.
<P>
	I remember that it was then that the gap between individual 
taxpayers and corporations began to come to light.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Friends of the Liberal Party had already been taken care of 
during the earlier mandate of the Liberal Party of Canada, and it 
is still going on. Anyone can compare the list of large donors to 
the chest of the Liberal Party of Canada and the list of tax 
policies that have not been reformed because they are just what 
big corporations want.
<P>
	When we see that the Royal Bank, for example, pours over 
$45,000 each year into the chest of the Liberal Party of Canada, 
we understand why in the last budget Canadian banks had 
nothing but a small income tax increase of $150 million over 
two years even though they made profits of almost $5 billion. 
We also understand why they are the main beneficiaries of the 
computer development programs provided by the federal 
government. When we see that the large corporations  managing 
family trusts give between $35,000 and $67,000 to the Liberal 
Party's chest, we understand why they have until 1999 to adjust 
to the new family trust provisions. I find it-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Incredible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> -yes, incredible, the member takes the words 
right out of my mouth. I find it incredible that they would have 
the nerve to present Bill C-70 as a major tax reform, like the 
secretary of state did a few moments ago. All they are doing is 
adding a few minor positive elements and a few negative ones, 
again to make taxation even more complex.
<P>
	I will tell you that it is a lot easier for this government to make 
cuts in social programs and to make outrageous cuts in the 
unemployment insurance fund. The federal government is no 
longer contributing to the unemployment insurance fund, but it 
will still take about $7 billion from it over the next three years.
<P>
	Over the same period, that is from 1994-95 to 1997-98, it will 
also take from the provinces the money it cannot obtain by 
closing loopholes in the federal tax system because it wants to 
protect wealthy party cronys or the large corporations which 
also happen to be important contributors to the Liberal Party 
fund. It will cut transfers to the provinces by $12.3 billion. It is 
offloading onto the provinces the problems created by its 
mismanagement of federal public finances.
<P>
	It is passing on to the provinces a possible lowering of our 
credit rating by the large bonds rating firms because, as Moody's 
has shown us, the federal government, even though it is 
represented by many stand-up comics, does not escape a serious 
analysis of our fiscal situation, of its unwillingness to correct 
this situation and our tax system in particular and to review all 
public expenditures item by item, including tax expenditures, as 
we have been asking since we arrived here.
<P>
	Moody's has understood that, although this document is some 
225 pages long, it is not with these insignificant reforms which 
make our tax system even more complex that we will regain 
control over our finances, over our tax system and over the 
government's present and future revenues.
<P>
	Moody's has understood one thing, and we can quote that 
agency. It has understood that this budget contained a lot of 
weak measures. There were measures that were supposed to 
allow the Minister of Finance to meet his objective of a deficit 
representing 3 percent of GDP for 1997-98, or $25 billion, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11705"> 11705 </A></B>
<P>
after that, there is nothing, just a big blank. We do not know 
where we are going. Moody's understood that.
<P>
	Moody's understood that in spite of all the cuts made at the 
expense of the unemployed, the seniors, the students, and the 
provinces, there is no way we can turn the situation around with 
this system. As Moody's put it, they could not see how in the 
medium term, we could control the deficit, much less the federal 
government's accumulated debt.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I have a feeling that Moody's can make calculations spread 
over more than a few months or one year. Moody's estimated, 
probably just as we did, that in spite of all the sacrifices and in 
spite of the last budget and the one before, from which Bill C-70 
stems, which are purported to be important and major steps on 
the way to recovery, to a reduction of the impact of the debt on 
the Canadian economy, in five years, the accumulated federal 
debt will exceed $750 billion and be closer to $800 billion. 
Moody's understood that.
<P>
	People at Moody's have a good appreciation of our situation, 
and they know how to interpret figures. They know there is no 
hope in the medium term, and even less in the long term, that 
this government, with its timid reforms of the Canadian tax 
system, will ever regain control of our financial situation, 
restore fairness to the tax system, and make it work smoothly. 
Moody's made a proper assessment of the Canadian situation 
despite what the intergovernmental affairs minister said after 
Moody's report was made public, and despite the answers the 
Prime Minister gave during question period this afternoon to the 
effect that Canada would have the highest gross domestic 
product growth in industrialized countries. Despite all of that, 
Moody's understood many of the problems in the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	First of all, if Canada has the best economic growth 
performance of all industrialized countries this year, it is 
because it was so far behind. Canada was the first to go into a 
recession that was the direct result of the monetary policy 
deliberately implemented by the Bank of Canada, a policy that 
brought us the worst recession in the whole Canadian history. 
Moody's understood all of that. When a country goes into 
recession before other countries, a stronger economic recovery 
is normal, especially the technical recovery that we are 
supposed to have had for three years. Moody's has understood 
that such a surge of economic growth is only temporary.
<P>
	We are glad that the more substantial recovery we have waited 
for so long has finally begun. We hope that this year, the 
economic recovery will truly lead to the creation of quality jobs 
for all Quebecers and Canadians. On the other hand, Moody's 
praises as we do the economic growth which is unrelated to this 
government's policies, even if the government claims the 
contrary at every opportunity.
<P>
	Economic growth is part of a normal economic cycle where 
the slowing down and the trough have lasted longer than usual 
because, I submit to you, of structural adjustment, globalization 
and of the new international situation, but in fact, this is quite 
normal considering that we were in the basement and that we are 
trying to stay on the ground floor over the next year.
<P>
	Moody's adds, and we agree with this analysis, that as soon as 
the Canadian economy slows down-not in ten years, but at the 
end of 1996-partly because of the slowdown of the American 
economy as early as next year, the effects will be very severe. 
This is why Moody's indicates that the deficit problem is not 
under control, much less the debt.
<P>
	Why? Because if, in one year and a half, Canada falls back 
into a recession cycle, tax revenues are going to decrease, which 
means that investor confidence is going to diminish because the 
federal government's deficit problems could, as soon as 
1997-98, be greater and require even more draconian cuts than 
the ones which have been imposed on us by the Minister of 
Finance these last two years and which did not solve anything.
<P>
	This means that foreign investors in particular, and Moody's 
was speaking to them, will start asking some serious questions 
about the future of the Canadian federation, the future of this 
government, if we are still stuck with it in Quebec. They will 
have serious reservations. Foreign investors will start 
wondering whether Canadian securities are a safe investment, 
because when the next recession comes around, with a debt 
which by 1997 will probably be close to $650 billion, it is really 
going to hurt, because we will need an increasing amount of 
money to service the debt. Since Canadian savings are not 
enough, foreign markets become an indispensable source of 
financing for the Canadian government, and the interest rates we 
will have to pay then, as a result of Moody's downgrading our 
bond rating-I can tell you Quebecers and Canadians are going 
to feel it.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	And what caused all this? The Minister of Finance, instead of 
indulging in theatrics and looking only at the short term, should 
have looked beyond the next federal election and beyond the 
referendum campaign in Quebec. He should have acted 
responsibly and done more than this superficial patching. He 
should have proceeded, as we requested, with a genuine review 
of public spending and the tax system, the tax loopholes he has 
yet to close after almost two years of Liberal government. That 
is what caused all this trouble.
<P>
	It is not a question of what will happen in the short term. The 
financial community looked at the short term. Everything is 
fine, but that will not be the case next year and in two years, it 
will be even worse. Moody's takes a much longer view. I respect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11706"> 11706 </A></B>
<P>
this firm because it had the guts to do this, although it was under 
political pressure, because as you know, bond rating firms are 
regularly  approached by lobbyists. Lobbyists are not just on 
Parliament Hill. There are lobbyists on Parliament Hill who go 
to see these people or the firms go directly to the Minister of 
Finance. They realize what is going on.
<P>
	Those who today blithely say that Moody's downgrade will 
have no short term effect are also irresponsible because of the 
message they are sending to the government. I am talking about 
large financial institutions in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada; 
some are arm-in-arm with the Liberal Party while others have a 
certain integrity we can respect. However they behave in an 
irresponsible manner when they say that all is well, that the 
financial sector anticipated Moody's downgrade and that the 
federal government was forewarned on February 11 of the 
impending downgrade but was reassured that the economic 
growth was there to offset it.
<P>
	In my opinion, all partisanship and opinions on the 
constitutional debate aside, saying such things is irresponsible. 
Some people are irresponsible enough to say that all is well. 
They are applauding the government even though it has failed to 
make the structural reforms, the deep structural changes that 
such a disaster calls for. Two years from now, these same 
people-I have them on record-these very people will be 
saying: ``Two years ago the federal government should have 
taken more effective measures, stricter measures to get the 
public finances in order. It should have reformed the tax system 
two years ago. We could have avoided this utter tax mess. We 
would also not be stuck with a recession made twice as bad as a 
normal recession because investors holding Canadian securities 
have lost confidence in our system and in the government's 
ability to manage the public purse''. These people in two years 
are going to say exactly the opposite to what they said last week 
or even last weekend about the impact of Moody's reduced 
rating.
<P>
	I would ask them, if they still have a sense of responsibility, to 
remind the federal government that it should not take short term 
holidays. It should set in motion what we have been asking it to 
set in motion since it took office. It must review everything it 
does here while awaiting Quebec's decision to leave the system. 
It is a system we consider to have no future, one that has shown 
itself to be, in the absence of tax reform alone in the past two 
years, immovable and, in terms of the constitution, irreformable 
and inflexible.
<P>
	Even with respect to tax reform, it is immovable. Perhaps 
because of the size of the machine and of the task, but it is 
immovable primarily because the government is defending 
interests other than those of Canadians and Quebeckers, I 
believe. The lack of a clear stand in favour of fairness in the tax 
system, in favour of a complete review of taxation and in favour 
of the establishment of a parliamentary committee to review the 
whole matter tells us it is time to ``get the heck out'', as the 
current expression has it, and I am talking to  Quebeckers here, it 
is time to get out before choices are made for us.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	You only have to look at the history of Argentina or Mexico. 
People say that countries in Latin America cannot be used for 
comparison purposes. But it is not true. In the early seventies, 
Argentina was thought to have a brilliant future, a country rich 
in resources, just like Brazil. Remember, until the early eighties, 
we were talking about the Brazilian miracle. Opportunities were 
endless.
<P>
	The same went for Mexico. When Pemex was created, 
enthusiasm ran high. Wealth was assured. The debt problem was 
not nearly as serious as the one we now face in Canada. And yet, 
these countries collapsed and the International Monetary Fund 
imposed on them measures that they should have imposed on 
themselves, but in a more humane and gradual way, to cause as 
little hardship as possible to individuals as well as businesses. 
Radical cuts were imposed on them.
<P>
	I remember in 1984, before joining GATT, which is now 
known as the World Trade Organization, Mexico was told to cut 
its education expenditures by half. All at one, expenditures had 
to be cut by 50 per cent in education, 30 per cent in health and 45 
per cent in rural development-and in Mexico, the rural sector is 
extremely important, much more so than in Canada. Yet, this is 
the kind of measures that were imposed on Mexico.
<P>
	If, according to Moody's in particular, but also many others 
who, before the budget was tabled, shared Moody's views and 
those of the Official Opposition, the federal system is presently 
in shambles, with $548 billion in accumulated debt, just imagine 
what it is going to be like five years from now, when the debt 
will reach and possibly exceed $800 billion. This growth, from 
$548 billion to $800 billion in five years, not counting inflation, 
will cause a serious problem.
<P>
	All this to say that we are ashamed of the only reform measure 
before us and not a very substantial one at that, changing a few 
minor aspects of the Canadian tax system and a few minor 
regulations, when what is needed is a comprehensive reform, if 
Canadians agree to keep this system. But when these changes are 
said to be urgently required by the Canadian tax system, that is 
too much.
<P>
	I will therefore suggest that my colleagues from the Official 
Opposition vote against Bill C-70 because, in our opinion, in 
terms of tax loopholes, redressing inequities in the Canadian tax 
system and the sacrifices big businesses that shirk their fiscal 
duty as well as some extremely wealthy Canadian families are 
asked to make, it does not go far enough. We have been calling 
for much more than that in the past 15 months. We want real 
reform, we want the red book promises regarding tax reform to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11707"> 11707 </A></B>
<P>
be carried out and true tax justice to be felt in this country before 
Quebecers leave it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
previous speaker from the Bloc Quebecois talked about how 
important it is that we overhaul the whole system and how 
ashamed he is that we are only tinkering with the system.
<P>
	It brings to mind some comments I was reading in the paper 
over the last few days about how the Bloc Quebecois feels it can 
overhaul the whole system. However, now we find it is 
retreating. Rather than full blown separatism we now find the 
premier of Quebec saying he does not think that will to fly, water 
down the whole message, talk about something a lot less 
draconian than complete separation. Along with the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois he now thinks perhaps some form of 
economic association would be the way to go. That is exactly 
what they have at this point.
<P>
	In reference to the previous speaker's comments that he 
would like to see a full blown overhaul of the whole tax system, I 
put it in the same context that perhaps the full blown overhaul of 
the political system in Quebec and in Canada would not go very 
far either. Let us hope it would not.
<P>
	That does mean to say this bill is a wonderful piece of stuff. 
Bill C-70 was a year old before it was even introduced in the 
House. This pertains not to the budget introduced six weeks ago 
but to the budget introduced a year and six weeks ago. It has 
taken the bureaucracy a whole year to come up with 200 pages of 
what virtually every Canadian would call unintelligible 
gobbledegook. It is far beyond the comprehension of most 
people.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	This is how we run our tax system today. Not only has the 
Income Tax Act become incomprehensible to Canadians, it has 
become incomprehensible in many ways to accountants. It is 
incomprehensible in much the same way as the Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court was saying last week that the legal system is 
going to collapse under its own weight because it has become so 
complex that even lawyers cannot understand it.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act is going the same way. It has become so 
complex with additions, deletions, amendments and changes 
that even accountants cannot figure out what is happening. We 
then add even greater complexity. Accountants are supposed to 
be able to figure all this out in anticipation of legislation that is 
only being introduced now even though the finance minister 
announced his intentions over a year ago. The income tax people 
have been assessing tax returns this year based on the contents 
of this bill. However, it was only tabled on February 16, 1995. 
People did their tax returns before the legislation was tabled in 
anticipation of trying to do their tax returns based on 
information that did not even exist.
<P>
	How do we expect accounting professionals to do an 
admirable and efficient job of trying to advise their clients on 
how to do their tax returns when they are doing it all on the basis 
of a statement by the Minister of Finance with no legislation to 
back it up and no real assurance that it will pass? We still have to 
vote on it. I hope that is not a perfunctory situation.
<P>
	Parliament holds the public purse. The House gives the 
executive the authority to raise money. It is raising the money 
and now it is asking us if it can. What happens if we say no? 
Perhaps we should say no. I think it is paying lip service to 
Parliament.
<P>
	It is an insult to Parliament that the executive can tax 
Canadians, impose rules, penalties and conditions all on the 
supposition that it will introduce legislation at some future time. 
It will then ask Parliament to vote on it and say it has been 
working on the premise that we were to approve it. What kind of 
way is that to run a country? Perhaps that is indicative of the 
kind of mess we are in because, as everybody knows, we are 
right up to our neck and over our head with a debt of $515 
billion.
<P>
	By the time the government has been in office three years it 
will have added $100 billion to the debt. By that time it will only 
have reduced the deficit by $15 billion, from $40 billion to $25 
billion.
<P>
	This policy of gradualism to deal with a crisis in a fiscal 
situation is not good enough. One hundred billion dollars in 
interest at 8 per cent is $8 billion more that we will transfer to 
lenders each year. That means taxes paid by the rank and file 
Canadians will be transferred to the banks in the United States, 
Germany and Japan, not back to the taxpayers of Canada. They 
will not see it.
<P>
	We are paying the money lenders and they now control the 
way the country is run. That is a desperate and most unfortunate 
situation. The Liberal government seems to be totally incapable 
of grasping the severity of the situation.
<P>
	Reformers have said get the budget balanced, do not worry 
about 200 pages of nickels and dimes and changes in the 
complexity to the Income Tax Act. Let us talk about 
simplification. Let us talk about getting the budget balanced. We 
said that it could be done in three years.
<P>
	The government has a revenue of approximately $120 billion 
a year. In three years it will have three times $120 billion, which 
is $360 billion, and during that time it can only find $15 billion 
to squeak out of there. Is this draconian? Is this really grasping 
the issue and saying let us get the job done now? I doubt it. I do 
not think so, and my colleagues agree with me.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	It is a shame that parliamentarians in charge of running this 
country feel that this policy of gradualism is the only way we 
can address the issue as this great country sinks beneath the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11708"> 11708 </A></B>
<P>
wave of debt. The interest is now the largest cost by far to the 
government, $50 billion a year.
<P>
	When the Liberal government was in power 20 years ago and 
the Prime Minister of the day decided it was time to open the 
gates and let money be spent, flow like water, would Canadians 
have voted for them? Would Canadians vote for them today if 
they realized that $50 billion a year is spent on interest to pay for 
past excesses and the way previous governments have tried to 
buy votes with our own money? Now we are spending $1,500 per 
man, woman, and child just to pay the interest on that debt.
<P>
	If and when we get the budget balanced, for ever dollar in 
taxes we are going to collect from Canadians, we will only be 
able to return 60 cents in services. The rest will go to pay the 
foreign lenders. That is no value for money. You pay a dollar and 
you get 60 cents back on your investment. What kind of deal is 
that? Who goes down to the local store and spends a dollar and 
expects to get 60 cents in value for the money spent?
<P>
	They will tell the government that it is out in the next election, 
because obviously it does not know how to deal with the 
problem. Remember that the members of the government are the 
ones who at the last election were parading around the country 
saying: ``Trust us, we are going to get rid of the GST''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> And we will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> And they will-well, maybe hell will freeze 
over first.
<P>
	They say they are going to get rid of the GST. They said in the 
red book they are going to get rid of the GST. They have not even 
talked about it. It has not even been mentioned. When was the 
last time we heard a member of the Liberal government stand up 
and say they are going to get rid of the GST? It is one of the little 
things they hope will go away. They tore that page out of the red 
book and reduced it by one page. That is one promise they are 
conveniently forgetting to deliver on.
<P>
	Canadians are still mightily upset, because they were 
promised that the GST was going to reduce the debt. Has the 
deficit gone down? Has the debt gone down since the GST was 
introduced?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> No, it has not. Not only has it not been 
reduced, but the debt continues to rise and we continue to sink 
under the weight of interest payments that we cannot afford. The 
government made promises it knows it cannot fulfil, all in the 
hope that Canadians would vote for them. And they did, 
misguidedly, unfortunately, because we now find out that the 
government is not going to live up to the promise of getting rid 
of the GST.
<P>
	At least the Reform Party was honest and open when it said we 
will get rid of the GST once the budget is balanced. Let us get the 
hard stuff done first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jordan:</B> It is pretty safe for the Reform Party to say that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Let us get the difficult job of balancing the 
budget done before we give any tax relief. That was the 
commitment we made. We said we would have tough and 
difficult times and we are going to have to reduce expenditures. 
But while we reduce expenditures, which means we will be 
spending less on Canadians, we did not promise any Canadian 
they would get tax relief. We thought that was unfair. We did say 
that there was light at the end of the tunnel. Let us get the job 
done. If and when the job is done, then we will promise to phase 
out the GST at that time.
<P>
	Colleagues from the other side went across the country saying 
``We will get rid of the GST if you vote for us''. Well, Canadians 
may have voted for them, but Canadians are still waiting. 
Unfortunately, the bad news is that Canadians are going to have 
to wait a long time before this government delivers on that 
promise.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Our credit is going down the drain. Moody's has downgraded 
our rating. Where is it going to end? We are now paying higher 
interest rates because our credit has gone down. That means that 
business has to pay higher interest rates. It means that the 
government has to pay higher interest rates, and that means that 
the Canadian taxpayer will have to pay more taxes.
<P>
	This government cannot manage the affairs of the state. 
Moody's has downgraded our credit rating and that will have 
ramifications for years to come. How will we be able to regain 
our AAA credit rating? How will we be able to stand up as one of 
the great nations of the world?
<P>
	Canada has a fabulous bounty of natural resources. We have 
hydrocarbons, we have prairie wheat fields, we have 
hydroelectricity, we have forests, we have minerals. It is all 
gone, because we went to the bank and put it up as collateral to 
borrow money to buy more votes. Here we are today in one of the 
greatest countries of the world. We have natural resources in 
excess. We have opportunities. We are the light for people 
around the world who can only dream of a country like Canada. 
There are opportunities for anyone who wants to come to this 
country and work hard and prosper. That was the great Canadian 
dream. People could come here with freedom, with hope and 
with opportunity. And they came by the millions. They 
populated this country and they built this country, only to see 
what they had built come down around their ears by the 
mountain of debt that has been foisted upon them by 
governments that care less about Canadians than their own 
self-interests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11709"> 11709 </A></B>
<P>
	The tax system in this 200-page bill has many pages that are 
incomprehensible to many people. Let me speak to a few of 
them.
<P>
	In some ways, while the government has said that it does not 
want to increase taxation, it is casting the net wider so that it can 
catch more taxpayers. Even though tax rates are not going up, 
the government is doing its darnedest to ensure that more people 
pay taxes. That is the essence of Bill C-70.
<P>
	The government talks about cleaning up the provisions for 
debt forgiveness. Debt forgiveness is a situation where a 
business or an individual runs into serious financial problems. 
Let us say that someone owns an apartment building and that the 
value of the building goes down because there are no tenants. 
The rents cannot meet the mortgage payment and the mortgage 
company forecloses. He has lost his investment. But the 
Minister of Finance wants his pound of flesh. That person has 
suffered a major setback. It could apply to someone who has a 
rental property of a house, or it could apply to someone who has 
a business-somebody who has, for one reason or another, had a 
reversal of his financial fortunes and has had to go to the lender 
to ask for a forgiveness of the debt because he can no longer 
afford to pay. And the tax man says ``Before you do that, 
remember that you owe me''.
<P>
	He owes the tax man in a situation where his financial 
fortunes are going down rather than up. I always thought this 
was an income tax. I guess not, because the Minister of Finance 
feels that it is his duty to stick his hand into the pocket of even 
the businessman whose business has failed.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	What about some of the other situations, such as taxation of 
income from foreign affiliates? I know that there have been 
situations where business has been found to try to minimize 
their taxation. However, here we have again an expanding of the 
circumstances into which income from property-which is a 
passive income, as opposed to active or business income-of 
foreign affiliates is not taxable in Canada.
<P>
	We are trying to cast further and further afield. Now we are 
casting abroad to ensure that a nickel earned anywhere in this 
world, not just Canada, does not escape the Minister of Finance 
and his bureaucrats' fingers, which seem to go all the way 
around the world to get that last dime of income tax to pay for 
the debts and the interest and so on, which is killing this country.
<P>
	Then we have the financial institutions and the securities 
dealers. We are now going to change the rules for them too and 
again we are going to cast the net a little bit wider to bring them 
into the taxation end as well.
<P>
	We have always believed that a dollar earned is a dollar 
taxable. We do not disagree with that basic philosophy. But now 
we are finding that a dollar unearned is a dollar taxable. Those 
people who deal with investments on a trading basis are now 
going to have to pay income tax on  the income on the basis that 
the shares had already been sold. But they still have them; they 
have not sold them. Now they are going to have to pay income 
tax as if they had sold them.
<P>
	Here we have a situation where an investment person who is 
managing his money and has it invested and is a trader in 
securities is fully invested, is doing well and his shares are going 
up and he has not sold any because he feels they are good and 
adequate investments. Now he finds that come April 30 he has a 
big tax bill, even though he has not received one cent, because 
the Minister of Finance wants to cast that net wider to catch 
every nickel he can lay his hands on because he is desperate for 
cash. While he is desperate for cash, he feels perfectly at liberty 
to dip his hands into the pockets of anybody he can find. Never 
mind about their cash flow problems; he does not seem to have 
any concern about their cash flow problems.
<P>
	Here is someone who is going to have a tax liability and a debt 
to be paid, plus interest if he does not have the cash, because the 
shares he is holding and continues to hold have gone up in value. 
He has not sold them. He does not have any money. He has not 
realized any gains, and yet he has a tax burden. Do you not think 
that is stretching it a bit too far? I do.
<P>
	How are we going to encourage investment if every time 
somebody makes a dollar, even before they get the dollar the tax 
man has his hand in his pocket saying ``You owe me. You have to 
pay it now. I am going to charge you interest and penalties unless 
I get it now.''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What is the solution?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> The solution is quite obvious: get our fiscal 
house in order so that we can manage our own cash flow and let 
business and other Canadians manage their cash flow and let 
them pay their taxes when they have earned the money. 
Remember, I said a dollar earned is a dollar taxable, but I did not 
say that a dollar unearned is a dollar taxable. That is a major 
quantum leap by this government into a new area of taxation, 
which we cannot condone under any circumstances whatsoever.
<P>
	Not only that, but there is a semblance of offsetting. They are 
saying that if your shares go down they will allow you to do it at 
market value. If you have a loss and a couple of gains, one up 
and one down, you can net them off and pay tax on the 
difference.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	That is okay in an inflationary environment. It is okay during 
a period of economic growth because by and large things tend to 
go up. This government will be the beneficiary of enhanced 
taxation during the good times. We are in an economic growth 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11710"> 11710 </A></B>
<P>
period at this time and no doubt that is why the Minister of 
Finance introduced this particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	Think about it this way. We go into an economic downturn, 
and we surely will as it has never failed before. I think the 
economists would agree that one will come along perhaps 
sooner rather than later, much to our misfortune. At that time 
after all the securities have been taxed at market value we do 
know that the preponderance may be that they will drop in value. 
At that time all of them will be asking for tax refunds which will 
further erode the government's fiscal position at a time when it 
needs the money most.
<P>
	The government should keep its hands off the taxation of 
unearned income. That is the solution. This government should 
not get involved in a situation that increases the volatility of tax 
collection.
<P>
	Any business and any government should know that the most 
important thing is a steady flow of income. This measure is 
going to try to generate additional revenues for the government 
in the short term while the economy is good. I can assure you 
that on the other side of the coin the chickens will come home to 
roost during the economic downturn. That is when this 
government will need the money most.
<P>
	Other little arrangements in the bill are things like funeral 
expenses. Most of us do not pay too much attention to funeral 
arrangements. Tucked away in Bill C-70 is the opportunity to 
put $15,000 cash into a trust fund to pay for funeral expenses on 
one's death.
<P>
	I am sure that the rank and file Canadians have $15,000 in 
their pockets and are just running out to put $15,000 into a trust 
fund now in order to ensure that they get properly buried when 
the time arrives. Not only that, they are going to be able to defer 
the taxes on the income.
<P>
	Unfortunately the average Canadian cannot afford to run out 
today and put $15,000 in a trust fund to ensure a proper burial, 
but the rich people can. Here is another little giveaway to rich 
Canadians by telling them how they can shelter their income. 
Just stick $15,000 in a trust fund to ensure that they get a proper 
and adequate burial. If we think about that amount and the 
interest that is quite a funeral the yuppies are going have on their 
demise.
<P>
	Perhaps I should buy some shares in these funeral home 
groups. They have been doing not too badly. I missed out on it 
before but maybe it would be a good idea to jump back in. 
Maybe they are going to make more money. Maybe $15,000 
funerals are going to be the order of the day rather than 
something more appropriate for those who have less money. You 
never know.
<P>
	Why in this time of difficulty when the Minister of Finance 
says that we need all the money we can get is he allowing rich 
people to tuck aside $15,000 plus interest, plus the income so 
that they never have to worry about it again? This nice little tax 
loophole has popped up from a government that promised to get 
rid of them.
<P>
	The solutions are that we be fair to all Canadians. Surely the 
rule has to be that we are fair, that we ensure a small group of 
people who have ready access to government members, cabinet 
ministers and so on, should not be entitled to some special 
privilege which other Canadians do not have.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	We should be fair to all Canadians. If the average Canadian 
cannot afford to put $15,000 into a trust fund for his funeral 
arrangements, then I do not think rich people should either. If 
they are that rich they can afford a few dollars to get themselves 
buried.
<P>
	There are also the real estate investment trusts. Quite recently 
the real estate market in office buildings has not been doing so 
well. Too many Canadians were talked into these trust funds. We 
ran up the price of office and other buildings in large cities like 
Montreal and Toronto with the expectation that these small time 
investors were going to make big dollars.
<P>
	Lo and behold what did we find? Down it went because the 
market was oversubscribed. The rich people took the money. 
They ran off home and the poor little investor was left with an 
empty building. He lost his shirt so they have now made some 
changes to the real estate investment trust taxation to allow 
these things to be rolled into an RRSP.
<P>
	Here we are again giving an artificial incentive to Canadians 
to buy into real estate. In five or ten years from now when the 
market goes down again they will be left holding the bag while 
some people will walk home with the cash and I do not think 
they will be the small time investors.
<P>
	During the Easter break, a mortgage free, nine storey office 
building in Edmonton was transferred for $1. There were not 
enough tenants to pay the taxes. It was losing $250,000 a year. 
Read it in the Edmonton <I>Journal</I>. It changed hands for $1. It was 
mortgage free. The city tax assessor said it was worth over $2.5 
million. For one dollar. If that had been in a real estate 
investment trust how much of that dollar would the investors 
have received? Nothing.
<P>
	We must be careful when we provide these tax incentives to 
the small and average investors. If we give these artificial 
incentives, we create a demand that should not be there. People 
jump in, the value goes up. We have heard this story so often. It 
is most unfortunate because it is always the small investor who 
loses.
<P>
	There are many rules on the mutual fund reorganization again 
to try to help small investors. However, we must be very careful 
that we do not provide artificial incentives to these people. If 
these investments are lost, we know who they will be pointing 
their fingers at. They will want their taxes back. That will be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11711"> 11711 </A></B>
<P>
further drain on the revenues of this government. That whole 
thing leads to volatility.
<P>
	These are a few concerns I have about the bill. I certainly hope 
this government can see the light of day. The job has to be done 
as far as balancing the budget, and not these small changes, not 
an overhaul the Bloc Quebecois was talking about.
<P>
	We are talking about a real concerted effort by the government 
to recognize that a fiscal crisis requires serious measures to get 
the budget balanced. Once that has been done, we do not have to 
worry about the pressure of increasing more taxes. We do not 
have to worry about the pressure of casting the net wider and 
wider to take in more and more people. We can start to live 
within our means. When the government feels it can dip into 
somebody else's pocket to help its cash flow problem, it makes 
the cash flow problem worse for the person who has to pay more 
taxes. The government does not seem to think about that.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If we are to create jobs we have to create the capital pools in 
the hands of the entrepreneurs who feel the money will not be 
taken away from them arbitrarily and prematurely with too 
much tax. We have to give them the opportunity to make a profit 
so they can feel confident to go out and build the factories, sell 
the products, hire the people and create the jobs which then 
create a whole new number of taxpayers. It is so much better, 
easier and fiscally prudent to have taxpayers than tax 
consumers.
<P>
	I know the Liberal government is proposing this but it hired 
them in the first place. We should have fewer civil servants 
because it reduces the tax consumers. If we can help them to get 
into the private sector, perhaps even to start up their own 
business, surely that has to be beneficial because now they are 
tax producers rather than tax consumers.
<P>
	This past weekend in my riding I was at a trade fair. I was 
talking to a young lady who had been employed in the health 
care services and now has her own little business. She is doing 
quite well and is quite happy. She is now a tax producer rather 
than a tax consumer.
<P>
	I was also talking to a young entrepreneur, not yet 30, on his 
own without any government grant or assistance in any way, 
shape or form. He has created a computer program that he is now 
selling right across the country to large retailers and so on. If 
anyone wants to know about it, it is called ``The Estimator''. It 
does a wonderful job of helping companies estimate large 
projects. He wants to go international with it as soon as he can 
generate the cash flow.
<P>
	Here is a young entrepreneur with no subsidy, no grant, on his 
own, who has developed a product with which he will now be 
generating some export revenues. These are the types of people 
we must encourage rather than drowning them in another 200 
pages of tax rules so incomprehensible that they cannot get their 
minds around them. He now has to employ professionals,  
lawyers, accountants and so on to figure out how he should be 
doing his taxes.
<P>
	Another item in the bill is the amendment to the way people 
may file notices of objections. Large companies now have to 
state specifically the areas in which they are objecting 
concerning their income tax if it is being reassessed.
<P>
	On the public accounts committee we were dealing with what 
became known as the resource allowance boondoggle; $2 billion 
of tax money went down the drain because of this simple little 
loophole and an inefficient civil service. To recap, in 1980 the 
government and an oil company agreed to disagree on the 
assessment of income tax. It said: ``See you in court''. This is a 
typical situation. It was nine years later, in 1989, before it went 
to court and the government lost, much to its chagrin and much 
to its surprise because it thought it had a watertight case. It 
wrote the rules and the law and felt it understood them but it lost. 
That was okay because it would appeal.
<P>
	In 1991 the government appealed and lost. It then asked how 
much money was involved. Believe it or not, it had never once 
figured out how much money was involved. By 1991 it realized 
that it was $1 billion. It was astounded. The government had no 
idea of the amount of money.
<P>
	However, that was okay because it was to take it to the 
Supreme Court and show everyone who could win. The Supreme 
Court said it did not even want to hear about it. That was the end 
of the situation but it had one little twist. The last appeal court 
which pronounced a judgment on the situation ruled so much in 
favour of the oil company that when we asked Revenue Canada 
officials: ``How much more money have we lost?'', they said 
that it could be another $800 million plus interest. We lost $2 
billion because nobody in 1980 asked how much money was at 
risk. Not only that, this situation remained wide open for 10 
years and 40 other oil companies found out about it and adjusted 
their taxes back to 1980 as well.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	It cost the Canadian taxpayers $2 billion because the civil 
service was not up to speed on the situation. With this measure 
that loophole has been closed by the Minister of Finance. It was 
closed largely because of the work done by the public accounts 
committee last year. We do not want to see this happen again. I 
do not want to stand up as a parliamentarian who is accountable 
to the public to say: ``There goes another billion'', but I have had 
to do just that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11712"> 11712 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canada pension plan loses $1 billion every five years. 
The people who are responsible for the CPP went to Treasury 
Board and asked for a new computer system. They said: ``For 
every dollar we spend on a new computer system we will save 
$3''. It sounded like a good investment to me, but Treasury 
Board said that it did not have the money. Therefore we will lose 
$3 and save one.
<P>
	That is how the government is being run. That is the type of 
thing that is going on today. When I tell Canadians about these 
fiascos they shake their heads in disbelief that their taxes are 
being spent in that fashion. What senior bureaucrat, who is 
being paid a large salary, can justify refraining from spending 
one dollar if the evidence is there that he is going to save three?
<P>
	One billion dollars will be lost through overpayments that are 
non-recoverable over a five-year period because they do not 
have a comprehensive and efficient computer system. That 
computer system would originally have cost $250 million. Now 
it is up to $340 million. Maybe by the time it is delivered it will 
be up to a billion and nothing will be saved. However, the point 
is that we are paying these intelligent, knowledgeable and 
educated people whose job it is to manage taxpayers' money to 
the benefit of Canadians. We are so tied up in rules and 
regulations that we cannot make an intelligent decision any 
more. We cannot say to the taxpayer that we are running the 
country efficiently.
<P>
	However, we can produce, after a whole year, another 200 
pages of incomprehensible law by which Canadians must abide. 
That is the problem not only with Bill C-70 but in the way the 
government is not attacking the problem. We need responsible 
government that is going to balance the budget and get the job 
done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my speech 
on the debate by reminding not only members opposite but all 
Canadians about our commitment in the red book to the GST. 
The hon. member from the Reform Party suggested that we on 
this side of the House had forgotten about the commitment 
which was made during the last election. It is clearly stated on 
page 22 of the red book. I would like to quote a couple of 
sentences from it. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fairness, simplicity, and harmonization should be key objectives of the tax 
policies. But instead of introducing fairness and simplicity into the tax system, 
the Conservative government not only imposed the greatest tax increases in 
history, but compounded unfairness and complexity by introducing the GST. 
The GST has undermined public confidence in the fairness of the tax system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The GST has lengthened and deepened the recession. It is costly for small 
business to administer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	We stated that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the first session of the new Parliament, a Liberal government will give 
the all-party Finance Committee of the House of Commons a 12-month 
mandate to consult fully with Canadians and provincial governments and 
report on ways to achieve tax fairness. In particular, the committee will be 
mandated to report on all options for alternatives to the GST.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I recite those paragraphs from the red book because I am one 
member of Parliament who believes passionately that the tax 
system must be reformed. I stated in opposition for four years 
that the GST was not the way to go, that our current tax system, 
both personal and corporate income tax, was complex and 
unfair.
<P>
	My proposal was quite specific. I worked with many chartered 
accountants and tax lawyers and we came up with the proposal 
of the single tax system. I was happy to see today, after almost 
six years of work, that the <I>Globe and Mail</I> has finally 
acknowledged that this may, in fact, be a pathway that we should 
consider taking.
<P>
	The point I want to make tonight has to do with the role of the 
opposition. When I learned that the Reform Party elected close 
to 50 members during the last election, I was pretty excited 
about it in the sense that one cornerstone of its campaign during 
the last election was comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	I can remember the leader of the Reform Party coming to my 
city of Pickering, to CFRB, one of our larger radio stations. He 
took a whole morning on CFRB to say: ``We must reform the tax 
system''. In fact, he went so far as to say that the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood was on the right path with the single 
tax system. He did acknowledge that the Reform Party system 
was called the proportional tax system but he made a 
commitment that he would lead his party in the House of 
Commons and talk about a constructive alternative to the 
current mess. Now a year and a half later very rarely do we hear 
the opposition talk about that very specific proposal its 
members campaigned on in the last election.
<P>
	I raise that because I think the nature and the spirit of the 
House has to do with constructive debate. It is from that action 
and interaction and the agreement and disagreement that we will 
eventually come up with a good, comprehensive tax system for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	What did we hear today? We heard some criticism of this 
leftover portion of the tax act, part of which we inherited from 
the previous government. Not once in the speech of the previous 
member did we hear anything about the constructive alternative 
that the Reform Party talked about during the last election.
<P>
	I talk about this with a tone of frustration because we have a 
spirit and an approach in this party where we debate vigorously 
within. We also welcome the debate that comes to us from across 
the floor. On the issue of taxation, the Reform Party has walked 
the other way.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="11713"> 11713 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Reformers have criticized the existing system but have not 
recommitted themselves to the campaign they ran on during the 
last election. I believe strongly in this issue and wish the Reform 
Party would come back and stir up that tax debate in a much 
more vigorous way.
<P>
	I am concerned about this as well because I now see that in the 
United States all the leading Republicans for the presidential 
campaign are talking about a single tax system or a flat tax 
system. We understand that even some of the leading Democrats 
are looking at a total reform of the tax system.
<P>
	That concerns me because if the United States adopts a single 
tax system before we do we will see a flight of capital and human 
energy and human capital out of this country that we have never 
seen before.
<P>
	That is why I believe this is one of the essential, one of the 
prime debates that we must have in the House. I believe that if 
we would lead the way in total tax reform, comprehensive tax 
reform from the Chamber, we could also reverse the capital flow 
back here.
<P>
	We all know the real challenge for those of us in government 
today is to get a handle on those capital flows. We know and we 
talk about the derivative game within all the chartered banks and 
major financial institutions. They are moving billions of dollars 
all around the world by pushing buttons.
<P>
	One of the ways we could attract large pools of capital is by 
making sure the fundamental tax system is such that it would 
attract those large pools of capital. With a system like that where 
we would have those large pools of capital, that would put 
downward pressure on interest rates.
<P>
	With that downward pressure on interest rates we would have 
capital available to the business men and women who are so 
desperately in need today of that capital in order to start their 
small or medium size business, grow it and expand it.
<P>
	That is how we will get the economy going. The instrument 
we control in the House that can best manage those capital 
flows, that excitement about investment, that possibility for 
increased productivity is based in the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I listened to the Bloc Quebecois finance critic today taking all 
kinds of cheap shots at the fact that we were making little 
amendments to the tax act. Why does the Bloc Quebecois not 
look at the notion of comprehensive tax reform?
<P>
	It is interesting. When we presented this idea to the finance 
committee a few months ago, the finance critic in the committee 
then for the Bloc Quebecois said: ``When we separate this single 
tax system is the type of system we will have for Quebec. Why 
would we begrudge it for the rest of Canada?''
<P>
	I wish the opposition parties, rather than taking cheap shots at 
minor amendments to the tax act, would get their forces together 
and really engage us in a debate on total tax reform.
<P>
	If we do not have total tax reform in the House in about 25 or 
30 months from now I agree with the people who say we will hit 
the wall when it comes to our deficit and debt.
<P>
	The quickest and most constructive way to get out of this is by 
dealing with one of the root problems, comprehensive tax 
reform.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICSERVICE">PUBLIC SERVICE</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to expand on my question of 
February 15 to the President of the Treasury Board concerning 
contracting in the public service.
<P>
	Our second budget was a strong signal that we are determined 
to constrain government spending. One area that has not been 
constrained is contracting.
<P>
	In the five years before we took office the cost of contracting 
rose at twice the rate of the cost of our own personnel; 7.5 per 
cent per year, increasing from $2.9 billion to over $5 billion. 
Under the previous government we were told these figures were 
simply not available. Our government has collected them and 
has made them public so they can be scrutinized.
<P>
	These figures are only part of the story. Public Works and 
Government Services Canada reported it contracted $9.4 billion 
of goods and services for departments, and this does not include 
contracting done directly by the departments. Nor does it 
include the hidden costs of contracting: the preparation, the 
evaluation and awarding, supervision and exercising of quality 
control, the contractors' use of government space and 
equipment or the expertise of government employees provided 
at no cost, or the lost productivity of employees who spend much 
of their professional time dealing with contractors at the 
expense of their own professional work.
<P>
	Since the budget this has become a particularly urgent 
question. Our budget projects reducing the size of the public 
service by 45,000 positions. We have pledged the utmost 
fairness and to reduce involuntary departures to the absolute 
minimum. We will pay $1 billion in early departure incentives to 
employees. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11714"> 11714 </A></B>
<P>
Training and out placement early retirement incentives will cost 
millions of dollars more.
<P>
	The real cost in addition to dollars is the horrendous anxiety 
for employees, turmoil for the organizations and disruption of 
services to Canadians.
<P>
	It is only fair that every effort be made to retain and retrain 
current employees for available work in the public service. We 
cannot justify continuing and expanding the use of outside 
sources to do work that could be done by an employee who 
would otherwise become another one of the 1.5 million 
unemployed.
<P>
	Contracting is an essential tool for good management to meet 
temporary requirements for peak periods of activity, for one 
time projects, for specialized skills temporarily required, to 
provide government services or programs at reduced costs. 
However, Parliament has no assurance that contracting is being 
used only where it is cost effective and appropriate. Nearly half 
the contracting is done with no competition. In one year 17,000 
contracts were awarded to single suppliers without a 
competitive bid.
<P>
	In many cases contractors are working side by side with 
government employees doing the same work but for 
substantially higher fees. While employees are subject to a 
rigorous merit process to ensure the best qualified are 
appointed, contractors face no such screening.
<P>
	There is concern about employees who have been 
compensated to leave the public service and then return often 
within days on contract either as individuals or through a 
company, sometimes while continuing to receive a government 
pension. This double dipping must be controlled.
<P>
	I urge the President of the Treasury Board to accept the 
recommendation of the auditor general to require all 
departments to account in next year's estimates for full time 
equivalent personnel on contract. Only then will Parliament 
know whether the sacrifices being imposed on government 
employees are not rendered pointless by a growing shadow 
public service of contractors. I ask him to ensure in the short 
term that we are not taking jobs, income and hope from people 
only to have someone else take over their work and income 
through the back door.
<P>
	We have people's lives in our hands, their future, their 
families, their homes, their careers, their children's education, 
their prospects for a decent standard of living in their old age. 
That is a serious responsibility and I believe constraining 
contracting is one important element of carrying out that 
responsibility responsibly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you 
know, one of the main responsibilities of the government is to 
use taxpayers' money in the best possible manner. When it 
makes decisions regarding contracts, the government seeks to 
get the best possible value for taxpayers' money and relies on 
good management.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While the government is concerned about taxpayers' money, 
it is also conscious of the fact that it is a major employer. As 
such, it must also be concerned about its employees. We are 
facing a smaller public service and this will translate into 
difficult times for many of our employees.
<P>
	We need only read the newspapers to realize the extent to 
which the President of the Treasury Board is concerned with 
employee well-being. He has been meeting with union officials 
and has said on a number of occasions the government wants to 
treat public servants fairly and humanely during the period of 
downsizing.
<P>
	This means, among other things, living up to our commitment 
to find alternative employment for as many affected 
indeterminate employees as possible. In this regard the Treasury 
Board expects public service departments to examine their 
contracts for services as well as other internal employment 
opportunities with a view to offering these opportunities to 
affected employees. There are currently staffing controls in 
place in the public service.
<P>
	The Treasury Board secretariat in consultation with 
departments and central agencies has been re-examining human 
resources management and employment practices to identify 
what new or modified measures should now be adopted.
<P>
	Again, our goal is to make the best efforts we can to 
reintegrate affected employees. Increased emphasis is being 
given to this very activity.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board has asked the Standing 
Committee on Government Operations to review government 
contracting services. The committee held extensive hearings 
during the fall. It continues to do so and is coming quite close to 
the completion of its task. It will be submitting a report, which 
government awaits with great interest.
<P>
	We will still need to contract out for services. There are 
fluctuations in workloads, for example, during the taxation 
period. There is a need for specialized services for fleet 
management of government vehicles. There is contracting for 
services during emergencies. If a boat is caught on a reef when 
no government coast guard boat is available we would need to 
ask someone for help.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe this approach in the management of government 
affairs is truly fair, both for federal employees and Canadian 
taxpayers.
