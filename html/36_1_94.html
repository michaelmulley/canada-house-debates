<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that veterans of Canada's Merchant Navy who served in 
World War II do not receive the same benefits as veterans of the 
army, navy and airforce, what actions, if any, has the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs taken to make equal benefits available to 
Merchant Navy veterans? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Merchant Navy veterans have had service 
eligibility for all currently available veterans benefits since 
1992. In view of this, no action need be taken by the Minister of 
Veterans Affairs “to make equal benefits available to Merchant 
Navy veterans.”

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this house reiterate the 1989 commitment to eliminating 
child poverty by the year 2000, urge the government to act, and 
strike an all-party special parliamentary committee with the main 
objective of considering Canadian parliamentarians' ability to 
narrow the gap between rich and poor in the new context created 
by the globalization of markets, because of the following facts: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) despite the economic growth of recent years, the gap between 
rich and poor continues to widen; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) the globalization of markets greatly affects governments' 
ability to develop their countries' economies in accordance with 
their priorities; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) globalization and the international agreements that frame 
it, particularly the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) 
as now written, may limit some of governments' powers and 
consequently those of the representatives elected to this House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, first I should inform you that I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the agreement on multilateral investment is being 
negotiated in Paris. Today is the deadline. Fortunately, and it 
is indeed fortunate, it looks like there will not be an 
agreement, but we all know that negotiations will eventually 
resume one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To debate this agreement, the MAI, is to raise the whole 
question of a global economy. 
On two or three occasions, the Bloc Quebecois has asked the 
government to hold a special debate on this issue.  Each time, 
the government has refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean dragged out the topic 
again, so to speak.  But his action highlighted a fundamental 
issue, because a discussion of the MAI, of globalization of the 
economy, raises the issue of the gap between rich and poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of low income earners in Canada jumped from 14.2% of 
the population in 1975 to 17.9% in 1996, twenty years later.  On 
a global scale, the share of total revenue earned by the top 
20%, i.e. the planet's richest individuals, increased from 70% 
to 85% between 1960 and 1991, while the share of the bottom 20%, 
i.e. the planet's poorest inhabitants, dropped from 2.3% to 
1.4%. 
There is a very private club of 358 billionaires—not 
millionaires, but billionaires, as in 1,000 times one million—who 
control an amount equal to 45% of the entire world's revenue, 
while poverty continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two possible attitudes to this alarming situation. 
One would be to sit back, give up, say nothing or, worse still, 
even contribute to the problem.  The other would be to roll up 
one's sleeves and try to do something about the widening gap 
between rich and poor.  In raising this issue and including it 
in its platform, the Bloc Quebecois has opted for the second 
course of action.  The action taken by the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean has shown where he stands; this is the issue he 
raised.   This struggle is one that concerns me as well, and has 
always concerned me since my earliest involvement in social and 
political affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the present Liberal 
government. 
Its recent EI reform has plunged more of our fellow citizens 
into poverty.  Promises, supposedly made for the purpose of 
eliminating child poverty, have never been more than base ploys, 
election slogans, calculated to bring in votes.  Yet the 
Liberals have substantial play in the budget, with a surplus of 
$21 billion above and beyond the 1997 estimates, an amount that 
once again was not forecast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is not good with figures.  The 
government has an extra $4.4 billion and he did not forecast any 
surplus this year.  But, instead of using this money to reduce 
the gap between rich and poor, the government is squandering 
$750 million on submarines and interfering in provincial areas 
of jurisdiction, in particular by investing $2.5 billion on 
millennium scholarships.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see it this afternoon. In spite of all the statements 
made by Liberal members, who claim they want to protect 
hepatitis C victims, the government refuses to allocate money 
for this issue, but it is discussing with professional sports 
tycoons to reach a tax deal with teams whose players make 
millions of dollars. How nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of globalization is not just theory and ideology. 
There are concrete numbers associated with it, and these figures 
are telling. In 1997, world exports totalled US$5,295 billion, 
while commercial services totalled US$1,295 billion. It is a 
daily reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that we oppose the globalization of economies? 
Definitely not. However, discussing globalization does not mean 
talking strictly about money. We must also talk about 
establishing fair and just rules for every country, for the 
people of each of these countries. We must talk about social and 
human rights. These are the issues that we must talk about when 
discussing globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is the latest attempt to put together, in an 
international agreement, multilateral regulations in the three 
key foreign investment sectors, namely the protection of 
investments, the liberalization of investments and the dispute 
resolution mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is a good example of the lack of powers of democratic 
institutions, because the federal government opted to negotiate 
behind closed doors, instead of holding an open debate in this 
Parliament and involving the Canadian people. It could have held 
this controversial debate in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are condemning. We are asking the government to 
stop ignoring the public's will, to listen to the various 
groups, particularly the poor, and to listen to parliamentarians 
from all parties. It is with this in mind that we are making 
this demand, and that we will oppose the signing by Canada of 
any treaty dealing with multilateral agreements on investment, 
of any treaty that would not include provisions on social and 
labour laws, the environment and cultural exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want a standardized, Americanized world, in which the 
only culture would be the American culture, and in which Dallas 
and its imitations would be the only television series available. 
This is not what they want in Quebec or in Canada, I have no 
doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also opposed to the provision in this agreement that 
protects investments for 20 years.  Today the elected president 
of Burma, who is in exile, is visiting Ottawa.  That country 
without any democratic rule, dominated by a military junta, 
could sign despicable agreements with major companies that would 
be protected for 20 years.  Should democracy return some day to 
Burma, and I am sure it will, the government elected by and for 
the people will be forced to honour these agreements.  That is 
not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk of the danger of parliamentarians and democratic 
institutions losing political power this is what we are talking 
about.  We will also oppose having such agreements signed within 
the OECD, the club of the well-to-do. 
We cannot let the rich determine the living conditions of all 
peoples in all countries in the world.  Such agreements must 
include all countries and be discussed within the World Trade 
Organization.  This is the place for such discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that globalization leaves no room for the small 
countries.  The opposite is true.  We see economic borders 
dissolving and a number of countries emerging each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new context, Quebec's sovereignty expresses nothing more 
than the political, economic and legal ability of the people of 
Quebec to decide the conditions of their interdependence with 
other peoples. 
If it is true that small countries are impotent against 
globalization, how do we explain the fact that countries with 
populations of between 4 and 15 million inhabitants, such as 
Austria, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and 
Switzerland, outperform Canada in socio-economic terms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are eloquent examples of how, in these times of rampant 
globalization, small countries can make different choices 
according to their needs, the needs of their population, how 
they can have an important public sector, progressive social 
policies, and yet have lower unemployment than Canada and a 
higher gross domestic product. That is part of reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not, therefore, one of being against 
globalization, but rather of defining a framework which will 
forge links that will unite the countries of this planet in a 
fair and just manner. 
The question for all peoples of the world is to determine how 
they can participate fully in major economic entities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the European Economic Community, and France of 
course, according to François Mitterrand, to be part of a whole 
one must first and foremost be oneself.  That is what the 
sovereignists want.  That is what the Quebec sovereignist 
project is all about and that is how the sovereignists address 
the question of globalization.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the leader of the Bloc's comments regarding the MAI 
and the potential consequences for Canada in terms of our 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that we already have a NAFTA investment agreement that 
governs something like 70% of our foreign investment in Canada 
which comes from the United States, and that NAFTA also contains 
a cultural exemption but the right of the United States to 
retaliate in kind for any measure that we take on the cultural 
side, would the member not agree that the main threat to our 
culture seems to be coming from the United States where we have 
an agreement that is going to stay in place regardless of whether 
we negotiate the MAI? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would the leader of the Bloc protect culture?  How would he 
see the MAI affecting culture considering we already have NAFTA 
and the main forces that might threaten our culture come from the 
United States where we have an agreement that is going to be in 
place for some time?  Would he roll back NAFTA in the areas of 
culture exemption? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question surprises me somewhat, because I believe the danger to 
be just the opposite, that such a multilateral agreement on 
investment, commonly called MAI, could impact upon NAFTA and the 
World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rich countries club, or in other words the OECD, could then 
impose this agreement on a number of countries bilaterally, thus 
ensuring that the WTO would be governed by such an agreement and 
NAFTA forced to follow suit.  That is where the danger lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my colleague that, in the debates on free trade 
then on NAFTA and even in the last round of WTO negotiations, it 
was Quebec, with the support of many of the European countries, 
which pushed for the necessity of cultural exemptions, of 
protecting cultural identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This inclusion in NAFTA was a gain, but still not enough of one. 
We need only think back to the debate, strange, paradoxical, 
even unfortunate for Canada I would say, around the purchase by 
American interests of Ginn Publishing.  Not one “Canadian” party 
here in this House spoke out against the fact that one of 
Canada's major publishing houses was going into American hands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
proud to have the opportunity to speak today on this very 
important motion. We need to reduce the gap between the rich and 
the poor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about reducing the gap between the rich and the 
poor, the remark made by the hon. member is very true.  The 
governments are not very serious about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, all we have to do is look at my province of Nova 
Scotia.  We see governments by way of loan forgiveness giving $47 
million to large corporations like Michelin.  On the other hand I 
am personally dealing with a complaint from an aboriginal family 
living in a home that is worth less than $20,000 who are in 
danger of being evicted by CMHC on mortgage foreclosure.  It 
demonstrates very clearly the difference and gap between the rich 
and the poor and where we as a government put our priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not have a question but more of a commentary. I want 
to commend my hon. colleague for bringing forth this motion. It 
is a very important motion, one which deserves worthy treatment 
by all members.

<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week, 
in an attempt to question the power of parliamentarians, I took 
my chair out of the House in order to trigger a public debate on 
the paradox that often emerges from the new economic context of 
globalization. This paradox is the gap between the rich and the 
poor that continues to widen despite the economic growth of 
recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wanted to urge people in general to reflect on what is at 
stake in the new economic reality that is the globalization of 
markets. 
This will hopefully help to mobilize the people and force us, 
parliamentarians of all stripes, to come up with concrete 
measures to ensure everyone's well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, we saw how people can mobilize and come together on an 
issue. The Multilateral Investment Agreement was supposed to be 
ratified today by the 29 member states of the OECD. But after 
the citizens of several signatory states mobilized against it, 
the agreement is now being questioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement, considered by some to be the constitution of the 
world economy, is only one aspect of the globalization 
phenomenon. 
When people mobilize, agreements can be thrown back into 
question even though their acceptance had been presented as 
being imperative and inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My action was very much inspired by this mobilization campaign, 
to show people that decisions affecting them directly are being 
made without meaningful consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to bring people to take an interest in these decisions. 
My action obviously satisfied a need because people mobilized in 
great numbers. Today, I come to the House with the support of 
hundreds of people and organizations of all kinds from 
everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people want concrete solutions because they responded 
favourably to the message I wanted to send through my action, 
which, all in all, was provocative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people are concerned about the growing gap between rich 
and poor in our society, particularly in the context of 
globalization.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share their feeling. That is why I will consult with those who 
are interested in this debate so that people can express their 
concerns and suggest adequate solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These consultations, whether they take the form of focus groups, 
informal coffee meetings or any other form, will have a dual 
objective: first, to foster a broad public debate and, second, 
to give us, as parliamentarians, effective tools to help us 
define the parameters for this new debate in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, apart from these consultations, people will 
mobilize to sign the petition I am circulating, asking that a 
parliamentary committee be struck to examine our ability, as 
parliamentarians, to reduce the gap between rich and poor in the 
new context of market globalization and to suggest concrete 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that I have no doubt as to the people's approval. As 
I was saying earlier, the support I have received shows that a 
large percentage of the population believes in the urgency of 
such a debate. One of my objectives is to bring this petition to 
the House with 50,000 signatures on it, as a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just mentioned two concrete objectives: involving people in 
this debate and making sure parliamentarians can find ways to 
solve the problem. 
This being said, for parliamentarians to find solutions, they 
have to know the kind of issues the committee will be called 
upon to review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, I suggest the committee should be asked to examine 
not only the impact of globalization, especially on 
parliamentarians' decisions, but also how to reconcile economic 
growth and social development in the context of international 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To learn more about international agencies, it might be helpful 
to examine their democratic legitimacy and understand fully the 
consequences of their various decisions on the manoeuvering room 
we, as parliamentarians, are trying to establish at the national 
level. 
Is there a need to reform these agencies, as several have 
suggested, in a way we would approve? We must look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be useful to further explore current social 
policies adopted by parliamentarians in other countries in the 
context of globalization and examine the inclusion of so-called 
social clauses in various international and multilateral 
agreements. I suggest we really have to take a serious look at 
this for the MAI. How could we establish a democratic and 
effective counterbalance that could be used to promote, protect 
and maintain social benefits in nation-states? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the world, suggestions and solutions are being put 
forward to counter the negative consequences of globalization, 
especially to adapt it to mankind instead of forcing mankind to 
adapt to it. 
In his last budget, the finance minister said that basic 
problems required basic solutions. I say that international 
problems require international solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guarantee that this committee would allow us, as members of 
Parliament, to be forward-thinking at the international level and 
find concrete solutions to the issue of the lack of power of our 
respective seats in the context of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To underscore and highlight the significance of this motion, I 
move the following amendment, seconded by the member for 
Richelieu: 
<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding the words “without delay” 
after the word “act”.

serious about the issue of the gap between rich and poor, I ask

view, consent was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No. When I first put the question, the

again, and I can certainly do that. As members know, such a 
request is frequently made in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, it is 
very clear, and perhaps the blues will show it equally clearly, 
that when you first asked for the unanimous consent of the

you a question, but that was after you received the unanimous 
consent of the House.

unanimous consent to make the matter votable?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is disagreeing but I 
think it was clear.  I asked the question.  The parliamentary 
secretary asked a question in response. I then answered the 
question for the parliamentary secretary and asked the question 
so that the House got the question clearly.  He was asking for 
clarification of my question about whether or not it was votable 
and I answered the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat that, when you 
asked for consent, you obtained it.  The parliamentary 
secretary, who was near the curtains, moved forward after 
consent was given.  He asked whether consent was on the 
amendment or the motion itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You obtained this consent, Mr. Speaker.  If you decide to change 
the House's decision, to change the rules in mid-stream, it is a 
very sad comment on the kind of debate that is possible among 
parliamentarians on the issue of globalization. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think what is clear is that at 
the first instance when you first put the question, my colleague 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury 
Board said no.  Then when you rose and asked the second question, 
I asked for clarification because I did not hear the translation 
in time.  I asked if this was a request for unanimous consent to 
have the non-votable motion become votable and at that point I 
thanked you for that clarification.  You asked the question and I 
said no. This is a non-votable item and it will remain so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, here is another version of the 
facts.  You are saying:“We said yes”.  No one heard the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board. 
Earlier it was yes.  Now we are getting a new version to the 
effect that someone said “no”.  Maybe somebody thought “no”.  We 
are here to think, I hope, but also to speak.  So now there is a 
second version. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the decision to give unanimous consent will be honoured. 
If that does not happen, it will be, as my colleague put it, a 
very sad comment on debates in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I sincerely and respectfully 
suggest you review the tapes and the blues to confirm that you 
had unanimous consent, although that was later denied, but you 
had it. And it is not normal for you to keep asking for consent 
until you no longer have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the President of Treasury Board, who 
was not in his own seat, has just admitted it.  He did not speak 
but shook his head no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has just admitted that he did not speak but shook his head, 
and I agree that one ought to use one's head before speaking, 
but when the time comes for a person to indicate consent or 
non-consent, that must be done by speaking, not nodding. He has 
just said that is what he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. That is the end of the 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that what we have here is a case where there was 
no unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> There was consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, there is no consent until the Chair 
indicates that the matter is settled.  I did not so rule. I did 
not give such an indication because I did not receive clear 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the parliamentary secretary asked his question and I 
responded, he indicated that he did not give his consent, and 
that is the end of the matter. The debate is closed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean. He had the 
guts to stomp out of the House with his chair to stir up a 
discussion over the issue of poverty in Canada. There are 
children who go to school on an empty stomach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate him. I hope the media will change their 
coverage on this issue, stop dealing with the chair incident and 
start talking about the poor in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question for my colleague. Now that we have had free 
trade and NAFTA in Canada for such a long time, and now that we 
are leaning toward signing the MAI, does he not think we have 
more food banks than ever in Canada? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the Royal Bank I am talking about, but food banks 
families have to go to because they do not have any money left 
to feed themselves. The EI fund has billions of dollars in 
surplus, but some Canadians are starving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague for Lac-Saint-Jean respond to this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I am very pleased to see that I have support coming not 
only from the Bloc Quebecois but also from other parties. I hope 
that my colleagues opposite and from all parties will seize on 
this issue. Furthermore, if they choose not to do so right now, 
I think time will prove me right and we will eventually be 
forced to take a very serious look at this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst 
asked me earlier, essentially, I left with my seat to elicit a 
broad societal debate. I never said I had all the answers. I 
plan to focus my efforts on getting the point across to the 
public and to parliamentarians alike that a debate must be held 
on this matter, that is, the consequences of globalization on 
political power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we find that globalization does limit the power of 
parliamentarians at home and abroad, there will be an urgent 
need for the public to look into the matter and understand what 
is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said repeatedly this week that any loss of political 
power means a so-called loss of democracy. This therefore 
concerns us all, the political parties represented in this House 
as well as the public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not claim to have all the answers, far from it. However, it 
seems to me that there should be a debate in which 
parliamentarians and the public would share their views and 
there is none. This is of greater concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we can look at the immediate consequences of 
globalization, and there are many. 
But what will be required, and sooner than later, is a 
comprehensive debate. Then, we will be able to deal with 
specifics, the consequences, the stakes and, more importantly, 
possible solutions we can explore to ensure a framework is in 
place for globalization to benefit the citizens of this and 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the challenge facing us. As I said, this is a complex 
message and the debate is just beginning. It will probably be a 
10-year process. That is why it must start as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that, as the public gets further involved in these 
issues, parliamentarians in this House will pay close attention 
and make sure that more concrete solutions are found.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make 
a comment about my young friend from Lac-Saint-Jean.  I am very 
glad that he brought his chair back and will continue to sit in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the House when he expressed frustration and left with 
his chair.  I saw the frustration of someone in his twenties 
whose idealism has not yet been tempered with the reality of age 
as it goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just say to him that he should never give up his 
idealism.  He should always keep it.  As the years go on he will 
find that it is always tempered with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frustrating to watch poverty in the world, seemingly on 
the increase.  I do not think that child poverty can be isolated 
from poverty in general. 
It seems to me that if there is family poverty, then there is 
child poverty.  The two go hand in hand.  There is no magic 
formula for simply eliminating child poverty with the stroke of a 
pen or a chequebook.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also comment that some of the contents of this debate 
tend to argue against some of the very elements that are helping 
child poverty and helping the economies around the world.  In 
order to get a perspective on that one has to look at history and 
the human condition that existed before countries began to 
interact with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in the fifties that Canada began to interact in an 
official way with other countries with which it had been trading 
in the past, mostly under the colonial system that we were under 
at that time.  Investment agreements began to be made in the 
1950s.  Up to now, as I understand it, there are 54 bilateral 
investment agreements that exist between Canada and other 
countries.  Around the world there are 1,600 bilateral investment 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the multilateral agreement on investment is very 
simple.  It is to allow more countries to sing out of the same 
hymn book.  Ultimately our hope is that once that framework is 
established the World Trade Organization, which represents 132 
countries, will see the wisdom of operating under a common 
framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does all right because our biggest trading partner is the 
United States.  We understand each other's society and so on and 
we try to treat each other, even though there are glitches from 
time to time, with some fairness.  That trade can go on without 
an MAI and without more agreements, but as other countries in the 
world, which are impoverished, want to raise their standard 
of living and want to put an end to their poverty, certainly we 
find that having some common rules among those countries will 
help them and will help us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also should point out that I think we all recognize that 
closed governments do not do well in the global village.  Closed 
governments are failing very badly.  I give the example of North 
Korea, a totalitarian communist government that has put walls 
around itself and almost chooses not to communicate at all with 
the rest of the world.  Starvation and impoverishment there are 
incredible, to the extent that South Korea, its arch enemy, is 
now sending aid to North Korea to try in its own way to help 
North Korea through these crisis times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, on the other hand, that open governments 
overall are gaining.  They are gaining in wealth and in economic 
base.  Therefore they have a better opportunity to look after the 
impoverishment which exists to some extent in every country in the 
world.  It exists in Canada, in France, in Europe, in Asia and so 
on.  We recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not simply to throw cash at the problem.  The 
answer is to provide a common denominator and an economic 
foundation so that countries can prosper and do well.  That is 
why we seek these agreements, so that the rules can be 
established and so that a Canadian company is not afraid to 
invest in another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring in the example of what happened with the Nova Scotia 
firm that went into partnership with Aeroflot and the Russian 
government in the building of a hotel last year.  Conflict arose 
because there is no MAI with Russia.  There is no bilateral 
agreement with Russia.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result those people were left in the jungle on their own 
and they ran into serious trouble.  That is a terrible detriment 
to a company or a potential investor who wants to go into another 
country and establish themselves there and in so doing help the 
economy, help jobs and help the growth of that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This interaction is a positive thing for all of us. 
Globalization represents empowerment for all countries if they 
will simply take it on.  I know there are fears.  There are fears 
expressed about cultural intrusion and so on.  Every country that 
has been negotiating in the MAI has its own set of reservations 
and its own set of concerns.  There is nothing wrong with that. 
There is nothing wrong with wanting to keep the cultural debate 
right out of the agreement.  We have said that.  We have made it 
very clear. We have said that if some other countries insist on 
having it in their agreement we will have a country specific 
reservation.  That is a bottom line.  There is no big deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the 40 or so years that these agreements have been made no 
company has come in and taken over the policies of this country. 
No multilateral organization has overwhelmed Canada.  If anyone 
wants to see an example of industry and large organizations 
having an influence on the policy of a country, we only have to 
go to Washington and see how that government works. The dollar a 
year men in with companies actually construct policy that favours 
those companies.  That does not happen in Canada.  It has not 
happened and it will not happen in Canada as long as the people 
of this country see that it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our exports have increased tremendously since we started having 
agreements. As a result jobs have increased as well.  We want 
that to continue but we want it to continue for us which is 
selfish but generous.  We want it to continue for every country 
in the world, all the people in the world and we are most anxious 
to use all the tools we have to get rid of poverty, child poverty 
particularly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about my illusions and said that, as I will get older I 
should lose my illusions. Is that his answer? Does this mean I

from now? I do not think so. I feel concerned about the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that some valuable debates must take place now. There are 
new ways to hold such public debates. I should not give up 
because of what was done in the past and say “we have no 
choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I reacted to. I reacted primarily to this attitude 
that makes some say “let us face it, we have no choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that if the public decides to mobilize, if it believes

change things.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to talk specifically about the Multilateral 
Agreement on Investment, but rather about the way this was done, 
secretly. Ultimately, they were rewriting the world economic 
constitution, but no one, or almost no one, knew about it, 
certainly not the people or me, a parliamentarian, a 
representative of the people. We were informed later about the 
content of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, when such a vast society debate has to happen, the 
people must be informed. And even though the debate is complex

not misinterpret what I said.  I told him not to give up his 
idealism in any way but over time recognize that politics is the 
art of the possible and what we try to do is head down a track or 
a road, and it is necessary to fight very often to get down that 
road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad my hon. friend accepts the principle of globalization. 
Representatives from the World Bank were in committee today. One 
of the things they said had to do with rural development and 
poverty which is a very serious concern of the World Bank. They 
recommended further worldwide liberalization of agricultural 
trade, a necessary condition for ensuring that countries can rely 
on international markets, rather than self-sufficiency policies, 
for their food security.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the great concerns of Canadians in this whole thing has 
been the secrecy of this agreement and the kind of things that 
have been going on behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not hear about this until last year during the election 
campaign. It has been going on for several years.  What is in 
this agreement that is so secret that it has not been publicly 
disclosed to the Canadian people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the process for negotiating 
the MAI had its roots in the processes for negotiating all the 
bilateral trade agreements that have gone on for years. The 
information was available through OECD from the very beginning 
but no reporters picked up on it, nobody ever looked at it until 
one draft appeared on the Internet last May. A draft is not a 
text, but it was interpreted as a text and what was not included 
at that time was a recognition that there was a list of 
reservations that not only Canada but every country in the OECD 
has included.  Those are the bases for negotiation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see it has tied the issue of child poverty into the whole 
aspect of globalization and the multilateral agreement on 
investment and I want to deal with those issues in their own 
right.  But it seems there is a problem right from the very

related.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is clear the Liberals are mishandling the economy. 
Poverty still exists in Canada where it should not exist.  I also 
believe that child poverty cannot be disassociated from poverty 
in families.  If we correct that with family members having the 
opportunity to work and have well paying jobs it will go a long 
way to correct that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe the Liberal government is mishandling the MAI. 
Today the minister is over at the OECD in Paris putting the deep 
six on the MAI at the same time as the Prime Minister is in Cuba 
talking about signing an investment agreement with Cuba of all 
places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuba expropriated all Canadian and foreign investment in Cuba 
and the Prime Minister is now talking about signing an investment 
agreement with that country and putting a deep freeze on the 
multilateral agreement on investment which would help a lot of 
Canadian companies and therefore a lot of Canadian workers and 
their children because there are a lot of high paying jobs.  It 
seems to me there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary Centre will be speaking more on the 
aspect of child poverty and what can be done but I want to raise 
a couple of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes it is important for all families in 
Canada to have the opportunity to work in meaningful and well 
paying jobs.  We think that through proper government this can 
happen.  It is absolutely deplorable to still have Canadians 
paying income tax in Canada when they are making $15,000 a year. 
That is simply not acceptable.  There are 2.6 million Canadians 
in that category we believe should be taken off the tax rolls 
altogether and be given an opportunity to keep some of their hard 
earned money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise the question of the role of government.  The NDP 
and the Bloc would have us believe the role of government is 
interventionist.  We have seen that from the Liberal Party in the 
past.  For about the last 30 years we have had a very 
interventionist government in Canada, social engineering.  Some 
would have us withdraw and form an isolationism in the world. 
Some would have us put up big tariff barriers again that existed 
from Sir John A. Macdonald's time. However, I do not believe that 
would serve Canada very well.  I think we can look at the example 
of Atlantic Canada to point out that it has not worked very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to Confederation Canada had several areas of the country 
that were doing pretty well.  Atlantic Canada had a very healthy 
trade relationship with the New England states.  It was in close 
proximity with an existing natural trade corridor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confederation came along and Sir John A. Macdonald instituted 
his national policy of high tariffs meant to direct the flow of 
goods and services east and west.  What did that do to Atlantic 
Canada?  It became dependent over a period of time on things like 
unemployment insurance, regional development grants and welfare 
because the central part of the country was draining it. The 
barriers meant that it could not trade effectively with New 
England states any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it has been demonstrated worldwide that barriers do not 
work.  Any country that has even unilaterally dismantled barriers 
to trade has benefited.  Therefore we need to foster a better 
environment for our Canadian companies to do well.  By doing 
that, workers in those Canadian companies are going to do well 
and have high paying jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our committee did a study on small and medium size enterprises 
in international trade.  We heard testimony that the environment 
for business in Canada to do well is not good at all. Witnesses 
said we are not internationally competitive because we are paying 
very high taxes.  Canadians still have the highest tax rates in 
the G-8.  We have a lot of regulation that is hard to overcome. 
We heard from one company that said it was easier to do business 
by moving out of its home base in Ontario to Illinois and then 
ship its product back into Canada.  This was easier than shipping 
across Canadian provincial borders.  That simply is not good 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe because we have had interventionist governments we 
have $600 billion worth of debt, debt that has made the Canadian 
taxpayer have to pay one-third of every tax dollar to Ottawa just 
to pay the interest on the debt.  It is just like digging a hole 
in the ground.  These types of governments that have intervened 
in the economy and in our personal lives have caused this to 
happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just have to think of all the companies that have been 
privatized in the last few years that were on the government 
gravy train needing big subsidies every year to exist.  CN Rail 
is now making a profit.  Air Canada is now making a profit. 
Petro-Canada is now making a profit.  All these companies were 
draining Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian airports are functioning on their own and doing well. A 
small airport in Peace River, which was turned over to the 
community in the last two years, is doing very well and is 
actually making money.  Prior to that it took $400,000 of 
taxpayers' money every year to keep that airport in business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interventionist government, which brought us the national 
energy program and FIRA, the Foreign Investment Review Agency 
that discouraged investment in Canada, intervened not only in the 
economy, in our personal lives, but in provincial areas of 
jurisdiction such as education, housing, tourism and job 
training, causing duplication in governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that with such a great country we have areas in Canada 
where there are unemployment rates of 60%?  It simply is not 
acceptable.  It is the debt load given to us by interventionist 
governments which have caused these rates.  As I said, 2.65 
million people earn less than $15,000 a year and still have to 
pay taxes to the federal government.  It is not acceptable.  We 
have to get our house in order first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social engineering of the past has given us employment 
insurance.  Some 25 different regions of the country qualify for 
employment insurance because of different criteria.  For the last 
30 years employment insurance has had 5% higher rates than those 
of the United States year in and year out.  We can chart it.  We 
can plot it.  They have gone up and down but are 5% higher than 
those of the United States.  Why is that?  It is because of 
interventionist governments doing social engineering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the aspect of the motion today which deals 
with globalization in the MAI.  My party and I believe that 
Canada needs a liberalized trade and investment regime if it is 
to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in 1998 the amount of Canadian investment 
outside Canada has exceeded the amount of foreign investment in 
Canada.  It is a trend that has been happening for the last four 
or five years.  This says something about a new found confidence 
of Canadians seeking the big market out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 30 million people who think the Canadian market is too 
small and want to take advantage of the world.  We have many 
things to offer, so if we are to trade with these countries, as 
we are, in many cases it will require Canadians to make 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which multinational Canadian companies are out there investing? 
They are companies that are home grown.  They have Canadians 
working for them here at home.  There are investments from the 
pension funds of Canadians in those companies.  They are publicly 
traded.  We have mutual funds.  We have RRSPs invested in these 
Canadian companies.  It is in our interests that they do well. 
They need the protection of some base rules of investment and we 
can do it more than one way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI should be allowed to die.  The trade minister seems to 
be allowing it to be put into a deep coma at the OECD.  We can 
sign bilateral investment agreements to achieve the same end.  We 
have done quite a bit of that in the past.  We also have an 
investment agreement with the United States and Mexico in NAFTA 
that governs 70% of investment in Canada already.  That will not 
change whether or not we have the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can continue down that road, but there are something like 
1,600 investment agreements worldwide.  It would be a simpler 
process to have one that we could all look at and say here are 
the simple rules for investment in the same way as we have had 
rules for trade in goods for 50 years.  If we do not want to do 
that we do not have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Jean in a symbolic act the other day 
took his seat from the House of Commons and got a little 
publicity from it.  It says a little more than that.  It says 
something about a party that wants to withdraw from Canada and to 
put borders around Canada, to have an isolation policy.  That 
simply does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of change is happening in Canada.  All of us have 
difficulty with change, but we cannot freeze a certain section of 
our lives and say we want to stay at 30 years old.  Change is 
something that happens to us all the time.  Trade and investment 
are like riding a bike.  If we stop peddling we will fall off and 
I do not think we will be served very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support the motion although there are certain aspects 
concerning child poverty that are important to deal with through 
well paying jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member.  It is 
good to see that he has his own private cheering section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's speech demonstrated a very important difference 
between his party and this side of the House that Canadians 
should recognize.  He talked about the Canadian taxpayer and the 
need to reduce the burden of taxation, something the Minister of 
Finance has been doing in his last few budgets and continues to 
do.  We see the Reform Party's inability to make the distinction 
between taxpayers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  I hear members opposite.  They do not 
realize that literally millions of Canadians are not taxpayers 
and are in need of assistance just as much as somebody who is a 
taxpayer.  What about someone who is unable to get a job or to 
find work?  I know they believe every Canadian can get a job if 
they want one, but that ignores Canadians with disabilities and 
those who are unable to enter the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that members of the Reform Party do not 
encompass the broad range of Canadians.  They select who they 
want to help.  They focus on whom they want to help, but they 
will not reach out to the full Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the basic premise of what the hon. member said in his 
speech.  He ignores large segments of Canadian society and only 
wants to deal with individuals who fit their mould of being 
appropriate for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was a very 
interesting intervention.  The member correctly observed that 
there were big differences between the Reform Party and the 
governing Liberals.  I am glad he finally got that point. It is 
pretty clear that there are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I was making is that we do not believe intervening in 
the economy is the right role for government.  We believe, 
however, that there is a proper role for government.  We think it 
is fostering an environment for Canadian businesses, their 
workers and their shareholders to do well here and to do well 
internationally.  We also believe there is a role for government 
to be the shepherd of environmental programs and competition laws 
by ensuring they are looked after for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to taxation the member raised an interesting 
point.  He said that we did not recognize the difference between 
taxpayers and Canadians.  I suggest Canadians at tax time do not 
see much difference either.  They are taxpayers and they are 
paying very heavily.  They want some tax relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I am disappointed in the direction the debate is going and 
in the way Reform members are diverting the debate. Liberals are 
jumping on the bandwagon and saying: “We are the best in the 
world; we are beautiful, good and nice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean tried to start a non partisan 
debate on a world issue that is very real and is simply 
redefined in our motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member started his speech by saying: “We do not know 
exactly what Bloc members want”. We can therefore deduce that he 
does not agree with what we want, but he does not know what we 
want. 
If we listen to his speech, we realize it is rather 
inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, I will explain to him what we want and I will ask him 
if he agrees. The motion is relatively simple: That this House 
reiterate the 1989 commitment to eliminating child poverty by 
the year 2000 and urge the government to act by quickly striking 
an all-party Special Parliamentary Committee that will consider 
the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals had made this commitment in their first red book 
and have said they were in favour of it. What we want is to 
eliminate poverty. We want to strike a parliamentary committee 
to study this matter. I ask my Reform colleague if he agrees 
with this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is 
any disagreement.  We want to get rid of poverty in Canada but we 
have different methods of doing it.

of power by government intervening in the economy is the proper 
way.  We have seen 30 years of such intervention and I believe it 
has failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment is still running almost in double digits and has 
been for a long time.  The Canada pension plan needs a massive 
infusion of taxpayers' money or a 72% increase to keep it viable. 
Health care is in trouble.  The federal government has cut back 
payments in health care by $6 billion to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the government should not intervene so much in the economy 
and the business sector and let business do what it does best, 
that is create well paying jobs.  We have to be competitive 
internationally.  On the issue of globalization, certainly that 
is happening, but I do not think it is something we can stop or 
would want to stop.  It is a smaller world and we have to take 
advantage of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the NDP supports the motion that has been brought forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois.  We welcome the attention that is being paid to 
the issue of globalization and give credit to the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean for provoking this debate.  However, contrary to 
what the member said when he was on his feet, the debate is not 
just starting but has been going on for some time.  I would 
suggest that it has been going on since about 1987 in the lead-up 
to the free trade agreement between Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite happy to hear what the member has to say.  I agree 
with him that there is a new consciousness among young people, 
among those of his own generation, about the extent to which 
forces are being gathered together within this globalization 
model.  They are very much leading to a future that not many 
young people want to contemplate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a future that has within it a low wage economy for a great 
many young Canadians.  I have seen it in my own work on the MAI 
over the past several months going across the country and 
speaking on campuses and in other places.  I have spoken to 
students about the multilateral agreement on investment and how 
it is the latest stage in a globalization model that the NDP 
rejects and that I want young people to reject.  There is a new 
awareness on the part of young people at the university level and 
elsewhere about how wary they should be of this globalization 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Jean said that he hoped time would see 
him right on this motion even if everybody did not agree with him 
at the moment.  Without malice I say that I have felt this way 
for a while.  I remember making a similar speech in 1987 when I 
said that time would see us right on the downside of free trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are reaching one of those times—and I am not 
speaking of the member now—when people who otherwise were very 
supportive of this model as it emerged in the context of the FTA, 
the NAFTA and the WTO are now beginning to have second thoughts 
about the wisdom of this particular model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These second thoughts are not just coming from the left, where 
people had not second thoughts but first thoughts about the 
downsides of globalization, they are coming from people on the 
right and in the centre who are asking themselves whether the 
effects of an unfettered global marketplace are not more than 
they bargained for when they first began to promote this model of 
globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to see the motion here today.  I noticed that it 
begins by referring to a motion passed in this House in 1989. 
That motion was moved by my former leader, the member from 
Oshawa, Ed Broadbent, at the time of his departure from this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the fact that this motion is referred to at the 
beginning of the Bloc motion points out something that many 
people are aware of, that is, that there has been a certain 
affinity between the NDP, and before that the CCF, and the social 
democratic tradition in Quebec which is represented by the Bloc 
Quebecois, which in the past was represented not just exclusively 
by the Bloc Quebecois from Quebec but by Quebeckers in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that Quebec has had a tremendous impact on the 
kind of country Canada has become over the years.  A large part of 
our social democratic nature has come from Quebec.  In 
English-speaking Canada it has come largely from the tradition 
that the NDP represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two things acting together, often synthesized by a Liberal 
government at the federal level, have led to the kind of country 
which is now being dismantled by the very globalization model the 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean refers to, which we in the NDP have 
been criticizing for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate gives me an opportunity, as the NDP House leader and 
also as the trade critic, to reflect on the relationship between 
the NDP and Quebec nationalists, not only nationalists in the 
Bloc Quebecois but also nationalists outside the Bloc Quebecois 
who are not necessarily sovereignists or separatists.  There was 
always thought to be a great deal of affinity in so far as we 
held these social democratic values in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened over the last several years, particularly 
since the creation of the Bloc, but going back to the beginning 
of the debate on the free trade agreement, is that we have 
disagreed with the Bloc Quebecois, and not just about separation, 
obviously.  We are federalists and they are sovereignists.  They 
understand that.  We understand it.  It is fair ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, where we have had problems and why I welcome this 
motion as an opportunity for all of us to reflect, is the way in 
which we have seen the free trade agreement, the NAFTA, the WTO 
and now the MAI as models for globalization that work against 
social democracy, that work against the ability of governments to 
create, to preserve and to maintain social democratic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always found it odd, frustrating and even irritating on 
occasion to see Quebeckers of various political persuasions 
embracing free trade and the NAFTA.  I say this in all 
earnestness.  I am not trying to provoke a partisan debate, I am 
trying to extend an opportunity for all of us to reflect on this. 
Recently, they did not even bother to file a minority report on 
the MAI.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last little while there seems to have been a bit of 
a shift, within the ranks of the Bloc in particular, and I 
welcome this shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think from our point of view this particular model of 
globalization, which the FTA, the NAFTA, the WTO and the MAI 
represent, is not just something that we should be sceptical 
about as social democrats from the point of view of whether it 
creates justice, because we certainly should be sceptical of it 
on those grounds.  It has led to increasing poverty and 
increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, not just 
within countries, but between countries in many respects in terms 
of north, south and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also should be sceptical of it in so far as it is a threat to 
the sovereignty of governments; to the power of governments to 
intervene, to shape, to contain, to regulate, to do all of the 
things that we have been able to do in the economy over the years 
to create a more social democratic Canada, which Bloc members 
would want to have at their disposal if there was an independent 
Quebec and they wanted to shape the Quebec economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this debate might be an opportunity to hear back from 
Bloc members on this.  It has always been a bit of a puzzle to us 
why they embrace that particular view of the global economy and 
why at one point the former leader of the Bloc, now the premier 
of Quebec, talked about the end of ideology, that ideology had 
been replaced by trade.  That was on March 15, 1994 in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade in itself is an ideology, in particular liberalized trade 
without government regulation, without core labour standards. 
This is in itself an ideology and there is ideology to be debated 
within different models of how global trade will unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pretend somehow that there is no ideological debate here is 
to play the game that the government wants us to play, but not so 
much the Reform.  I think they acknowledge that there is an 
ideological debate here and they are very clear about what side 
they are on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome this motion from the Bloc.  I look forward to hearing 
more of what they have to say and reading more about how they 
square what they are saying today with some of the things that 
have been said in the past.  I look forward to working together 
with them and with others who see the real threat that this model 
of globalization presents, not only to social justice, but to the 
sovereignty of all governments whether they be federalist or of 
any other nature.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the remarks of the 
House leader of the New Democratic Party are interesting and 
raise a number of questions. For instance, he sees a 
contradiction between our being Quebec sovereignists and our 
position with respect to globalization and our adherence to the 
free trade agreement with the United States, and then with 
Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot speak for the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, who is 
perfectly able to speak for himself, but there is not 
necessarily a contradiction. Globalization is an inescapable 
reality in our society. Whether we like it or not, we are headed 
in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As social democrats, we must however ask ourselves the following 
question: In the face of globalization, can we, as social 
democrats within our various parties, be it the Bloc or the NDP, 
contribute to the debate to make sure that this movement toward 
market globalization is more civilized and that a national 
perspective is taken to domestic interests? It is our duty as 
parliamentarians and members of Parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can also make a contribution with respect to working 
conditions, especially in countries like Mexico, and compliance 
with environmental rules that apply to every country in the 
world. Much remains to be done in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is what the call from the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean is all about, by demanding that those who decide 
economic issues and political issues too—because he called on 
parliamentarians as well—finally comply with the terms and 
conditions that the people want to see enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly recall that, when they took position in favour of free 
trade, the members of the Bloc Quebecois knew at the time there 
would be a price to pay for this change and that transition 
measures would be required to help industries adjust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona may 
want to respond to these comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  It is true that globalization is a fact.  But what is 
up for grabs is what kind of globalization we are going to have. 
Are we going to have globalization that is really just a global 
marketplace with this race to the bottom where governments and 
societies give up their social and economic values by trading 
away their labour standards and their environmental regulations 
in order to attract investment?  Or is our form of globalization 
going to be a global community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it raises the matter of global governance.  In spite of 
what the member for Peace River keeps accusing the NDP of, we 
have never suggested that we should be isolationists, that we 
should put up tariff walls or that we should go back to the days 
of Sir John A. Macdonald.  What we have suggested is that if we 
are going to have a global market we need to have forms of global 
governance that do for global markets what national governments 
used to do for national markets.  That is the way ahead.  We are 
not looking for a way back, we are looking for a way ahead that 
creates some form of global social and economic justice, and the 
MAI is not the way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is a replication of the NAFTA at a much larger level.  I 
think that is something that people who were for the NAFTA have 
to take into account— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  On a brief question, the hon. member 
for Prince George—Bulkley Valley. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am surprised at the irresponsibility and the 
naivete of the member for Winnipeg—Transcona.  I would like to 
remind him that this is a country of 30 million people who 
produce far more in a year than we could ever consume.  Therefore 
it is an absolute necessity that Canada trade with other nations 
and take part in the global marketplace.  That is what fuels the 
economy of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case the member does not know it, if it was not for the NAFTA 
and the free trade agreement right now the economy of this 
country would be in disastrous shape because we do not have a 
buoyant domestic market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess it is just one of 
those things where it does not matter what one says because 
Reform members only hear what they want to hear.  I never said 
Canada did not need trade.  I never said we did not want to be 
part of the global marketplace.  I never said any of those 
things.  Reform members either have wax in their ears or they are 
just committed to a particular point of view no matter what 
people say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said we had to have a global marketplace that was regulated in 
a certain way so that there was social and economic justice. 
That does not mean we do not trade.  It means we trade in a 
particular way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to commend the member for Lac-Saint-Jean for the 
intent of this motion.  While we may differ on the means, we agree 
on the end.  We would like to eradicate child poverty in 
Canada.  Progressive Conservatives recognize that one of the 
best levers to eradicate child poverty, not only within Canada 
but globally, is liberalized trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a Progressive Conservative government that led Canada 
into the free trade agreement in 1988 and the NAFTA in 1993.  In 
fact if members want to talk about transparency and about 
openness and engagement, there was a federal election fought in 
1988 on the free trade agreement.  Compare that to the secrecy of 
the current MAI discussions and negotiations, Canada's 
participation and lack of consultation within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where do the Liberals stand on that 
debate?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  The Liberal Party has been consistently 
inconsistent in its trade policy.  Recently the Minister for 
International Trade said the Liberal Party was on the vanguard of 
the rising anxieties of the free trade agreement of 1988.  In 
fact the Liberals were the leaders of the anti free trade 
movement in 1988. Now the Liberals cannot get enough free trade. 
In fact they like it so much they do not feel it is important to 
negotiate or to engage Canadians in these discussions.  That is 
how much they like free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We actually have some commitment to commitment.  They are born 
again free traders.  Now with the public opposition mounting they 
are posturing against the MAI agreement.  Or at least they are 
indicating in a very public sense that they have some 
difficulties with it when in fact privately they do not have a 
great enough understanding of it to have any opposition to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes that a good multilateral investment 
agreement could benefit all Canadians.  However we do not believe 
that any agreement at any cost without any negotiation or 
consultation with Canadians is the right agreement.  The lack of 
public consultation within Canada on the MAI is appalling.  The 
motion today has helped us bring to light some of this lack of 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we have public debate on this kind of 
issue. Public debate is the best way to dispel some of the 
arguments put forth by some of the most vociferous opponents and 
indeed proponents of the MAI.  There is common ground between 
these two extremes. That is why the PC Party asked the 
subcommittee on the MAI to table the agreement before parliament 
15 days before it was ratified by cabinet.  The idea was taken 
from a bill introduced by Alexander Downer, the Australian 
minister of foreign affairs, in the Australian parliament in 
1996.  This became the Australian model for treaty negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc motion claims an agreement like the MAI would weaken 
legislative rights.  That is why the PC Party introduced a 
recommendation to the MAI subcommittee to conduct a full impact 
analysis of the effect the MAI would have on our federal, 
provincial and municipal programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc's motion blames globalization for the growing gap 
between rich and poor around the world.  Globalization is not the 
largest contributing factor to this dangerous spread between the 
rich and the poor.  Globalization is not all bad nor is it all 
good.  It is like most things.  It brings risk and it brings 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americas and Europe have come to see the benefits of trade 
union rights and child labour legislation but they have become 
wealthy enough to absorb those costs.  Without the expansion of 
liberalized trade, the engine of job growth, workers in 
underdeveloped countries may never have that same opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberalized trade is the most effective lever that developing 
countries have to bootstrap themselves into a decent standard of 
living, the decent standard of living we take for granted in this 
country.  Free trade critics argue that globalization pushes 
labour offshore to cheaper markets when in fact the majority of 
foreign investment flows between rich countries, or flows between 
rich countries in search of markets, not poor economies offering 
cheap labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of globalization forces free trading economies to 
increase labour flexibility. For those countries that increase 
their labour flexibility, it allows them to react quickly and 
adapt to shift people and resources away from declining 
industries and toward growing ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion should not be about the fear of liberalized trade 
and its perceived effect on the gap between rich and poor. Free 
trade has not been the cause of the increase in this gap, and 
there is very little substantive or credible data to support that 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks at the export levels of Quebec in 1988 before the 
FTA and in 1996, exports have increased from $16 billion to $40 
billion.  Those exports are extremely important to Quebec. Those 
figures have helped to stabilize the employment levels in Quebec, 
not destabilize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about child poverty in Canada, perhaps we 
should be working together to create an economy that works in a 
country that works.  We know full well the cost of separatism, 
the debate on separatism and the cost to children and  all people 
in Quebec in terms of poverty.  We should be very careful that we 
are not blaming the wrong demon when we talk about child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members should be reminded that their PQ cousins in Quebec 
have vowed to remain part of NAFTA if separation occurs.  They 
understand full well that NAFTA has benefited Quebec as it has 
benefited Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important contributing factor to the gap between rich 
and poor has been a global transitional economy from the resource 
and manufacturing based economies to the information technology 
and knowledge based economies. 
This gap between rich and poor has been exacerbated at this 
critical and pivotal time in this paradigm shift by the cuts in 
the health and education transfers made by the Liberal government 
in Ottawa.

changes were made to the unemployment insurance fund, only 36% of 
unemployed Canadians now actually collect EI.  The 35% decrease 
in health care, welfare and education funding to the provinces 
invoked by the Liberal government has disproportionately affected 
the poorest of Canadians. It has denied the poorest Canadians 
equality of opportunity which is fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the free enterprise system.  We believe it is the 
best system for all Canadians.  For the free enterprise system to

They need a strong education system.

Canadians but will benefit children around the world.

Canadians and the poorest of Canadians have affected the access 
of young Canadians to the opportunities provided in a global 
knowledge based economy as we enter the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are really serious about addressing child poverty in 
Canada, I have some suggestions.  I reiterate that we should 
support and continue to seek solutions to this problem.  The 
government should work toward this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must utilize a progressive trade policy and a progressive 
free enterprise domestic economic policy. The combination of 
those two policies will first of all ensure that Canadians have 
opportunities to participate in the global economy and second, 
that they are not burdened by intrusive government in Canada 
which denies them the opportunity to participate effectively in 
that global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest as well that we work together across Canada 
toward a national unity agreement that works and stop this 
endless debate on the national unity issue. We must work to stop 
the tremendous cost that has been borne by ordinary Canadians and 
ordinary Quebeckers for the separatist movement over the past 20 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must start working together to build economic bridges across 
Canada and economic bridges around the world which will benefit 
young people in Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we work seriously toward those ends we will all be better 
served. In fact all Canadians will be better served by 
constructive policies coming from all sides of this House.

heard my colleague refer to Marx, and I am glad he did, because 
I myself have based my speech on something Marx said that is one 
of the reasons I am obviously supporting the Bloc Quebecois 
motion.  I will explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marx—or Engels, but I think it was Marx—said that the gap between 
rich and poor would only widen under capitalism.  With the 
introduction of communism, the system he founded, it became 
clear that, despite what he hoped, this gap between rich and 
poor continued to widen, with the disproportionate wealth of the 
nomenklatura. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing in mind what the leader of our party said earlier about 
the gap between rich and poor also widening in our capitalist 
society, I wonder whether it has something to do with human 
selfishness, with the powerful doing what they can to become 
increasingly wealthy, even if it means trampling the poor.  One 
might think it was inevitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion just introduced by the Bloc Quebecois, 
because I think that, if capitalism is not to prove Marx right, 
this debate on growth must go hand-in-hand with a debate on 
everyone's right to share in the fruits of that growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore support the motion because, although I am not a 
Marxist, I do not want his prediction to come true. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
intervention from the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tremendous concern about the gap between the rich and 
poor.  In the U.S. there is the gated community concept. 
Families and individuals live in gated communities. They pay for 
their children's private education, private hospitals and their 
own security service. They live in gated communities which are 
effectively insulated from the public at large. They do not 
really care about what goes on outside their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capitalism without the effective interventions of the state in 
areas of health care and education is not sustainable.  I 
mentioned Karl Marx and said that he may have been right about 
unfettered capitalism but he was wrong about communism. The 
communist system arguably would not have a tremendous gap between 
the rich and the poor because everybody would be poor. However, I 
do not think that is the most effective system either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again commend the member for Lac-Saint-Jean for having 
initiated this debate.  The benefit is that we have the 
opportunity to debate in a very philosophical and concrete way 
important policy initiatives.  We are able to look at the problem 
very seriously.

BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to my hon. colleague's remarks 
with interest, and I would like to give him a few figures 
concerning the matter of smaller countries and globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the unemployment rate in Canada stood at 10.3%. It was 
3.6% in Austria, 8% in Denmark, 5.4% in Norway, 6.8% in the 
Netherlands, and 3.6% in Switzerland. So a country's size has 
nothing to do with the impact of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have never suggested that globalization per se is bad. What 
we would like is some parliamentary control over globalization 
so that ordinary citizens can benefit from it, and not only 
those who can make big profits. Profit is important for 
companies, but the governments should also be able to 
redistribute wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said he finds it strange that Quebec sovereignists 
should support free trade. He should not forget that it is 
Quebec that brought free trade to Canada, because it was in its 
own interest to do so, and Quebec's development depends on 
north-south trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member not admit that it is the way countries are 
governed and the development tools they give themselves, and not 
size, that determine how well they do internationally? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say that although 
Quebec has been strongly supportive of free trade, I come from a 
province that was in free trade prior to Confederation.  We have 
some contributions and agree with the member on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smaller countries have more to gain from liberalized trade in 
many ways than some of the larger countries.  That has been 
demonstrated in almost every equation, such as in the access to 
larger markets, especially for a country like Canada where it is 
absolutely essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the support within Quebec for free trade, I would 
expect that the support would be there and will continue to be 
there.  The benefit has effectively led to the tripling of 
exports since 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member's intervention. I look forward to 
continuing this dialogue elsewhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe 
that at this point in the debate it is very important and 
opportune to read the motion again because we have heard all 
kinds of things even if there was not much in way of a debate, 
except from one or two speakers from each party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer given by my colleague from the Reform Party confirms 
why we should support the motion moved by the Bloc Quebecois 
leader. I support the motion and I am going to read it again to 
prevent the debate from going further off course. After only a 
few speeches, it is already off course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House reiterate the 1989 commitment to eliminating 
child poverty by the year 2000, urge the government to act, and 
strike an all-party Special Parliamentary Committee with the main 
objective of considering Canadian parliamentarians' ability to 
narrow the gap between rich and poor in the new context created 
by the globalization of markets— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion does not indicate we are against liberalizing trade 
or that we are against the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, 
quite the opposite. The motion does not indicate anything of the 
sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion suggests that parliamentarians from all parties 
look into a problem which is very real. In their first red book 
the Liberals said they would eliminate child poverty before the 
year 2000. 
What we are asking is to strike a committee to see whether this 
deadline is realistic, to see if we can reach this commendable 
goal which is desirable for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like speakers from the Liberal Party to tell us why they 
are now opposed to something they had espoused before. It is 
rather odd. When the Liberals, the New Democrats and members 
from other parties say: “Therefore the Bloc Quebecois is against 
liberalizing trade, against the MAI”, it becomes necessary to 
remind them of the spirit and the wording of the Bloc Quebecois' 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point in the motion says: “globalization and the 
international agreements that frame it, particularly the 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment as now written—”. I believe 
this is underscored by what the international trade minister 
just said in Paris. 
We are not against the MAI, but the Bloc Quebecois would never 
give its support to a government's signing such an agreement as 
it is currently written, because there is a risk of limiting 
certain powers of states and hence of the representatives 
elected to this House—we are not saying it does so, but there is 
that risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is a committee of parliamentarians.  I would be 
very surprised if MPs wanted to shirk their responsibilities. 
That is why I am surprised the Liberals are unwilling to agree 
to discussing the MAI among other things in a committee setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that I am going to split my 20 minutes with my 
colleague for Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to focus on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.  As 
my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean has demonstrated with his 
speeches and with his exit from the House, many in Quebec, in 
Canada, and everywhere else in the world, are intrigued and 
greatly concerned by the gap between rich and poor due to 
globalization.  What exactly is this agreement?  Where does it 
come from?  What is its intent?  What are this agreement's 
objectives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many legitimate fears expressed. Many concerns 
have been raised about the signing of an agreement such as the 
MAI.  Negotiations or discussions on it date back to 1995 under 
the auspices of the OECD. 
It is worth repeating here that we call the OECD the rich 
countries club. The NGOs often use that same term.  It is a 
group of 29 countries that make up the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some consultations, it is true, but for the most part 
negotiations were held in secret.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When 29 rich countries negotiate behind closed doors agreements 
that are designed to promote investments, it is only normal for 
the populations of these 29 wealthy countries—and of those 
other countries interested in joining them—to wonder about 
these agreements and to even question them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important for Canadians to remember that the 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment includes about 90% of 
Chapter 11 of NAFTA, dealing with investments. Therefore, it is 
not completely new stuff, since 90% of the MAI is found in 
Chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were discussions held on such an agreement? There are two 
main reasons. 
First, the purpose of the agreement is to set rules and to 
regulate—I know this is somewhat redundant—the investment 
sector, since there are currently over 1,300 bilateral 
investment accords, of which 50 were signed by Canada, including 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea was to promote, regulate and facilitate exports and 
investments from Canada to other countries, and conversely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the agreement is also to benefit from 
globalization. There are disadvantages, but there are also some 
advantages, such as increased investments. Also, if the 
agreement is amended as we wish, it should promote economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the two reasons why we supported the principle of the 
agreement. But again, in its current form, we cannot support the 
ratification of the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our party leader mentioned earlier, the Bloc Quebecois has 
been supportive of the free trade agreement with the United 
States, since the beginning, and we also supported its extension 
into NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even supported in principle the continuation of the 
negotiations, but we object to the signing of the agreement in 
its present form. We are not like the Liberals who, in 1988, 
were opposed to multilateral agreements and saying that they 
were the worst possible things for Canadians, but turned around 
after the election and started signing all kinds of such 
accords. We are consistent in our position and we will continue 
to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have been following us are aware of the very serious 
reservations that the Bloc had regarding this issue. 
Among other things, and the member for Rimouski—Mitis will 
elaborate on that later on, we want a general exception clause 
for cultural industries, which we did not have as of this 
morning, and that is why we would oppose the signing of the 
agreement in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wants countries to retain the right to take 
or maintain measures to protect the environment and labour 
standards. We would not sign or support the signing of any 
multilateral agreement that would not include a clause to 
protect the environment and labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want such an agreement to specify that countries cannot 
lower their national standards with regard to health, 
environmental safety and occupational safety in order to attract 
foreign investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want legislation such as the Helms-Burton Bill to be 
deemed ineffective and non enforceable under such an agreement 
because it goes against the principle of trade. We also want 
immigration laws, regulations and national procedures to be 
given precedence. And, of course, we want provincial 
jurisdictions to be fully recognized in an agreement such as the 
multilateral agreement on investment and other agreements. 
Without that, we will never sign or support the signing of such 
an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the lowering of health and occupational safety 
standards, particular attention must be paid to the text of the 
agreement in these two areas. There are two versions of that 
part of the agreement. One says that a party “should not” lower 
its health, safety and environmental standards. 
The other version says that a party “shall not” lower these 
standards. There is a world of difference between “should not” 
and “shall not”. If we ended up with a version that said “should 
not” or “it would be desirable”, again we would not support such 
an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exception for cultural industries is also a precondition 
that must be met before we sign or support such an agreement, as 
well as a clearer definition of “expropriation” and 
“expropriation requiring compensation”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to ensure that the role of the provinces will be 
respected before we give our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, the Liberals and the Reformers signed a 
report in which they asked that the agreement be submitted to 
parliamentarians before it was signed, as requested by the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean, so that parliamentarians can fulfil 
their duties as auditors and as the people's representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask, we demand that the text of the agreement be submitted to 
the subcommittee before it is signed, which hopefully will not 
be until all the issues are resolved. 
Now that the OECD is no longer considered the forum for 
negotiating such an agreement, we also ask that the agreement be 
referred to the WTO, so that all the countries in the world can 
take part in its development.

hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion urges the government to immediately strike an 
all-party special parliamentary committee. I would like my hon. 
colleague to comment on the fact that globalization emerged a 
few years back and that we had to wait until today for the 
heartfelt cry of the hon. member for Lac-St-Jean to reflect the 
awareness that all kinds of dealings and agreements are in the 
works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about the Free Trade Agreement for the Americas. We have 
NAFTA. We have the MIA. We also have organizations like the IMF, 
the International Monetary Fund, and the WTO. What about the 
people in all of this? 
What role do the citizens expect their parliamentarians to play? 
What do the people expect their parliamentarians to say or do to 
ensure that globalization serves the interests of all and not 
only of those who want to make money out of this phenomenon? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.  It gives me an opportunity to clarify parts of the 
motion before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first point out, with respect to the role of 
parliamentarians, that, when the Liberals were in opposition, 
they demanded a special debate on the free trade agreement with 
the United States.  They did not insist on an opposition day, as 
the Reformers did, they called for a special debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1988 election campaign focused primarily on the free trade 
agreement with the United States.  What is happening today?  The 
free trade agreement with Chile was negotiated under wraps by 
unelected negotiators and officials.  What was the role of 
parliamentarians?  They passed the bill implementing the 
agreement.  Not one comma of the agreement was debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members would surely agree that the free trade agreement with 
Israel and Palestine is likely to have some fairly special 
provisions. And what was the role of parliamentarians in this 
agreement?  They passed the bill to implement it.  The agreement 
and its conditions were negotiated by unelected officials. 
Canadians today are facing a fait accompli and are obliged to 
live with these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are requesting initially, as my colleague mentioned, to be 
increasingly involved in these multilateral agreements. 
Parliamentarians must have a role to play.  They must first look 
to see how their role as representatives of the public may be 
expanded in the proliferation of such agreements.  That is what 
must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Liberals why they refuse to fulfill 
their parliamentary duties.  Why are they not meeting the 
commitment they made in black and white in the red book? 
Why do they refuse to strike a committee or, at the very least, 
why do they not say something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do not want the role of parliamentarians—and there are 
a number of them here who have been re-elected—why are they 
here? They are here to serve as parliamentarians, as 
representatives of the people, but they do not honour their 
commitments.  They do not fulfill their parliamentary 
responsibilities.  They hide and refuse to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like them to answer certain questions in their speeches. 
It is indeed vital to keep a close eye on all the agreements, 
often negotiated on the sly by officials who have not been 
elected and often presented to parliamentarians as a fait 
accompli.

dimension or the impact this agreement might have on the 
cultural sector, because this agreement, as presently designed, 
represents a real danger for cultural sectors in Canada and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot think of a massive liberalization that would lead to 
the outright abandonment of policies and measures designed to 
support the cultural sector without first knowing the economic 
importance of this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cultural activities in Canada provide about 900,000 direct jobs 
and an estimated 300,000 indirect jobs, for a grand total of 1.2 
million. These jobs account for 9.2% of the labour market. The 
direct contribution of cultural activities to the economy 
amounts to $29 billion, or 4.7% of the gross domestic product, 
while its indirect contribution is $42 billion, or 6.8% of the 
gross domestic product. Consequently, we cannot consider the 
cultural sector as minor and make it a pawn to be sacrificed on 
the altar of major international trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, Canada has put in place some measures aimed at 
supporting domestic art production. 
The main measures implemented were the imposition of limits on 
foreign property and of quotas on Canadian content, subsidies, 
support for distribution and exports, tax credits and the 
creation of crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite their scope, these measures barely allowed Canada to 
have access to part of its domestic market. Indeed, Canadian 
cultural products have a marginal position in the market. For 
example, 92% of the movies shown on our screens are foreign, 60% 
of books sold in Canada and Quebec are American and 88% of sound 
recordings put on the market have a foreign content. As you can 
see, we are far from being protectionist in the cultural sector. 
We only want to keep some room so that our creators can express 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, without those support measures, Canadian and Quebec 
artists would not even have that minimal share of the Canadian 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers distinguish themselves from their Canadian fellow 
citizens by the fact that in some areas they have a preference 
for their own writers and productions. However, in the event of 
complete deregulation, foreign conglomerates could flood our 
market with products so cheap that even that preference would 
not allow us to preserve a Quebec content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supporters of neo-liberalism often argue that Canada is an 
exporter of cultural products and, hence, it would be beneficial 
to liberalize trade in cultural products. They forget that to 
begin with you must have something to sell. In the cultural 
area, it is vital to have a safe domestic market to develop 
products we will then be able to export. 
Government policies were the means which stimulated and 
encouraged the creation and production of cultural works for 
Canadians and which indirectly created cultural goods and 
services that could be exported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we destroy the base for cultural creation in Canada and in 
Quebec, there will probably still be a cultural industry, but it 
will in no way be the mirror of Canadian and Quebec identities. 
We will become producers of americanized cultural products that 
will be sold in Canada as well as in foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI includes copyright in the definition of investment. 
Since the most recent commercial agreement always takes 
precedence over other agreements, the MAI would weaken copyright 
by invalidating the gains made under previous agreements such as 
the Rome Convention, the Berne Convention and the International 
Treaty on Intellectual Property. The MAI would bring to an end 
collectives which defend the rights of artists. This would be 
the triumph of the American business approach over the rights of 
creators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem was well understood by the Culture, Youth, 
Education and Media Commission of the European Parliament, which 
stated in January 1998, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incorporating intellectual property issues in a general 
agreement to regulate investment would be the equivalent of 
applying an extremely minimalist approach to the whole idea of 
intellectual property. This is why the MAI should not be applied 
to that area but should abide by the international agreements 
already in force that are the result of long and complicated 
technical negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deeply regret that there is no single Canadian position 
regarding the cultural industries, but rather multiple positions 
that change according to the mood of the Minister for 
International Trade, the public whom he addresses or the 
pressures exerted on him, in particular the telephone calls from 
the U.S. Trade Secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, on February 12, the minister asserted that this 
agreement would not be signed unless it provided for a full 
cultural exemption. However, the next day, he was less 
definitive. On February 13, he said that, if he did not get a 
full exemption, he would settle for country specific 
reservation. The minister speaks out of both sides of his mouth 
in his response to the report of the Subcommittee on 
International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment regarding the 
MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a distinction between an exemption and a country 
specific reservation? Yes, and an important one. A country 
specific reservation is neither sufficient nor acceptable. 
Reservations have a lower legal status. 
Moreover, to settle for a country specific reservation instead 
of a full exemption would be a major compromise never seen in 
multilateral and bilateral agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general exception clause has the advantage of not 
identifying a particular country.  All countries are entitled to 
the same exception, while a mere reservation identifies a 
country trying to protect itself.  A reservation clause shows 
that this protection is an irritant that will eventually 
disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reservation clauses are limited by two principles: the status 
quo and dismantling. The status quo principle implies that the 
only authorized changes to measures to which the reservation 
clause applies would be those which would make those measures 
more compatible with the agreement. It would therefore be 
impossible to establish new cultural protection measures, either 
in the traditional sectors or in the new media resulting from 
technological progress. 
Under the dismantling principle, all the measures listed by the 
various countries are gradually eliminated.  Once a country has 
abandoned a measure it is for good, it cannot be reactivated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we agree to sign a MAI which does not have a general 
exemption clause for cultural matters, we must realise that we 
are forsaking whatever small Canadian or Quebec content we still 
have.  Without a way of expressing our culture we cannot 
preserve our Canadian or Quebec identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a democratic component, because without a truly 
Canadian or Quebec cultural space it is impossible to maintain a 
diverse public space allowing our citizens to participate in our 
cultural life, which is necessary to public life. 
We have to leave some room for a democratic expression which 
goes beyond the simple producer-consumer relation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must be inflexible concerning the MAI.  Without a 
general cultural exemption, no MAI.  A reservation is not 
acceptable.  The heritage minister must play an active role 
in the international negotiations to have culture excluded the 
same way defence is excluded. If they really care about the 
future of their own country, Liberals should worry more about 
the MAI than about separatists because the MAI is a bigger threat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague from Rimouski—Mitis for her excellent 
speech and the point she made concerning the cultural exception 
clause in the Multilateral Agreement on Investment as well as in 
the other agreements. As she reminded her Liberal and 
“Canadian” colleagues in her conclusion, it is very important 
that we think not only of us but also of their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put a question to my colleague from Rimouski—Mitis 
about something that is a surprise to me this morning, the 
inconsistency in the speeches and positions of my colleagues 
from the Liberal Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have her opinion on what we heard in the House, 
because she also listened very carefully to the speeches, as we 
do. How can the Liberals—who wrote in their red book that they 
wanted to eliminate child and family poverty in general by the 
year 2000—oppose today a motion reiterating the 1989 
commitment to eliminate poverty by the year 2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know what she thinks of the position held 
by Liberal members about our demand to strike a committee made 
up of Reform, Liberal and Bloc members. A majority of committee 
members would be Liberals since, as everybody knows, they hold 
the majority in the House and form the government. 
But Liberals are opposed to the creation of such a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What, in her opinion, are the Liberals thinking, if such a thing 
is possible, in opposing a motion for the elimination of child 
poverty by the year 2000 and the striking of a parliamentary 
committee to take position on this matter? I would like to hear 
her opinion on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, in my opinion, this is 
clearly a worrisome situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we are asking that a special committee be struck to look 
into this extremely important issue. My hon. colleague from 
Repentigny mentioned that many things have happened since 1993. 
All kinds of agreements were signed without parliamentarians 
being involved. Individuals who are not accountable to anyone 
have negotiated agreements on our behalf and did not even ask 
our opinion. That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take what I witnessed this morning as an example. A 
sub-committee of the heritage committee was set up to examine the 
issue of sports in Canada. When we heard witnesses from amateur 
sport, no one was there. The room was almost empty. There were 
no reporters, hence no media coverage, and just a few Liberals. 
In attendance were, besides the chair of the committee of 
course, perhaps one or two Liberal members and myself, the only 
opposition member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning however, there were not enough seats for all the 
members who came to hear NHL officials lament about the horrible 
situation their industry is in because they are not generating 
enough profits. Mr. Corey told us Molson made only $5 million in 
profits last year. My comment to him was that it was too bad 
that members of his team earned more than he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the tragedy, no effort is made to sit down and discuss. 
I have nothing against businesses turning a profit, that is what 
they are about, but they should also pay their share of taxes. 
Only those who make money have to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with people in my riding throughout the Easter break 
and all day yesterday. They told me “We do not want to pay for 
Montreal again, Mrs. Tremblay. We hope you will object to that. 
We are still paying for the Olympic stadium and now we are 
expected to pay for the core revival. We are unemployed. On the 
lumber issue, we went three or four times before NAFTA panels. 
We won every time, but nothing came of it. Our foresters are 
going through tough times”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA also applies to hockey teams. Let them go and argue before 
a NAFTA panel their case against the unfair subsidies American 
hockey teams receive from the municipalities, states and federal 
government in the United States. Do not come and ask us to give 
them money.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it was rather interesting to hear one of the speakers from the 
Bloc asking a question of Liberal members.  I believe the 
question was why are you here. I believe that is what I heard him 
say.  I find that an extraordinary question coming from someone 
from the Bloc.  The reality is its own members have questioned 
the validity of their being in this place because of the results 
of the last referendum.  There has been a suggestion by members 
from that party that they should just resign, take their ball and 
go home, which would be just fine with me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness I must admit I thought the speaker who just finished 
made some very interesting points.  She talked about the success 
of the Canadian cultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have indeed been successful as a government, as a country and 
as a nation in supporting our cultural exports.  Let us take a 
look at the greatest box office hit I believe in history, 
<I>Titanic</I>, which featured a Canadian director and the music 
of the wonderful and talented Céline Dion.  One of the biggest 
stars in Europe is a Canadian, Bryan Adams.  We have many things 
we can be proud of from the point of view of the arts and 
Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought the member actually made some very valid points which 
sounded a bit to me like she was speaking in support of some of 
the government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then get the other extreme.  The Bloc members are a bit like 
chameleons.  They change their colours as the mood moves them. 
They are difficult at times to understand from a logical point of 
view.  I heard a Bloc member this morning say they are democratic 
socialists.  I assume that means they are the NDP en français. 
It had not occurred to me before but apparently that seems to be 
their philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what the members of the Bloc need to do and what they 
should be doing is debating an issue in this place that basically 
says what kind of a society we want if we are to have an impact 
on eliminating child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty does not happen in a vacuum.  Child poverty 
generally results from family poverty.  It seems to be 
politically more attractive to talk about the children.  What 
about the parents? What about the mothers and fathers working at 
part time jobs, the working poor in society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party seems to have a solution, broad base tax cuts 
right across the board so that everybody, particularly its 
friends, would receive huge tax breaks while the poor it purports 
to defend would receive minimal or nothing in the form of tax 
breaks.  Reform's solution to child poverty is myopic at best and 
is simply misguided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the Bloc and what kind of society we want.  Do 
we want a divided society based on our differences? Do we want a 
society where we continue to concentrate on the issue of national 
unity in this great country based on our differences?  Of course 
we have differences.  I think the message should be vive la 
différence et vive le Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc would take some of its ideas and put them into 
practice in terms of constructive debate in this place it might 
be surprised at some of the support that could arise.  I thought 
some of the debate we have sat through was reasonably well 
thought out and gave some valid points and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the principle of the motion the young member has put 
forward, now that he has decided to bring his seat back and join 
the rest of us, is not a bad principle.  The concept is there is 
a disparity between the rich and the poor and we should strive to 
eliminate that. There is a problem as it relates to family and 
child poverty and we should strive to eliminate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view our government has done a number of things in the 
last budget with family tax credits, commitments to education and 
the youth employment strategy.  We have done a number of things 
to help in the area of eradicating poverty.  However, it is not 
enough. I admit that.  I think the finance minister and the Prime 
Minister would admit it is not enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take it in the context of the overall job of running 
corporation Canada, this great country, and we are the board of 
directors, we have to priorize.  We have to make commitments to 
keep the interest rates down, to keep inflation down, with record 
numbers.  Of course the hon. member does not agree.  He is giving 
me the thumbs down.  I would not expect the thumbs up from 
someone whose sole purpose in life is to destroy this wonderful 
country.  If I ever got it I would be nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot even talk about something like globalization or the 
MAI without hysteria coming out of members opposite, coming out 
of people like Maude Barlow champing at the bit, demonstrating 
everywhere, whipping people into a frenzy, putting out false 
information all over the country and the members opposite using 
the negotiations around the MAI for their own political purposes. 
It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade and globalization are all part of reality.  We cannot 
be isolationists.  Members can clap if they want.  I have never 
said anything different.  We cannot be isolationists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc would like to put borders around its own province and 
be in isolation.  That is what would happen.  The number one 
trading partner for the province of Ontario is the province of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think interprovincial trade is a very important issue.  There 
are barriers that should be eliminated in interprovincial trade. 
We should be working toward that together as the board of 
directors of corporation Canada.  I think we can move in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we cannot ignore that there is a requirement, 
an obligation in fact, for us to have negotiations with foreign 
countries.  If we see where the Prime Minister is today and has 
been for the past day or two, there is an interesting problem 
there.  The Americans do not want to sign the MAI because they do 
not like the fact that we are upset with the Helms-Burton act. 
They want to be isolationists. They do not mind trading with 
China. They do not mind trading with a country whose human rights 
record is undoubtedly and arguably the worst in the world, but 
they do not want to trade with the little island of Cuba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we see what our Prime Minister has been able to accomplish 
in softening the relationship with Cuba, in getting a settlement 
from the Cuban government for Confederation Life.  We have to 
have these kinds of discussions and negotiations if we are to 
play on the world economic stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should just settle down. Let us get the MAI document out. We 
should not be abrogating our labour standards, we should not be 
abrogating our environmental standards, we should not be 
abrogating our health and safety requirements in this country. 
This government would not allow that to happen. But because these 
things are put on the table we get knee-jerk reactions from 
people who put blinders on and refuse to even discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have negotiations on globalization, on international 
trade if we are ever to increase the marketplace for the 30 
million people in this great country. We cannot do it all 
internally.  Interprovincial trade is a problem but globalization 
is here to stay.  Canadians should embrace it and have confidence 
to be able to compete on a world stage in the business community 
and in the arts and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have that confidence and I know our government does as well.

I have to say I find it utter nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is in favor of free trade, in favor of international 
trade. But does he know that, for example, Quebec's Unibroue, 
the micro-brewery Quebeckers are so proud of because it produces 
a quality beer that is sold all over the world, is unable to 
sell a single bottle of beer in Ontario because of the tariffs 
and structures the Ontario government has put in place to keep 
out producers from Quebec and, I suppose, from other provinces 
also?

Quebec who bought cars made by Ford, Chrysler and GM in Ontario, 
at almost double the price these same products are sold for in 
the United States, without protectionist measures, the Ontario 
economy would have taken a nosedive and its automobile industry 
would be dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favor of trade, but we have to start from identical 
bases and production costs must be identical because of the 
commitment of governments to respect certain rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we sell a welding product, for example, when a welder in 
this country must wear special protective clothing, his workshop 
must be heated, and he must receive a minimum salary, whereas in

street corner, using the bottom of a bottle for a mask? How can 
we be competitive in these situations?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I actually agree with the 
concern raised in the case of the micro brewery in Quebec.  It is 
ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the beer distribution system in the province of 
Ontario is fundamentally controlled by the big brewers.  That is 
where we need to resolve the problem.  They control the 
distribution system.  The hon. member's micro brewery in the 
province of Quebec cannot get listed on Brewers Retail.  We do 
not sell it in corner stores and in grocery stores like in other 
parts of this country. There is a fundamental problem there.  The 
hon. member raises a valid point.  Quebec and Ontario should sit 
down and discuss how we can alleviate that injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec buys over $9 billion more from Ontario 
businesses than the reverse.  We have a very healthy balance of 
trade.  We have a very healthy interest in working with the 
province of Quebec.  We have some room because of that balance of 
trade. I invite those issues to be put on the table.

eliminated the deficit of $42 billion.  All that is vitally 
important to the success of programs that will help eliminate 
poverty.  It will create jobs.  That is how we are going to 
eliminate poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the members opposite, who appear to be social democrats

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone favours increased trade. We know that the number of 
wars in the world is decreasing, which makes it possible to have 
broader economic markets and allows small countries to also 
benefit.  Wide political room is no longer needed, just wide 
economic room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, though, can we ensure that certain people do not get hurt 
by this globalization?  I will ask two questions to illustrate 
this.  First, is it or is it not true that the total annual 
income of the more than 250 million poorest people on earth 
equals the net worth of the six richest people?  The answer is 
that this is true. This is not surprising, considering that 
close to one-third of humanity lives in abject poverty and earns 
less than 1US$ per day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, is it or is it not true that, as the world gets richer, 
the gap between rich and poor is widening? 
This is false. It is not narrowing. The gap has more than 
doubled in a little less than one generation. Why? Because out 
of each $100 in economic growth, $86 goes to the richest 20%, 
and only $1.10 goes to the poorest 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions and answers that are food for thought. This 
situation is not the result of chance. It is the result of 
people looking after their own interests, people seeking to have 
their economic interests taken into account and promoting the 
increase of trade. We have had agreements such as NAFTA, the 
creation of agencies such as the WTO, the World Trade 
Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. All these 
organizations look after their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, what is our duty? Our duty is to be the 
democratic hope of people. 
When someone in Saint-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska, where there is a hog 
slaughterhouse, tells me: “It seems to me that suddenly there 
are fewer jobs. What is going on?” Well, this is linked to 
globalization. Somewhere in Asia there is an economic crisis 
going on. It has an impact on the marketplace, on the sale and 
consumption of pork for example, and in turn it results in fewer 
jobs in a village in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues I must, as an elected representative, find ways 
to rectify, change, modify. It may not appear like much but, for 
instance, Bill C-36 contains a clause providing for an increase 
in the amount of money the federal government can give the 
International Monetary Fund to deal with international crises. 
It looks perfect at first glance, but is it not a way to invite 
speculators to provoke crises because to cash in and, in the 
end, force the states and the Monetary Fund to make up the 
difference and find their way out of these crises? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important questions and the motion sets them out. Now 
that the private sector is responsible for creating wealth, we 
assume the equally important responsibility of distributing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, the performance of the last few years leaves 
much to be desired. In the motion, there is a historical 
reference. In 1989, the House adopted a motion calling for the 
elimination of child poverty by the year 2000. 
We have our work cut out for us if we really want to do it 
before the year 2000. This morning, the National Council on 
Welfare submitted a report to the Standing Committee on Finance 
in which it says that “There are about one and a half million 
poor children in Canada. About two thirds of them, roughly one 
million, live in families on welfare”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian Parliament had to be evaluated today on its 
performance in its fight against child poverty, it would be 
judged to have failed miserably. It would not get a passing 
mark, because it is not living up to its commitment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the apathy of the Liberal majority in particular, and 
given that it does not want to support this motion, what will it 
take for parliamentarians to act on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean rose to the challenge. He is 
asking parliamentarians from all political parties to commit to 
finding solutions. We have not yet reached that stage. We are 
merely asking parliamentarians to commit to finding solutions, 
and we cannot get this commitment from the Liberal majority. We 
will have to come up with an even more compelling way to get 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set an objective. We mentioned 50,000 signatures on the 
petition being circulated to ask that these positions be 
considered. 
The Liberals are silent on the issue. They are not even prepared 
to have a debate and to allow a parliamentary committee look at 
it. We will counter their silence with thousands of signatures 
opposing it. We already have 50,000 of them and, if more are 
needed, we will get them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty is present everywhere. Last weekend, I took part 
in various activities and I asked people about the 
appropriateness of the chair episode. No one questioned the fact 
that fighting poverty is the way to ensure globalization does 
not turn to our disadvantage. Everyone feels it is an important 
issue for which solutions must be found. I do not have these 
solutions. I do not know yet whether bank mergers are a good 
thing and I do not know yet how this ought to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do want the debate started by the member for Lac-Saint-Jean 
to take place. 
We must ask ourselves these questions, otherwise the year 2005 
or 2010 will roll around and we will still not have any 
solutions. We ourselves will no longer be in this Parliament, 
because we will have found another option, but the situation 
will not have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, almost 10 years ago, the House pledge to eliminate 
child poverty by the year 2000. Today, there are still 1.5 
million Canadian children living in poverty. We must not find 
ourselves in the same situation 10 years from now, or in an even 
worse situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on this note. How can we achieve such a result? 
Some people say we are naïve. Being naïve can trigger change. 
One who is naïve and politically organized and who has the 
determination to do achieve results will put the issues on the 
table, will discuss them and will find effective solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we must never do what the Prime Minister did. After having 
almost strangled a protester, he is now heaping ridicule on the 
youngest member in this House because he asked this basic 
question “What can we do to narrow the gap between rich and 
poor? How can we make sure that globalization will not have 
negative impacts, but positive ones?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will have to live with the consequences of 
his actions. I think he knew very well what was happening. He 
knows very well that he is unable and unwilling to deal with 
this issue. The Prime Minister, the Liberal members and all 
members of Parliament should react by saying this “It is indeed 
an important issue that has been raised by the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue of paramount importance and members of Parliament 
have a key role to play. It is on that, in particular, that the 
people in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada will judge them. Have 
they managed our country well or have they only been spectators 
who zap from place to place with their remote control while 
letting others decide in their place and waiting to see how 
things will develop?

listened to the hon. member from the Bloc and I am wondering if 
the member could tell the House what aspect of globalization is 
hurting Canada.  Is it the free trade agreement with the United 
States?  Is it the NAFTA with United States and Mexico?  Is it 
the World Trade Organization where we have negotiated with 132 
other member countries or is it the MAI? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explicitly tell us what aspect of globalization 
is being hurt by treaties Canada signed?

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a concrete example that 
can be readily given, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. 
If we ever negotiate such an agreement without a basic exemption 
for cultural matters, it would be unacceptable and very 
dangerous for Quebec as well as for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to close our eyes on how different countries treat 
their employees or environmental issues, we would allow the 
development of submarkets or situations where there would be 
undue competition. People will be treated unequally to attract 
capital and to meet requirements. These are elements of 
globalization that we  must control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no contradiction. And if there is anyone who can 
understand that in Canada, it is Quebeckers. We were the 
architects of the signing of the free trade agreement with the 
United States. We were in favour of signing the agreement, but 
we wanted to ensure that its conditions were acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you go in with a considerable capital—as in the case of 
the MIA, for example—the people living in the countries to our 
south who profit from these investment projects must have an 
equal opportunity and these projects must be made undere 
acceptable conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also ensure that productivity gains due to globalization 
are distributed among the country's citizens. If it is always 
the same people who are profiting from the revenues, there is a 
major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the same problem at the end of 19th century, before the 
Industrial Revolution. Ten- to twelve-year old children worked in 
mines and textile mills. Some people said this did not make 
sense; it was the start of labour unions. 
They tried to humanize these attitudes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, on the eve of the 21st century, we are faced with the 
same challenge because, in effect, if the annual revenue of more 
than 250 million of the poorest people on earth equals the net 
assets of the six richest persons, then something is not working 
in the system. As an elected representative, I am responsible, 
as are all other members in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member 
talk about the need for cultural exemptions.  I was trying to 
find out what area was the biggest concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated that unless Canada achieves a cultural 
exemption under the MAI there are serious problems for Canada. We 
have an investment agreement and a treaty with the United States 
and Mexico called the NAFTA. We have a cultural exemption under 
the NAFTA but I wonder if the member recognizes that the cultural 
exemption also provides for the United States to retaliate in 
equivalent measure for any protectionist measure we take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that most cultural people in the industry seem to think 
the threat is coming from the United States, I am wondering about 
the logic of this because the NAFTA is going to stay in place no 
matter what we do in terms of the MAI. I am wondering if the 
member is not giving a little too much credence to the MAI.  The 
NAFTA is going to stay in place and it takes precedence in terms 
of the culture agreement with the United States in any case. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, we should not forget that one of 
our goals in NAFTA was to have a judicial body that could make 
binding rulings in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the softwood lumber dispute between Canada and the United 
States, for example. There did not seem to be a way out of this 
problem through discussions between our two countries. The free 
trade agreement provides for a set of rules to make this kind of 
decision and includes consultation mechanisms so that we can use 
an arbitration process if appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is but one way of reining in international agreements so 
that, in the future, decisions will be made in an appropriate 
and compassionate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other conditions are equally important. It is crucial for Quebec 
to get a clause protecting provincial jurisdictions. For as long 
as we are a part of Canada, if an agreement such as the MAI is 
signed without such a clause, it will be an encouragement for 
members opposite to resort to the same practice the Conservative 
government used to encroach upon our jurisdictions. They could 
also justify these intrusions under international agreements and 
say that, because of these, they have to take action in 
education and other sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is essential for us. To conclude, we believe the assessment 
we will make of the impact of globalization will depend not only 
on the wealth that it creates, but also on the distribution of 
this wealth between the people who live in the various countries 
that are involved in different trade relations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this context that the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
proposal by the youngest member in the House, the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, that a parliamentary committee be struck to look 
at the issue of the role and authority of governments with 
respect to the redistribution of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A debate on this scale cannot be partisan.  It is therefore with 
confidence that I urge my fellow members in the House to take an 
active role in the Bloc Quebecois' proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to read out the motion.  It goes 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House reiterate the 1989 commitment to eliminating 
child poverty by the year 2000, urge the government to act, and 
strike an all-party Special Parliamentary Committee with the main 
objective of considering Canadian parliamentarians' ability to 
narrow the gap between rich and poor in the new context created 
by the globalization of markets, because of the following facts: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) despite the economic growth of recent years, the gap 
between rich and poor continues to widen; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) the globalization of markets greatly affects governments' 
ability to develop their countries' economies in accordance with 
their priorities; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) globalization and the international agreements that frame 
it, particularly the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) 
as now written, may limit some of governments' powers and 
consequently those of the representatives elected to this House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by recalling the observation of one of this 
century's great thinkers, Fernand Dumont, who said, in <I>Raisons 
communes</I>, that “Problems do not go away because we have talked 
about them too much; they persist because we have not resolved 
them”.  He was right, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, in our ridings, we are constantly reminded of the 
increase in poverty by the very people who suffer because of 
that problem. Every day, the fact that poverty is on the rise is 
reported by the media and by members in the House of Commons. 
Since we came to the House in 1993, this issue has been a 
priority of the Bloc Quebecois. It is an ongoing concern among 
our members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for statistics, they leave no room for argument. They show 
that, despite economic growth, the gap between the rich and the 
poor continues to grow rapidly. A study from the national forum 
on family security concluded that, between 1981 and 1991, in the 
bottom 20% of the income scale, $25,000 or less, incomes dropped 
by $400 million. 
In the middle income group, between $39,000 and $54,200, incomes 
dropped by $2.7 billion. However, in the top 20% of the income 
scale, $74,000 or more, incomes increased by $6.6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the situation elsewhere? In 1992, the wealthiest 20% of 
the population in the United States had an income that was 11 
times higher than that of the poorest 20%, compared to seven and 
a half times in 1969. Internationally, the wealthiest 20% of the 
population have seen their share of the world income increase 
from 70% to 85% between 1960 and 1991, whereas the poorest 20% 
have seen their share drop from 2.3% to 1.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But beyond these statistics, there is pain. There are children 
who are hungry and parents who are desperate because they cannot 
give them what they need. There are young people who are 
reluctant to bring children into this world because they are in 
dire financial straits. 
Do we have the right to remain silent and to continue to include 
in our legislation what really amounts to the social and 
economic exclusion of an important part of our collective 
wealth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People looking for a job must not be reduced to developing 
productive resources. They are human beings who want to take an 
active part in economic growth. It is in this perspective that 
we must reflect on the globalization of trade and, particularly, 
on the multilateral agreement on investment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization is more than a theory or an ideology. It is a 
reality we see every day. Whether we like it or not, rising to a 
changing and knowledge based international environment has 
become the main concern of industrial strategies and national 
economic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is aware of this reality. That is why we 
agree with the MAI principle, which is aimed essentially at 
defining a legal framework for alleviating the uncertainty 
associated with investing in a foreign country by making it an 
obligation to implement the same measures for national and 
foreign businesses, to promote investment and, at the same time, 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before we support this agreement, we must get right to the 
bottom of an aspect of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. 
I would like to raise one of the aspects that concerns me the 
most, that is the increasing impoverishment of people and the 
gap between rich and poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social clause is the most important aspect for me today and 
I would like to stress it. I know there are others claimed by 
the Bloc and by the Canadian people, but the social clause is 
the one that would allow us to have a better control so that the 
gap between rich and poor would not deepen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, OECD union organizations have been calling for the 
inclusion, in all trade agreements, of a social clause 
committing countries to respecting the seven fundamental 
conventions of the International Labour Organization. 
What is at stake here is the freedom of association, the right 
to collective bargaining, the ban on forced labour and job 
discrimination, among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, I know 
that the preamble to the report does mention the attachment of 
signatory states to the 1992 Rio Declaration. But how can such 
an undertaking be taken seriously when it is known for a fact 
that the United States ratified only one convention out of seven 
and that Canada has signed only four of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may fear that this agreement on investment could be signed 
without a social clause. Instead, we would like the investment 
treaty to be negotiated under the auspices of the World Trade 
Organization, because it is more representative. 
At the moment, the OECD has only 29 member states, while the WTO 
has 130. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wants more transparency and I think it has 
the support of the people. We want more transparency because we 
know that the people are very concerned and did not have a say 
in this agreement which will probably be signed next fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More transparency is needed. This agreement must generate more 
local benefits and some guaranteed net benefits for the 
countries involved in increasing capital flow. The people must 
be the first to benefit from any increase in capital flow. We 
are well aware of the problems associated with some agreements 
that may not be complied with. Capital outflows could be 
catastrophic for some of the countries involved in this 
agreement. 
National economies would become more vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safeguards must be in place to avoid abuses and to ensure that 
this agreement benefits people. I strongly support the motion 
tabled this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I was elected, child poverty and the impoverishment of the 
people have been at the heart of all my comments and speeches in 
this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I learned that two young people in Bonaventure killed 
a senior citizen.  Many will say that is the way young people 
are, but that is not true. As parliamentarians, we have a 
responsibility that we very often fail to assume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have to do what Martin Luther King did?  Everyone is still 
talking about it years later.  What did he do?  He got directly 
involved.  Do we have to do what Monsignor Romero or Terry Fox 
did? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have to do?  As parliamentarians we can see that 
although we are needed it is sometimes hard to get an idea 
across 
and to open hearts and minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean, who I also congratulate, and of 
whom I am very proud, has raised a question.  I would say it is 
a non-partisan question: Can something be done for young people? 
Can something be done for older people?  Can something be done 
for the people in our ridings?  That is what we are after.  That 
is why we were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not want to be passionate.  I wanted to remain very calm 
today, for the subject to remain above partisan politics.  It 
must appeal to our hearts and minds.  We have to loosen the 
purse strings.  Perhaps we should be the first to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, without a debate, if there is not an actual committee 
responsible for 
weighing the pros and cons, and especially possible approaches, 
what means do we have at our disposal in the next two years to 
ease the situation a bit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has often said that Canada is a rich country. 
It is.  The wealth is there, but who holds it?  Twenty per cent 
of the people who are starving come from our ridings, and it 
hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague spoke of the next ten years, I want to ask about 
the period up to 2000.  How could we get people some help? 
There are petitions, of course, but is there anything else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier, I said that 
globalization is more than just a theory or an ideology, it is 
an everyday reality. My hon. colleague talked about the sadness 
and despair he often sees among his fellow citizens, at least 
among those who do not have a decent salary, because there are 
no jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the fact that this issue can be addressed in the House 
of Commons, that we are having a debate and that the people can 
take part is indeed a good thing. I think we are about to sign 
an agreement the people have never heard of before and even us, 
as members of Parliament, have not had the opportunity to 
discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people will have to be heard on this issue. I invite all my 
constituents to express their concerns about this agreement. We 
will have to further inform the people of all the issues the 
agreement will likely raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked earlier about the flow of capital. There could be 
flights of capital. It happens when, for some reason, agreements 
that have been signed are not honoured. In such cases it is the 
population that suffers the very serious consequences of a loss 
of investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore this issue has to be taken seriously. I am glad to see 
that we can discuss the MIA. We could bring it up with our 
constituents. We will see, with the passing months, what the 
people think about the agreement and what are the reservations 
that the various countries could put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to respect the particularities of the various 
countries. Here, in Canada, we know that some of the provinces 
have particularities that are not mentioned in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to live with the globalization of the markets, but we 
also have to take into consideration the capacity of the 
countries to evolve in tune with this huge globalization 
phenomenon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today in response to the Bloc Quebecois motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the next few minutes, I will be emphasizing that, in its 
latest budget, our government has taken effective, targeted 
action to maintain and improve the situation of low and middle 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget marks the beginning of a broad based tax relief 
effort comprised of two major initiatives and designed to 
maintain targeted relief for those who need it most and in areas 
where the greatest benefits will be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years, the measures contained in the budget 
will translate into $7 billion in tax relief benefiting mostly 
low and middle income taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relief will be small at first, as the fiscal dividend it comes 
from will itself be small. We will not make tax cuts that risk 
compromising neither the fiscal health we have just restored nor 
the priorities identified by Canadians, including health care, 
education and public pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, in accordance with this country's priorities, the 
government will start by reducing the taxes paid by those who 
can least afford them: low and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first of the two broad based tax relief initiatives consists 
in increasing the non taxable income of Canadians who earn a 
small income. 
Currently the basic personal exemption is $6,456, while the 
married exemption and the equivalent to married exemption cannot 
be more than $5,380. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provides for a $500 increase of these amounts for low 
income Canadians, as a result the amount of income taxpayers can 
receive on a tax-free basis will be increased by $500 for a 
single person earning less than $20,000, and by $1,000 for 
families earning less than $40,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure, which is to come into force July 1, 1998, will 
take 400,000 low-income Canadians off the tax rolls and reduce 
taxes for an additional 4.6 million Canadians. The income tax 
relief will amount to $85 for single taxpayers, and to a maximum 
of $170 for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the budget provides for the elimination of the 3% 
general surtax for Canadians with incomes up to about $50,000. 
This surtax, a tax on tax created in 1986 to help reduce the 
deficit, will be lowered for Canadians with incomes between 
$50,000 and around $65,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this measure, which will come into force on July 
1, 1998,, close to 13 million taxpayers will pay no federal 
surtax in 1999, and another one million Canadians will see a 
significant reduction in their surtax liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two measures provide for a very progressive distribution 
of tax relief since the biggest tax relief, as compared to 
current taxes, will go to taxpayers with the lowest income. For 
example, singles earning $30,000 a year will see their tax 
burden reduced by 3%, while singles earning $50,000 a year will 
receive a 2.4% tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A family with an annual income of $30,000 will get a 31% 
reduction, while for a family earning $50,000 taxes will fall by 
3.3%. As a result, a family earning $30,000 will see its total 
federal income taxes falling to about $300 or about 1% of its 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to previous budgets, the 1998 budget provides for targeted 
tax relief for those who need it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian Opportunities Strategy, for the first time 
ever, interest payments on student loans will be deductible.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure will be extended to all students and will benefit 
more than one million people. For example, for a student with a 
typical debt, this measure will mean a federal and provincial 
tax reduction of almost $530 the first year and of up to $3,200 
over a ten year paydown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also proposes several measures that will allow 
Canadians to improve their qualifications, for instance the 
extension of the education credit to part time students. A part 
time student taking two eligible courses will be able to save 
$120 in taxes. 
This measure will reduce the costs associated with education and 
will facilitate continuing education for over 250,000 part time 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of the expenses associated with education and to 
promote continuing education, the government will now allow part 
time students to claim the child care expense deduction. This 
measure, which will affect about 50,000 part time students, will 
allow a parent with two children who is taking two courses to 
save about $550 in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, these two measures will more than triple, from $300 to 
almost $1,000 a year, the tax savings for a typical part time 
student with two children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To support continuing education, the budget also proposes to 
allow Canadians to make tax free withdrawals from their RRSPs to 
finance full time education and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers will be able to withdraw, tax free, up to $10,000 a 
year, without exceeding $20,000 over a four year period. To 
preserve their retirement incomes, taxpayers will have to 
reimburse these withdrawals over a ten year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support measures for families are also included in the budget. 
For example, there is an increase of the child care expense 
deduction from $5,000 to $7,000 for children under age 7, and 
from $3,000 to $4,000 for children aged 7 to 16. A parent with 
two preschool children will have his or her taxes reduced by 
$1,600. This measure takes into account the child care expenses 
paid by full time working parents and will benefit 65,000 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget contains another family support measure. It adds 
$850 million to the $850 million increase in the child tax 
credit announced in the 1997 budget, to come into effect in July 
1998. This will be introduced in two stages. The first calls for 
$425 million more per year, starting July 1999, and the second 
the identical amount in July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also plans a credit for natural caregivers, which 
will decrease the combined federal and provincial tax by $600 
for those taking care of an aged parent or a disabled relative. 
Some 450,000 natural caregivers, who would not normally be 
eligible for the disabled dependent credit, will benefit from 
this assistance. 
In addition, a GST and HST exemption will apply to expenses 
incurred in providing temporary assistance to a person whose 
self-sufficiency is limited through disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to encourage the hiring of young people aged 18 to 24, 
employers will pay no EI contributions for new jobs created for 
young people in 1999 and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add, before closing,  that I will share my 
remaining time with the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the reduction in employers' contributions to 
employment insurance, which have been dropped to $2.70 per $100 
of insurable earnings since January 1, 1998, this measure marks 
an important step in facilitating job creation for young 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to treat self-employed workers and limited companies 
more fairly, the budget proposes that Canadian self-employed 
individuals may, starting this year, deduct their contributions 
to health and dental insurance plans from business income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to add that globalization definitely 
poses considerable challenges to our society. The technological 
progress of the past two decades outstrips that of the entire 
last century.  The 1998 Liberal budget reflects this phenomenon 
by proposing targeted tax relief and by building a solid economy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but 
her time is up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a bit 
surprised at what the member had to say.  I thought we were 
talking about the MAI and its impact on the gap between the rich 
and poor. What I heard sounded like a budget being brought in. 
It was as though the Minister of Finance were making his budget 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of self-congratulation we often hear from the 
members opposite when it comes time to hold a debate.  They are 
always telling us how wonderful they are, as though we were 
living in the most wonderful country in the world and had no 
problems here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has child poverty increased?  It is certainly not because of 
everything the government has done.  I will take my cue from the 
member opposite.  If she wants to refer to the budget, I too can 
play at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is her opinion of the non-indexation of the child tax 
benefit, of the personal tax tables, of the tightened EI 
eligibility criteria, of the cuts in the Canada social transfer 
that have taken a serious toll on the public?  The end result is 
that the public is worse off.  Not once did I hear the member 
expressing any concern over the agreement being signed.  Is she 
not concerned about the various provisions.  The member did not 
point to one provision that concerned her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two criticisms of what she said.  First, I do not think 
the government has anything to crow about.  Second, I would have 
liked her to tell me which provisions in the MAI caused her the 
most concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer the member's 
question. What surprises me in her criticism is that she does 
not seem to understand the role played by the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the government is to help people. How does it do 
that? It does it mainly through its budget. The budget is the 
most important element because, as we all know, it controls the 
allocation of moneys to the various departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have tried to demonstrate in the speech I just made in 
this House is how our government is responsible, how it pays 
special attention to the poorest, to young Canadians who need 
money to pursue their education. As a government, it is our 
responsibility to meet the needs of young people and low income 
families, those with very low salaries, and that is exactly what 
I have tried to demonstrate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is an interesting debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member who just spoke used a lot of facts and in 
some respects was talking about the budget.  We should examine 
that a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that has been brought up here is child poverty and 
globalization.  In terms of poverty, would the member agree that 
something should have been done in the last budget for the over 
2.5 million Canadians who are still paying taxes to the federal 
government and earning less than $15,000 a year?  In fact the 
1997-98 fiscal year which ended on March 31 would have had a 
surplus of over $4.5 billion if the government had not decided to 
spend it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member is getting some coaching from her colleague but 
that is all right.  Maybe together the two of them can figure out 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me it would have been an opportune time to have some 
tax relief for low income Canadians, to take them off the tax 
rolls altogether.  What is required are good paying jobs. People 
who are not in the category of having high paying jobs should not 
have the extra difficulty of having to pay federal taxes on an 
income that is very low, $15,000 or less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with me on that? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to that comment 
by saying that poverty is a very serious issue and a basic 
concern of our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat what I have already said. Let us not forget that, 
thanks to our budget, 400,000 people will not be paying any 
taxes next year. Those are the very people referred to by the 
member, that is people with extremely low salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind the member that our fundamental task and our 
first priority this year has been to reduce the deficit. Not 
only have we reduced it, but we have eliminated it completely. 
It was a monumental task, and I am very proud of our 
achievement. We would like to do more— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but the time provided for 
questions and comments has expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to debate the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois has presented the House 
with a rather broad sweeping motion.  I will direct my comments 
at the portion of the motion dealing with the elimination of 
child poverty which falls within my specific mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While families have the primary responsibility to nurture their 
children, they are not alone in this critical undertaking.  The 
healthy development of our children requires the attention and 
collaboration of parents with territorial and provincial 
governments and the private and voluntary sectors.  The 
Government of Canada is most certainly prepared to do its part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume the hon. member was in the House during last 
September's Speech from the Throne.  If he was he would know that 
the Government of Canada is working with its provincial and 
territorial partners to build a comprehensive and effective 
national child benefit system.  During the Speech from the Throne 
the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois would have heard the 
government reiterate its commitment to “ensure that all Canadian 
children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full 
potential”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that there is a real need to demonstrate this 
by one stark statistic.  Eighty-five per cent of single parents 
are women and 65% of them live in poverty.  Other groups are 
equally affected, such as aboriginal youth and disabled youth and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech went on to say that the government has already 
demonstrated its commitment to the well-being of our children in 
part by increasing our contribution to the Canada child tax 
benefit by $850 million during the course of this mandate.  This 
was not hollow rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate if some members find the budget to be 
something reprehensible.  Most of the initiatives for human 
development are directed at children and families in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government demonstrated its intent quite clearly in the 
budget by repeating its commitment to increase the child tax 
benefit by an additional $850 million.  That is $850 million on 
top of the $850 million we committed to the Canada child tax 
benefit in the 1997 budget.  This is already an increase in 
advance of what we had planned to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will live up to this commitment in a fiscally 
responsible manner.  The $850 million committed in the 1997 
budget will come into effect July 1 this year.  Of the new 
funding, $425 million will be allocated in July 1999.  The 
remaining $425 million will come into play in July 2000. That is 
a total Government of Canada commitment of $1.7 billion to try to 
help in part fight child poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member that this investment demonstrates quite 
clearly the government's commitment to do as much as it possibly 
can to move toward the elimination of child poverty in Canada. 
This in real terms is action.  In the meantime, while we are 
working with our partners in planning these new strategies the 
government already has a number of programs in place to assist 
children and their families.  I would like to bring a few of 
those programs to the attention of members.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The child care visions program was created in 1995.  This 
national program for research on child care and development is 
administered by Human Resources Development Canada. The program 
supports research and evaluation projects to study current child 
care practices and delivery of services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget increased resources by $100 million over the 
next three years for two existing community based programs that 
benefit children at risk.  These are the community action program 
for children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at the midpoint of a national tour on youth and children 
which will go to every province and both territories visiting and 
consulting with all stakeholders for children and youth. I have 
seen many, many wonderful programs, successful programs at the 
community level undertaken with the priorities as demonstrated by 
the people. Just yesterday I was in Quebec and Verdun visiting 
some stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community action program for children responds to the United 
Nations convention on the rights of the child and helps community 
groups address health and social needs of at risk children up to 
six years of age.  This program will allow communities all across 
Canada to design projects most relevant to the needs of children 
in their communities.  It provides a variety of services such as 
toy lending libraries, infant stimulation, parenting education 
and support, and integrated services through family resource and 
child development centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the development of the national children's agenda and 
such programs as Health Canada's prenatal nutrition program, we 
can also begin to address issues such as fetal alcohol syndrome 
and fetal alcohol effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be most advisable to undertake the appropriate steps to 
ensure that we have some kind of capacity in the name of a 
national advisory committee for that, as well as to undertake a 
number of strategically appointed pilot projects that would deal 
with not only identifying but relating these to issues that 
affect things such as young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my capacity as Secretary of State for Children and Youth, I 
have begun discussions with street youth, street youth workers 
and health care professionals on possible approaches to the 
issues of street youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue which affects street youth is that because they lack 
an address, street youth cannot enter any kind of training 
program.  They cannot enlist in any kind of government service or 
program. This is very important. A mechanism should be instituted 
by which street youth will be able to give information that is 
satisfactory to various learning institutions which will allow 
them to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to be concerned about the security of these youth. 
These young people are someone's children and they are our 
country's children. While not being able to resolve this 
overnight, we should be able to provide some security for them, 
some kind of clearing house mechanism where they can have the 
time to make decisions.  Some of these young people actually have 
children as well.  Security is a big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations and Inuit child care initiative helps to bring 
the quality and quantity of child care services for aboriginal 
communities in line with child care services available to the 
general population.  The Government of Canada is providing $72 
million over three years to help create 4,300 new child care 
spaces and improve some 1,700 existing spaces.  We also have 
committed $36 million annually to maintain the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that these programs and any others that may be 
developed are effective, it is necessary to gather up to date 
information on the social condition of Canadian children. To that 
end Statistics Canada and Human Resources Development Canada are 
currently engaged in the national longitudinal survey of children 
and youth. 
This is a long term study which revisits individuals every two 
years from birth to adulthood.  It presents an integrated picture 
of their lives.  The data we are gathering is assisting us in 
planning future programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the initiatives I have mentioned, we are collaborating 
with our provincial and territorial partners in working toward 
establishing a national children's agenda.  The agenda will be a 
broad comprehensive strategy to improve the well-being of 
Canada's children. The agenda's impetus will ensure that all 
Canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop 
to their full potential as healthy, successful and contributing 
members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this national agenda we will expand our aboriginal 
head start program to on reserve children.  We will measure the 
readiness of Canadian children to learn.  We will establish 
centres of excellence for children's well-being. Federal, 
provincial and territorial governments will work together to 
fully develop the national children's agenda, one of the most 
significant social policy initiatives in 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other programs I could speak to.  Yesterday in 
Verdun I had the opportunity to visit the children and youth 
centre Toujours ensemble.  It is a wonderful centre. I encourage 
members opposite to visit it. It demonstrates the excellent 
initiatives people undertake when they are adequately resourced

carefully to the speeches by the member for Laval West and by 
the minister.  I think anyone who defends themself for 20 
minutes when no criticism has been leveled at them must have 
something to hide.  We have not accused them of anything, but 
they defended themselves for 20 minutes.  Something is not quite 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said the Bloc Quebecois motion was all over the 
place and all muddled.  I will help her out with a reminder.  We 
want to create a special committee to examine the disparity 
between the rich and the poor.  That is not so very complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two very simple questions for the minister. First, has 
the number of poor children increased or decreased since the 
Liberals have been in government?  Second, why is she opposed to 
creating an all party special committee to consider the problem 
of the gap between the rich and the poor? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not a person 
who is usually against very much.  What I am in favour of is what 
the government has consistently been doing.  That is, throughout 
all the successive budgets since 1993 when we became government, 
there are two areas where we have not reduced funding, where we 
have built programs consistently.  We have enforced and expanded 
programs dealing with children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I did not state that that was confusing.  I said 
that it was broad sweeping, that it pulled in such issues as the 
multilateral agreement on investment and the globalization of 
markets affecting the government's ability to develop the 
country's economies in accordance with its priorities. These are 
all broad assumptions and are broad sweeping issues that do not 
directly relate to my mandate.  My mandate deals with les enfants 
et la jeunesse. In that mode I wanted to talk about something 
that is relevant to my mandate, the elimination of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the throne speech and the budget, the programs 
instituted, the prenatal nutrition program, the community action 
plan for children.  I do not know whether the member opposite has 
bothered but I have gone to the grassroots level, to the various 
communities not just in Liberal held ridings but to various 
places. I have seen the programs.  They are excellent programs. I 
advise the member to visit them as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in the practice of setting quotas or targets that we 
cannot meet.  We put all our efforts into eliminating and trying 
to reduce unemployment.  We have done that.  We have gone from 
double digit to a single digit unemployment figure.  That says 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also created an opportunity for people by way of 
reducing and eliminating the deficit on top of trying to do what 
we can for poor people.  We are not continually putting pressure 
back on the taxpayers of Canada.  I think that speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about numbers but we cannot achieve anything if we 
do not put a concerted effort into something, which we have done 
consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the hon. member to read the budget.  It was an 
education budget.  I do not know if she recalls but the media 
were calling the Minister of Finance the minister of education 
because of the budget he put before parliament.  I encourage the 
member to look at all the granting systems and the millennium 
scholarship fund.  Much debated they were, but they were 
necessary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to the motion today.  I was somewhat 
amused when I looked at the television broadcast of this debate 
and saw the line underneath the picture indicating “elimination 
of poverty”.  I thought some might say we have reached a point 
of arrogance to assume we in the House will eliminate all 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some comments regarding the motion which I would like to 
share.  The particular motion proposes to eliminate the gap 
between the rich and the poor and to eliminate child poverty 
through government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some individuals these are noble sounding goals, but Reform 
would take issue with how the Bloc and others in the House 
propose to achieve these goals.  Often the method and the 
determination of the outcome are more critical than just lofty 
sounding goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some feel the answer to these problems is more megagovernment 
programs, more government make work projects, more protectionism, 
more bureaucracy, more taxes, more debt and a more unfocused 
federal government, more of the old vision of how a government 
should work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because this has not worked that Reform takes a different 
view of how these issues should be addressed.  Reform would point 
out that we have been through the age of megagovernment programs 
and it has not worked.  It certainly has not eliminated the 
problems.  The Bloc obstensibly says that this is an attempt to 
address the issue.  Instead of eliminating poverty or the gap 
between the rich and the poor, what has been the result of 
megagovernment that the Bloc seems to wish to promote today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short list would include a $600 billion debt, the highest 
taxes in the industrialized world, one-third of every tax dollar 
going to interest on the national debt, job insecurity for many 
Canadians, almost one in five of our trained young people not 
finding work, and a brain drain of our brightest to better 
opportunities in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do better but more of the same and bigger government 
are not the answer.  This megagovernment vision which the Bloc 
and others in the House seem to support has resulted in low and 
single income individuals and families paying higher levels of 
taxation with the hope of getting some back through some 
government program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after the latest budget an individual starts paying taxes 
at approximately $7,000.  Surely such individuals cannot be 
classified as rich, but the government still forces them to hand 
over their income to their megagovernment so that perhaps their 
megagovernment can think of some sort of bureaucracy growing 
program for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual earning $29,000 will pay about 20% of his income 
to the federal government in personal income tax, employment 
insurance and CPP premiums. 
This total does not include the Liberals' beloved GST or any 
provincial taxes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A megagovernment comes up with megaproposals and megaprograms 
which are not easily tailorable to the needs of individuals. 
Given the diversity of the needs of the regions in Canada, the 
big brother approach does not meet people where they are at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example might be the child tax benefit.  One can agree there 
is value in recognizing the increased costs of raising a child, 
but we can take issue with how it is recognized by the 
government.  It is important to recognize the responsibility of 
raising children.  In the words of supreme court Justice La 
Forest: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage has from time immemorial been firmly grounded in our 
legal tradition, one that is itself a reflection of longstanding 
philosophical and religious traditions.  But ultimately its 
raison d'etre transcends all these and is firmly anchored in the 
biological and social realities that couples have the unique 
ability to procreate, that children are the product of these 
relationships, and that they are generally cared for and nurtured 
by those who live in that relationship. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family is an important relationship.  The child tax benefit 
essentially takes money from families with children through taxes 
today.  Then one year later they are sent a cheque.  This is a 
year after they filed and paid their taxes.  Would it not be 
easier to simplify the process and simply reduce their tax bill 
at source in the first place and eliminate much of the 
bureaucracy involved in processing the program?  Let the family 
have the money in the month it is earned and not a year later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a family in my riding, the Lucas family, that shared 
with me a story of how there was an error in the child tax 
benefit the family received.  Revenue Canada sent a cheque for 
$1,000 and said “We underpaid you on the child tax benefit”. 
This is a poor family that is just starting out with one young 
child and another one on the way.  This was a windfall, $1,000 
out of the blue.  The family enjoyed the $1,000 by spending it on 
some immediate needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three months later the family got a letter from Revenue Canada 
saying it was an overpayment on the child tax benefit and now the 
$1,000 had to be paid back.  The stress it put on that family I 
cannot begin to fully articulate today.  However after many calls 
and many appeals to the taxman the family was allowed to pay so 
much off a month.  It put tremendous stress on the family.  In 
researching the whole situation it was not the only family that 
had been ground up in this bureaucratic nightmare.  In fact there 
were many families across Canada.  It is the height of 
administrative bureaucracy when it loses touch with the impacts 
it is having on everyday people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of complexity adds to the burden of taxation and 
administration that families have to carry.  Not only have taxes 
become the greatest expense in the family budget, but it has 
become a family expense just to file an income tax return because 
it is so complex.  There are 600 pages in the act and 700 pages 
of special interpretations.  The Income Tax Act and the special 
interpretations that go with it are thicker than most phone books 
and it started out as a 36 page document to fund the war effort. 
Bureaucracy has gone crazy and it is impacting on families.  The 
bottom line is that more government intervention in recent years 
has worked against the family and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Reform's vision?  Reform has pointed out that the old 
vision of megagovernment just is not working.  This is the vision 
which has us working half the year just to pay the tax bill.  The 
old vision of the current government promised job creation and 
social justice.  That is what it promised but it delivers chronic 
unemployment, chronic poverty and youth crime.  It is a vision 
which promises national unity through national programs and 
national standards but delivers friction, disunity, 
non-accountability, duplication and waste.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Current government vision trivializes the individual, family and 
community contributions by implying that only through government 
programs, government spending and government propaganda can the 
country be held together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's vision is that of a country defined and built by its 
citizens rather than by its government.  It is a vision of 
smaller government and lower taxes.  It is a vision that reaches 
out to the initiative, drive and diversity of Canadians and calls 
upon individuals, families and communities to lead the way to 
growth, progress and unity.  It allows families and communities 
to enjoy the fruits of their labours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to address child poverty is to address the needs of 
the family.  This may be attained through jobs for parents or 
youth.  This can be achieved through lower taxes and less 
bureaucracy.  Children are members of families in the care of 
their parents.  They are not disconnected free agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes that we can best help families by simplifying 
and reducing the burden of government on them and by showing that 
they make an important contribution to the health of our country. 
More than that, Reform would point out that we need to better 
respect the autonomy of families and not undermine these 
relationships by driving a wedge between parents and their 
children or between husbands and wives with greater government 
intervention in family relationships.  That is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just my comments.  These positions are written 
into the policies, statements and documents of the Reform Party. 
We affirm in our statements the duty of parents to raise their 
children responsibly, according to their own conscience and 
beliefs.  We further affirm that no person, government or agency 
has any right to interfere in the exercise of that duty as long 
as the actions of parents do not constitute abuse or neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than saying we need bigger government and the higher 
taxes that go along with it, Reform is saying that we need 
smaller government.  The money earned by families is best left in 
their pockets, the pockets of those who know how best to spend it 
to address their needs and those of their children.  Children can 
be best served by those closest to them, that is parents and not 
governments.  Parents know best how to address the needs of their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the publicity stunt we saw performed by the Bloc 
Quebecois member who carried his chair out of the House in 
protest.  It is interesting that he did this to demonstrate the 
government's ineffectiveness in addressing child poverty and the 
gap between the rich and the poor— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member still has well over nine minutes 
in his time, but seeing that it is almost two o'clock and I want 
to lay a report upon the table, I wonder if he would cede the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
has been much discussion about the rationale used by Canada's 
government in deciding on a collaborative approach to hepatitis C 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Krever commission delivered its report, the federal 
government has been working very hard to find a solution to this 
difficult problem.  When Justice Krever presented governments 
with the facts it became clear that many of the hepatitis C 
infections between 1986 and 1990 might not have happened if 
things had been done differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beginning of 1986 was when surrogate testing was first used 
on a national scale in the United States.  To ignore that 
benchmark date would lead us to an unsustainable rationale for 
offering assistance.  Even after 1986 the science of hepatitis C 
was still unsettled and indeed it is still evolving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who claim governments should ignore such benchmark dates 
altogether are perhaps arguing for some sort of retroactive 
scheme which would eventually apply to all health care harms 
suffered by Canadians.

No amount of money can ease the pain of those who have been 
infected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting the current agreement we are acting responsibly by 
providing assistance to those infected between 1986 and 1990. For 
those not covered in the current agreement we have a collective 
responsibility to find ways to ensure their needs are met.

quality of life for every victim.  As long as there is one victim 
suffering we still have work to do.

when Canada's health ministers announced the compensation package

to learn yesterday of the death of Monsignor Juan Girardi, the 
Guatemalan assistant archbishop and human rights activist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monsignor Girardi, who was brutally assassinated, had just 
presented a scathing report on the holocaust suffered by the 
Guatemalan people during the civil war that lasted over 36 
years. His death could jeopardize the fragile peace accords 
signed by the factions a year and a half ago.

workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>April 28 is the international day of mourning for injured and 
fallen workers and it is recognized by more than 70 countries 
around the world.  Last year the United Nations conducted 
ceremonies to commemorate the international day of mourning at 
its headquarters in New York City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a civilized and developed nation and yet today three 
more Canadian workers will die on the job and the same will be 
true tomorrow and the day after.  In fact, 1,000 Canadian workers 
a year will die at work and almost a million more will suffer 
some form of lost time due to injury, sickness or occupational 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian workers get up in the morning to earn a living, not to 
be injured, butchered or maimed on behalf of some arbitrary

enforcement of our health and safety legislation?

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You need to hear this from my heart.  I live with hepatitis C 
every day, and don't think it's easy to live with somebody who 
has only days to live.  Hepatitis C has destroyed his liver. 
Every day I watch him fading away—preparing myself for his 
death not being able to get physically close.  How extraordinary 
considering that my husband has worked his whole life to support 
the health care system.  The system gave him this disease and now 
at 47 his only recourse is $700 a month on disability.  You've 
taken away his health, you've have taken away his will and now 
you take away his dignity.

over 50 of them fatally.

503 deaths, making farming the most dangerous occupation in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, tonight's vote is about real people like Ronald Thiel of 
Saanichton, B.C. who was infected with hepatitis C through 
tainted blood when he had a heart valve replaced in 1983. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His liver is badly damaged.  He had to stop working at age 53. 
He has suffered many medical complications which have made his 
life a misery.  He writes “I know that I am dying before my time 
but I have no intention of going to my grave without fighting 
this injustice as long as I can”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Thiel speaks for all excluded hepatitis C victims when he 
paraphrases Shakespeare.  “If you prick us, do we not bleed?  If 
you tickle us, do we not laugh?  If you poison us, do we not die? 
If you wrong us, do we not revenge?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot escape its responsibility.  The victims of 
the tainted blood scandal and the people of Canada will one day 
require justice.  But how much more honourable, how much more 
noble it would be for this parliament to offer compassion to the 
suffering today, rather than be forced to do so by the heavy hand 
of the law tomorrow.

Speaker, tonight MPs have a chance to vote in favour of 
compensating all those victims who contracted hepatitis C from 
tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister says that the government should not accept 
responsibility for victims prior to 1986 because there was no way 
to detect hepatitis C in the blood supply before that time. 
However, Justice Krever says that there was a test available to 
the government as far back as 1981 and the government never 
acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government again, in the name of justice, why will it 
not simply let MPs vote for these victims tonight? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

federal government and all the provincial governments and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition parties are silent and do not criticize the 
provincial governments for being part of this agreement, then 
logically and credibly they should not be attacking the federal 
government for being part of the same agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is an irrelevant answer to a question that was 
never asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real arguments come from the health minister.  He keeps on 
repeating that compensating hepatitis C victims would open up the 
legal floodgates to everyone, but that argument is also false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contracting hepatitis C from tainted blood was not some 
unavoidable accident.  What we are talking about is compensating 
people who became ill because of proven government negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again, in the name of compassion and fairness, why will 
the government not allow the MPs to vote for these victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why is it that since the last election the Reform Party 
did vote as a group on every measure except three times? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there is an argument for coherence on the part of the 
Reform Party.  Certainly there is the same argument when it comes 
to measures like this one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government has not only lost its head, it has lost 
its heart as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is forcing Liberals who got involved in politics to build a 
just society to be unjust.  It is forcing Liberals who profess 
compassion to vote against compassion.  It is forcing Liberals 
who know what is right in this case to vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is, why is the government forcing its members to 
vote against justice, compassion and against what they know in 
their hearts is right? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

interests and those of his party? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>

that is not true and this government knows it.

contracted this disease through government negligence and 
government negligence alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these Liberal backbenchers got involved in politics 
because they really cared.  They really thought that they would 
go to Ottawa and do the right thing.

the question at the heart of this matter is not the question put 
by the hon. member for his own reasons.  It is the question he 
refused to respond to in the debate last week, namely, should the 
public make cash payments to those injured through the health 
system where they were injured through no one's fault.  The 
answer to that has to be no.

<A NAME="LINK194">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your efforts and the challenges you have in the House. 
I gain appreciation for your position more and more all the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To carry on with my speech regarding the Bloc motion, I make 
reference to a publicity stunt we saw in the House some days back 
by a Bloc MP who carried his chair out of the House to protest 
government ineffectiveness in addressing child poverty and the 
gap between rich and poor. It is interesting that the Bloc comes 
back with this motion which proposes greater government 
intervention to address these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us continue to use this illustration or analogy 
with the chair.  We do not need more politicians establishing 
programs which tell families what kind of, for example, chair 
they should have, which is what the Bloc seems to be proposing. 
Rather, this decision should be left to parents. Give them back 
some of the resources they had so that they may decide what kind 
and what size of chair they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair that a child needs is best provided for and decided on 
by parents.  Parents and not government know what kind and size 
of chair their children need as they grow up. Going from that 
first chair with the hole in the middle, through the high chair, 
the stool up to a student's desk, parents are in the best 
position to make these decisions because they are closest to the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents know when to make the changes, big governments do not. 
Big government programs which promote a one size fits all 
approach serve to diminish the value of the individual and cost 
more than the benefit they deliver. The responsiveness of 
government is so slow and delivers a one size fits all solution 
that it never brings out the best of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the many Reform proposals to assist the family refers to 
changes to the negative tax treatment of families.  We would 
extend the child care deduction to all parents, including those 
who care for their children at home, and put this decision in the 
hands of those closest to their children. Let the parents decide 
how to raise their children.  It seems to make sense.  We would 
increase the spousal amount to level the playing field for 
parents who choose to stay at home to look after their children 
and help their families meet the needs of this demanding time we 
all live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this a good idea?  Research indicates this is good for 
children.  Polls indicate this is something parents intrinsically 
know and want.  I refer to some polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a research project done by the National Foundation of 
Family Research and Education, NFFRE, performed a comprehensive 
meta-analysis of current research on child development. According 
to NFFRE the core findings from this meta-analysis are that 
regular non-parental care for more than 20 hours per week has an 
unmistakably negative effect on social and emotional development, 
behaviour adjustment and the emotional bonding of young children 
to their parents.  In addition, the report stated parental care 
consistently and significantly outperformed regular non-parental 
care for children prior to five years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This high integrity research makes it clear that the best 
interests of infants and preschool children are served when they 
are in full time parent care. 
For many of us this is a “no brainer”, yet current government 
policies give tax incentives to institutionalized care but none 
to parental care.  It seems upside down to me.  It sends a 
message to parents that the work they are doing has no value. 
That is very destructive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, parent and family time is important and governments 
need to respect this if we are to preserve the health and 
happiness of our homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue with more poll information and studies that have 
been done, parents want to make families a priority.  I am 
referring to a national poll conducted by a research firm known 
as Compass Inc.  Fully 94% in this national poll of Canadians 
identified that lack of time spent with offspring has, at least, 
a somewhat serious stress on family life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 a cross-Canada poll conducted by Decima Research was the 
most comprehensive poll ever taken of Canadian women.  Women were 
asked:  “If you had the choice, would you stay at home to raise 
your children or work outside your home and use day care?”  Not 
surprisingly, 70% said they would rather stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, NFFRE submitted to the Government of Ontario a study it 
was contracted to do regarding child care.  By more than a 10 to 
1 margin, 92% of Ontarians said it is preferable for a young 
child to be at home with a parent than to be in institutionalized 
day care.  They do not see taxpayer funded government programs as 
being the answer for child care or the child poverty question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of parents who had put their children in non-parental care, 77% 
in this same study indicated they would have preferred to have 
provided parental care in retrospect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  No one is proposing that parents have to stay 
at home to raise their children.  That is not what I am saying. 
But surely the government should not penalize them when they do 
and that is the reality we are living with today.  This is doubly 
tragic when the polls underline the fact that parents want to 
stay at home and the research indicates that it is a good idea 
for the health of the child.  Why does our government policy so 
stringently work against something the people want, which makes 
so much sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform wants parents to be allowed to make the choice which best 
meets the needs of their family without tax unfairness. 
Unfortunately the government does not seem to get it.  In the 
last budget, for example, it increased the inequity stay-home 
parents suffer by raising the child care expense deduction by 
35%, refusing to recognize any value for stay-home parents.  It 
is tragic.  It is actually destructive.  It works against 
families and some children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the Bloc motion deals with child 
poverty in terms of material wealth.  As I have indicated, what 
many Reformers are concerned about is another form of poverty 
which many children are suffering, the poverty of lack of time 
with their parents, the lack of a consistent caregiver.  I could 
quote studies of the damage that does and the psychosis that 
develops in children when caregivers are constantly changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government has done much to add to this kind of poverty by the 
mega-government, tax and spend, government will fix everything 
philosophy that this motion subscribes to.  We need to focus on 
the well-being of the family and the whole child within the 
family; not just the material child, but the child who needs to 
spend time with their parents; not just the child alone, but the 
child and the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong families pass on our culture, language, heritage and 
values.  Strong families train future citizens.  In this context 
let us get it right and always remember that governments make 
poor parents, but strong Canadian families create good 
governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the 1996 national longitudinal survey on the health of children 
reported that some 25% of all children in Canada have some sort 
of health, educational or social problem.  The member is quite 
right when he identifies the need for us to invest in children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the possibility of extending the child care 
expense deduction to families who provide care in the home to 
preschool children and the possibility of a caregiver tax credit 
which would provide a similar benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bill coming forward on Thursday which deals with 
splitting income between spouses.  There are many ways to deliver 
these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not touch on probably one of the single largest 
reasons there is child poverty in Canada and that has to do with 
the breakdown of the Canadian family.  The Vanier Institute 
reported that lone parent families account for about 12% of all 
families, but they also account for about 46% of all children 
living in poverty.  I think the numbers are quite prevalent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that we talk a lot about child poverty 
when in fact the real issue is family poverty.  Child poverty is 
a political term.  Family poverty is the reality.  The family is 
in crisis in Canada with a 30% divorce rate and over a million 
common-law relationships which break down 50% more than married 
relationships.  This is leading to broken families and creating a 
most dangerous environment for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member whether he has any comments about this other 
important dimension concerning the manufacture of poverty in 
Canada by the breakdown of the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of the hon. member across the way.  I agree that the focus on 
child poverty is misplaced.  We are better to focus on the 
situation of the Canadian family overall if we really want to 
improve the lot of children.  They are not disembodied entities. 
They are part of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the Reform Party shares the concern about the stresses 
of the economy on families.  It is part of the reason that we see 
one of our critical mandates as being one of job creation.  The 
head of the family, whoever it may be, must be able to find a 
job.  We do not see increased government spending as the road to 
job creation, but lowering taxes and decreasing the bureaucracy 
on many of those small business people and others who provide 
jobs for people.  That is the road to a healthier economy which 
in turn will benefit the children within these families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one other point that we sometimes gloss over on 
this debate about the tax credit and recognition that is given to 
institutionalized care, but not to those who choose to care for 
their families at home.  More critical than the financial impact 
on these families is the subtle message that this sends to them 
if they choose to stay at home and care for their children. 
There are some sacrifices involved in that.  I realize not 
everybody wants to do it.  However, if they choose to do it the 
message they are getting from the policies we have today is that 
there is absolutely no value in it.  The government will not 
recognize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we send these subtle messages they serve to undermine the 
strength of the families and they serve, in part, to cause some 
of the family breakdown we have had.  That is why I think it is 
so critical that we not only worry about the financial impacts, 
but the message we are sending as far as the value of the 
parent-child bond.

make.  I did not vote no.  It was the member across the way.  I 
am always supportive of free votes in this House.  I recognized 
the question, so I wanted to clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the parliamentary committee is concerned, these things 
cost a lot of money.  I know, as do many hon. members, that there 
are some straightforward things we can do to correct current 
policy, things that do not cost anything, that can save taxpayers 
and that can impact immediately the family and the children in a 
positive way without incurring more taxpayers' money on more 
committees and that type of thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and 
Agri-Food)(Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if you 
would allow me, first, as a good Liberal, I would ask for 
permission to share my time with my colleague, the member for 
Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opposition colleagues do not seem to recognize the 
government's commitment or its previous record of improving the 
economy and giving our young people more job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said in our initial action plan for renewing the 
federation, entitled “Creating Opportunity” and repeated in the 
document “Securing our Future Together”, the future belongs to 
societies that have a dynamic economy, that look after public 
health, that promote child development and that invest in 
knowledge, education and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has clearly indicated that these are 
our values and priorities. Moreover, we are making progress in 
each of these sectors. My colleagues have already outlined some 
of our outstanding achievements in this regard, our exceptional 
results in putting our fiscal house in order and our increased 
investments in health care and in programs designed to reduce 
child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks will then focus first and foremost on the efforts 
made to help Canadians acquire the skills and knowledge that 
they will need to support competition in an ever changing world. 
We should not delude ourselves; the world is changing very 
rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technological revolution, the information society and the 
world economy are modern realities that go beyond our borders 
and over which we have no control as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economic opportunities increasingly depend on the 
skills and strengths of our labour force. As well, our quality 
of life depends on our ability to think, innovate and create in 
a world transformed by information and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who question this fundamental fact in the new economy only 
have to look at the present job situation. 
Since 1981, the number of jobs for Canadians with only a high 
school diploma has fallen by 2 million, while the number of jobs 
requiring more advanced skills has risen by more than 5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Canadians with higher education levels have better 
job opportunities, better job security and higher-paid jobs. The 
unemployment level for people without a high school diploma 
stands at 15%, while it is only 5% for university graduates. 
Training will help to reduce the gap between these two groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the cornerstone of the new Canada opportunities 
strategy is the Canada millennium scholarship program. 
I want to point out that more than 100,000 scholarships, funded 
through an initial endowment of $2.5 billion, will be granted 
each year to full—and part-time students during the first 10 
years of the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarship program will invest in the 
knowledge and creativity of young Canadian and improve their 
access to post-secondary education. The scholarships will average 
$3,000 a year per student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they choose to attend a cegep, a community college, a 
professional or technical institution or a university, students 
will be eligible to receive up to $15,000 over a four-year period 
to complete their education and get a diploma or a certificate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada opportunities strategy will help Canadians still in 
school or already in the workforce to increase their knowledge 
and their skills in order to improve their career opportunities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of adults who choose to go back to school full time 
is three times higher than it was 20 years ago. Most of them 
have made that decision because of work related reasons. The 
strategy will make this easier for a greater number of people. 
Starting on January 1, 1999, Canadians will be allowed to 
withdraw funds from their RRSPs tax free in order to go back to 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who have completed their education but are facing 
financial difficulties and find it hard to pay back their 
student loans, the Canadian opportunities strategy provides for 
more flexibility as well as interest relief. 
Interest relief on Canada student loans means that the Canadian 
government will make interest payments for up to 30 months after 
the completion of the student's education. The income threshold 
to qualify for relief is $20,460. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families are encouraged to save a little bit of money each month 
for their children's education. The Canada education savings 
grant will help them. Families that contribute to a registered 
education savings plan will receive a 20% grant from the 
Canadian government for the first $2,000 in contributions. Small 
savings today could pave the way to a brilliant future in 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these measures will bring about sustainable and meaningful 
improvements and will be a very effective and tangible way to 
fight poverty. 
The Canadian opportunities strategy will be a great contribution 
to the fight against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy will make post-secondary education more accessible 
by helping needy students overcome the problem of higher 
education costs. We will be giving more help to students who 
have to support dependents, to part-time students and to those 
who conduct advanced research or go pursue graduate studies 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will help students pay back their student loans. We will help 
families save money for their children's education. We will 
encourage employers to hire young people, and we will help a 
greater number of students take advantage of information 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian opportunities strategy introduced in the last 
budget and our employment insurance system are two good examples 
of how the federal government devotes its energy to helping 
Canadians adjust to changes on the job market in the 1990s and 
take advantage of opportunities in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to create more opportunities for Canadians, and 
young Canadians in particular, to succeed in the new knowledge 
based economy. I therefore urge the hon. members to recognize 
the action taken by this government to help reduce the income 
spread between Canadians and fight poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Theodore Roosevelt who said that those who build the 
future are the ones who do something, not those who complain 
about how it should have been done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to direct my question and comments to the hon. member 
who recycles speeches on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first remind him of a few statistics, then I will have a 
very simple question to ask him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the National Council of Welfare, there were 900,000 
children living in poverty in 1989. When the Liberals took 
office in 1993, there were 1.4 million of them. In 1996, after 
three years of Liberal government, the number had risen to 1.5 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need not read today's motion over, but I listened carefully to 
what the hon. member said and I do not think he got the point. 
So, my simple question is the following. What should we be 
discussing in this House today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand: </B>Mr. Speaker, I think we are talking about 
the sharing of wealth. I must tell the member opposite that, 
personally, before entering the political arena, I worked in the 
area of social development. I was then one of the organizers of 
the summit that is taking place right now in Quebec City and I 
certainly know what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sharing of wealth is essential to the fight against poverty 
and it is the federal government's responsibility. However, the 
federal government is not solely responsible for everything that 
goes on in the community. There are other levels of government, 
and we want to work with them, especially the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can even tell the member that I personally asked the organizer 
of the summit that is taking place at this very moment in Quebec 
City if the federal government could participate in this summit, 
but he refused.

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
provinces have so many problems, it is because of the cuts in 
transfer payments that they have been subjected to for several 
years. The government has imposed these cuts on all the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member opposite—his riding must 
resemble any other riding—if, in his riding, there are soup 
kitchens and shelters for poor people. Have their numbers not 
increased over the last few years? Does he not feel that wealth 
is not distributed equally everywhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member could comment on that, unless his riding is so 
wealthy that people there do not need these services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not talk about wealth 
and poverty. I will simply say that in my riding of 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet, of which I am very proud, 
people have decided to take control of their own destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that people decide to take control of their own destiny 
in our communities often leads to success. The role of 
governments, including ours, is to help communities. I always 
tell my constituents to bring forward their projects and that we 
will be there to help them and to support their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why things are going well in the riding of 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet. Yes, there are soup 
kitchens, but I can tell you that people in that riding have 
taken control of their own destiny. They want to develop and 
they want to broaden their horizons because a growing number of 
our industries compete in international markets. 
It is precisely by helping them do that that we fight poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
answer to a question put by the hon. member for Laurentides, we 
got a slight hint that the hon. member for 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet was beginning to understand 
what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will gladly read to him the motion before the House, because 
he has not read it. He talked about a lot of things, but forgot 
the subject of our debate today. The motion is as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House reiterate the 1989 commitment to eliminating 
child poverty by the year 2000, urge the government to act, and 
strike an all-party Special Parliamentary Committee— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not blaming anyone here. We just wanted to address this 
issue and we did not need the Liberal budget to do so. 
Is the member in favour of striking an all-party committee to 
discuss the gap between the rich and the poor in this era of 
globalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand:</B> Mr. Speaker, in answer to the hon. member, 
I would point out that I have read the motion. I do not think 
that the federal government can, all by itself, fight poverty. A 
people's summit would be far better than any parliamentary 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not the 
first time I have risen in this Parliament to speak on poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House reiterate the 1989 commitment to eliminating 
child poverty by the year 2000— 
</UL>
<I want to take a look at the first point of their motion, which 
provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) despite the economic growth of recent years, the gap between 
rich and poor continues to widen; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that most Canadian and Quebec women spend at least 
part of their life at home full time.  Nearly half of them are 
not in the labour market and fewer than half of those who have 
preschool children have a paid full time job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian and Quebec parents seem to have the best of intentions 
about sharing the job of raising children.  However, for better 
or for worse, the job of raising them still falls to women. 
Genetically speaking, there is nothing that says women should 
look after the home.  However, in practice they are the ones to 
look after most of the domestic duties.  That is why I am 
talking about women at home, which means in fact women at home 
raising children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada and Quebec, women at home work full time and even do 
overtime. 
Studies have shown they work between 41 and 60 hours a week, 
according to the number and age of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women at home are on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week.  See 
if you can come with a more demanding job.  This is our focus in 
the discussion on poverty.  We have to start with the family. 
We also know that women at home work essentially in the home. 
Their husbands, children and other members of the family benefit 
most directly from their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, others benefit as well.  This is why paying women at 
home would stimulate the economy.  They would be spending the 
money for essentials such as more appropriate food and more long 
lasting clothing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers also take advantage of homemakers in other areas. 
Since women manage the home and take care of the other family 
members, it becomes easier for the husband to dedicate himself 
totally to a paid, full time job outside the home. I see the 
opposition before me today and the member for Repentigny smiling 
because I am talking about paying stay-at-home women. We are 
talking about families and children. I can say that, if women 
still stayed at home to look after their children, there would 
be less poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if we take a more general perspective, homemakers are 
responsible for the future to the extent that they take care of 
the next generation. 
To carry on from one generation to the next, we need a dynamic 
and healthy population. What exact value must be placed on the 
work of these women who are on duty 24 hours a day to do 
everything in the home? According to some estimates, housework 
would amount to between 35% and 40% of Canada's GDP, which 
represents at least $136 billion in Canadian dollars. This is a 
significant amount, but stay-at-home women have no access to this 
money to help their children get out of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other workers in our society, homemakers do not receive a 
salary. And because they are not paid, they do not have annual 
leave, employment insurance and compensation for accidents, 
disabilities or illnesses. What is more serious in the long term 
is that they do not have a pension plan. 
Yet, like all other workers, homemakers eventually reach 
retirement age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that stay-at-home women have to face financial 
insecurity throughout their lives, even in their retirement 
years, after spending so many years working for the well-being of 
their families and of society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers often decide to go and work in mediocre conditions, and 
this is when we start talking about poverty. Women who have 
large families and who work for $3 or $4 an hour are not getting 
a decent salary. Some stay at home to raise children and do all 
the related chores. For those who work outside the home, it is 
extra work, since they must do household chores in addition to 
going to work, sometimes for $3, $4 or $5 per hour for washing 
floors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mothers belong to one of two groups: working mothers and mothers 
who stay at home. 
Even these expressions have a certain connotation. If some women 
are working mothers, what is a mother who stays home? If there 
are full time mothers, does it mean that those who have a career 
outside the home are only part time mothers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women at home, whether they are married or not, do not get any 
personal benefit from the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec 
Pension Plan. Proposals to share pension credits between spouses 
are fine, but they do not take into account the value of the 
work performed by women at home, since the couple's total 
pension is not increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1970, the Royal Commission on the Status of Women concluded 
that women who stay at home produce as many goods and services 
as those who are gainfully employed, and that if they were paid, 
it could help children and eliminate poverty in certain regions 
of Quebec and Canada. 
We can re-examine our approach and create legislation that is, 
above all, fair to families, and gives parents the primary 
responsibility and the freedom to select the formula they judge 
is best for rearing their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are some reflections on the legal aspects.  The 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that every individual has 
an equal right to protection and benefit under the law, without 
discrimination. The present day taxation legislation does not 
afford equal treatment to mothers.  Some get special treatment 
while others do not, which is contrary to the democratic 
principles of equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the House Debates from 1983, the NDP member for 
Kamloops said he would continue to call upon the minister to 
reform the taxation system so as to treat all family situations 
equally. What we need is a system which takes into consideration 
all of the costs and efforts involved in raising children, 
regardless of marital status or income level, a system which 
gives women who choose to stay at home the same status and 
recognition as those who are in the work force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, a national survey reported that 81% of Canadians were 
in favour of stay-at-home parents being included in the Canada and 
Quebec pension plans.  But they still are not entitled to this 
pension.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to people, I say to members from every party in this 
House: Let us work together, let us try to find a solution to 
pay a salary to mothers who stay at home, to help children and 
their families escape poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays when we talk about poverty, we talk a lot about 
programs, all kinds of federal and provincial programs. The 
problem with the Bloc's motion as it stands is that it suggests 
a parliamentary committee. I would prefer a royal commission 
that would study poverty and the possibility of paying a salary 
to women at home, mothers who stay at home to raise one or more 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank everybody in the House today and I wish all the 
best to women. 
I also say to men who want to help us to write their MPs. They 
do not need a stamp. All they have to do is write a letter to 
their MP suggesting that a royal commission look into how to 
help families escape poverty. All they have to do is get in 
touch with their MP, regardless of his or her party, to get 
their message across. Even if it takes months, we have to keep 
trying. We must win for the sake of the men and women who stay 
at home to raise their children, and help them break the cycle 
of poverty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to remind the member for Abitibi that there is no such thing as 
a part-time mother or father. When we become a mother or a father 
it is for life. We are and always will be there no matter what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a mother. I am a single mother. Is the member telling me 
all mothers should stay at home and should be paid to stay at 
home? Is the member telling us his government is willing to pay 
women who stay home to raise their children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Abitibi to answer with an 
unequivocal yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I had some difficulty hearing the 
hon. member's question. In the context of this Bloc motion on 
poverty, let me go back to the Quebec Liberal minister who said 
in 1994 that we should reform the whole of society, bring in a 
new guaranteed income supplement, abolish welfare and certain 
other programs, and take the money and invest it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the hon. member's question dealing with poverty, 
I remember that in October 1997, the Quebec government got a 
booby prize for its performance against poverty. This prize was 
awarded last October at a gala in Alma. I have this all here in 
my notes. 
A coalition of community groups from the whole area met in Alma 
and awarded the booby prize for the fight against poverty to the 
Quebec government and Lucien Bouchard, and that happened on his 
own turf. We should start by finding solutions at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about world-wide poverty. Let us talk about poverty 
at the provincial level and about family and child poverty. Why 
did the Quebec government get this booby prize in Alma, in the 
riding of the member who took his chair out of the House? Think 
about that, and start by cleaning up your own backyard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to what the member opposite said just now.  First 
of all, it is important that it be said, because there is a lot 
of confusion.  I did not clearly understand where he was headed 
with the idea that women should go back to staying at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague, the member for Laurentides, I find it 
offensive when people speak this way.  I am expecting, I am 
going to have children, and I do not necessarily want to stay at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the member a chance, however.  Perhaps he meant the 
unseen work done by women.  If he recognizes unseen work, I urge 
him officially to speak to the Minister of Finance about seniors 
benefits.  But he is speaking about poverty.  Does he agree with 
the idea of a committee, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to reply to the 
Bloc Quebecois motion calling for a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is incorrect.  What is needed is a royal commission on 
poverty in Canada, on paying a salary to women who stay at home, 
not just a small parliamentary committee that will visit towns 
and cities designated by members, or a parliamentary committee 
that will do its work behind closed doors in the House of 
Commons and conduct hearings all over the place.  They cannot 
cover all the towns and villages in Quebec, all the major 
regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I prefer a royal commission.  I made it clear in my speech that 
there are two categories of mother:  those who work and those 
who stay at home full time.  These expressions are emotionally 
charged.  If certain women are working mothers, what is a woman 
who does not work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are full time mothers, that means that those who work 
outside the home are part time mothers only.  There is nothing 
wrong with women working.  It is an honour for a woman to work, 
but I can guarantee you that, rather than work for $7.40 an 
hour, 40 hours a week, many women would stay at home to raise 
their children. 
There would be less poverty.  Right now, in Lac-Saint-Jean, 
Quebec, women are washing floors for $3, $4 or $5 an hour.  What 
we want is a royal commission. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to take the floor today in support on my 
party's motion. If members read the motion carefully, they will 
realize that it raises fundamental questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives, parliamentarians and democrats, it 
is our duty to deal very seriously with fundamental issues such 
as poverty, precisely because of the global phenomenon of the 
gap between rich and poor that is growing wider and wider 
despite the prosperity Canada and many countries are 
experiencing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of a new millenium and in the context of market 
globalization, all these issues have become fundamental stakes 
in philosophical debates in our society and political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues and challenges which my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean 
raised on April 20 deserve more serious consideration. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois is pursuing this debate today by 
calling on members of all stripes to discuss and find different 
approaches to these problems and to the changes flowing from 
globalization, a process that sometimes goes much too fast and 
creates problems such as greater social disparity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it is very difficult to foresee with any degree of 
accuracy the impact of globalization, the Bloc Quebecois agrees 
with the idea of the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean that we should 
strike a parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to have an in-depth discussion. The Bloc 
Quebecois thinks that this could help us better understand the 
impact of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task my party and I are ready to undertake is not easy, but 
it is very exciting. 
Our whole society must rise to meet the challenge of 
globalization. As a responsible political party, the Bloc 
Quebecois has chosen to publicly launch this debate in the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going further, let us examine what globalization really 
means. How can it be defined? According to the International 
Monetary Fund, the IMF, which brings together 182 members 
states, globalization is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the increasing economic interdependency of all the countries of 
the world, due to a rise in the volume and variety of 
cross-border goods and services transactions and in the 
international monetary flows as well as the accelerated and 
widespread use of technology. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why have so many governments opened up, willingly or not, to the 
world economy? 
Because world trade can benefit all the countries that take part 
in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence, the countries are changing their economic practices and 
specializing in areas where, comparatively, they have an edge. 
They also trade with other countries, which increases their 
standard of living compared to the situation they would find 
themselves in if they had to produce all the products they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, world trade often has a tremendous impact of 
the redistribution of income within a country, so that there 
could be winners and losers. In order to try to alleviate the 
problems associated with globalization, it is important to 
implement compensation and adjustment programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it was agreed that a multilateral investment 
agreement should be negotiated under the auspices of the OECD, 
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Bloc Quebecois supports the principle behind the 
MAI, which is designed to clarify the rules in the area of 
investment, thereby promoting freer investments and freer trade 
in general, the agreement, in its present form, contains 
significant flaws that will have to be addressed if the 
government wants to have not only the support of the Bloc 
Quebecois, but also the support of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As international cooperation critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I 
deplore the fact that the majority of countries, particularly 
developing countries, were excluded from the negotiations, which 
will end today, because they took place within the context of 
the OECD. 
It is unacceptable that only 29 member countries, the wealthiest 
in the world, can have their say and not the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would rather see these negotiations being 
pursued within the context of the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of October 22, 1997, 132 countries were members of the WTO, 
and 34 countries and seven organizations had observer status. 
That means that a larger number of countries affected by such an 
agreement would have the opportunity to express their views 
about the agreement at the development stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the federal government, through the Minister 
for International Cooperation, seems more and more to enjoy 
thumbing its nose at developing countries and non- governmental 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to warn the government opposite. The globalization of 
markets and the MAI will not solve every problem on the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, since the present government has taken 
office, we have been witnessing an important change not only in 
its attitude toward development assistance, but also in its 
attitude toward the role of the state with regard to world 
misery. The United Nations world report on human development 
says that inequalities are growing everywhere. While the poorest 
20% of the population on the planet shared 2.3% of the world 
income in 1960, their share barely reaches 1.1% today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the wealthiest 20% of the population have become even 
wealthier. Their share went from 70% in 1960 to 86% today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Africa, incomes have dropped by 30% in just a few years. Some 
countries are becoming even poorer while others are slowly 
getting back on the road to economic growth. 
This slow change is very disturbing and is happening everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, there were 3.5 million people living in poverty in 
Canada. In 1995, this number went up to 5.1 million, a 45 % 
increase. During that same period, the number of poor children 
rose by 54 %, from 934,000 to 1,441,000 between 1989 and 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding alone, the Laurentides, soup kitchens, community 
groceries and other organizations of this type are mushrooming. 
I recently attended the opening of the Club des petits 
déjeuners, an organization that provides breakfasts for young 
children in schools in my riding, children who do not eat 
breakfast in the morning because their parents cannot afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These associations are still necessary in my riding, which 
undoubtedly indicates an increasing level of poverty in my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering these dismal statistics, how can we explain that 
Canada went from fifth to eleventh place among OECD countries 
for development aid expenses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the United Nations, developed countries such as 
Canada should allocate at least 0.7 % of their gross national 
product to development aid. Since the fiscal year 1993-94, the 
federal government has literally axed the budget envelope for 
international assistance by taking more than $617 million out of 
it, which means that it allocates only 0.29 % of the gross 
national product to this purpose in 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By acting in this way, Canada is evading its international 
responsibilities towards the poorest in the world and is doing 
nothing to reduce the gap between rich and poor countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could act otherwise, but it will not. It would 
rather spend millions of dollars, among other things, on buying 
new submarines.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these facts, it is clear that, for the federal 
government, the problem is not one of means, but one of 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has now started and the federal government has the 
duty to seriously consider the Bloc Quebecois motion. This is 
for the well-being of the people of Quebec, of Canada and of the 
entire world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have one 
comment and one question for the member for Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months now, the member has been traveling across her riding 
and the province of Quebec telling people she represents the 
Parti Quebecois and Quebeckers in Ottawa. Lately we saw several 
of them playing Santa Claus in Quebec, distributing cheques on 
behalf of the Quebec government. They did not give them to poor 
families, but to rich ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member know why in October 1997, the Groupe de 
solidarité populaire du Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean gave the golden 
raspberry award for poverty to the government of Lucien Bouchard 
for being the one institution which had contributed the most to 
increasing poverty among Quebeckers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I was listening to the member speak about globalization 
and all the other countries in the world. 
Could the hon. member tell me right now whether a royal 
commission on poverty or on remuneration for homemakers would 
not be better than a parliamentary committee operating behind 
closed doors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, those who have nothing to say 
say stupid things. If the federal government had not cut 
transfer payments to the provinces so drastically, the provinces 
might not have so many problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If the member for Abitibi is a conscientious and honest man, he 
should stand up and repeat the derogatory comments he made to my 
colleague from Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> This is not a point of 
order. The member for Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if you could ask him to be quiet 
and listen, it would be interesting, because I do not think he 
even knows the difference between a royal commission and a 
parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I am talking about international aid because it is important 
for a developed country like Canada to help on the international 
scene.  But we still see poverty in our ridings.  If the 
government took the money in the employment insurance fund—there 
will soon be $20 billion—and transferred it to the provinces, we 
would solve our problems at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even heard the member for Abitibi—and I am amazed that we 
have such parliamentarians—say that social assistance had to be 
cut.  Really.  It is women with children who are suffering for 
the most part and who receive social assistance.  Yes, programs 
must be set up for them and they must return to the labour 
market. 
He however is talking about women remaining at home and being 
paid to do so.  Oh, boy.  That makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the members of the Liberal Party should look at the 
motion today, support it and vote with us in favour of a 
parliamentary committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again 
I rise with pride to speak on this motion. It is a very important 
motion.  The whole question of the gap between the rich and the 
poor which we see increasing daily is very important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the remark made by the member which I 
agree with.  Governments have to get their priorities straight if 
we are going to deal with this issue. Lots of times we see 
priorities being made and moneys being directed in the wrong 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also concerned about remarks made by the hon. member for 
Abitibi with respect to women being paid to stay at home.  Unless 
I was misreading it, I got the impression that he felt it was 
exclusively women who would be working at home.  I hasten to 
point out that today many men head single parent families.  In 
two parent families many men choose to stay home to look after 
their children and to attend to the concerns of the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we speak about families and that we be 
careful that we do not discriminate against women with respect to 
roles and responsibilities in the family. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the NDP member for his 
support.  I totally agree with him.  We cannot discriminate.  It 
is important for the women who choose to be at home.  I think as 
many men as women are responsible for child care.  I do not know 
why we would discriminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again call for support.  We are not asking for the moon.  We 
simply want a parliamentary committee to look at this whole 
issue.  It is good for all parties.  It is non-partisan and it 
would serve the needs of this fine country they keep bragging 
about—Canada and its provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it hard 
to rise in this House after hearing such a disgraceful and 
demagogic speech from the hon. member for Abitibi, but I will 
still exercise my right to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would to point out that, last week, the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean made quite an impression when he took 
his seat out of the House. He did so to stress the social 
inequities that keep increasing despite major improvements to 
our economic performance. He walked out with his chair to 
trigger a larger debate on what it means to sit in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What political power can we use to reduce the gap between the 
rich and the poor?  As elected representatives, are we not the 
first ones to be asked this question? 
Yes, I think so, which is why I am glad today to speak on the 
impact of the globalization of markets and the proliferation of 
international agreements on the sovereignty of states and, 
therefore, the real powers we as elected representatives have in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to have this debate here, because it deals with an issue 
that directly concerns all of us. We are here to represent the 
people who have elected us democratically. Therefore, every time 
we lose some of our power, some of our authority as legislators, 
it reduces the ability of our fellow citizens to shape their 
collective future, according to their own values. This is why I 
support the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, who wants to see this 
debate go beyond the walls of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I was elected to this House, it did not take long for me 
to notice how globalization has an enormous impact on the work 
we do here, in Ottawa. 
My colleagues have already talked about its impact on many major 
issues. There is certainly an area in which the effects of 
globalization on national democracies cannot be denied, namely 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, through the past generations, the ability of the human 
race to modify the world ecosystem has increased dramatically. 
This is due to our exploding population and our rapid 
technological progress. For instance, economic activity 
throughout the word is more than 20 times what it was in 1900. 
Consequently, many human activities are exhausting the planet's 
non-renewable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day, our excessive production and consumption cause the 
extinction of at least 100 different species of plants and 
animals. 
Needless to say, this worrisome problem goes beyond national 
borders. We must find ways to solve it that are as international 
as the nature of this challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, we dump in the atmosphere billions of tons of CO2, 
the product of our energy consumption, and we use over 40% of 
the planet's organic matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one year we burn as much fossil fuel as the earth was able to 
produce in around one million years. Poverty and misery are 
still rampant around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Montreal, where I live, is more and more frequently 
smothered in smog. Many Montrealers are getting organized to 
find solutions to this problem which affects our quality of 
life, but they will not be able to do it alone because half of 
this pollution comes from our neighbours in Ontario and New 
England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still they refuse to be defeated by the scale of the problem. 
Together we must find solutions to meet the challenges we face 
due to the deterioration of our environment and the 
multiplication of substances dangerous to human health. To do so 
we cannot keep our eyes on the short term. What is needed is a 
fundamental change in the way we make decisions at every level 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must start integrating environmental concerns in the everyday 
decisions we make as individuals, managers and lawmakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not fool ourselves: the precarious condition of our 
environment is the result of nearly two centuries of abuse. 
There is no easy solution. We can expect more crises, more 
environmental accidents. 
What is needed is for the ecological balance, which has been 
gradually destroyed over the course of centuries, and 
particularly over the past century, to be restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a long term undertaking, which will require the 
commitment of each and every one of us, from the 
various governments down to the last individual and, above all, 
a serious response to the environmental challenge which will lay 
our present lifestyle open to question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the environmental issue is more than just pollution, the 
build-up of domestic and chemical waste or land use management. 
These are just symptoms of a larger problem, and that is mainly 
the way we approach our relationships, define our prosperity and 
select a lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, we are witnessing a real revolution in 
attitudes. Recent polls, open-line programs, radio hot-lines and 
television reports all agree. My fellow citizens, and young 
people in particular, agree on the value they put on their 
quality of life as compared with the mere accumulation of 
consumer goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They choose health over the pursuit of economic expansion at all 
cost. These new values are priorities. They should be used as 
the basis for the political will to allocate sufficient 
resources to the preservation of our environment, which we all 
care about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paradoxical that this government repeatedly drew upon this 
widely held public opinion to finally come up short in 
terms of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gases and protect the 
collective scientific tools used to assess our environmental 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government cannot be satisfied with reacting to 
environmental crises. Never has the government developed a 
long term action plan which takes into account the collective 
diversity of the territory for which it is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never has the government seriously considered where it wanted to 
be in five, ten or more years from now. In order to have a 
political will, governments must be able to set out the goals 
they wish to achieve through the action they take. 
Unfortunately, for the moment, we have to express our concern 
about this government's lack of vision with regard to 
environmental issues in today's context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's failure in the area of greenhouse gases reduction says 
a lot about that. Only Quebec is on the way to meeting its 
international commitments in this regard. How can the federal 
government limit itself to feeble symbolic and optional measures 
to reach these ambitious targets when it is obvious they will 
lead nowhere unless they are accompanied by active measures and 
research budgets. It so happens the Liberal government, that 
claims to be concerned about the environment, has a budget for 
the reduction of greenhouse gases that is 10 times less per 
capita than that of our neighbours to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the situation is so alarming that many predict that 
environmental protection will become the main public concern in 
the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, during the same year, the same 150 countries that met 
in Kyoto, Japan, to agree on international targets for the 
reduction of greenhouse gases negotiated the multilateral 
agreement on investment, which is designed to reduce investment 
barriers.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These dual reduction targets are crucial to the preservation of 
our quality of life. But do the countries sitting at the table 
have the necessary powers to meet all these commitments? How can 
the globalization of markets affect our ability to respond to 
environmental threats? Which agreement will have precedence over 
the others in case of conflict? That question remains unanswered 
here, in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, the only general exception contained in the MAI relates 
to national security issues and law enforcement. There is no 
reference to important international agreements such as the 
Kyoto agreement or the Montreal protocol on CFCs. 
That is why, before giving our final approval for this 
agreement, we want the right of countries to take or maintain 
environmental protection measures to be explicitly preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, like all those around me in this House, I am 
concerned about the state of our society and our environment in 
the next 20 or 30 years. If we can agree on the principles of 
sustainable development that I just set out, we must promote 
these principles abroad both in trade and environmental 
negotiations. That is the role I have set for myself as elected 
representative of the people of Rosemont, and I will use all the 
means available to me to fulfil that role. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a comment and ask a question. I listened carefully to the 
hon. member for Rosemont, who made a very good speech. He 
started by saying I was a demagogue, an accusation I find 
strange and cannot accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned how to read when I was very young, and I did read in a 
major newspaper in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, on October 31, 
1997, a report that said: The fight against poverty: Quebec gets 
a booby prize. The Quebec government was awarded this booby 
prize in Alma, during a citizens solidarity gala in 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members chuckled at my remarks. I made the same speech in 
this House on June 3, 1993, and it was very well received by 
Conservative, NDP and Liberal members. I will give you the 
answer later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question: Does the hon. member for Rosemont think 
that the Quebec government will start fighting poverty in the 
Lac-Saint-Jean area because it got that booby prize? On June 3, 
1993, when I made this same speech in the House, the Bloc 
Quebecois was not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we have to raise fundamental 
questions such as these today, it is perhaps because of the 
empty rhetoric we hear from my colleague opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as poverty is concerned, the hon. member should know that 
his own government has made cuts and reduced transfer payments 
to the provinces. I think he could have seen the first moves in 
that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the Axworthy reform and various things that have 
happened and are due mostly to what this government has done or 
failed to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Vancouver East.  I would ask her to keep it short.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will keep it very short.  I would like to thank the hon. member 
for Rosemont for his comments.  I think he drew a very good 
parallel between the state of our environment and the 
multilateral agreement on investment and globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member if he concurs that one of the real 
dangers of the MAI is that it will have a huge impact on 
developing countries and will, by increasing foreign investment 
and the power of multinational corporations, not only have an 
impact on deepening poverty in those countries, but will also 
have a huge impact on the physical environment because it will 
allow greater power to those corporations to plunder the natural 
resources not only of our country but also of those countries in 
the developing world.  That is one of the real intents of the 
agreement that is being negotiated by the wealthiest nations of 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member if he would agree that is one of the 
dangers of the agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed, I believe the 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment will fundamentally change 
the picture. This is why the Bloc Quebecois has expressed 
several concerns about this agreement as regards cultural, 
social, labour and environmental issues.

have the effect of reducing the quality of our environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the honour of telling the member for Rosemont that I 
refused that raise. This is in the records of the House of 
Commons. The money I refused will go toward paying the public

the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing to consider is what leeway his government 
and other countries are able to give their citizens to improve 
their situation. The issue is not to draw conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is to give citizens room to maneuver so they 
can improve their situation, instead of throwing stones at 
everyone in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
stress the importance for Canada to meet the challenges of 
globalization. Our country is well known for its active 
participation and for the leadership it has often displayed in 
the development of an international trade system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's vitality is quite impressive. Our country is among 
those that rely the most on foreign trade. Indeed, foreign trade 
accounts for more than 40% of our gross domestic product, the 
highest percentage among all G-7 members. Our favourable trade 
balance increased from $7 billion in 1991 to $41 billion in 
1996. The total value for Canadian exports of goods and services 
was a record $280 billion in 1996, almost twice as much as in 
1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its trade policy, Canada seeks to promote the constant 
improvement of the quality, accuracy and scope of international 
rules on trade and investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 50 years, our country has been a leader in the 
development of rules for international trade. We contributed to 
the establishment of GATT, in 1947, and to the gradual 
improvement of these rules during successive negotiations rounds 
that led to the Uruguay Round, in 1994. Canada can be proud of 
the rules that now exist under the World Trade Organization for 
goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only natural that we would support changes to include 
something as critical as international investment. In the 
current context of globalization, direct foreign investment goes 
hand in hand with trade. 
The two cannot be dissociated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's role in developing trade is to support Canada's 
businesses in such a way as to maximize their chance of success 
in foreign markets and thus to help create and maintain jobs 
everywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians, there has never been a better time for exports 
and for taking advantage of international investment 
opportunities.  Markets are opening up, trade barriers are 
dropping, and goods and services are moving freely between 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign investment in Canada triggers employment and growth. 
Too often, too much attention is paid to the heavy impact of 
direct foreign investment on Canadian employment and prosperity. 
Three out of ten jobs in Canada are directly or indirectly 
linked to direct foreign investment in Canada. 
More than 50% of exports and 75% of manufactured exports are 
directly linked to direct foreign investment in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every $1 billion in investments contributes to the creation of 
over 45,000 jobs over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct foreign investments bring new technologies to Canada and 
bring new production processes on line more quickly.  New 
technologies make it possible for Canadian businesses to 
maintain or even increase their competitive edge, both in world 
and domestic markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the liberalization of financial markets and the 
relaxation of restrictions on foreign investment no doubt 
explain the remarkable vigour of Canadian direct investment 
abroad in the 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This investment provides an increasingly vital contribution to 
our economic prosperity.  Since 1996, the value of Canadian 
direct investment abroad has surpassed the value of foreign 
direct investment in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian direct investment abroad 
has tripled since 1986, reaching a figure of $194 billion in 
1997.  The growth of this investment also reflects a new 
approach to emerging economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These investments are a source of substantial revenues and 
dividends for Canadians and allow our businesses to compete 
internationally. 
Canadian investment abroad produces benefits at home for 
research and development activities, growth and export 
opportunities, thus creating jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By investing their own resources in target countries, Canadian 
companies are displaying confidence and thus positioning 
themselves favourably to take advantage of potential trade 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increasing number of Canadian competitors are very actively 
promoting and expanding their businesses worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada would like a set of internationally accepted rules on 
foreign investment, just as there are rules on foreign trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective is very clear.  The Government of Canada wants to 
conclude a good deal at the right moment.  We do not want to 
sign just anything at any old time. 
Therefore, if OECD countries reach an agreement that serves the 
interests and respects the values of Canadians, in keeping with 
our specificities and the exceptions we put forward, we believe 
such and agreement would be beneficial to Canada. But our 
commitment goes further than that. Our government has been 
consulting Canadians since the negotiations started and will 
continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted the provinces, the NGOs, and of course 
Parliament. In this regard, I will remind members of the House 
of Commons that last November, at the request of the Minister of 
International Trade, the Sub-committee on International Trade, 
Trade Disputes and Investment of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade held public hearings on 
the MAI. 
In December, the committee tabled its report with as its main 
recommendation that we continue to participate in the MAI 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois concurred in the report. Last week the 
government tabled its response to the report. In short, the 
government accepts all 17 recommendations. At the recent annual 
meeting of OECD ministers, the Minister of International Trade 
unequivocally restated Canada's basic position in these 
negotiations. The ministers agreed to keep on negotiating 
without setting any specific deadlines. This is in keeping with 
Canada's position to take the time to negotiate the best 
possible agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will keep on consulting as many groups as 
possible to ensure that Canada's positions reflect the interests 
of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
particularly nice to hear a Liberal making sense, after what we 
heard earlier, and I would like to congratulate the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot agree with everything that was said because, for one 
thing, it was a bit general.  At least it made sense.  There was 
a beginning, an end and a middle to this speech.  I would like 
to congratulate the member.  There are perhaps other Liberal 
colleagues who could take lessons on speech-making, or at least 
read this one to learn a few things.  It might be instructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have listened to our colleague, the member for 
Pierrefonds—Dollard, expressing his agreement with the 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the rate of growth, our 
Canadian businesses, which are flourishing all over the place, 
and telling us how everything is just peachy and how everyone is 
so nice and so wonderful, I think we have to be honest and admit 
that there are a few problems somewhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals have been in office, the figures show that 
child poverty, and the poverty of families by extension, has 
increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not who are the bad guys and who are the good. 
The question is whether there is not some way to create a 
special parliamentary committee to discuss in as non-partisan a 
way as possible, even if it is difficult—my colleague said so—the 
problem of the gap between rich and poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague, the member for 
Pierrefonds-Dollard, if I can be heard over the inanities of the 
member for Abitibi, whom it is my misfortune to also have to 
call a colleague, and who may have learned to read when he was 
young, but picked up nothing in the manners department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You would have had trouble learning to do two things at the same 
time, at the rate you are going.  One day, maybe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member for Pierrefonds-Dollard is this. Why 
are you opposed to the Bloc Quebecois motion?  And I ask you to 
put it in your own words.  What is it you do not agree with? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the hon. 
member for Pierrefonds—Dollard responds, I ask members to direct 
their questions to each other through the Chair and we will get 
through the day. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Repentigny. I am sure he does not want to involve me 
in his argument with my colleague from Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to point out to the hon. member for Repentigny that 
the government has already started to fight poverty. If you had 
gone through the previous budgets brought down by the 
government, you would have noticed that the first step to take 
is to reduce the deficit, which is what the current government 
has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But even in its attempt to reduce the deficit, the government 
decided to start by helping the poorest of the poor, the unborn 
child. In our minds, poverty starts with pregnant women who do 
not have the means or the money to eat three meals a day. We 
started by creating a fund to help those mothers. 
That was a start. It is very interesting to note that, for young 
people living in poverty, the first years are the most crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we did was to help pregnant women to ensure 
that their children, the future generation of Canadians, were 
born healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, in the last budget brought down by the government, you 
must have noticed that we have taxable and non-taxable benefits 
that are handed out to the poorest members of our society. 
Unlike the Reform Party, which wants to reduce taxes for 
everyone, our government has decided to help out the most needy, 
the poorest of the families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a family earning $20,000 or less, the mother would get $1,600 
for her first child and $1,400 for her second child, for a total 
of $3,000 or 15% of her family budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have chosen to fight poverty by helping out the poorest 
members of our society, which we did in the last budget. We had 
set aside $850 million for 1998, and we will add $425 million for 
1999 and another $425 million for the year 2000. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague for his wise, logical and factual 
speech. It contained a lot of good points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to remind the House that, if we really want to 
examine the issue of globalization and its benefits, we need 
only ask people in Malaysia, Indonesia and India what they think 
about it. They can tell us clearly that globalization helped not 
only the people of these countries in general, but also their 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague if he could give us other examples 
where globalization has helped people all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is not really the word “globalization”, but 
the fact that, for a country like Canada, it means an increase 
in our exports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must not forget that here, in Canada, almost one job out of 
two is related to the export trade, especially in the province 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, for us, globalization means access to various 
markets. When we finally have access to these markets, jobs will 
be created in Canada. Then the government will be in a better 
position to give more money to CIDA and to help other countries 
in the world. I think it is very important. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for Pierrefonds—Dollard for his reply to my question 
as to why he was opposed to our motion. When he said that the 
Liberals had solved all the problems, I was somewhat satisfied 
but nevertheless surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am not mistaken, the Liberals have been in office for five 
years. This is not a question for the hon. member, because I 
have the answer. Statistics show that since 1993, when the 
Liberals took office, the number of children living in poverty 
rose by 100,000, from 1.4 million to 1.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the hon. member's reply, are we to understand that, during 
the first four years, the Liberals merely looked at the 
situation and only took action last year? Were they inactive 
during four years and active during one year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, does this mean we no longer have to raise this issue 
because it is solved? What we are saying is if the issue is not 
solved, we simply want to discuss it with representatives from 
the various parties and with Canadians and Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Repentigny for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at the wording of the Bloc Quebecois' motion 
today, I asked myself a question. The Liberal Party of Canada 
held its convention last March, here in the national capital, 
and there were observers from the other political parties, 
including two from the Bloc Quebecois. The Bloc Quebecois  must 
have looked at the priority resolutions passed by the Liberal 
Party of Canada. One priority resolution was from Quebec and I 
will be pleased to send it to the hon. member. That resolution 
dealt with the issue of poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pleasure that I rise today to support the motion of 
the member of the Bloc Quebecois.  The motion put forward today 
is a very good one.  It shows very clearly the links between 
growing poverty in Canada and globally and the phenomenon of 
globalization now characterized through the multilateral 
agreement on investment.  This is an important motion because 
these are two key issues that face the country, both of which 
emanate from policies that have been adopted by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many times in the House that the Liberal 
government is tackling the issue of poverty.  When we look at the 
evidence and what has happened not just in the House of Commons 
but in terms of government policies since the resolution was 
passed unanimously in 1989, we begin to see the real picture that 
emerges is of government policies that have systematically 
oppressed and increased the number of poor families, of 
unemployed people and of people living under the poverty line in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989 the number of children living in poverty has grown by 
538,000.  That is a shocking number.  The number of food banks 
has tripled.  The number of poor children has grown by 47%.  The 
number of low income persons in 1996 was 40% higher than in 1989 
when the resolution was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons for the growing inequality are very clear.  The 
blame lies at the feet of the government that has adopted a 
corporate agenda of massive cutbacks to our social programs and 
$700 billion in cuts to transfer payments that have harmed the 
people of Canada, particularly low income Canadians who depend on 
transfers and social programs in terms of health care, education 
and social welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Liberal government refuse in the House to fully 
index the child tax benefit.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another reason for growing inequality in Canada.  We 
have seen the gutting of our UI program.  Whereas 80% of the 
unemployed workers who have paid into the program used to collect 
benefits, it is now down to a measly 30% or a little more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the gutting of our federal housing program. 
Is it any wonder we have growing poverty and growing inequality 
since the federal government abandoned social housing in 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province of British Columbia the loss of federal 
dollars for social housing alone has meant a decline of 8,000 
units that would have been built had the program continued. To 
families where housing is a key determinant of health and 
well-being that means many more singles, couples and children are 
living in very substandard housing as a result of government 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to look at the living standards in Canada, it is 
shocking to note that Canada is the only major industrialized 
country where living standards actually fell in the 1990s. 
Between 1989 and 1996 the average family income for Canadians, 
adjusted for inflation, fell by $2,300 or 3.9%.  That can be 
compared to the average real income per person in the United 
States which grew by 6.2% or the real income per person which 
grew in western Europe by between 6% and 13% over the same 
period.  That shows how drastic things are in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has meant that in 1996 the income of the poorest 20% of 
families in Canada fell by 3% because of lower earnings, cuts to 
UI and social assistance, but we have to point out that in 1996 
the income of the most affluent 20% of families rose by 1.8%. 
Those statistics speak to the growing disparity and the growing 
inequality that face us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the government admits things are failing.  A huge 
government report conducted by an interdepartmental committee was 
comprised of 27 top civil servants in 1996 whose mandate was to 
identify pressure points facing the Canadian government over the 
next 10 years.  This is what they said in their report: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the primary obstacle standing in the way of a new national 
dream is a perception among many Canadians that Canada is no 
longer a land of opportunity—a society where they can realize 
their aspirations and be treated with dignity and fairness. 
Unhappily, much of the research done by federal departments over 
the past few years tends to confirm the existence of a growing 
class of (excluded people).  It would appear that these trends 
will continue— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when the Minister of Human Resources Development was 
minister for international co-operation in 1996 he had this to 
say about globalization: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the sunny promise of globalization has a dark side.  They 
counterpoise a more integrated world economy and boundless 
prosperity against the risk that most of the world's people will 
fall by the wayside, impoverished and disgruntled spectators to 
the global revolution. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not listening to its own Canadian 
Human Rights Commission which has pointed out that poverty is a 
human rights issue.  Instead of addressing these issues the 
Liberal government has for three years worked in secret to defend 
the interest of the most powerful people in our society, those 
who own and control multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question the MAI is a threat to our democracy.  It 
will have a tremendous impact on our social policy and the 
ability of democratically elected government to formulate social 
policy in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed on the score of poverty not only by 
going ahead and negotiating agreements like the MAI.  It has also 
failed to deal with issues like bank mergers where we have seen 
profits of $7 billion and the concentration of corporate capital 
that does not serve the interest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the B.C. legislature a couple of days ago a resolution was 
passed calling on the federal government to ensure that Canadian 
medicare and social services were fully excluded from the 
provisions of the MAI and calling on the Government of Canada not 
to sign the draft multilateral agreement on investment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues are linked in terms of globalization and poverty 
because there is not a shred of evidence that the MAI will 
benefit Canadians.  It will only benefit large corporations and 
will only increase growing inequality in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call on the government to reverse its priorities, to stand up 
and acknowledge this is a wealthy country where wealth can be 
distributed so that the lowest income people of Canada can have 
better housing, health care, social programs and education. Those 
things can be realized if the priorities of this government are 
reversed and it stops defending the interests of those 
multinational corporations through the MAI.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
motion put forward by the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie 
concerning globalization and the widening gap between the rich 
and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean on his dedication to bring this very serious 
problem to the fore. Sometimes non conventional approaches must 
be taken to make oneself heard; there is nothing wrong with 
wrecking a little havoc to put an important message across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean wants to send is 
indeed important. We are told that all G-7 nations are jealous of 
Canada's economic indicators, but that is to forget the cost 
attached to globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a part of the country where unemployment is 
frighteningly high. It is more than 22% in the Acadian 
peninsula. 
This is not just a figure, it represents entire families 
experiencing hardship because the economic market is impervious 
to human suffering. This 22% figure means that one out of every 
five people is looking for work but not finding any. This 22% 
figure reflects a kind of suffering that Canada should never 
tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living in a world in which multinationals have turned 
substantial profits in recent years. It is important to 
understand that I have nothing against companies turning a 
profit. It means jobs. But we must take a good look at the price 
to pay for this profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable for these profits to be made on the backs of 
workers. It is unacceptable for these profits to be used to fill 
someone's pockets when most Canadians cannot make ends meet. 
It is unacceptable that these profits are giving rise to poverty 
in a whole section of the population.  It is unacceptable that 
these profits are being made at a cost to children, who are the 
most directly affected by this poverty.  It is unacceptable that 
these profits are damaging society and not improving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the world people recognize the serious problems 
attached to the phenomenon of globalization.  We recognize that 
the world market left to its own devices increases social 
inequality and sets countries on the road to ruin. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the race to the bottom.  I do not know if we truly 
understand what it means.  The race to the bottom means lower 
wages for workers.  It means poor working conditions.  It means 
that an employee cannot go to the bathroom because his supervisor 
controls his every move. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that globalization benefits all Canadians.  Why 
should company CEOs earn a million dollars in salaries when

</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past seven years, the gap between the rich and the poor 
has widened.  Let us take a look at General Motors as an 
example.  CEOs' salaries increased by 250%.  Employees' salaries 
increased by 33%, and 25% of jobs were cut.  Why are the 
benefits not more equitably shared? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A balance should be struck so that the profits of one do not 
signal the misfortune of the other.  Canadians want their 
government to assume its responsibilities and ensure that 
globalization serves democracy, equality and human aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living in a world that wants to transfer the balance of 
power from the hands of elected parliamentarians like us into 
the hands of multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reminder to my colleagues in this House.  We must not hand 
over all our powers to the multinationals, which are interested 
only in their own profits.  Canadians will suffer the most if we 
do.  Our constituents will suffer in the race for profits.  They 
will be the victims of the growing inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, we have a lot to contribute to putting a 
stop to the ever growing inequality.  Government can commit to 
setting objectives for the reduction of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This growing inequality is the result of government policies 
that refuse to help Canadians when they are at their most 
vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of Canadians today are jobless.  However, 64% of them 
are not eligible for the benefits intended for them. 
This situation is even more ridiculous considering the fact that 
there is more than $20 billion in the employment insurance fund 
at this moment. The gap between the rich and the poor is due in 
part to the fact that the government refuses to take its 
responsibilities and to give workers the EI benefits they have 
paid for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Parliament can honour its 1989 commitment to eliminate 
child poverty by the year 2000. That commitment was made thanks 
to the efforts of former NDP leader Ed Broadbent. Is it not sad 
to realize that, ten years later, we are not any closer to the 
desired objective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do what is fair and equitable. Let us work together to 
make sure that this growing inequality ceases immediately. Let 
us work together so that all Canadians can benefit from living 
in a fair and equitable country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I know that the name of my riding is quite a 
mouthful, but it is one of the loveliest regions in Quebec.  The 
full name is Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok.  These are 
the names of the four RCMs around the Gaspé and the Magdalen 
Islands directly opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in today's debate in the House on the 
distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor, mainly in 
the context of globalization of markets.  I am also very pleased 
to be speaking after my colleague, the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, because I know that the region he represents is 
experiencing some of the same things as we are in the Gaspé. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague mention an unemployment rate of 22% in his 
riding.  My constituents are in pretty much the same boat, if 
not a little worse off. 
Even if I look beyond our region, the situation is the same in 
New Brunswick, showing the relevance and importance of the 
issue.  Those of us from the regions must raise these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People often say that the population in the regions is small, 
but we export.  We are therefore hard hit by the globalization 
of markets.  What tools has the Parliament of Canada put at our 
disposal?  We do not see any.  Our colleague, the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, initiated this debate, and that is what should be 
borne in mind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak of exporting regions, such as mine in the Gaspé, in 
the Magdalen Islands or in Acadie—Bathurst in New Brunswick, the 
crab fishery is very important.  I mentioned it earlier.  I 
think that the only person not aware of the problem is the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  We rely heavily on exports. 
The Japanese are our main buyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is there to help this industry if ever Asian prices 
were to drop?  We are just as dependent on exports as the riding 
of my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques.  His riding would 
also be affected if anything were to happen to Asian pork 
markets. 
This is what we want to discuss. What are the available tools? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we talk about the distribution of wealth, but what does 
the Parliament of Canada put at our disposal? What are the tools 
available to help the needy and those who are searching for 
work? How can we improve the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of globalization, what are the tools provided to 
fishers who rely on the TAGS program? These people need tools to 
cope. They export their fish, because there are not enough of us 
in Canada to eat it all. They would like to retrain, but to do 
what? These are all issues that need to be discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude, for I want to give the last word to my 
colleague, the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
But first I want to congratulate the Ralliement 
madelinot-gaspésien. This organization from the Gaspe Peninsula 
drafted a social contract to make people think about the 
distribution of wealth. The hon. member for Québec referred to 
it in this House, and I am prepared to give a copy of this 
social contract from the organization to all members of the 
House. This group of people representing the various regions of 
the Gaspe Peninsula also wants to launch a debate on the 
distribution of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now give the last word to the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely the problem in our country. It all started 
with free trade and then NAFTA. In fact, the purpose of these 
trade agreements was to protect what we had and to improve the 
situation in other countries. However, the opposite is 
happening. This is why, two weeks ago, we had to file complaints 
with Canada's labour board, because these agreements were not 
being complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, you can imagine what will happen with the globalization of 
markets. Again, we have a problem in this country, and until the 
government takes its responsibilities and addresses these 
issues, there will be hungry children in Canada. In the Atlantic 
region, the government is prepared to close down TAGS.

splitting my time with my colleague from Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why my colleague has to lose his temper.  A little 
earlier he was speaking in the House and was worried and 
concerned about the fact that if the MAI were to be implemented 
or if globalization is to take its course workers could not go to 
the bathroom. I am really surprised that the debate had to come 
to this level of argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things are not as bad as my colleagues in the NDP would have us 
believe.  We still are considered the best country in the world 
in which to live.  For three years in a row the United Nations 
has identified Canada as the best place in the world in which to 
live. We rank number one, ahead of the United States, Japan, 
Netherlands, Norway and other countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have a quality of life which is higher than any other 
country in the G-7 which makes it the highest quality of life in 
the world.  It is ahead of Germany, France, the United States, 
the United Kingdom and Italy.  Canada also has the highest level 
of enrolment when it comes to higher education than any other 
country in the G-7. Things are not as bad as my colleagues like 
to make them look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to say all these things are because of the 
government's action.  All these good things have been achieved 
collectively by Canadians at every level of government, 
municipal, provincial and federal.  All those things are 
happening because the government was able to collect taxes from 
people and corporations in order to spend on our wonderful social 
programs which are the finest in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my colleagues to know that money does not grow on banana 
trees.  It is not planted in backyards.  We have to work and 
produce in order to generate money.  That money would not be in 
the amount we see here in Canada if it were not for corporations 
that are investing in research and development and in products 
that are selling here and more importantly are being sold abroad 
in markets in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the United States 
and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleagues are not suggesting that we should close our 
borders, bury our heads in the sand and wish for a sunny day 
because it is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today is trying to blame everything on 
globalization.  There is no way out.  Either governments around 
the world will have to move into the next century smiling and 
co-operating or governments will move into the next century 
kicking and screaming.  Simply put, the world is changing.  All 
we have to do is to look at the past few years to see the 
revolution and the evolution which have taken place when it comes 
to information technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are scrambling to catch up. In the past few years we 
have been able to unleash the intelligence of our people in 
Canada and in the United States.  That is why today we have the 
most sophisticated mode of communication in the world, which is 
the Internet.  Tomorrow we will see other technologies coming on 
board which will eventually render governments pretty well 
obsolete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that the government which is the fastest to move 
toward not becoming obsolete in the new world order is the 
government that will be serving its people the best.  The 
government that is capable of coping with what is taking place 
around the world and establishing standards that suit the people 
of the world is the government that will be meeting the needs of 
its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multilateral agreement on investment is not the end.  It is 
the beginning.  It is the beginning of something wonderful.  No 
member of the World Trade Organization is biting the butt or 
chopping the head of another member. Everything is going fairly 
well.  We finally have a world order and rules which govern the 
whole world when it comes to trade between the economies of 
countries.  We finally have a mechanism in place where if one 
country is in dispute with another country there is a forum where 
they can resolve their dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about rules also governing investment there is 
nothing to worry about because nobody is robbing anything from 
anyone.  All we are saying is that we want to have a level 
playing field all over the world when it comes to countries that 
presently are or eventually will be members of the World Trade 
Organization and the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have a proper level playing field so that we know 
what we are talking about.  Billions of Canadian taxpayers' 
dollars are invested abroad, in the Asia-Pacific and elsewhere. 
We want to make sure these investments are protected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not fearful.  We have one of the most open economies in the 
world.  We are not afraid of a takeover because our country is 
wide open for investment.  We welcome investment. Investment 
creates jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no fear here because simply put, with the multilateral 
agreement once and if it is signed, there is no need to change 
anything when it comes to existing Canadian laws.  Canadian laws 
will not be affected.  It will not take anything away from the 
Government of Canada when it comes to its ability to introduce 
new laws or to change existing laws, providing it treats everyone 
on the same basis with equality. There are exemptions.  A lot of 
our industries are exempted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what this is all about, trying to blame the 
poverty of the world on the multilateral agreement on investment 
or blame world poverty on globalization. Ask the people in 
Malaysia.  They will say that thanks to investment in their 
country the level of income and the gross domestic product have 
multiplied many times over.  Speak to the people in Singapore, 
Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Latin America and 
elsewhere in the world.  They will say one by one that thanks to 
trade and thanks to our investment in their countries and their 
investment in our country, there is a much better world.  We have 
to bring down barriers, not build them up.  Protectionism could 
kill an elephant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you bet your life if this motion were ever to 
become votable I would be the first one to vote against it and I 
would not be blushing because it is a ridiculous motion.  It is 
not a thoughtful motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one has done anything substantial in order to convince me 
that as an elected official I should be voting for something that 
is against the interests of the people.  A multilateral agreement 
on investment and globalization will work eventually in the best 
interests of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody told me a story about a company that went to India and 
invested in toothpaste, Colgate or whatever.  As a result of that 
investment the quality of life of the people who work in the 
surrounding area has dramatically improved.  As a result of that 
particular investment, another nail has been put into the coffin 
of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one example. There are hundreds of other examples across 
the land where foreign investment has helped to improve the 
quality of life for people in countries where they live and 
eventually narrowed the gap between the poor and the rich.

why my colleague from Ottawa-Centre is getting so upset. He does 
not need to get angry. He looks mighty serious and angry. I want 
to throw the ball back into his court. When I look at where the 
hon. member for Ottawa Centre is coming from, I understand why 
he is so vigorously defending the interests of the government. I 
am sure that he does not have the same problem in Ottawa Centre 
that we have in Acadie—Bathurst, which is why my predecessor, 
Doug Young, was shown the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite my colleague opposite to visit Newfoundland, since his 
government wants to abolish the TAGS program. 
He does not need to go outside the country to see people living 
in poverty and children going hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what my colleague has to say about this and 
the fact that more and more people in Atlantic Canada and in 
downtown Montreal can be seen begging in the streets. Even here 
in Ottawa, there are people begging, which we never used to see 
before. The same thing goes for Vancouver. This is the real 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It started with the Free Trade Agreement, then NAFTA and now the

people of New Brunswick who with their government have changed 
the course of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Government of New Brunswick, a Liberal government 
that came to power at a time when there was a big gap between the 
rich and the poor.  There was not enough economic growth in that 
province.  In a matter of a few years the sensibility, 
sensitivity and vision of that Liberal government enabled it to 
map out a strategy whereby the province of New Brunswick was able 
to attract businesses and investment. I repeat investment.  I 
know my colleague in the NDP hates the word investment.   He is 
allergic to the word investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was economic growth in New Brunswick. New Brunswick is now 
more equipped than ever before to meet the challenges of the next 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should not look at it as a negative thing. 
Investment has helped his province and it will continue to help 
his province.  He should stand and say that he wants more 
investment, that he wants to encourage more businesses to be 
established in his province, that he wants it to do more trade 
not only with the rest of Canada but with the rest of the world. 
The world is his market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization means bringing down borders.  It allows us to sell

I am very pleased to speak in this debate on the subject of 
elimination of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty is an issue which has seized Canada for many 
years.  Most notably the House of Commons passed a motion to 
eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. Child poverty is a 
political term.  That term was coined to elucidate some sympathy 
for a cause or an issue.  Child poverty is really family poverty 
which is the aspect I will discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Bloc member raised the issue of the gap between the rich and 
the poor recently in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would agree that in Canada we should have an 
environment in which we can be as successful as we possibly can 
be, in which we can earn economic returns based on the amount we 
contribute, our abilities and the opportunities we create for 
ourselves, and in which we can be as successful as we want to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of narrowing the gap between rich and poor I suspect we 
are not so much concerned about how much rich people might be 
getting through their efforts.  Our interest is more in terms of 
how we deal with those who are in need in society.  Many members 
of this place share a value system which says that we should help 
those most in need first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as a point of reference I would like to share with the 
House what an LICO is, a low income cut off.  In Canada we do not 
formally have a poverty line.  However as a reference point we 
use the Statistics Canada low income cut off threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give members an idea of what these numbers would be, in a 
city such as Ottawa one person with an income below $16,874 would 
be deemed to be living in poverty according to Statistics Canada. 
Two persons would increase to $21,092.  Three persons would 
increase to $26,232.  Four persons, for instance a mother, father 
and two children, with incomes below $31,753 would be living in 
poverty.  That is a point of reference.  I will not make any 
judgment on whether those levels of income are significant in 
terms of our understanding of the concept of poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons for poverty in Canada.  Most would agree 
that one of the key elements has to do with jobs and the strength 
of our Canadian economy to deliver jobs for Canadians who want to 
work and want to earn incomes to take care of their 
responsibilities and to enjoy the fruits of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has come through a very traumatic fiscal period over the 
last 25 years in which deficits increased annually.  Our national 
debt has a substantial annual financing cost.  In 1993 we had a 
$42 billion deficit.  Obviously it was very difficult for any 
government to produce the kinds of initiatives that would deal 
with that fiscal situation and with issues such as jobs in the 
absence of dealing with the fiscal health of Canada.  All members 
know that for the first time in a long time Canada will have a 
balanced budget for the year ended March 31, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget presented to this place the finance minister 
outlined a number of initiatives.  It was not a lot but it was a 
clear start with things like education of our children, ensuring 
accessibility to schools so that they could get the skills and 
the training they needed to get the jobs they needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a scenario where the interest rates in Canada came 
down and have been the lowest in 10 years.  We are still two or 
three percentage points below those in the United States.  This 
means we are able to invest capital and that jobs are flowing 
from that capital investment.  It means we have a very stable 
fiscal situation which has increased exports, and exports create 
jobs.  In that aspect things are starting to happen but not 
quickly enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need tax breaks.  They need to pay less in taxes so 
they have more disposable income, can continue to be consumers in 
the economy, generate more growth within our system and provide 
more jobs so that the synergy and ripple effect will take place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly poverty has to be discussed in the context of economic 
realities, but I want to talk about poverty in the context of 
social realities.  The Vanier Institute of the Family stated that 
lone parent families represented about 12% of all families but 
accounted for 46% of all children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lone parent situations do not very often statistically occur 
naturally in terms of an unmarried mother, for instance.  It is 
about 3%.  Actually the preponderance of the lone parent 
situation in Canada has to do with the breakdown of the family. 
It has to do with the fact that in Canada today 30% of all 
marriages end up in divorce.  It has to do with the fact that we 
now have over a million family relationships in Canada which are 
common law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common law relationships break down twice as frequently as 
married relationships within the first five years of such 
relationships.  Some 60% of common law relationships break down 
within the first five years.  Some 60% of all parental 
relationships, whether they be married or common law, involve 
children.  This is one of the most significant reasons we have 
child poverty and so-called family poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important area for us to deal with and there is no 
simple solution.  It is very complex in terms of the social 
dynamics and the strength of the Canadian family.  Economics have 
something to do with it.  Stress in family life, stress in 
business life and stress in life generally have a great deal to 
do with how society is at peace with itself and how we grow and 
develop together.  There is a complexity here that is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am working on a bit of research about children's outcomes.  We 
know if children are healthy we have healthy families and 
obviously a healthy country.  Healthy children are a very 
important part of the strategy dealing with the elimination of 
poverty and the narrowing of the gap between rich and poor.  This 
means we have to understand how children develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most significant pieces of research done in the last 
few years by the Carnegie Foundation was called “Starting 
Points”.  It indicated that the quality of care in the first 
three years of life was the most significant determinant of the 
physical, mental and social health of children.  Brain 
development occurs so rapidly during that period that the 
foundations for abstract reasoning, logical thinking and general 
logic are all established by age one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many elements to this issue, but early childhood 
development represents an area in which we must make a major 
investment.  We must invest in children and over the longer term 
we will have not only healthy children but also healthy families 
and clearly a healthier country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to my colleague take a rather roundabout way before 
getting to the motion we have introduced today, which merely 
dealt with the striking of a parliamentary committee to try and 
seek some solutions to the poverty we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of the 1989 commitment to eliminate poverty by the year 
2000.  It must be admitted that they have totally missed the 
boat.  We have recently been given a figure of 1.5 million poor 
children in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to common-law couples.  I fail to see what this has 
to do with poverty.  For me, poverty equals joblessness. 
Instead of talking about the deficit, he should have talked of 
the debt. 
The reason for poverty is the $600 billion in accumulated debt 
that has been run up in past years, because of needless national 
spending.  This $600 billion cost us $50 billion in interest 
annually.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had $50 billion to invest in jobs every year, there would 
be far fewer poor people now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to return to the opposition motion.  I would 
like to hear whether the hon. member is really in agreement with 
this proposal to strike a parliamentary committee in order to 
find ways to eliminate poverty as quickly as possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, I understand the member's 
concerns and I will answer his question directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member wants a parliamentary committee to assess how we can 
deal with the issue.  In my experience as a parliamentarian, 
parliamentary committees do not often have the opportunity or the 
resources to do the job that is necessary.  In fact I do not 
believe we require a royal commission on the family or children. 
I do not believe we need a parliamentary committee.  I think we 
need to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this place should understand that economics has a 
significant role to play in terms of eliminating child poverty. 
Restoring the fiscal health of the country will play an important 
role in improving our economy, expanding the economy, creating 
jobs, providing greater disposable income for Canadians and being 
able to deliver tax breaks to families so they have less stress 
in terms of their financial affairs.  Those things will help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member did not hear the part of my speech in which I 
talked about the breakdown of the Canadian family.  Divorce and 
breakdown of common law relationships with children are causing a 
very significant problem in that although only 12% of families 
are single parent families they account for 46% of all children 
living in poverty.  This is not an insignificant portion of the 
problem which the member seeks to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that if it was simply a matter of giving 
money to poor people eventually we would get to the point where 
there would be a disincentive or no incentive to work or to 
contribute. In fact we would approach a level at which they would 
effectively have, with all of the benefits provided directly or 
indirectly by various levels of government, a guaranteed annual 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A guaranteed annual income is a simple solution but it will not 
deal with the problems.  That is why, when we deal with things 
such as how to help those in most need, increasing the child tax 
benefit by $850 million this year and another $850 million the 
next is a start.  Is it enough?  No, not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a start.  It represents and reflects the commitment of the 
government to restoring fiscal health to relieve Canadians over 
the longer term of the tax burden they are feeling and to 
ensuring that, most important, we invest in children who are our 
future and represent our best opportunity of investment for long 
term sustainable returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It being 5:30 p.m. it 
is my duty to inform the House that proceedings on the motion 
have expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will now proceed to the taking of several deferred 
recorded divisions.

<A NAME="LINK243">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
all necessary steps to ensure the continued viability of housing 
co-operatives administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, in 1884 Abraham Lincoln said: “Let not 
him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him 
work diligently and build one for himself, thus by example 
assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in that spirit of citizens supporting one another and by 
extension the community that the co-operative housing movement in 
Canada was born in the 1930s.  Sixty years later, the viability 
of co-op housing is being seriously threatened through government 
neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a few minutes to explain how this has come about 
and what can be done to repair the situation.  I will start by 
outlining a brief history of co-op housing in Canada and show why 
it has been such a success story compared to other forms of 
social housing.  I will then proceed to talk about the current 
move to devolve social housing to the provinces and the negative 
effects this will have on co-ops.  Finally, I will outline an 
alternative solution that has the potential to not only save the 
federal government money but also save the co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-op housing movement began in the 1930s when Canadians in 
the maritimes, Quebec and Ontario built houses collectively for 
private ownership.  It expanded with the construction of student 
co-operatives in the 1940s and family co-ops in the 1960s. 
The federal government got involved by supporting co-operative 
housing financially in Canada in 1970 through the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  CMHC has called co-ops one of 
the great success stories in Canadian housing.  Its record is 
especially enviable when we compare it to the federal 
government's track record on other forms of social housing.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain how co-ops work.  Co-operative housing is 
affordable, not for profit housing owned and operated by its 
members.  Residents pay housing charges and have the right to 
permanent residency as long as they respect the obligations of 
membership which they have a say in setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joint ownership eliminates the insecurity of the rental market 
by putting control of the housing in the hands of the members. 
Each member has one vote in making decisions on important matters 
such as housing charges, the election of directors and the rules 
and regulations members will be expected to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members share common goals in the management of their 
co-operatives and a sense of community arises from working 
together.  Members of housing co-ops often assist each other in 
ways beyond their housing needs.  Housing co-ops have helped 
maintain or rebuild communities threatened by decay or urban 
renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within budget limits co-ops seek to provide high quality 
housing both in initial construction and through continuing 
maintenance.  Co-ops are required to maintain capital reserves 
for the replacement of worn out buildings and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, co-ops are radically different from other 
types of assisted housing providers.  Only co-ops are committed 
to hiring and empowering ordinary Canadians to manage their own 
housing.  Members learn skills that help them break the poverty 
cycle, enabling them to reduce dependence on government support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-op members do not live in low income ghettos but in mixed 
income communities.  Just over half the nearly 90,000 households 
receive rent geared to income assistance from the federal or the 
provincial government.  In federally sponsored co-operatives 
assistance is provided to more than twice as many households as 
required by their operating agreements with CMHC at no extra cost to 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members manage subsidies economically on the government's 
behalf.  CMHC says: “Co-operatives have been highly successful 
at achieving income mixing without polarization of income groups. 
Income was basically a non-issue for members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have co-ops been successful in social integration, they 
are also the most inexpensive to operate of all forms of social 
housing.  Operating costs are 19% less than municipal or private 
not for profit housing and 71% less than government owned and 
operated public housing.  These cost saving benefits are shared 
with taxpayers since lower operating costs reduce the 
government's rent geared to income subsidy bill.  Because they 
spend less than other housing providers and reinvest their 
operating surpluses, housing charges stay low.  As time passes 
co-ops need smaller and smaller government subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite all their success housing co-operatives in 
Canada now face a serious threat to their continued existence: 
devolution to the provinces.  In March 1996, with very little 
public discussion, the government announced that it would make an 
effort to turn over the management of existing federal social 
housing resources to the 12 provinces and territories.  In the 
two years since, agreements have been signed with Saskatchewan, 
Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Northwest 
Territories which would see these governments assume 
responsibility for public housing, private non-profit housing as 
well as co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general I support the devolution of social housing 
administration to the provinces.  I have always believed that the 
level of government that can best serve the needs of its clients 
should be the one to manage that program.  But the inclusion of 
co-op housing in this devolution creates some serious problems 
for co-operatives and their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two main issues for co-op members are loss of control and 
loss of financial security.  At present members manage their own 
affairs, which helps to foster community pride and a sense of 
ownership.  The new agreements threaten that control in five 
ways.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, existing contracts between CMHC and the co-operatives are 
not protected under the new social housing agreements.  According 
to law professor Patrick Monahan of Osgoode Hall Law School, 
while the agreements address the issues and concerns of the 
provinces and CMHC, they fail to offer legally binding protection 
for the co-ops that actually own and manage the housing 
facilities.  This effectively gives the provinces complete 
control over the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the provinces can unilaterally alter the operating 
agreements between the co-ops and the governments.  Professor 
Monahan found that if any of the provincial legislators were to 
enact legislation overriding or amending the terms of such 
project operating agreements, the provincial governments would 
not be in breach of their obligations under the new social 
housing government agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, co-op residents were neither permitted to sit at the 
negotiating table as these deals were made nor were they even 
consulted in the discussions.  Agreements that have been signed 
to date and those currently under negotiation have been worked 
out behind closed doors.  This excludes a significant group of 
stakeholders:  the women and men who live in, own and manage this 
housing.  These groups are the primary partners in the successful 
delivery of these programs but they have not been consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new agreements could also affect the character and quality 
of federally funded co-ops.  There are real concerns among 
co-operatives that the new agreements will lead to the erosion of 
their autonomy as property owners, especially when it comes to 
day to day management decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to protect the existing contractual rights of 
co-operatives makes these concerns very real.  What the provinces 
view as flexibility in the agreements, co-op members see as an 
invitation to intrude.  Any careful reading of the history of 
co-op housing will show that the greater the degree of government 
intrusion the less efficiently co-ops operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, lumping co-ops in with other forms of social housing 
which are being downloaded to the provinces will increase costs. 
Consolidating the control of shared cost programs such as public 
housing with one level of government will reduce program 
administration costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However very few co-operative housing units receiving federal 
support were initiated under these shared cost programs.  The 
remainder are unilaterally federally funded.  The transfer of 
management of these programs to 12 provinces and territories will 
increase wasteful duplication and government involvement, not 
lessen them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces taking over these co-op programs will have to add to 
their bureaucracies and invest time in learning to administer 
programs that CMHC will continue to oversee.  In Ontario the 
province intends to download those programs to yet a third level 
of government, the municipalities.  In that province three levels 
of government would be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if that were not enough, co-ops face another threat from 
these new agreements, the loss of financial security.  CMHC only 
guarantees funding to co-operatives to the end of their current 
agreements.  The $1.9 billion the federal government currently 
spends on social housing are not guaranteed because the dollars 
are not tied to existing programs and projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial agreements promise a steadily shrinking federal 
contribution.  As existing programs and projects reach the end of 
their funding cycle, federal funding will cease and there are no 
assurances that anyone else will step in.  The agreements reveal 
a slow but definitive withdrawal of federal financial support for 
Canadians with housing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new social housing agreements also do not require the 
provinces to replace the funding.  There is nothing in the 
agreements that directs the provinces to assume that 
responsibility or, for that matter, that obliges them to continue 
spending the money they contribute now under the shared cost 
housing programs.  In fact the agreements give the provinces and 
territories an incentive to reduce the number of social housing 
units in their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 7(e) of the Saskatchewan agreement states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for greater certainty the removal of Housing from the Portfolio 
of programs covered by the agreement (whether by disposition, 
destruction, no longer being within a program in the Portfolio or 
otherwise) will not entail any reduction of the total amounts of 
CMHC funding— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is however another solution.  Next week, the Co-operative 
Housing Federation of Canada, CHF Canada, will meet with the 
minister responsible for CMHC and propose that a new non-profit, 
non-governmental organization be set up to administer co-op 
housing agreements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If implemented, this new agency would save governments a minimum 
of $2 million a year plus $50 million over the next 20 years by 
reducing program administration costs and would lead to a more 
efficient use of federal subsidies.  It would also meet the 
federal government's goal of devolution of administration while 
preserving the keys to the co-op housing success story:  member 
control and decentralized management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed agency will adhere to the goals and principles of 
current programs and will operate within a strict accountability 
framework.  As important, the CHF Canada proposal will ensure the 
continuing success of a housing system that many thousands of 
people have worked very hard to build, an effective unifying 
system working in every province and territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently an independent study commission jointly funded by CMHC 
and CHF Canada examined a new draft of the co-operative sectors 
proposal and compared it to CMHC's current operation with 
improvements suggested by CMHC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultant found that compared to CMHC's approach the CHF 
Canada proposal would generate savings for government in program 
administration costs and would assist co-operatives in increasing 
the effectiveness of their operations.  When a co-op saves money 
in this operation it means more money to house people in need 
either in that co-op or through other housing programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let me restate that I agree with most of what the 
government has done in the area of social housing.  Lumping 
housing co-operatives with all other social housing and 
downloading them to the provinces threaten to destroy what has 
become a unique Canadian success story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about optimizing the structure of government so 
that it can best serve the needs of Canadians.  There is a ready 
alternative to the current round of provincial and territorial 
grievances.  I suggest the government take a good, long, hard 
look at it before going any further.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I participate in today's debate to urge 
the government to take steps to ensure the viability of housing 
co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my colleague from the Progressive Conservative 
Party for giving us this opportunity to debate this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind the House that, in the riding of 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, which I have been representing since 1993, 
there is a deeply rooted tradition of co-operative housing, with 
more than 2,000 units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is our duty as parliamentarians, as our colleague 
suggested, to outline the merits of co-operative housing. 
Co-op members are involved in their community. They are involved 
in a managerial capacity. Because they take their 
responsibilities, they look after the well-being of the co-op, and 
this can only reflect positively on the entire environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about co-ops, about ensuring their viability, by 
allocating the necessary resources so that 20, 30 or 35 years 
from now, co-ops are still a viable reality both in terms of 
upkeep and subsidized housing, without mentioning that the 
governments that have succeeded each other since 1992 have 
systematically withdrawn from the co-op program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the more militant among us, the staunchest 
advocates of social housing, will recall that when times were 
good, there were three separate federal programs under which 
housing could be built, operated and subsidized for members of a 
co-operative. But after 1992, the government, following the trend 
and figuring that subsidized housing should no longer be 
subsidized, cruelly withdrew from that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that 29% of Canadian households with the 
greatest needs are found in Quebec, a province which has always 
been very supportive of co-ops. This means that, with 25% of the 
population and 19% of the funding for social housing, Quebec has 
more families in need of assistance for co-operative housing or 
any other form of social housing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in this case as in others, the list could be 
long.  The Government of Quebec, the people of Quebec and the 
taxpayers of Quebec have not had the support they were entitled 
to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to say that the government announced a few 
months ago in the Speech from the Throne it wanted to withdraw 
and negotiate with the provinces the full transfer of all 
matters relating to public housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sovereignist that I am, I would see this as a matter to 
celebrate, since the whole area of public housing is more a 
matter for the Government of Quebec and, to some degree, for 
municipal governments. 
There is, however, cause for concern, because the government 
wants to transfer, to all intents and purposes, nearly $2 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments that signed agreements with the central 
government—including Saskatchewan, and I will come back to it, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and the Northwest 
Territories—signed at a loss.  For negotiations to be fair and 
to make it worthwhile to the provinces to sign, there must be 
money to ensure the continued operation and upkeep of 
co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative housing movement got started in the 1970s. 
We will therefore be looking at co-operative housing that will 
require important investments for maintenance, renovation and 
repair in the year 2000, 2005 or 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Co-operative Housing Federation of Canada and its 
counterpart in Quebec are asking is not just that the federal 
government negotiate the transfer of responsibility with the 
provinces, but that it have the generosity, the conscience, to 
provide, in the negotiations to follow, for funds to be 
transferred as well, so that the provinces that become 
responsible for this co-operative housing are also given the 
money to maintain and repair it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government opposite is short-sighted and lacking in 
vision, and governs by trying to offload its responsibilities 
onto the provinces. 
The $2 billion they are trying to negotiate will not be 
sufficient to allow us to plan long-term projects for the housing 
stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a strange thing.  On the one hand, the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, the member for 
Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel, a fairly easy-going fellow, is not all 
that worked up about it.  The Government of Quebec has broken 
off negotiations.  The federal government is letting things 
drift along and, right now, there are no negotiations taking 
place between the Government of Quebec and the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are there no negotiations between these two levels of 
government?  Because the offer on the table is unrealistic 
and ridiculously low, because there is no desire to right the 
historical wrong done to Quebec, which has, I would remind you, 
29% of the neediest households within its borders.  In the best 
years, it receives 19% of subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Société d'habitation du Québec and the minister 
responsible for housing in Quebec, Rémi Trudel, have calculated 
the shortfall the Government of Quebec has experienced in recent 
years by not receiving its fair share. The figure is in the 
millions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our responsibility to remind the minister that he must 
give clear directives that negotiations with Quebec are to be 
resumed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of the Government of Quebec being able to 
regain control over this area of jurisdiction, like all 
governments wishing to do so, but not by selling out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak of a proposal to which my colleague has already 
alluded: an agency.  Where social housing is concerned, there is 
already the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which 
administers a certain number of operating agreements in 
conjunction with the co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It carries out real estate market studies.  It carries out 
analyses and tries to understand the major trends in the housing 
market, not only construction, not only the private housing 
market, but also the co-op market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cooperative Housing Federation of Canada, which is certainly 
the movement with the greatest expertise anywhere in Canada, has 
made a proposal, and I believe they wish to meet with the 
minister at the earliest possible opportunity. If adopted, their 
proposal would save billions of dollars, as it would make a 
community partner such as the federation the major administrator 
of operating agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, where English Canada is concerned, this is a 
proposal worth considering. Once Quebec will have regained this 
responsibility, along with the related budgets, and once there 
can be a true housing policy—because the appropriate resources 
will be available—it will be up to the Quebec government to 
decide whether it wishes to have this type of partnership with a 
community agency such as the one that is proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that, out of all the provinces, Quebec 
is the only one that allocated budgets for the maintenance of 
co-operative and social housing, and our province is also the 
only one that earmarked $40 million for development purposes. 
This shows the degree of support for the co-operative movement in 
Quebec, and I hope such support will continue in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Tobique—Mactaquac who 
brought this motion before the House.  The motion directs the 
government to take all necessary steps to ensure the continued 
viability of housing co-operatives administered by Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing co-operatives play an important role in providing 
affordable housing in my riding and in this country.  Over 
250,000 Canadians are members of nearly 2,200 non-profit housing 
co-operatives located in all parts of Canada.  The people who 
live in housing co-operatives are often more satisfied in their 
accommodations than those who rent privately or who live in other 
kinds of social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turnover rates are about half those in the private rental 
market.  About one-third of renters say they would move into 
housing co-operatives if they could.  Forty thousand Canadian 
households are on co-op waiting lists.  Canadians who live in 
co-ops are members, not tenants.  They control their own housing 
through elected boards of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-op housing is unique.  Among assisted housing providers only 
co-operatives are committed to empowering ordinary Canadians to 
manage their own housing.  While co-ops are dependent on some 
government support, they do in fact break the cycle of dependency 
enabling Canadians who need affordable housing to take control of 
their lives. Operating costs are below those of all other forms 
of assisted housing, 19% less than municipal or private 
non-profit housing and 71% less than government owned and 
operated public housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-op housing would make an important contribution even if it 
was not substantially cheaper than comparable forms of government 
assisted social housing. Co-op housing allows members to learn 
the skills of operating and managing the co-op.  Co-ops have more 
than twice as many single families than are found in the general 
population.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians with disabilities and other special needs live in the 
more than 5,000 units of co-op housing.  They are counted on to 
participate as full and equal members.  Co-ops emphasize 
abilities, not disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the co-op members are women and 10% of the units 
are occupied by women over 55 years of age.  Women participate 
fully and equally with co-op elected leadership and staff. Nearly 
two-thirds of co-op units contain families with children. Co-ops 
help communities achieve sensible and sustainable urban 
development and preservation of historic neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All co-ops play an important role in this country whether they 
be housing co-ops, consumer co-ops, farmer co-ops or financial 
service co-ops.  Indeed at a time of mega bank mergers I believe 
that financial service co-ops will play an important role in 
providing Canadians with options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps nowhere is co-op housing more important than in British 
Columbia.  In the lower mainland of B.C., affordable housing is 
often not available.  Even modest housing can be extraordinarily 
expensive.  There are close to 15,000 people on waiting lists for 
co-op housing.  Housing co-operatives play an important role. 
Co-op housing in B.C. fills the need for affordable housing for 
families, seniors and low to moderate income households. I think 
particularly of the housing co-ops in Steveston in my riding of 
Delta—South Richmond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-ops are adaptable and resourceful.  They will seek to respond 
to reasonable changes in government policy.  But co-ops are 
concerned about their very existence.  The current government 
policy designed to download or to devolve social housing 
responsibilities to the provinces fails to protect housing 
co-ops. The plan threatens to destroy a unique Canadian success 
story that has taken over 30 years to build.  Co-op members 
across Canada are deeply concerned by this proposal which will 
affect 250,000 residents and over 60,000 co-op homes and 
apartments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the government to change direction to find a 
mechanism to protect co-op housing in its rush to download to the 
provinces.  The unique co-op self-management approach may well be 
eroded in the downloading. Co-ops are not just another form of 
social housing.  Co-ops are the least costly form of all federal 
social housing programs because of the commitment and involvement 
of co-op members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future, co-op rents may rise dramatically and the buildings 
may deteriorate physically as a result of insufficient federal 
funding which may force cash strapped provincial governments to 
cut spending for social housing. The risks are real because the 
downloading agreements with the provinces do not adequately 
protect the operating agreements between the co-ops and CMHC and 
because federal expenditures have been capped at the 1995-96 
levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The downloading has already taken place in Saskatchewan.  The 
Saskatchewan government is currently proposing changes which 
co-ops believe will seriously erode their accountability and 
authority for setting housing changes, budgets and the number of 
households they will subsidize.  If co-ops are forced to accept 
these proposals, they will be forced to operate much more like 
public housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am impressed by the work done by the Co-operative Housing 
Federation of Canada. It has proposed a viable non-governmental 
alternative for the country's housing co-ops.  The administration 
of co-op programs would be contracted to a non-profit management 
corporation operating at arm's length from government.  This 
approach would build on the co-op sector's decades of experience 
and successful cost effective self-management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Streamlined staffing and organization would allow considerable 
savings in comparison with government management, be it federal 
or provincial.  Minimum savings are estimated at $2 million a 
year in the cost of portfolio administration plus $50 million in 
savings on project costs over 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal from the co-ops, unlike the current government 
policy of transfer to the provinces, would preserve the keys to 
the co-op housing success story:  member control and 
decentralized management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia both co-op organizations support the 
national organization's proposal for an agency at arm's length 
from government. Furthermore I understand the province of British 
Columbia is supportive of the position taken by our co-ops and 
has written to the federal government to have co-ops taken off 
the table in the transfer talks. The federal government has not 
yet responded to this very critical need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to respond to the motion concerning co-operative 
housing and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government understands the importance of good quality 
housing to Canadians.  We understand the importance of helping 
Canadians meet their housing needs.  We know that good quality 
housing creates sound communities and a strong country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to playing a strong leadership role 
in housing.  On behalf of the Canadian government our national 
housing agency, CMHC, is working in partnership with the 
provinces and territories, municipal housing authorities and 
non-profit housing co-operative groups to help low income 
Canadians obtain adequate, suitable and affordable housing. We 
are currently supporting more than 656,000 units of social 
housing across the country at a cost of $1.9 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that these resources are used efficiently and 
are targeted to Canadians with the greatest need.  That is why we 
have offered to the provinces and territories the opportunity to 
manage existing social housing, with the exception of the housing 
programs for aboriginal people living on reserves. The decision 
to offer the transfer of administration of social housing 
resources to provincial and territorial governments was made in 
order to clarify responsibilities in the area where both Canadian 
and provincial governments are active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central goal of this initiative is to eliminate duplication, 
increase efficiency and promote one-stop shopping for social 
housing clients. It simply makes sense to have only one level of 
government involved in administering the social housing resources 
in this country.  This approach will maximize the impact of tax 
dollars by streamlining the existing arrangements and 
facilitating one-stop shopping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, agreements have been signed with Saskatchewan, New 
Brunswick, Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories and Nova 
Scotia.  Negotiations will continue with the remaining 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-operatives, like other social housing groups, are included in 
this transfer of responsibility to the provinces and territories. 
I would like to make very clear that there are sections of the 
new social housing agreements that require provinces and 
territories to carry out all of CMHC's responsibilities to 
non-profit and co-operative organizations and that oblige the 
provinces and territories to respect the rights of non-profit and 
co-operative organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to highlight that existing project operating 
agreements with third parties, including co-operatives, will 
continue to be legally binding and can only be changed by mutual 
agreement of the parties concerned. CMHC's rights and obligations 
under these agreements are indeed covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes the close involvement of 
co-operative and non-profit housing groups in the management of 
significant portions of our federally assisted social housing 
portfolio.  These groups also provide an important link between 
the government and the communities they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure my colleagues that CMHC is committed to 
finding solutions that will restore any social housing project, 
including co-operatives, to financial health where such solutions 
are feasible.  In all cases CMHC works closely with sponsor 
groups and whenever possible provides the necessary assistance to 
these projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, over the past year CMHC has been working with the 
Co-operative Housing Federation to develop more streamlined and 
flexible guidelines to facilitate major repairs or renovations 
such as the replacement of roofs.  Let me give the assurance that 
the Government of Canada is not withdrawing from its 
responsibilities to provide financial support for low income 
Canadians with housing needs.  On the contrary, we will continue 
to meet our substantial financial obligations to social housing, 
$1.9 billion annually as I mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new arrangements are expected to bring significant 
benefits to a great many people. 
People living in housing projects will benefit far more from a 
streamlined management.  Sponsors of social housing projects will 
benefit because they are now dealing with only one level of 
government, a level of government that will be able to better 
tailor programs to reflect local and regional social housing 
needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, the people of Canada are going to benefit from the 
best of federal and provincial co-operation working together. 
This new approach to administration of social housing resources 
is about building on a solid partnership and working 
co-operatively with provincial and territorial governments for 
the benefit of all Canadians.  It is about bringing government 
closer to communities and people across this country.  It is 
about ensuring that taxpayer dollars are used in a most efficient 
manner, and that is good news for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation our government 
is responsible for a number of programs that help ensure 
Canadians are one of the best housed people in the world.  In 
addition to our significant contribution to social housing this 
government provides support for several short term initiatives 
designed to help certain groups make much needed repairs to their 
homes.  Programs such as residential rehabilitation assistance 
program, the emergency repair program, and the home adaptation 
for seniors' independence reflect the government's commitment to 
involve as many quality housing projects as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 30, 1998 the Canadian government announced a five 
year extension of these three programs at a cost of $250 million. 
These programs will benefit as many as 40,000 households and 
create thousands of new jobs across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the families and individuals who have benefited from 
these programs appreciate the government's role, as do the 
partners in the housing industry.  However, I am glad to mention 
the interest and support shown by the provincial and territorial 
governments.  As well, they have worked with the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's decision to spend $250 million over the next 
five years emphasizes its commitment to stronger, safer 
communities, to provide flexible federalism through 
federal-provincial agreements and to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary goals of this new allocation of funds is to 
improve the quality of housing in low income neighbourhoods. This 
initiative combines good social policy and good economic policy. 
It also is an illustration of how well flexible federalism can 
work.  At the moment a number of provincial and territorial 
governments cost share a large portion of these programs.  They 
are invited to continue under this extension and positive 
responses have already been received from several provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that in addition to the $250 million there is 
considerable more that has to be done over time.  A reflection of 
the importance of government ascribes to housing is very clear. 
It is also a symbol of the success in controlling the deficit. 
We have always said fiscal restraint was not an end in itself but 
rather a means to a greater end.  Our goal has always been to 
restore order to public finances to be able to focus more action 
and interest for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress the government remains committed to ensuring Canadians 
maintain the best housing for people in the world.  For Canadians 
housing is more than just a roof over our heads.  It is the 
centre of our lives.  It is an important form of our 
self-expression.  It is a crucial determinant of the quality of 
life.  Good housing is a key to better building communities as 
well as the cornerstone for a strong economy in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear to say housing is one issue that unites us. 
From Victoria to St. John's, Newfoundland Canadians are coming 
together to make sure we provide desirable housing for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear at this point. The government will show 
leadership in housing and make certain that we have an enhanced 
way of life through good housing programs for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, when we 
think about housing, most of us spend our entire lives or at 
least 20 to 25 years paying for one house.  Housing is a human 
right.  We deserve to have shelter to protect us from the 
elements.  We bring up our families in our houses. Yet housing is 
becoming further from most of us as poverty grows in this 
country.  As the gap between those who have and have not grows, 
more and more people will be without housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-operative housing movement has provided places for those 
who would not otherwise have a chance to put a roof over their 
heads, for those who would not otherwise have a chance for home 
ownership.  Over the last 25 years that movement has provided an 
avenue for housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 25 years the co-operative housing movement and the 
Government of Canada were partners in building a Canadian 
co-operative housing sector. The unilateral decision by the 
federal government to terminate this partnership will affect more 
than 60,000 co-op units and far more individuals who live in 
those houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No other housing program has created the strong sense of 
community so characteristic of co-operative housing.  Rather than 
terminate such a valuable partnership, the federal government 
needs to develop new and stronger partnerships between Canadians 
and their housing co-operatives.  This is one of the few supports 
available for urban natives.  There are very strong urban native 
housing co-operatives across this country.  They are completely 
dependent on it.  This change will destabilize that sense of 
ownership, belonging and long term stability that co-operative 
housing has brought to senior single mothers and urban natives 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal plan to devolve housing is threatening the future of 
the co-operative housing movement.  Co-operative housing 
contributes to the alleviation of poverty and it increases living 
standards and develops a sense of community.  The transfer of the 
housing co-operatives to provincial and territorial governments 
is threatening the stable, well maintained co-op community 
Canadians have built over the years and the investment the people 
of this country have made in this unique type of good affordable 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is social housing self-managed by its members who are diverse 
in income, culture and education.  It is a tool of national unity 
due to the fact that co-operative housing represents communities 
within communities across Canada that share the same philosophy, 
operating agreements and structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government needs to recognize the uniqueness of 
housing co-operatives and their national position in Canada's 
social housing program and transfer that segment of the portfolio 
to the co-operative housing federation to look after it under the 
same contract it has had for the past 25 years to 30 years.  The 
federal government must work with the national co-operative 
housing sector to find an arrangement that will preserve the 
successful features of co-operative housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This housing makes up 10% of Canada's federally assisted housing 
stock.  The non-profit agency being proposed by the Co-operative 
Housing Federation of Canada will specialize in managing the 
co-operative housing portfolio.  Carving out that portfolio among 
12 different jurisdictions will leave the co-op housing sector 
divided and without countrywide links to benefit all co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are owned by their residents who volunteer time to their 
communities.  Their operating costs are 19% below costs of 
municipal and private non-profit housing and 71% below costs of 
housing owned by the federal and provincial governments.  In 1992 
the value of donated time ran between $900 and $1,400 per 
household per year.  Co-ops are accountable to their members, 
their residents.  This means built-in incentives to manage well 
and keep costs low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government took steps to undermine the continued 
viability of Canada's housing co-operative movement.  The policy 
being implemented by the Liberal government violates its 1993 
electoral promises.  In 1993 the Minister of Finance wrote a 
letter to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the 
co-operative housing federation, the National Housing Coalition, 
supporters of non-profit co-operative housing and the Canadian 
Housing and Renewal Association.  He stated:  “Our platform 
document provides a framework for government in the 1990s.  While 
it does not specifically address our commitment to non-profit and 
co-operative housing, let me make it abundantly clear that the 
Liberal government is committed to stable and secure funding for 
the non-profit and co-operative housing sectors”.  This has 
turned out to be untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Liberal promise on social housing was like 
the promise to eliminate the GST and abandoning people in one 
million Canadian households living in need of adequate shelter. 
It is similar to the abandonment of those with hepatitis C, the 
east and west coast fishermen, our medicare system, young 
students struggling for an education, the EI program and those 
who are unemployed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need housing.  The co-operative movement is ready to 
take on that aspect and provide housing for those in need and we 
should support that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is not very often in the House that we actually have a debate 
about the need for housing.  I thank the hon. member from the 
Conservative Party for bringing forward this motion so that at 
least there is some discussion in the House of Commons about what 
really is a most fundamental and important aspect of people's 
daily lives, the right to adequate, safe, affordable shelter and 
housing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague from the NDP for Yukon, I believe housing is a 
fundamental human right.  If there is no adequate safe housing 
there is very little else in life that can be dealt with because 
it is such a fundamental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to other members speaking on this motion and 
actually have been very interested, quite surprised and dismayed 
to hear the government member talk about how the government has 
shown such leadership on this issue.  If there is such leadership 
on the question of housing then why is it that the federal 
government abandoned social housing in 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia if the federal government 
were still continuing with its program of funding and developing 
social housing, we would have another 8,000 units built since 
1993.  In my riding of Vancouver East there are numerous very 
well built, very well managed, very good local neighbourhood 
projects that are social housing projects and co-operative 
housing projects.  I do not think we can place a financial value 
on the kind of stability those housing projects and co-ops have 
produced in a local context.  Housing co-ops and social housing 
generally do help provide great stability in local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Vancouver East, particularly in a neighbourhood 
like the downtown east side where there are still 6,000 people 
living in substandard slum housing, in single occupant rooms, the 
fact that the federal government has refused to fund social 
housing, has refused to provide funds for co-operative housing of 
which we have many in my riding of Vancouver East, is really 
another indication of the failure of the government to address 
the real priorities and the real needs ordinary Canadians have in 
terms of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In B.C. alone there are something like 20,000 on waiting lists 
for social housing.  B.C. is one of only two provincial 
governments left providing social housing, but we could do a lot 
better if the federal government were still a financial and 
committed partner to the provision of co-operative housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devolution of housing has had a devastating impact for 
people who live in poverty and has contributed to the growing 
inequality we see in Canada, the growing gap between the rich and 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is devolving housing to the provinces and 
what has been very interesting is that the co-operative housing 
movement has shown a lot of initiative in coming forward and 
saying to the federal and provincial governments it wants to be 
involved in self-management and in the administration and 
maintenance of co-operative housing projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been very disappointing to see the lack of response from 
the federal government to this very positive initiative that is 
financially sound, socially responsible and will ensure local 
accountability, local management and a sense of national 
standards and guidelines, something that has really been lacking 
since the federal government has devolved housing to the 
provinces. 
We want to call on the government today to be very clear that if 
it means what it says about showing leadership in this area it 
should be clear with the provinces that the federal government is 
willing to negotiate an option with provincial governments which 
will allow the CHF to bring forward the proposal that it has and 
to provide for the management of co-operative housing.  This is 
something that has a lot of support in my province of British 
Columbia, which our provincial government is seriously 
considering and is willing to look at. But we need the federal 
government to be part of that negotiation and to say that it is 
committed to allowing this initiative from the CHF to be 
successful.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already received many messages and cards from my 
constituents who are fortunate to live in co-op housing and who 
are writing to me as their local MP to say they support the co-op 
sector's proposal for a non-profit agency to administer co-op 
housing.  I have had cards, for example, from the Paloma co-op in 
my riding.  A member of that co-op wrote “I love my co-op 
because as a middle-aged woman living alone I feel safe and 
secure and can go to university and get a degree and improve my 
employment”.  That is as a result of having a stable, secure, 
neighbourly, protected housing environment which has come about 
as a result of living in a housing co-op. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to encourage the government to review its position 
and to demonstrate an understanding that housing is a human 
right.  I believe that the government has to review its 
abandonment of social housing.  It has to go back and renegotiate 
with the provinces to find a way to ensure that there is 
provincial involvement but, critically, federal involvement to 
ensure there is further development in social housing and 
co-operative housing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that co-op housing in this country has been 
a Canadian success story.  But that success story has now 
partially been dashed by the abandonment of the federal 
government in the devolution of co-op housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad to have this debate today.  We need to have more 
debates on co-op housing and social housing.  I want to say to 
the government that in my riding of Vancouver East we have a 
desperate need for more co-ops.  We have a desperate need for 
more social housing.  We have people who are one step away from 
homelessness.  We have people who are living on the streets 
because the federal government has abandoned its role in social 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to call on the government today to reaffirm its 
commitment to house people, to provide the funds, to negotiate 
with the provinces and to say yes to the proposal from the Co-op 
Housing Federation to ensure that the option that it has brought 
forward is something that can actually be realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for

Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the 
members of the Reform Party, the NDP and the Bloc for supporting 
my private member's motion because this is a very important issue 
for co-op housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could say the same about the parliamentary secretary on 
the government side.  It is typical that when we have a program 
that works well, the Liberals want to destroy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard what my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, said.  I 
just do not agree.  I believe there will be a devolution of 
social housing which will threaten co-ops.  What we are saying is 
that there will be a loss of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forth five points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is that existing contracts are not protected under 
the new social housing agreements.  Second, the provinces can 
unilaterally alter the operating agreements.  Third, the co-op 
residents were not consulted on these agreements. Fourth, 
agreements do not protect the co-ops' autonomy.  Fifth, co-ops 
can be lumped in with other social housing programs.  A sixth 
point is that there will be a loss of financial security.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline two points:  federal contributions will dwindle 
as current funding expires and, two, new social housing 
agreements now require the provinces to replace funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new independent, regionally based, non-profit co-operative 
housing agency will offer the federal government an affordable 
way to protect public investment in co-op housing and to ensure 
that public funds directed to co-op programs are spent as 
intended and properly accounted for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the intention of the Government of 
Canada to renew its participation in the NATO-led stabilization 
force (SFOR) in Bosnia beyond June 20, 1998, in order to maintain 
a safe environment for reconstruction and reconciliation and a 
lasting peace for the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be in the House 
this evening to share with my colleague the Minister of National 
Defence a presentation on this take note debate on the future 
extension of the Canadian contingent in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me recognize and express my appreciation to members of 
both the foreign affairs and defence committees who travelled 
earlier to Bosnia to review for themselves their assessments and 
judgments about the activities in that area and to follow along 
not only on their recommendation that an extension be approved but 
also to take full acknowledgement of their recommendation that 
there be a parliamentary debate.  This evening myself and my 
colleague are very pleased to follow through on that 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The findings of the committee really confirmed what I saw for 
myself just a few short weeks ago when I visited Bosnia.  It was 
really quite dramatic to see the changes that had taken place. 
During my first visit to that area I was told to equip myself on 
a daily basis with a bullet proof vest and helmet.  This time I 
just had to wear the bullet proof vest.  It feels like great 
progress has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, there are political changes taking place, 
particularly in the Republic of Srpska, where there is a new 
government beginning to show some recognition of and willingness 
to conform to the Dayton Accords.  We are also beginning to see 
some signs of economic reconstruction and, to some extent, a 
reconciliation amongst the population itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UN High Representative Westendorp has said that the situation in 
Bosnia has moved from the “critical list” to the “stable 
list”.  However, it is still quite apparent to most that a 
certain form of life support is required by way of the presence 
of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still believe it is very essential to once again look at 
what we have been able to achieve to judge where we want to go in 
the future and also to look at the kind of priorities and targets 
we can set in the forthcoming years in order to ensure that the 
investment and the commitment which Canadians have made over the 
past several years both under the UN and NATO can be fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that I would like to express the real, good sense of 
gratitude that we have to our young Canadian men and women who 
have served there and particularly to recognize the 13 Canadian 
forces people who gave their lives as part of the Canadian 
commitment to Bosnia.  It is a demonstration of the worthiness of 
the Canadian population, particularly those in our armed forces, 
to provide the honourable role of peacekeeping.  In this case 
they can honourably say that is what they have accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what is important to note is that there has been quite 
an important turnaround in the last year or so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were I reporting to the House at this time last year, I think I 
might have been somewhat more pessimistic in my sense of outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meetings last spring of both the defence and foreign 
ministers under NATO, the mandate was re-energized.  Clear 
directions were given to the new high representative to take a 
very strong and stalwart stand to make things happen, to make the 
Dayton Accords a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then municipal elections have been held and I think they 
were carried out successfully.  The special police forces have 
been brought under control.  The seizure of the TV transmitters 
by escort troops has, for the first time, opened up a degree of 
free media in that area so there can be a full expression of 
points of view.  The SFOR troops were provided protection and 
security for the mass execution graves so that war crimes could 
be properly examined under the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to recognize that there are significant 
benefits in the world.  Countries are coming together to work 
together.  Some 34 countries are contributing.  It is a model for 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has given NATO a new sense of direction and purpose in 
providing a degree of stability and security.  It has shown that 
the troops themselves are not there simply for the classic 
traditional peacekeeping purposes, but are engaged in a wide 
variety of activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister of defence would properly acknowledge in his 
remarks, not only are the troops providing the basic security for 
the Dayton Accords, they are also showing a model of tolerance 
and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our troops are using funds provided by CIDA to help rebuild 
schools.  They are helping to demonstrate civic pride and 
commitment.  Once again they are an important factor in moving 
that area toward more democracy.  They are showing that the use 
of military personnel is not just for conflict and confrontation, 
but can really be used in a peace-building capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SFOR is a symbol of the international community's readiness to 
provide intervention and responsibility. At the same time we will 
provide, through the SFOR commitments, an ongoing role which is 
very crucial and which continues to provide stability as we look 
at other hot spots growing in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited the Kosovo-Macedonia area when I was in the Balkans. 
Once again the fact that peacekeepers, including some Canadians, 
are on the border of Macedonia is a real deterrent to the spread 
of disruption and conflict taking place in that area.  Once again 
the capacity of the international community to intervene to 
prevent conflict from taking place instead of only trying to 
resolve it is a clear demonstration of what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I think it is important to note that there are 
lessons to be learned in this area.  Each day that goes by, as 
the committees have reported, lessons have been learned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tasks which lie ahead are perhaps the toughest of them all. 
For those who think the job is about done, let us recognize that 
there are still very important and significant tasks to be done 
to complete the work which was undertaken when the Dayton Accords 
were first signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first and perhaps most significant task is to provide the 
right atmosphere and control under which refugees can be 
returned.  The outstanding issue in the area is still the 
hundreds of thousands of displaced people both inside and outside 
the country.  Without the security that SFOR has provided refugee 
return would not take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, there are still some very difficult problems.  The 
major problem around Brcko in Bosnia is crucial in resolving and 
reconciling the issues between the different factions in the 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important need for a continuing presence to ensure 
that the general elections taking place later this year will be 
again conducted with no disruption or untoward interference by 
those who want to destroy the Dayton Accords. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that we maintain pressure on war crimes. 
What has been happening in a very interesting way is that 
indicted war criminals are now giving themselves up because they 
recognize they have no other choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly the influence of Karadzic and his control on the 
area has been reduced because of the presence of the SFOR.  They 
have undertaken the Canadian notion of shrinking the area of 
responsibility and control and the result has been that war 
criminals are voluntarily giving themselves up to tribunals.

important role for Canadians that our own forces are playing in 
the Canadian land mine initiatives taking place in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the agreement of my colleagues, the Minister of National 
Defence and the Minister for International Co-operation, we 
announced a major $10 million land mine initiative just about a 
month ago in Bosnia.  That will provide an integrated approach 
between military, civilian, NGO and UN personnel to provide 
humanitarian demining that would complement what is being done by 
the Bosnia troops and would provide not only demining but also 
new space, new land and new opportunities for the refugees coming 
back.  We are beginning to achieve multiple objectives by our 
involvement.  Once again in this kind of responsibility the 
existence of our troops is very crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I pass the floor to my colleague, I underline the 
importance of our continuing presence partly as a member of a 
broad international coalition and partly as a way of bringing to 
bear the kinds of special values, capacities and skills provided 
by the Canadian forces.  They are also beginning to demonstrate 
that the international community is prepared to provide real 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes down to the truth the only people who can 
ultimately resolve the issue in Bosnia are the Bosnians 
themselves, but they will need continuing help.  We would 
recommend to the House that they accept and agree to an 
extension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the kind of take note debate that is occurring tonight, my 
colleague and I and the Prime Minister can then go forward and 
make a decision about the future of this one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be able to join my 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in commencing the 
discussion tonight on the future of the Canadian military 
involvement in the SFOR or the stabilization force NATO in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had some firsthand experience with the situation in 
Bosnia.  Last fall I visited there and saw for myself the 
destruction and devastation that followed six years of war.  I 
saw how horrible it is to live in a land strewn with almost a 
million land mines.  I learned how hard the men and women of the 
Canadian forces are working to help rebuild that country.  I 
slept at Camp Holpina, a camp named after a Canadian solider who 
was killed by a land mine, and I discussed with our troops how 
they were doing.  I was very proud to be Canadian as I listened 
to these fine young men and women describe how they were helping 
the people of Bosnia and Hercegovina rebuild their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my visit there I have spoken with many of my counterparts 
in NATO and I can say that they are like minded when it comes to 
staying the course in Bosnia.  This has always been and should 
remain a multilateral effort.  All of us have seen the benefits 
of acting together in this way.  We know this continues to be as 
important today as it has been in the past. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's numerous contributions to peace in the former 
Yugoslavia are evidence that this tradition is still strong. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has played an active role in this region since war broke 
out in 1991.  Canada participated first in the European Community 
monitoring mission and UNPROFOR between 1992 and 1995 because 
Canadians could not stand by in silence and witness such 
destruction.  Nor could we be idle in the face of crimes against 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we stayed there with our allies in the NATO led 
implementation force and then as part of SFOR, so much has been 
and is still being accomplished.  SFOR has helped to guarantee 
that municipal elections, for example, take place peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SFOR has actively supported the UN international police task 
force in the restructuring of civil police, significantly 
enhancing the freedom of movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SFOR has worked diligently with the local armed forces to 
encourage them to increase their demining efforts. 
As a result some 20,000 mines have been lifted in the last year 
under SFOR monitoring.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>SFOR has also participated in operation harvest, an amnesty 
program intended to reduce private holdings of illegal arms and 
ordinances.  It was conducted this spring.  The Canadian battle 
group played a vital role in this recovery effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been accomplished but much however still needs to done. 
We are still witnessing pockets of violence in places like Drvar 
where we have recently seen that the return of displaced persons 
can provoke violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the expiry in June of SFOR's 18 month mandate the time has 
come to take stock of our involvement and the continued viability 
of an international military presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now enough stability to be able to put more focus on 
economic recovery, on more demining, on the September 1998 
general elections, on police reform, on the safe return of 
displaced persons and on the building of common institutions. 
However we along with our allies believe that until such time as 
the many dimensions of the peace settlement are firmly in place, 
the secure environment provided by SFOR is the only way these and 
other reconstruction efforts of the Dayton accord can continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do this only by maintaining our current level of military 
commitment.  Right now Canada has over 1,200 military personnel 
in the region.  To continue to make a meaningful difference we 
need to deploy a combat capable contingent of about the same 
number of personnel.  They would contribute to a renewed 
multinational force by deterring hostilities, stabilizing peace 
and thereby contributing to a secure environment to be able to 
carry out the further reforms I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our allies agree that a post-June SFOR is necessary.  We are not 
doing this alone.  We are doing it in a multilateral context.  We 
believe that we must continue to help support the return of 
refugees in minority areas, help install local governments and 
help strengthen demining efforts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our allies are also of the opinion that any military 
contribution must have clear objectives, in order to monitor 
progress. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a precise mandate and a provision for regular 
review.  That is why any Canadian renewal is only possible if 
there is a transition strategy which vigorously and frequently 
evaluates progress to ensure that we are constantly focused on 
our task at hand and so we can assess how best to reach our 
objectives.  Once these objectives have been met we will be able 
to withdraw, secure in the knowledge that we have helped bring 
lasting peace to a troubled region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask whether we are setting the stage for another Cyprus 
if we do not impose an end date.  The situations are different. 
In Bosnia-Hercegovina there is a peace plan to which all the 
parties have agreed.  Nevertheless we must assume that the 
problem there will take some years to resolve—we cannot simply 
pull out—and that for at least part of that time NATO forces 
will have to remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My visit to Bosnia convinced me of many things.  It convinced me 
that the work we are carrying out there is essential.  Our forces 
are making a difference to people's everyday lives.  They are 
proud to represent Canada as a part of this international 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It convinced me that Canadian participation in SFOR is a key 
component in this multilateral NATO operation.  It convinced me 
that much still needs to be done and that Canada must be a part 
of that effort.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to be able to talk about Bosnia again; it seems to 
happen every six months or so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians have a lot of questions about our 
involvement in Bosnia.  Everywhere I go people ask me to explain 
why we should be there.  They ask questions about the history of 
Bosnia.  They ask if it is a civil war, whether it has been going 
on for a long time, what it is really like there and what the 
people are really like there.  They deserve answers to some of 
these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the two ministers who have just spoken have been there. I 
have been on the ground, visited the people and taken pictures. 
I changed my point of view many times because of what I observed 
firsthand on the ground.  This is an opportunity to express that 
and to get it on the record.  I will take this opportunity to 
answer some of those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been going on for a long time.  We could go back to Roman 
times when they were fighting in this area.  We could go back to 
the Ottoman empire when there was fighting in this area.  We 
could talk about the involvement of many countries, of Russia, of 
Germany, of Greece, of France and of Britain.  There has been 
much involvement.  There is a history there.  There was the first 
world war and Archduke Ferdinand.  We could talk about the Nazi 
occupation.  Then we could talk about Tito and his rule until 
1980 when he died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we come to current history and to 1991.  Two of the 
strongest parts of Yugoslavia, which had been held together by 
Tito, decided to opt for independence.  When Croatia and Slovenia 
decided to separate it was the beginning of the modern day 
problems that would occur in this part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a history there.  There is a history of turmoil and of 
trouble.  At this point there is also Canadian involvement first 
with the UN forces.  We were one of the first countries to be 
involved.  I like the others would say that I saw nothing but 
dedication and great Canadians working with the people of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud to be a Canadian and to see the Canadian flag on the 
tanks when they came around the corner.  That made me proud as a 
Canadian.  Talking to some of our troops made me even prouder. 
They told me about the little kids they had helped, the schools 
they had reconstructed and that sort of thing.  That was real. 
That was something we could feel, touch and look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people thought at that point that Kosovo would have been 
the next place to explode but instead it was Bosnia.  That is all 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 Dayton accord supposedly ended the conflict.  When I 
went there as an election observer on the ground last September I 
had the opportunity to see how the Dayton accord would work.  I 
will use my province as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was like if during the war all the people from Red Deer had 
been moved to Saskatoon. Then the Dayton accord came along and 
said to the people in Saskatoon that in 1991 they lived in Red 
Deer so they should vote for the mayor and the council in Red 
Deer.  However they lived in Saskatoon.  People of a different 
ethnicity mix and of a different religion now lived in Red Deer 
and had to vote for the mayor and the council in Red Deer. 
Because of problems like the ones we just witnessed occurring 
there some of the people from Saskatoon decided to go back to Red 
Deer.  That is why there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will that create peace? There is a built in conflict because 
the people who designed the Dayton accord were in Dayton, Ohio, 
and did not take into consideration the emotion, religion or 
ethnic mix there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes they are all of Slavic background but they are of three 
religious backgrounds.  There are Muslims, there are Orthodox and 
there are Catholics.  It is very different and they feel very 
strongly and are very emotional. In Drvar when the Croats 
attacked the Serbs who were returning home it can be seen why. 
That is going to continue and continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to find out what it was really like in that country so 
I hired a translator and a car and off we went to cover Bosnia. I 
visited schools.  I visited mosques.  I visited churches.  I 
visited community halls.  I talked to farmers.  I went to bars. I 
went everywhere the people were and I talked to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably one of the most emotional feelings I got occurred when 
I talked to a group of kids who were 10 to 11 years old. I asked 
them to tell me how they felt about their country.  I have pages 
of their comments but I will quote only a couple which I think 
say a lot. Remember that these kids are 10 and 11 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said they could not relax or run freely because there are 
mines everywhere.  That is what Bosnia-Hercegovina is like now. 
Mines are everywhere.  We found mines under Coke tins. The bottom 
was cut out of the Coke tin and a plastic mine was inside.  It 
was placed on a picnic table, there for someone to pick up. Boom. 
In cobs of corn, on the sides of roads, there are mines. There 
are millions of these mines everywhere.  Imagine living in that 
sort of an environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“When I see my friend without a leg or a hand it makes me very 
sad”. “I cannot wait to grow up”. “Suddenly there was heat. 
My sister fell over me.  Something exploded.  There was smoke. 
There were screams.  Rivers of blood.  I saw both my parents 
dead.  I called them but they did not respond.  When I wanted a 
drink of water I saw a head without a body.  Since then me and my 
sister cannot sleep at night”. That is what the kids of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the people?  The people are well educated.  They are 
handsome, good looking people.  They are friendly.  They are 
concerned about families, about school, about education, the same 
things we are.  Yet there is something there that is different. 
That something is a level of history and hate I have never 
experienced before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk to someone and they would tell me about a war and 
they described it as though it were yesterday.  One person told 
me about a war that happened in 1536 when the Ottoman Turks were 
there.  Another person told me about when the Nazis came in 1943. 
It was as if it were yesterday. That is why they hate their 
neighbour.  Because their neighbour was involved with that action 
and it has been regurgitated and regurgitated and everybody 
remembers it as if it were yesterday.  They are handicapped by 
their history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget the little old lady who had gone for a loaf 
of bread.  I asked if I could take her picture. She had a 
beautiful face.  Her face was stressed and strained and I thought 
of what it had seen.  She said she had to go home and change her 
dress so I could take a picture of her with her loaf of bread.  I 
convinced her finally that I could take her picture without her 
actually changing her dress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget the old fellow who at a polling station said 
“You are from Canada”.  He asked me if I knew how to make 
slivovitz.  That is plum brandy.  “Come to my basement and I 
will show you”.  He was so proud.  His was the best in the 
community. 
I was also advised not to drink any of it as a person could go 
blind.  This was a real guy.  He was proud of this.  He was a 
real person, someone that makes you say how can there be such 
hate here?  These people have such emotions, such feelings, such 
beauty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the countryside as well.  It is like Switzerland. The only 
problem is it is full of mines.  We drove through some of the 
valleys.  The houses are destroyed.  The fields are mined.  The 
graves are in the ditches.  There are no birds singing in the 
fields.  Not having lived through a war, experiencing this 
firsthand on the ground in a car with a driver and a translator 
was quite an experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we stay in Bosnia-Hercegovina?  We have several options. 
We could leave.  We could simply leave, saying that it is a long 
war, that it is going to be like Cyprus and might last forever. 
What are the problems if we do that?  My feeling is that if we 
were to leave at 12 noon by 12.30 there would be a full fledged 
war again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would that mean?  It would mean the potential of expansion. 
The Turks are not prepared to see Muslims die. The Russians are 
not prepared to see Serbs die.  The Germans are not prepared to 
see Croats die.  The Albanians and the Greeks and the 
Macedonians.  The list goes on and on of possible future 
expansion of warfare in this area.  Kosovo is the exact same 
example.  What will Greece do?  What will Turkey do?  There are 
so many people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we leave, what about the CNN factor?  What about the killing 
we would watch on our televisions?  Are we prepared to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are hard questions.  These are questions we need to ask as 
we contemplate this decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another choice would be to divide the country into three units 
and say this is where the Serbs will be, this is where the Croats 
will be and this is where the Bosnians will be.  I guess that is 
called ethnic cleansing but I do not know that that is acceptable 
or possible.  Certainly it is not something we would be prepared 
to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our third option is a short term plan in which we would do 
something which I consider to be so typically Liberal. That would 
be to simply extend our mandate and not really propose a 
solution.  It is similar to saying that the financial problem has 
been solved even though there is a $583 billion debt, but it is 
all solved because we balanced the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is going to address the sustainability and what are 
the costs to our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put forward a fourth option tonight and hopefully the 
minister will get a chance to read it.  That option would be to 
show some leadership in developing a long term solution, a plan. 
I am not saying I have all the answers. I am not saying how we 
would handle the refugee return or the war criminals.  However we 
need to have something longer than six-month intervals. I cannot 
help but remember standing in the lobby in this House when the 
former defence minister said “We will be out of there by 
Christmas; there is no chance we will be there beyond 
Christmas”.  That was in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at something bigger.  We need to talk about 
costs, about mandates, about responsibility, about length of 
stay, about a plan. I would like to see this government take some 
initiative, do some planning, show something beyond a six-month 
window in a problem like this one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stand up here and say we should not stay there.  I can 
now put a face on Bosnia-Hercegovina.  It means people.  It means 
caring. It means that little man and his slivovitz. It means 
school kids.  However, we must do something better than simply 
say that the Dayton accord is going to do it all.  It is not the 
answer and I have given just a brief insight into why it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as far as the take note debate is concerned, I guess I 
was naive when I first came here.  One of the first speeches I 
gave in this House was on Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Did I ever work 
hard to prepare that speech because I thought it really was part 
of the decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it was announced yesterday by the defence minister that 
we are staying on for at least another six months.  It is already 
news.  We are not informing anybody about anything.  I think the 
huge turnout here demonstrates how many people are really 
interested in the take note debate.  We are here so the 
government in a week's time can say “We had a full fledged 
debate on Bosnia and every party had a chance to speak.  We 
debated the issue and came up with this decision.  This is 
democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put to the House that tonight may be the wrong night to talk 
about democracy when we have just gone through what we went 
through with a 15 year old boy being removed by our guards, I 
hope not to jail.  We saw the vote on hepatitis C.  I feel 
somewhat like a hypocrite to the Canadian people when I say I am 
here to try to make a difference about Bosnia-Hercegovina because 
I want to make a difference.  I want to help the people of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina.  How do we get a government that does not 
involve us to hear us?  That is a plea I guess for the 
democratization of Canada.  We need that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of disgust for this kind of procedure.  Yes it is 
on the record, but I wish the minister could hear it or would 
read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion let us come up with a plan.  Let us talk about the 
big picture.  Let us not just do what makes us feel good. Let us 
show some leadership and be part of the decision making process. 
Let us talk about the cost of lives and the suffering. Let us 
really make a difference to the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina.

my pleasure to speak this evening on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois to the motion regarding the renewal of the NATO 
stabilization force in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have the pleasure of informing the House at the start of 
my presentation that the Bloc Quebecois will support this motion 
and therefore the intention of the Government of Canada to renew 
the force's participation in the SFOR past June 20, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal proposal follows an initial renewal of the mandate 
of the Canadian forces in Bosnia in November and December last

The initial renewal had the support of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and the Standing Committee on National Defence. 
Several members of these committees, including myself, had the 
opportunity to travel to Bosnia-Hercegovina to view the situation 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw during our visit the fragility, indeed the 
precariousness, of the peace process, which involves not only 
military personnel of NATO member countries and the OSCE 
Partnership for Peace countries, but also civilian and police 
personnel from many countries in the international community, we 
must not forget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The events that occurred barely a few days ago, on April 24, 
1998, prove this fragility.  In northern Bosnia, in the 
municipalities of Derventa and Drvar, tensions between Serbs and 
Croats resulted in outbursts of violence, exchanges and 
altercations between people of various nationalities in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian soldiers were called in to put a stop to the 
confrontation in Drvar after Bosnian Croats set fire to 
buildings and attacked United Nations' vehicles in response to 
threats made to the life of a Croat bishop elsewhere in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continued presence of the international community is needed 
to provide this safe environment referred to in the motion 
before this House. It is especially important to maintain this 
safe environment since it is necessary for the reconstruction 
and reconciliation efforts at the heart of the Dayton accords to 
finally pay off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By its presence, the SFOR will help ensure the safety of ongoing 
civilian activities and particularly the social and economic 
reconstruction operations identified in the three-year plan, as 
established by the World Bank and the European Community, 
operations in which mine clearance instructors from the 
Department of National Defence of Canada are taking part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois that the civilian 
activities aimed at consolidating democracy, which are placed 
under the auspices of the OSCE, promoting human rights and 
providing assistance to the great many refugees and displaced 
people in Bosnia-Hercegovina, could not take place without the 
continued presence of the SFOR. This is a force which also tends 
to create a climate in which other international players in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina can carry out their activities safely. All 
these players—the international police force set up by the UN 
Security Council, the ICRC, UNICEF, the High Commissioner for 
Refugees and the many NGOs such as CARE Canada which does 
important work in support of Bosnians—perfectly complete the 
work done by intergovernmental organizations in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that the renewal of the SFOR mandate 
in Bosnia-Hercegovina should be accompanied by increased support 
for the International Crime Tribunal, a more significant support 
for this international court, which is playing a fundamental 
role with regards to the aftermath of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. We believe that SFOR soldiers, including 
Canadian soldiers whose dedication I salute, should be given the 
mandate to play a more proactive role in this respect and not 
hesitate to arrest individuals charged with crimes and against 
whom the chief prosecutor, Madam Justice Louise Arbour, has 
issued arrest warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timid attitude of the Prime Minister of Canada in this 
matter, which is the result of some comments he made, without 
mentioning those from his government, which by the way has not 
yet introduced a bill to amend the Criminal Code with a view to 
ensuring Canada's full co-operation with the International Crime

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois urges the government to make amends and 
support more that it has so far the efforts of the tribunal to 
bring to justice the individuals suspected of the worst crimes, 
international crimes, whether they are war crimes, crimes 
against humanity or worst of all, the crime of genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is timely to remember, with respect to genocide, that this 
year, in 1998, we will be celebrating not only the anniversary 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also the 50th 
anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide that was breached by individuals in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, as the International Crime tribunal will 
show, if it can bring to justice the individuals charged with 
such crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal of the SFOR mandate is also important, especially as 
it will send a message to those in the Balkans who might be 
tempted to again threaten international peace and security in 
the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to tensions in the Kosovo area, tensions that are 
aggravated by the refusal by the Republic of Yugoslavia to enter 
into a meaningful dialogue with Albanians from the Kosovo area 
and to respond to the mediation proposal made by the 
international community. These tensions do not favour the 
withdrawal of SFOR's troops from Bosnia. On the contrary, they 
favour their continued presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community should consider the possibility of 
creating a similar force in the Kosovo area if the situation 
continues to deteriorate in this part of the Balkans. Last week, 
fighting in the region resulted in at least 23 deaths, and 
border tensions are increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, SFOR's presence is more needed than ever, just as sending 
a protection force into Bosnia-Hercegovina was necessary a few 
years ago, when the UN created UNPROFOR, which was replaced by 
IFOR, the predecessor of SFOR, the mandate of which we want to 
renew today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, some people criticized Canada for having waited 
too long before taking action. Canada cannot repeat today the 
mistake it made by not taking action and by not leading the 
international community to take action decisively and quickly. 
It cannot choose the same ambivalent approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I also want to say how disappointed I am to see this 
debate taking place in the House when so very few people are 
present. I think an issue such as this deserves more attention. 
Not only should the issues of creating and setting up 
stabilization or peacekeeping forces be looked at seriously by 
the standing committee on foreign affairs, as was done in other 
cases involving the creation or renewal of peacekeeping forces, 
but it remains essential, despite the absence of members this 
evening, that this issue also be debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should probably give serious thought to legislating the 
creation and renewal of peacekeeping forces and requiring that 
Parliament be consulted and give an opinion binding on the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice in recent years seems to be lacking in uniformity. 
Since I joined the House on June 2, I have noticed that the 
issue of renewing forces is sometimes studied in committee, and 
sometimes by the House in plenary.  There does not seem to be 
any real criterion behind the decision by Parliament or one of 
its committees to approve the renewal or creation of such 
forces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt we should follow the example of certain countries that 
accord Parliament a much greater role in the renewal and the 
creation of such forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this issue warrants greater study since the members of 
the opposition lacked important information in preparing their 
position.  The government did not deign to provide information 
on the real mandate it wanted to give the Canadian forces or on 
other terms of Canada's participation in the SFOR, which it 
wanted to renew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without real information, the opposition parties are not able to 
formulate positions that are as valuable as they might be to the 
government in making its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stress that the importance of renewing this 
force is related primarily to the issue of maintaining and 
consolidating the existing but fragile peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a friend, someone I met on my trip to 
Sarajevo in Bosnia, a young Quebec woman who is serving as the 
deputy ombudsman for Bosnia-Hercegovina and who introduced me to 
a magnificent work I recommend you read.  It is the story of a 
young child who contemplates and analyzes through the eyes of a 
child the effect of the war on the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
In looking at the war and trying to understand it, the child 
thinks primarily of the stars on the sidewalks of Sarajevo. 
There are many such stars in the Sarajevo market, among other 
places, where the many shells fell killing so many people in one 
night of catastrophe for Sarajevo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Céline Auclair, my friend, wrote me at the start of this year, 
January 19, 1998, and referred me to this work by a young 
Frenchman, Mr. Lecomte.  It is a very moving work and both she 
and I found it overpowering.  I quote her “Every time I see a 
star on the sidewalks of Sarajevo I smile and catch myself 
dreaming.  Much better than before, when I stepped over the 
scars left by the shelling, aware that I was in the shadow of 
death”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shadow of death no longer hovers so closely over 
Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The SFOR's mandate must be renewed to keep 
it away from this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to take part in this take 
note debate and to consider the Government of Canada's intention 
to renew its participation in the NATO led stabilization force in 
Bosnia beyond June 1998 in order to maintain a safe environment 
for reconstruction and reconciliation and a lasting peace for the 
people of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree.  I think it is important that Canada maintain its force 
in Bosnia for the continuation of the kinds of work it has done 
already to help maintain stability and ensure that Bosnians have 
the opportunity to move forward into a more peaceful existence in 
the near future, the mid term and the long term. 
It is important that Canada continue to perform what is regarded 
by most in the world including most Canadians as a critically 
important function in contributing to a better world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has legitimately and for extremely good reason become 
well regarded for its peacekeeping and peacemaking role around 
the world.  It is important that we continue to do that for the 
benefit of those in whose country we operate, in this case Bosnia 
since it is important that we do our bit to ensure peace is 
possible there.  Bosnia and all the other hot spots around the 
world have an impact on Canada too. In order for us to live 
peacefully and constructively we need to ensure we play our role 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put these supporting words into context I will make some 
comments about the approach the federal government and Canada has 
traditionally taken with regard to the role of its armed forces. 
The auditor general and many within the armed forces have cast 
considerable doubt on the ability of Canada's armed forces to do 
the jobs they have been set to do.  The main reason is that this 
House and the Canadian government do not have a clear view of 
what functions the armed forces should provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without knowing where we are going it is very difficult to know 
what resources need to be made available to the armed forces to 
ensure their priorities are met.  It is not clear to many 
Canadians what our priorities are with regard to our armed 
forces.  The auditor general has quite rightly pointed out the 
difficulties this generates for the armed forces, not only for 
the front line personnel but for others who make important 
decisions.  It is not clear what place new equipment, refurbished 
old equipment, or modernized equipment has because we are not 
sure what role we want our forces to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community has gone through a dramatic 
transformation since the end of the cold war.  The end of the 
cold war marked the end of close to a century of strife in which 
the world was repeatedly torn apart by the varying rival military 
alliances of the great industrial and military powers. They were 
rivalries which brought us the two world wars and the cold war. 
During such an age it was often necessary to seek security in 
military alliances. It was equally true that the greatest 
temptation of such an age was to imagine that security was 
exclusively a matter of military strength and of participation in 
the collective security of military alliances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP and the CCF before it were among those internationalists 
who always argued that it was important to think of security as 
something broader and deeper than the security associated with 
collective military alliances.  The CCF supported the view that 
danger was found not only in military threats but in the social 
and international tensions created by economic exploitation and 
inequality, by the international arms trade and by the 
manipulation of smaller states by great powers in their strategic 
rivalries with other great powers.  That criticism continues to 
this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1960s the NDP built on that CCF critique by adding the 
nuclear arms race to the list of security threats.  By the 1980s 
global poverty, environmental degradation and widespread human 
rights violations were also seen by New Democrats and by 
progressive people around the world as essential elements of any 
risk assessment that Canadians interested in security matters 
should take into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The culmination of this perspective in international relations 
for the CCF and NDP was a foreign policy statement entitled 
“Canada's Stake in Common Security” prepared in 1988.  It has 
been the basic thrust of the NDP's defence and foreign affairs 
policy since.  The main framework of NDP policy was articulated 
in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common security instead of traditional collective security is to 
be preferred and actively sought and modelled by a Canada that no 
longer sees itself primarily or even at all as a stakeholder in a 
collective alliance. 
Canada's real stake is in a world run according to the rules of 
common security.  The paper of course is a little dated now, but 
its essence remains the same and might be argued to be more 
poignant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A policy of global common security is surely crucial to human 
survival in the post cold war era.  We must not put to rest the 
bipolar world of the cold war only to slip back into a multipolar 
world of competing regional if not ideologically based alliances, 
or regress to the international anarchy of the international 
system before the First World War.  Neither should we assent to a 
unipolar scenario that would allow the Americans to assume the 
role of global policeman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the cold war many Canadians had high expectations 
for the possibilities of building a common security.  Many hoped 
that with the end of the horrifyingly surreal definition of 
international security as a nuclear balance of terror there would 
finally open up some real opportunities for an authentic 
conception of common security.  Such a common security would 
continue to have a military dimension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, systems of mutual independent surveillance, 
global arms reduction treaties and military information sharing 
all integrated into a new global security architecture preferably 
under the auspices of a reformed and revitalized UN would have to 
be developed and maintained.  On the other hand, governments 
could spend more on international development, poverty reduction 
and environmental protection and engage constructively in the 
democratic development of developing societies as a way of 
achieving genuine international security, rather than propping up 
so-called friendly authoritarian regimes as happened so often 
during the cold war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's New Democrats would want to mobilize this reservoir of 
hope for a common security, but we realize there are fundamental 
changes ahead.  The end of the cold war has brought us a few 
welcome steps back from the brink of nuclear holocaust. The 
decades of addiction to grotesque levels of military spending and 
the obscene accumulation of weapons of mass destruction have left 
the world with a formidable hangover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nuclear weapons remain the single greatest threat to the future 
of the planet.  A flourishing arms trade, of which Canada plays a 
part, ensures the world is still awash with military hardware. 
Millions of innocent people are threatened daily with a plague of 
anti-personnel land mines.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs has 
played a major role in addressing this issue.  This hangover 
takes the form not only of deadly war materiel, but also in the 
social conflicts left in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and other former communist states in Europe and in the 
breakdown of social peace in many African states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the international community must respond to the 
changing technological and social faces of war.  For the 
militaries of industrialized countries, new information 
technology is leading to the development of an array of new 
so-called smart weapons which are dramatically changing the 
dynamics of warfare on the battlefield.  In many recent conflicts 
the social warfare is changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canada play a major role in helping the 
international community find its way through the military dangers 
peculiar to the post cold war era and on building a democratic 
world order where communities and finally the global community 
can contain and shape the global marketplace to make it serve the 
common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, it is important that Canada's armed forces 
understand their role.  The first call on Canada's defence policy 
and armed forces, as it is for any country, must be to guarantee 
the territorial integrity of the country.  While we share the 
longest undefended border in the world with the United States, 
Canada's geography poses substantial challenges to the tasks of 
guaranteeing our territorial sovereignty and environmental 
integrity.   Thousands of miles of coastline present challenges 
to the prevention of illegal hazardous waste dumping and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canada's armed forces are equipped to meet 
these challenges.  The auditor general points out some problems 
in this regard.  Canada needs to be able to fulfil that primary 
role, that of defending Canada's integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of our commitment to NATO, Canada needs to be able to 
play our role in the trans-Atlantic security issues.  That is why 
we are in Bosnia in the first place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the NDP, the CCF supported the creation of NATO and 
Canada's membership in it from its inception and right throughout 
the 1950s. In the course of the 1960s many members of my party 
and many Canadians became increasingly critical of American 
foreign policy and of NATO's first use of nuclear weapons policy. 
They called into question the wisdom and legitimacy of Canada's 
membership in NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has added to that concern in the recent past is the almost 
complete domination of NATO by the United States.  Were it the 
case that Canada was participating in Bosnia under the auspices 
of the United Nations, we would have absolutely no reservations 
at all.  But I think everybody is saddened by the fact that this 
has to take place under the auspices of NATO and is largely then 
seen as an American driven operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that we strengthen the United Nations. We also 
have to make sure that Canada works toward the abolition of 
nuclear weapons. We should also do our best to eliminate the 
international arms trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things we have to pay attention to if we are going 
to focus on whether our armed forces have the tools to do the 
job.  This comes with regard to peacekeeping in particular and 
also with regard to conflict prevention. I will say just a few 
words on each. Canadians are rightly proud of Canada's record as 
a leading participant in UN peacekeeping missions and want to 
build on past and present experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tragic incidents in Somalia show the need for vigilance and 
the maintenance of professionalism in the military and civilian 
leadership of Canada's armed forces.  The government has been 
rightly criticized for the way in which it handled the Somalia 
inquiry, for cutting it short and for not carrying out all of the 
recommendations of the Somalia inquiry. It is crucial that as 
Canada works its way through this period that the Canadian public 
has confidence in the integrity of the relationship between the 
civilian and military leadership in Canada's armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada fashions its military policies to support the 
peacekeeping missions we are so often called upon to make, it is 
important to distinguish between the variety of UN missions. They 
are often grouped together under the rubric of peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often it is the case that Canadian military personnel find 
themselves not keeping the peace that is in place but bringing 
about peace among warring parties, as was the case in Somalia and 
which I think is a component in Bosnia too. In other situations 
military personnel are sent to secure food supplies and safe 
havens for civilians in the context of civil or international 
conflicts, which is plainly the case in Bosnia and in a number of 
other missions.  In these situations of peacemaking and 
protecting civilians from conflicts in progress, the Canadian 
military will need to maintain armed forces equipped and trained 
to be combat capable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military planning, so long attuned to the context of the 
cold war where peacekeeping was of secondary importance, must 
adjust to the primary importance of peacekeeping and peacemaking 
for our armed forces. It is important for this place and the 
government to make clear Canada's commitment to peacekeeping and 
peacemaking and following that to ensure there are the resources, 
the materiel and the personnel needed in order to appropriately 
fulfil that requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs to play a stronger role in conflict prevention. 
Perhaps the Prime Minister's visit to Cuba this week is an 
indication of a commitment to that.  Certainly it is an 
indication that we are prepared to be independent of the United 
States on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a leading contributor of personnel and resources to UN 
peacekeeping missions, Canada has a special responsibility to 
work for a just international order of common security which is 
geared to conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventing conflict means addressing the problems at their 
roots, encouraging democratic development and human rights, 
sustainable development to prevent resource depletion and an 
international economic order that will reduce inequalities and 
eliminate poverty. We have not done a very good job on these last 
matters. We have not made a major contribution in this area. Such 
a conflict prevention approach is not primarily a military matter 
but it is a question of prevention. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT121"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to play our proper role in the world, we have to do 
our bit on the prevention side.  We know from various issues at 
home, social programs, health care and unemployment, that we take 
prevention issues seriously.  We should do that in the military 
too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two final points to make.  If we are to ask the Canadian 
Armed Forces to play these important peacekeeping-peacemaking 
roles, as I have said, we need to ensure that we have a clear 
vision of what those forces are intended to do.  We need to back 
up that clear vision with resources in order to fulfil that 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment we have neither the vision nor the resources to 
adequately fulfil the jobs we ask the forces to perform from time 
to time.  That is my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make is that it is becoming 
increasingly clear that the morale in Canada's armed forces is at 
an all time low.  One of the things we surely cannot expect to do 
is to ask the men and women in our armed services to go into 
dangerous situations in circumstances in which their morale is 
low and in circumstances in which they feel they are not 
adequately appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former vice-admiral, Chuck Thomas, has said “We put our 
troops in jeopardy when we don't give them enough money to 
support their families.  Soldiers have never been rich but I have 
never seen anything like this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence committee is crossing the country and hearing on a 
daily basis of how difficult it is for soldiers and their 
families to make ends meet.  Surely we cannot expect these men 
and women to risk their lives for the benefit of the world in a 
far off place unless we treat them well, unless we treat them 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize—and indeed the Minister of National Defence 
appears to have recognized it—that there is a serious problem 
which needs to be addressed.  That is one thing.  It is another 
thing to actually address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation in which our armed forces personnel are not 
feeling very confident about their role within their 
organization.  They do not like the way they are treated, feel 
they are undermined economically and socially, and have some 
difficulty seeing why they should do what they are called upon to 
do when they are not adequately appreciated.  Indeed a recent 
internal Canadian forces poll showed that 83% of the military has 
lost faith in the leadership.  That is not a very good sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I would like to make is with regard to the 
auditor general's report that was published today.  It raises 
very serious concerns about the ability of our forces to function 
within present circumstances.  He says, for example, that if the 
status quo persists the department's available capital funding 
may not be sufficient to equip and modernize the force that 
national defence is currently planning.  He points out the roles 
that have been expected of the armed forces but calls for a 
significant refocusing of the mission and a reallocation of 
resources to do the job we are asking them to do today.  He talks 
about declining funds for equipment modernization.  He talks 
about the Canadian forces trying to cope with equipment 
deficiencies and shortages.  He says that the army has difficulty 
keeping pace with technology and that the air force is facing 
obsolescence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these things is designed to provide any confidence in 
the ability of our armed forces to do the job that is asked of 
them.  We all know that those men and women will do the job that 
is asked of them, but are the government and the armed forces as 
a whole up to the task?

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak today on the issue of whether Canadian 
troops should renew their participation in the NATO led 
stabilization force or what is better known as SFOR.  Indeed my 
party, the party that when in government first ensured Canadian

renew Canadian participation now under the NATO banner and beyond 
the current June 20 deadline.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no mistake about it.  The debate we entered into 
tonight has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the 
Prime Minister is interested in the opinions of the other 
parties.  It has everything to do with optics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this debate and when this issue is raised in the public 
eye the Prime Minister will surely declare that there was a 
debate in the House, that all parties took part and that everyone 
had a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case.  For the record I would like to read the 
motion put forward by the government, the one we are debating 
this evening: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the intention of the Government of 
Canada to renew its participation in the NATO-led stabilization 
force— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Take note of the government's intentions”.  That is what we 
are doing tonight.  This is an important debate and my party will 
make its voice heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I will make is that this should not be a take 
note debate.  If the government had courage it would make this a 
votable motion the way it should be.  However the government has 
no courage and no understanding.  If it had either, the Prime 
Minister would not have felt it necessary to make this evening's 
vote on whether to compensate all victims who contracted 
hepatitis C because of tainted blood a vote of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada is not confident that his 
government is doing the right thing.  He does not have the 
courage to stand behind his government's decision.  Instead he 
had to use the authority of the whip to put his party's 
government in line.  That is not a courageous thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that I talk about courage tonight.  If the men 
and women who will be affected by the government's policy to 
extend Canada's participation in SFOR have only one thing, it is 
courage.  As we represent Canadians in the Chamber they represent 
Canada in uniform, carrying a gun and risking their lives in a 
far off place that many Canadians cannot even find on the map. 
They are armed with courage.  I am sure they expect no less from 
the government they are serving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the current government always disappoints in the 
department of courage.  Did it take courage to whip government 
backbenchers into line for tonight's hepatitis C vote?  No.  Did 
it take courage last week when Canada abstained from a crucial 
United Nations vote condemning the forced recruitment of child 
soldiers in Uganda?  No.  Did it take courage for the Prime 
Minister to stand beside the Cuban dictator in Havana while he 
compared the current American embargo to the murder of six 
million Jewish lives during World War II's Holocaust and not say 
anything, not a word?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will always make excuses after the fact but it 
has never shown courage at the appropriate time.  The foreign 
minister, an individual who while highly educated has not one 
clue about the lessons this century has taught, has since 
confessed that a mistake was made when Canada abstained from the 
UN vote.  That is simply not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fearful government that celebrates easy decisions and 
avoids the difficult ones.  In fact the only reason we are here 
tonight is that the Prime Minister does not have the courage to 
stand up to the Canadian public and say bluntly that Canadians 
are staying in Bosnia longer than expected because if they do not 
stay we risk losing all that has been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the Prime Minister will appear before the Canadian 
public and say that parliament decided to extend Canadian 
involvement.  Even though it was the Prime Minister's 
decision—and by the way it was a good one—he does not have the 
courage to stand and say it was his decision just in case there 
are Liberals out there who might not agree with him. Instead he 
will hide behind tonight's meaningless take note debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said that if there were one thing Canadian soldiers would 
be bringing with them to Bosnia it would be courage, I did not 
mean to exaggerate.  The government has cut the defence budget by 
30% in the last five years.  That is taking its toll. It is 
taking its toll on equipment and on training.  As the defence 
committee travelled from base to base this spring we found that 
it was taking its toll on the simple quality of life that my 
party believes soldiers should enjoy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, while the government expects Canada's forces to jump when 
the Prime Minister gives the word and while the dedicated people 
who make up the Canadian forces will always respond when the 
government calls, the government abuses the forces.  The 
government abuses the force's dedication to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot think of a more disgusting waste of talent and 
dedicated men and women than to abuse their dedication by not 
providing them with the equipment, training and resources they 
need to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government continues this trend of abusing the Canadian 
military there will come a time when the Prime Minister says 
“okay, boys, it's time to go” and the response will come “I am 
sorry, sir, but we can't perform that mission”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer will come, not because they will not want to perform 
their particular mission, not because they do not want to come to 
the aid of Canada, but because their government has let them down 
and they no longer have the equipment to do the job.  That day 
will come, sooner than one would think unless the government 
begins to show the smallest ounce of courage and do its most 
fundamental job, protect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Prime Minister, as I am sure the current Minister of 
National Defence has done behind closed doors, to stop abusing 
the Canadian forces, to show some courage in leadership and to 
give them the resources they need to do their job, this time in 
Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard tonight good reasons why Canada must 
extend its stay in Bosnia.  Good work has been started and must 
continue.  To leave now would be to abandon all that has been 
accomplished, but there is another reason that has not yet been 
pointed out in the Chamber.  It was hardly mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue came before the committee in November.  When I 
mentioned it at the committee to the NATO ambassadors they were 
frank with me.  NATO is undergoing change.  There will be three 
new member countries and, to his credit, the Prime Minister was 
on the right side of the issue when it came to expanding NATO. 
However, to be honest, NATO's role will have to be adjusted 
somewhat if it is to continue being effective in this post-cold 
war era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of NATO and whether NATO should be expanded further or 
at all, or whether NATO should even exist, are issues that will 
continue to be debated.  In fact they were being debated this 
week on the floor of the United States Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intent to enter into that debate tonight, but it is 
important to note that while the world debates the current 
usefulness of NATO all eyes are on Bosnia and the current NATO 
forces there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If NATO were to fail in its stated mission of implementing the 
Dayton accord, the voices of those who would have NATO disband 
will grow louder.  For that reason and others mentioned here 
tonight, my party supports the decision already taken by the 
Prime Minister to renew Canada's participation in the NATO led 
stabilization force beyond June 20, 1998 in order to maintain a 
safe environment for reconstruction, reconciliation and a lasting 
peace for the people of Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party's only concern with tonight's take note motion is that 
the government expects Canada's soldiers to show more courage 
than it ever has.  We should all be thankful that the men and 
women who wear Canada's uniform are up for the job.

particularly grateful to my colleague for Compton—Stanstead and 
my colleague for Richmond—Arthabaska for sharing time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attached a great deal of importance to taking advantage of my 
presence in this House to make a few comments on the renewal of 
our Armed Forces commitment in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, this was because of my respect for our young 
military personnel serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, of whom 
we are very proud.  We often see them coming to our assistance 
when there are natural disasters. 
My region of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean has had the opportunity to 
benefit from their expertise, and above all has seen their 
devotion, during the recent disasters, not only in my region, 
but also in the Greater Montreal region and in the West.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, when we see them helping out their fellow human beings in 
other countries, Bosnia in particular in the past few years, we 
tend to forget them.  The time has come for all MPs to try to 
see the armed forces in a more positive light than they have in 
recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you have listened to all the speeches within this debate this 
evening, they indicate, I believe, that by far the majority of 
Canadian MPs agree there is a very serious problem within our 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike my colleagues who have already spoken, I have not had the 
opportunity to visit our military personnel on the battlefields 
of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
However, I particularly appreciated what these members shared 
with us this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common thread that runs through all these remarks, all the 
judgments that have been made, is that we cannot keep asking our 
military to do the impossible. Incredible efforts are demanded 
of our troops as part of NATO, both at home and abroad, to help 
foreign countries torn apart by terrible wars. In this context, 
be it only for peacekeeping, everyone agrees that it takes 
rather extraordinary courage to agree to serve in the Canadian 
Armed Forces outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the committee is currently travelling across the 
country. Some 25 military sites will be toured by our colleagues 
from all the parties represented in this House. I do hope that 
the committee's recommendations will not be left to gather dust 
on a shelf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague said, morale in our armed forces is indeed 
at its lowest. Unfortunately, it is not in a superficial, 
strictly routine debate like this one today that we will be able 
to make any real, significant contribution to the future of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. All tonight's debate is good for is to 
take note of the fact that the government intends to renew our 
commitment to peacekeeping within NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a few briefings on various Canadian bases, I figure the 
government must have gained some awareness of the kind of 
recommendations and suggestions the military make to us through 
the Standing Committee on National Defence. I want to 
congratulate all my colleagues on this committee. They visited 
the base in Bagotville, and that was greatly appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said that the climate is very unhealthy and, as we 
know, there is severe attrition within the Canadian armed 
forces. This attrition has its causes, and I think the committee 
will be able to make a harsh judgement on our attitude toward 
the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal to continue to require incredible efforts of 
our troops who have to work very hard with foreign forces that 
are a lot better equipped than they are. We know we have the 
best soldiers in the world. They have to make unlimited efforts 
to be on the same level as soldiers from several other countries 
within NATO because those people are better equipped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several NATO countries throughout the world have made an 
important choice. Here, in the House of Commons, we have always 
been reluctant to make that choice. 
This is one rare occasion where almost all political parties 
without exception agree that it is not normal that we do not pay 
more attention to the quality of life of Canadian soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence budget was cut by 30 to 40% in recent years. 
Everybody supports rationalization. However, I think that, if 
there is an area that deserves a lot of consideration, it is the 
area related to our Canadian troops, who must carry out mandates 
that are extremely dangerous.

<A HREF="#LINKT125"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, everybody agrees that the quality of our equipment is 
at a minimum. We all know Canadian soldiers. The major regions 
of this country all have military infrastructures. One must 
listen to what these people have to say to realize how serious a 
deficiency there is in this area. I do not know if it is bad 
purchases or if priorities are not clearly identified, but the 
bottom line is that our soldiers are really not equipped to be 
part of such international forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for training and for salaries. Indeed, 20%, 25%, 
30% and even 40% of pilots in certain squadrons leave and go to 
work in the private sector, because the difference in the 
working conditions is simply too great. It is not that our 
military do not enjoy their work, but in the end the difference 
in the quality of life in the armed forces and in the private 
sector becomes too great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think our young military personnel have taken much abuse from 
the federal government—including all previous governments. The 
time has come to have, here in the House, a constructive 
discussion on how we view the important role of our armed forces 
and the type of contribution we are prepared to make to allow 
them to be among the most effective in the world. 
We are currently asking the impossible from our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign, our party suggested—and this 
was one of our major commitments—the creation of a special 
intervention unit, an elite corps that would have integrated 
members of the three branches of the forces, that is between 
14,000 and 16,000 troops. This might have helped us to better 
prepare about one quarter of Canadian troops for international 
missions, and for missions in our own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should make a careful reading of chapters 3 and 4 of the 
auditor general's report. Unfortunately, I do not have time to 
read the main excerpts, but the report stresses that Parliament 
should be able to determine whether DND's resources are 
adequate, given Canada's defence objectives. 
I took a rather close look at this report, and we should listen 
carefully to the auditor general's recommendations, regardless 
of our political affiliation. Our troops are being asked to do 
the impossible, both at personal and operational levels. I hope 
that the report of the standing committee will make all of us 
here more grateful to our military personnel for their services.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your recognizing me for the debate on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the motion because I think it is important to 
look at something in the wording.  This is a government motion by 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the intention of the Government of 
Canada to renew its participation in the NATO led stabilization 
force, SFOR, in Bosnia beyond June 20, 1998—. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are almost in May. 
We are in a take note debate because the decision was made and 
announced some time ago.  We are here debating whether Canada 
will carry on its commitment beyond June 20, 1998.  Clearly this 
is a joke.  Where is the planning horizon the government works 
on?  It clearly is not there.  It really does not plan things.  I 
think that will explain some of the problems I will bring up 
in my presentation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT126"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with three questions. First, can Canada deliver on 
the renewal of this commitment for six months and beyond? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what will the price be if this becomes a very long term 
sustained commitment in Bosnia? What will the price be to the 
forces and to the men and women who serve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, what must change so that Canada can deliver should 
Canadians choose to support it over the long term? That is what I 
will deal with in my presentation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the debate itself and the fact that 
the debate is happening under these circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is can Canada deliver.  The answer is yes. 
Looking at a six month commitment, which is what this motion is 
about, and a force of 1,200 men and women then yes, Canada can 
deliver and it will deliver.  We have men and women in Petawawa 
right now who have been training and preparing to leave in June. 
They will serve serve well and Canada will meet its commitment 
over the six month period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are talking about a 10 to 20 year period which is probably 
what will be needed to stabilize the area then the answer is no, 
not with the lack of commitment the current government has shown 
to our forces and to the men and women who serve so well.  It is 
no, not with the continued force of 1,200 or more which may well 
become what is needed if things escalate.  That certainly could 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is no, not with the current commitment Canada has in 
other parts of the world.  The answer is no with the current lack 
of commitment to proper equipment that has been shown by this 
government.  The answer is no, not with the ever reducing number 
of men and women in our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to whether Canada can deliver over the six month 
term, which we are debating today, is yes.  It can and will. 
That is in spite of the level of commitment this government has 
to our forces, not because of it.  It is because of the 
incredible men and women serving in our forces.  That is 
something you learn as you travel from base to base in this 
country.  The men and women in our forces are tremendously well 
equipped in terms of their personal abilities and are well 
trained and committed.  There is no doubt about that. They will 
deliver because of what they are, not because of what they are 
given to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What might the price be that our forces might pay if we end up 
indefinitely, six month term after six month term? Those of us 
who have travelled from base to base with the SCONDVA committee 
started to realize what the price might be. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT128"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT128"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2130

<A HREF="#LINKT127"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price is unacceptable in terms of what will happen to our 
forces and their ability to do what they should be doing, which 
is to defend the sovereignty of our nation, to be there in the 
case of natural disasters like the floods and the ice storms, and 
to be there to deal with civil unrest, which we have already seen 
in Oka and which we could well see in various parts of the 
country over the next years.  I do not have the time to get into 
any detail on the price, but the price that we have seen 
manifests itself in several ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it manifests itself in terms of morale.  Generally 
speaking, we have seen from base to base across the country that 
the morale of the men and women in our forces is not high. 
Further deterioration in morale could well be the price they pay. 
Families are being torn apart due to a lack of commitment, what 
has happened over the past years and what will happen if things 
do not change, if we maintain this kind of commitment overseas 
and here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing was made clear.  Men and women are happy to serve. 
When they are asked if they would like to go on a tour to Bosnia 
they say yes.  They say yes for a couple of reasons.  One, 
because they will get extra money which their families 
desperately need.  Their pay levels are not sufficient.  They say 
yes because they joined the forces to serve their country.  This 
is an opportunity to do that.  They say yes because they know the 
training they will receive in this area is second to none in 
making them ready to be a part of a combat-ready force which this 
country deserves and desperately needs to defend our sovereignty. 
They go for those reasons, in spite of the price that they and 
their families might and do pay.  We have seen it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third concern I would like to raise is what must change so 
that Canada can deliver, if Canadians determine that is what 
should happen.  Canadians have never been asked about this issue. 
I will talk about that when I wrap up, when I discuss this debate 
and the conditions under which it is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed in very broad terms to change things so that 
Canada can deliver?  Specifically, what must this government and 
future governments do to build a sustainable and top quality 
military? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they must show commitment to change in the structure of 
our forces and leadership.  I am not saying that all the 
leadership in the Canadian forces is not good.  Certainly, some 
of the men and women are top notch, as well as some of the 
leaders in our military.  They must show this commitment to 
change, to change in leadership and to change in the structure of 
the forces, separating the military from the civil service 
branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they must show commitment in terms of money.  Spending 
on our forces has been reduced from about $12.5 billion, when I 
started looking at this in 1992, to $9.3 billion.  It has been 
cut too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the government must demonstrate two things.  First, that 
it believes we need a strong combat-ready military.  Second, that 
it believes the men and women who serve in our forces are doing a 
great job and that they are top quality.  They must demonstrate 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask this question.  When was the last time a 
prime minister in Canada said that our country, Canada, really 
needs our military and that the very existence of Canada depends 
on us having a good military? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When was the last time we heard a prime minister stand in this 
House or elsewhere to say that the men and women in our forces do 
a great job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have listened to the debate in the House this evening 
and it is very clear that the mood of the House is strongly in 
favour of extending the presence of our troops for a renewed 
mandate in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great challenge to the world community taking place 
in Bosnia at this time.  As we watch what is taking place in 
Kosovo we know how important it is for us to ensure that the 
mission in Bosnia is successful, that peace in eastern Europe 
depends upon it and that we Canadians are playing an important 
role in guaranteeing that peace, that security, that development 
of civic society that the Dayton Accords presage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to the NDP spokesman who said that the mandate which 
has been given our troops and the role that the government has 
provided is not clear.  We heard a Conservative spokesperson say 
that the morale of our troops is low.  We heard our Reform 
colleague just now say no to a commitment that would be too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with all of those opinions.  I have had the honour of 
going to Bosnia and the honour of speaking to our troops there. 
They know what their role is.  They have a high morale because 
the challenges they face each and every day are challenges which 
they have chosen to face.  They have enormous responsibility, 
requiring military ability, but also human qualities, an ability 
to bring people together, to deal with sensitive political 
issues, to demine houses, to act at the staff level, to control 
movements and arrangements between some troops of some 23 nations 
which bring into play the best qualities of all Canadians:  their 
bilingualism, their biculturalism, their multiculturalism, their 
tolerance, their ability to encourage people to act together and 
to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing in Bosnia and the role of our troops in that 
process is extremely important.  Let me just recall a few 
elements.  In the first place there are the Bosnian elections. As 
members know the international community through OSCE has 
invested heavily in Bosnian elections as they are the instrument 
for the success of the entire peace process.  Municipal elections 
held there in September 1997 were of great importance, given the 
extent to which power is decentralized in that area.  Elections 
held in the Republic of Srpska on November 22 and 23 of 1997 
established the first truly multi-ethnic government in Bosnia. 
In September of 1998, this year, general elections will take 
place, the second set to be held under the Dayton peace plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's role in these elections has been important.  We have 
assisted the OSCE with the technical preparations for the 
elections and we have committed over $6 million to this process. 
Our assistant chief electoral officer has participated along with 
other experts in forming groups necessary to assure the success 
of these elections.  These elections will not be successful and 
indeed may not even take place if it is not for the presence of 
our troops and those of our allies in that area. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second element. There are in the former Yugoslavia 
close de 3.2 million refugees and displaced persons as well as 
persons affected by the war who need help. Current conditions in 
Bosnia, both in terms of security and economy, make it difficult 
for refugees to return home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been advocating a concerted effort to identify those 
who can and want to go home now so that they receive special 
attention and help on a priority basis. Our country provided 
close to $65 million during the war and in excess of $17 million 
in humanitarian assistance to the former Yugoslavia since the 
end of the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence of our troops is essential to the success of this 
operation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third element, which is the housing and the 
rebuilding of infrastructure in ex-Yugoslavia and in Bosnia.  An 
estimated 50% of all housing units in Bosnia were damaged during 
the war and 6% were completely destroyed.  Canada provides 
funding to the emergency shelter and materials fund of the United 
Nations and has provided emergency shelter throughout the former 
Yugoslavia.  Under CIDA, Canada has established a special 
facility to assist Canadian construction firms active in the 
Bosnian and Croatian markets.

to see and talk to our troops.  They have actually helped to 
clean up and repaint the hospitals and schools.  They had worked 
on the hospital that we visited.  The doctors were there when the 
hospital was re-opened.  There was a sense of tremendous 
dedication on the part of the troops and a sense of tremendous 
gratitude on the part of that local community when they saw their 
hospital functioning again, thanks to the input of our troops and 
their ability to work on the side, in addition to their other 
heavy responsibilities, to achieve that and other goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rebuilding and the infrastructure that needs to be replaced 
in Bosnia will be assured by virtue of the presence of our 
troops, not only by the security they provide, but by the 
personal efforts they make to ensure this happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth aspect of their presence that is equally important is 
the aspect of the land mine clearance.  According to initial 
predictions it could take some 70 years to clear the three 
million land mines left from the recent conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia.  Canada has taken a lead in urging increased support 
for demining and for greater government and donor co-ordination 
to help work in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider the removal of land mines a priority for 
humanitarian reasons, particularly to ensure the safety of 
children returning to school after years of conflict and to 
encourage the return of refugees.  Mine clearance will also allow 
for the reconstruction of infrastructure necessary for economic 
renewal.  We have contributed money and are contributing men and 
effort to this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land mines convention is one of the great prides of our 
recent diplomatic efforts and the area of Bosnia is one place 
where its success, at least in the demining aspect, will be 
tested.  The presence of our troops is essential, not only to 
ensure the stability necessary to achieve that, but to also help 
in the technical aspects of achieving that extremely important 
goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will turn to the health sector.  It is extremely 
important in a community ravaged by war to re-establish decent 
health.  We again had the opportunity when we were there to visit 
hospitals.  We visited the hospital in downtown Sarajevo which 
was shelled and in which people operated under incredible 
circumstances during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as Canadians are contributing to community based 
rehabilitation in Bosnia.  Queen's University is there providing 
a self-sustaining program of physiotherapy to an estimated 40,000 
people with war injuries and is training of some 200 health 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other rehabilitation programs which are too numerous 
for me to name.  However, I want to share with the House one 
example of an important program, the MAP international project, 
which provided some $2 million worth of selected pharmaceuticals 
to Bosnia.  Members of the committee were there when these were 
distributed.  Some of them were given to the president of the 
Republic of Srpska to reward her and her government for the 
efforts they were making to ensure peace and co-operation with 
SFOR troops in her area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these important elements, the return of refugees, the 
civil security, the return of decent government, assistance to 
the health sector, the rebuilding of schools and communities, 
depend on the presence of our troops, our young men and women who 
are there extending their helping hand, not only providing 
security, but also in a sensitive and an extraordinarily truly 
Canadian way working with people in these communities to ensure 
they can recover their lost and shattered lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those troops deserve our support.  I believe those troops want 
to stay.  I believe those troops believe strongly that they want 
to be there to finish the job.  We as members of the world 
community owe it not only to ourselves and to stability in Europe 
but also to our fine young men and women who have served and will 
continue to serve to ensure that they will do the job to 
guarantee peace and stability in a region that is very important 
to us all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, tonight I have the 
honour of speaking in support of the continued participation of 
the Canadian forces in the NATO mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina 
following the completion of the current mission on June 20 of 
this year. 
This follow on force will be tasked with preventing any renewal 
of hostilities in the unstable Balkans region.  Its purpose is to 
provide general support to the enforcement of the civil 
provisions in the Dayton peace accord.

<A HREF="#LINKT130"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All our key allies and the international organizations working 
in the area agree on the need to extend the SFOR follow on force. 
The secure environment established and maintained by SFOR is 
deemed vital to the reconstruction effort in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues to indicate their support for Canada's 
participation for the following reasons.  First, SFOR's work in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina is not finished and the work of the Canadian 
forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina is not finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada has a tradition of responding to the call of the 
international community whenever world security has been 
threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we have a long and honourable tradition of participating 
in multilateral operations.  We have served under the flags of 
the United Nations and NATO and in operations involving groups of 
nations sharing the same interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, our continued participation in SFOR is consistent with 
Canada's defence policy.  In particular we believe in the 
importance of collective security and we continually contribute 
to preserving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now Canada has invested heavily in terms of time, 
resources and personnel to promote peace and security in the 
Balkans.  We have always played a pivotal role, serving with the 
European Community monitoring system, UNPROFOR from 1992 to 1995, 
IFOR from 1995 to 1996 and now SFOR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the military aspects of the hostilities are not the be 
all and end all of the mission.  The civil ramifications of the 
military operations must be considered, especially in an area of 
such deep rooted strife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military plans and operations within SFOR have been 
cognizant of civil conditions and activities.  Throughout the 
military operations thus far it was important to improve public 
security, fight organized crime and corruption, and promote 
balanced media.  Separating the warring factions was not the only 
objective.  That is why it is so important to continue the 
mission.  The civil provisions of the accord must also be upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees 
belonging to ethnic minorities is presenting serious problems. 
The political struggle between the various ethnic groups 
continues to undermine efforts to consolidate peace.  In other 
words the parties involved are not prepared to assume 
responsibility for their joint future.  It is clear that they 
cannot count on the involvement of the international community 
indefinitely, but they clearly are not yet ready to go it alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the violence which erupted in Kosovo in March and which 
nearly led to war, and in light of the riots which took place in 
Drvar only a few days ago, we must acknowledge the fact that 
instability continues to haunt Bosnia-Hercegovina and by 
extension the entire Balkan region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short it is absolutely critical for Canada to extend her 
involvement in SFOR.  It is consistent with the efforts we have 
made for many years aimed at establishing peace in this area of 
the world by creating the stability required to implement the 
Dayton accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the Bosnian situation within the historical 
perspective of Canada's role in international affairs, we can 
only arrive at the same conclusion.  The fact is that in past 
years when the international community called upon Canada to 
preserve peace, liberty and democracy our country always answered 
the call.  Today we intend to carry on this honourable tradition 
within our means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has traditionally shouldered its share of 
responsibilities in the world's hot spots when international 
security was threatened.  Canada answered the call during both 
world wars, the Korean war, the gulf war and on many peacekeeping 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's vast experience with multilateral operations has 
allowed us to make a major contribution to international security 
notably in Somalia, Haiti, central Africa, the Middle East, the 
Persian Gulf and of course the Balkans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the Canadian forces have managed to maintain 
their traditional commitments with NATO.  During every operation 
they have conducted, whether in Canada or overseas, the men and 
women of the Canadian Armed Forces have demonstrated their 
ability to fulfil in outstanding fashion any mission assigned to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, continued Canadian participation in SFOR is in tune 
with the tine honoured Canadian tradition of doing what we can to 
guarantee respect for life and human dignity both in Canada and 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1994 defence white paper Canada made a commitment to 
continue its active participation in multilateral efforts aimed 
at enhancing collective security. 
This attitude reflects our national interests since Canadians 
believe that their own security cannot be dissociated from that 
of our allies.  However, according to the 1994 defence white 
paper: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multilateral security co-operation is not merely a Canadian 
tradition; it is the expression of Canadian values in the 
international sphere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar vein, the 1994 report of the Special Joint 
Committee on Canada's Defence Policy declared: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we believe Canada stands for values that are worth promoting 
in the larger community, we must be prepared to invest resources 
and commit Canadian troops in defence of those values.  If we are 
not prepared to do so, then what do we stand for as a country? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment a little further on our participation in 
not only this mission but in a large number of missions in recent 
years.  Despite a reduction in financial resources and personnel 
we have asked our forces to do much more with less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on the 1994 Special Joint Committee on Canada's Defence 
Policy.  I agreed then and I agree today that we should 
participate in international missions.  I said then and I say now 
we must provide more resources.  Our forces are conducting the 
missions, but at what cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on National Defence as we heard tonight 
is currently studying the quality of life of Canadian forces 
personnel.  We are hearing many stories from personnel about the 
poor quality of services provided for them by the Department of 
National Defence.  It appears to me that when cuts are needed the 
military is a prime target, but we must consider the impact on 
the personnel on the armoury floor and in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we have cut too far yet, but I am saying we are 
dangerously close to the point of no return.  We must ensure that 
our personnel have not only required equipment for their missions 
but also the support services to assist them and their families 
in coping with their missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my hon. colleagues not only to support Canadian 
involvement in SFOR but our military in general.  We ask these 
men and women to put their lives on the line not only for us but 
for others throughout the world.  We must return that expectation 
by meeting theirs, which is to provide them and their families a 
satisfying quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we should consider the potential drawbacks of a 
Canadian decision to forgo the participation in SFOR.  Failure by 
Canada to participate in the follow on force would fly in the 
face of those values that Canadian forces are charged with 
defending throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, since Canada might possibly be the only NATO country 
not serving with the new force, her failure to participate would 
do serious damage to our reputation among our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude I urge my colleagues to support Canada's 
participation in the SFOR follow on mission.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow 
me first to congratulate you on the daily improvement of your 
French.  You know I am delighted to take part in the debate, 
because there is always a consensus in this House on matters of 
foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind those joining us of what we are debating this 
evening in the special debate, since the House does not usually 
sit beyond 7:30 p.m., and that is the need for Canada to 
continue its involvement in peacekeeping in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will agree that looking back on this century's history, we 
will recall the Armenian genocide, the first world war, the 
second world war, the Korean war, the Vietnam war and especially 
the heightened tension that led to the break up of the Republic 
of Yugoslavia. People in my generation, especially those who 
studied political science as I did, automatically associate Tito 
and Yugoslavia.  There was a belief that the Yugoslavian model 
was a model of a revolving confederation, one that managed a 
potentially explosive balance of various national communities. 
Time has shown us that the Yugoslav model was very fragile 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the Bloc Quebecois, since its arrival in 
the House in October 1993, has always enthusiastically supported 
all peacekeeping operations—in Haiti, Somalia, Rwanda and the 
Central African Republic.

<A HREF="#LINKT132"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought it was a generous way to deal with international 
relations, an alternative way to use our armed forces, where 
troops are sent as peacekeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the situation was a bit 
different. Things started to escalate in 1992. First, we had 
UNPROFOR, then a stabilization force. It was only at the third 
level of operation, in 1995, that we sent peacekeepers over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who take an interest in foreign policy understand full 
well that Canada has some expertise in peacekeeping. Despite our 
sovereignist aspirations, we are very proud to remind people 
that Lester B. Pearson, a former leader of the Liberal Party who 
received the Nobel Peace Prize in the late 50s, was the first 
one to suggest, always under the auspices of the United Nations, 
that armed forces be deployed after a ceasefire has been reached 
in a region where tensions run high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the people watching the debate tonight, some might wonder 
why a country like Canada, with no military engagement 
tradition, where military service is not compulsory, a country 
that was never directly involved in the war, that has no warring 
tradition, would take an interest in what is going on outside 
its borders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my constituents ask me that question, I simply give them 
the example of Bosnia-Hercegovina, a country that has produced, 
since the early 90s, 3.5 million refugees spread around the 
world. Of course, in an era of globalization, when refugees look 
for a new haven, when wars produce political refugees, it all 
has an impact on our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is countries such as Canada, France, Italy and Germany that 
have welcomed these political refugees. Our party believes that 
it is important to make an additional effort in terms of 
equipment, because, as you will remember, Canadians were 
mobilized from Europe and North America for the Sarajevo airlift. 
A <I>Hercules</I> was used to carry supplies. So, there was a Canadian 
contribution in terms of material, troops—about 1,300—and 
international assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the early 90s, close to $80 million in taxpayers' 
money—because Canadians pay taxes and because the government and 
Parliament agreed to humanitarian assistance—was sent through 
CIDA and various international co-operation agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we needed an illustration of how fragile the situation really 
is in Bosnia, how things are not settled yet, how important it 
is for NATO to continue its efforts under the supervision of the 
United Nations, since this is what we are talking about, all we 
would have to remember is that since 1992, 50% of homes in 
Bosnia have been destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an assessment by the United Nations, it will take 
US$4 billion over the next few years to complete the 
construction and reconstruction of Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True, the peace is real, but it is fragile. It is fragile for a 
number of reasons. 
First of all, the Dayton accord, which was negotiated under the 
auspices of the Americans in Ohio, turned Bosnia-Hercegovina into 
a federated republic made up in fact of two states: Serbia and 
the Serbo-Croatian Republic. This unification has not been 
completed yet and they still need to establish national 
institutions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT133"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, there are a number of signs telling us, as foreign 
observers, that the peace, however real, is fragile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few examples.  First of all, of course, there are 
the Bosnian Croats.  Although they openly, formally, officially 
and publicly supported the Dayton accords, they did so with this 
no doubt legitimate hope that could reach extreme proportions 
and threaten peace efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bosnian Croats, who supported the Dayton accords, still 
dream, maybe somewhat secretly, of being reunited with Croatia. 
This shows just how fragile the peace is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, of course,—as you know, Mr. Speaker, because I know 
that you are a keen and vigilant observer of the international 
scene,—the whole question of Kosovo.  Kosovo is a republic of 
Serbia that was for a very long time an independent province and 
that unfortunately saw this status challenged to the point that 
the central government deployed troops there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kosovo is a hotbed of unrest, because 90% of the inhabitants are 
Albanians who understandably have more affinity with Albania 
than with the state to which they have been attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all these factors are taken together, we are well advised, 
as parliamentarians, to seek an extension of the participation 
of NATO, under the auspices of the UN, with a high command.  I 
believe that the NATO and UN mission is very clear. 
It is a preventive mission to ensure that the slightest 
potential for hostility is nipped in the bud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seeds of potential conflict must be suppressed in order to 
ensure that the situation that has prevailed since 1995 can 
become more permanent and that all those, such as Canada, 
Quebec, France and Italy, who believe in peacekeeping efforts in 
the Balkans for the end of the century, can continue to invest 
resources in international co-operation and humanitarian aid so 
that the experience of the former Yugoslavia will never be 
repeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is late in the 
evening.  There has been comment on the length of the debate and 
on the opposition side some disparaging comments on the quality 
of the debate.  I will not enter into that but I would take issue 
immediately with the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry who 
made the comment that parliament did not have a big enough role 
in this debate and in these general questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has taken a very dramatic step forward in the life of the 
present government, although it began in the last parliament 
under the present government, that is to say the commitment made 
by the government that when Canadian forces would be involved in 
military style activities abroad under the United Nations or 
otherwise, parliament would get an opportunity to debate.  It is 
not a decision making role but it is an unprecedented step to 
allow parliament to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been honoured by the government since that undertaking 
was first given in, I believe, 1994.  It has been refined to the 
point where if there is an issue of urgency such as when the 
matter arose during the summer recess with the extension of our 
mandate in Haiti I as parliamentary secretary contacted the 
official spokespersons for all opposition parties and asked for 
their interim approval.  It was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made a step forward here.  There is an involvement of 
parliament and I think the debate tonight reflects that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2205"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting of course that the present government 
inherited the obligations to the United Nations in lineal descent 
from obligations entered into by the preceeding government, the 
Mulroney government.  That was in response to a request by 
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the then secretary general of the United 
Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although SFOR is a different type of operation from the one the 
Mulroney government engaged us in, the lineal descent is clear 
and I think one of the large oversights was on the part of the 
Mulroney government in not insisting in Canadian involvement in 
the decision making group.  We have not been part of the contact 
group.  We were not at the original time and we have not been 
since, and so in a sense we are carrying out macro decisions that 
others are making.  It is not something one would recommend to 
governments in future situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to history which was referred to by the member for 
Red Deer in a somewhat general way, of course we also inherit 
past history. In Santayana's terms, we also inherit the 
non-observervance of history, in his famous aphorism. The 
lessons of the past were not applied, were not understood and so 
wise decisions were not made.  But they were not our decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present grand lines of the Balkan Peninsula, with the 
disintegration of the Ottoman empire, were created at the 
Congress of Berlin in 1878 and through two world wars and two 
Balkan wars which were even bloodier in a limited environment 
they were confirmed in their large lines.  Everything else has 
represented incremental changes or territorial adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was Bismarck in 1878.  There was not an equivalent 
Bismarck in 1989-90 when the Berlin wall was falling down and the 
cold war was ending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems in a certain sense is that the European 
statesmen in 1989-90, it has been said by historians, rushed to a 
premature recognition of successor states to the old Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think their error was not in their recognition of the new 
successor states for it was very clear Slovenia and Croatia had to 
be independent.  But they followed Tito's internal historical 
boundaries which he had created through successive constitutions 
from 1944 onwards, which were really designed to give population 
and geographical balance but which ignored much more than the 
previous historical boundaries under Austria-Hungary and under 
Serbia, and ignored ethnocultural concentrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a very real extent one had sown the seeds of later conflicts 
in 1991-92, the problem of either exchange of populations or 
radical constitutional adjustments for which nobody was prepared. 
It was an example of the doctrine of uti possidetis being 
misapplied and I think we are reckoning with some of the 
consequences of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say, however, that facts cannot themselves 
acquire a normative quality and I think one of the interesting 
facts is President Chirac and his visit to Sarajevo earlier this 
month.  President Chirac is one of those who had the most 
reservations about the dispositions made in 1989-90 in the 
diplomatic terms, but he is referring in essence, echoing 
German legal philosopher Mr. Jellinek, to the normative force of facts. 
New 
frontiers have been created and it is time now with eight years 
of experience to try to make them work.  We enter in that 
context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go into Bosnia again and the mandate is extended, we must 
recognize this is a not a Canadian classic peacekeeping mission 
under chapter 6 of the charter; nor, however, is it a chapter 7 
mission, the peacemaking mission with all the legal powers under 
chapter 7 to apply armed force.  It is in between, 
so it creates problems in deciding the limits of 
competence of our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to tread carefully because in a certain sense the peace 
building role is not defined in terms of what can and cannot be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are subject to the general laws of war but we have a mandate 
essentially to help in limited aspects of matters, maintaining 
elections, trying to get the cities running again, and this is 
something we do very well. 
I think it is probably the biggest justification apart from 
historical continuity.  We have been there and we do not leave a 
job in the middle before it is completed. That is the biggest 
justification for going on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would note here with great pleasure, as I think some earlier 
speakers have, that there will be a massive role for our limited 
number of Canadian forces in mine clearing.  We all remember the 
land mine treaty to which Canada contributed so much.  We took 
the initiative. We went ahead in spite of the reluctance or 
opposition of superpowers and big powers, and 121 countries have 
signed.  There are 300,000 to 1 million mines remaining in Bosnia 
in 18,000 mine fields.  At the moment SFOR is clearing 22,000 
mines a year.  We hope to bring it up to 100,000 but it is quite 
a challenge. I think all Canadians will feel great pride that 
this is one of the responsibilities of our force in Bosnia at the 
present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In suggesting to the House that it approve, not in the legal 
sense the decisions made, but that it give its enthusiastic backing to 
this extension, we entered in the task in good faith.  There were 
conditions that we would not have created if we had been in the 
decision making at the beginning.  But we continue in good faith. 
We have a mission to fulfil and I think we are very proud of what 
we are doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise 
today to discuss the role the Canadian forces have played in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence and a 
member of the national defence committee I have had the 
opportunity to visit the war torn Balkans on two previous 
occasions.  I have seen firsthand the excellent work of our 
troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this Chamber knows of the former Yugoslavia, a 
country torn apart by war, families broken up, human rights 
violated on a massive scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know about the Canadian forces, a military organization 
with an international reputation of excellence.  I have no doubt 
the international respect for the Canadian forces has increased 
as a result of their operations in the former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991 Canadian forces have done their best to assist the 
international community in dealing with the conflict in the 
Balkans.  Indeed they have been at the forefront in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian military personnel have helped prevent the fighting 
from spreading to other parts of the region and becoming even 
more brutal.  They have also accepted to save countless lives in 
assisting in the delivery of humanitarian supplies and preventing 
more massive assaults on civilian populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our military contribution has included a broad range of 
capabilities, at sea and in the air.  As the mandate of the UN 
and NATO forces evolved over the course of the conflict, so too 
did the task performed by Canadian personnel. Duties ranged from 
traditional peacekeeping functions such as monitoring ceasefires 
to more challenging roles that test the skills and training of 
our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1992 when the mandate of the UN protection force, 
UNPROFOR, was expanded a Canadian battalion performed the 
dangerous task of opening the Sarajevo airport.  That was the 
beginning of operation airbridge, the largest humanitarian 
airlift ever.  The air force made some 1,900 flights into 
Sarajevo between 1992 and 1996 with almost 30 million kilograms 
of food, medical supplies as well as 1,100 medical evacuations, 
all under difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were also the first troops to be deployed to the 
former Yugoslavia and the republic of Macedonia.  In the spring 
of 1993 Canadians were sent to the tiny enclave of Srebrenica in 
Bosnia, the first attempt at creating a UN safe area.  In the 
Medak pocket in September 1993 Canadian soldiers became caught in 
a fire fight when they attempted to establish a buffer zone 
between the opposing forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Operations in the former Yugoslavia have presented our military 
leaders with many new and difficult challenges but they have 
responded in magnificent fashion.  Four of our soldiers served as 
deputy force commanders in UNPROFOR and one, Major-General Lewis 
Mackenzie, served as the force commander's chief of staff. They 
have all received praise from the international community for 
their courage and commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked most about our ground forces, but the air force 
and the navy have also played a part in the instrumental role in 
the former Yugoslavia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1992 to 1995 as part of the UN's operation deny flight, the 
Canadian forces provided air crew for surveillance aircraft 
monitoring the UN embargo over Bosnia and Hercegovina.  Today our 
air personnel play an important role in NATO's aerial 
surveillance missions.  As part of the ongoing operation bison, 
they assist in the control of tactical intra-theatre airlift for 
the NATO stabilization force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year six of our CF-18s flew an air umbrella over Bosnia and 
Hercegovina enforcing the no-fly zone and prepared to support the 
troops on the ground if necessary.  I understand that Canadian 
soldiers found great comfort in knowing that there were Canadian 
fighter aircraft patrolling up above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian navy has also done yeoman service.  Between 1992 
and 1996, 11 Canadian warships and four Aurora maritime air 
patrol craft patrolled the Adriatic Sea enforcing the military 
embargo and economic sanctions imposed by the UN.  That is a 
significant commitment of Canadian sea power maritime capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of the Canadian operations in the former Yugoslavia 
has not gone unnoticed by the international community.  When the 
implementation was first established in 1995, the Canadian forces 
were called upon to establish a brigade headquarters in the 
British sector, a clear indication of the respect they have 
earned among our NATO allies.  Their British commander later said 
he had nothing but praise for the efficient, professional 
approach adopted consistently by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civil officials with the UN have also had high praise for the 
men and women in the Canadian forces.  In a letter to the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> last July, the former leader of the World 
Health Organization's humanitarian mission to Yugoslavia wrote 
that the conduct of the Canadian army was highly professional and 
at all times combined discipline with humanity, tact and—is it 
necessary to say—courage in an extremely exacting situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have 1,200 personnel in Bosnia and Hercegovina as 
part of the NATO led stabilization force, or SFOR.  Their mission 
is twofold:  to ensure compliance with the military aspects of 
the Dayton accord and to help preserve the secure environment 
necessary for the consolidation of peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their operational responsibilities include providing local 
security of vital points, deploying forces on both sides of the 
ceasefire line and identifying the dominating potential 
flashpoints. This is difficult, dangerous work but they carry it 
out with a professionalism that has traditionally been the 
earmark of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not make reference to the 
humanitarianism of the men and women of the Canadian forces 
serving in the former Yugoslavia.  During their time there, they 
have participated in a wide range of activities including 
repairing schools, hospitals and roads and providing medical 
care. Let me mention one specific example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the summer of 1994 the crew of the frigate HMCS <I>Halifax</I> 
provided much needed aid to a refugee camp in Slovenia.  Sailors 
donated 50 bags of toys and clothing for the camp residents. 
Eight sailors conducted general maintenance around the camp 
including plumbing, carpentry, roofing and painting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What most Canadians do not realize is that much of the 
humanitarian work done by the members of the Canadian forces, 
including that done by the sailors of the HMCS <I>Halifax</I>, is 
done during their off duty time.  They do not have to do it. 
They choose to do it.  They choose to help out.  That is the 
measure of their compassion and dedication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's military personnel have faced difficult tests in the 
former Yugoslavia including bad weather, relentless sniper and 
artillery fire and have been taken hostage.  Thirteen have made 
the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives in the cause of 
peace.  They have persevered and in many cases have gone beyond 
the call of duty to perform acts of bravery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1992 Sergeant J.S. Forest of the Royal 22nd Regiment 
rescued two seriously wounded women while under heavy sniper 
fire.  As Captain Joseph Bélisle took aim at the snipers, 
Sergeant Forest crawled up beside the two victims and carried 
them to safety.  While still under heavy fire, the two soldiers 
helped the women into a military vehicle.  Both men were awarded 
the Medal of Bravery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Sergeant Thomas Hoppe.  Sergeant Hoppe received 
the Meritorious Service Cross for his command under fire of a key 
observation post located between Serb and Muslim forces in Bosnia 
in July 1994.

<A HREF="#LINKT137"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A month later Sergeant Hoppe performed another act of extreme 
bravery.  When he realized that snipers were firing on three 
young children playing in a cemetery in Sarajevo, Hoppe dashed 
out from behind cover to rescue the boys and hustle them into a 
waiting armoured personnel carrier.  For this action he received 
the Medal of Bravery.  Sergeant Hoppe is the only Canadian forces 
member since the second world war to have won both these medals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has earned a well-deserved reputation for being there 
when it counts.  If Canada is to continue to play an effective 
role on the world stage, it is critical that we maintain that 
reputation.  That means contributing to international efforts 
aimed at enhancing global security efforts like SFOR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces have done a lot of good in the former 
Yugoslavia since they first went there in 1991.  They have made a 
real difference.  In Bosnia and Hercegovina they continue to make 
a difference.  Although much has been accomplished, the situation 
is not yet stable.  Let us do the wise thing and keep the 
Canadian forces there as part of SFOR until it is stable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on this debate.  It 
hearkens back to what we were doing four years ago at the 
beginning of our first term in Parliament.  Many of us made our 
first speech in the House of Commons in an emergency debate 
concerning the crisis that was taking place in Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many people in the House spoke eloquently about the 
issue, we failed miserably.  Despots were prepared to rape, 
murder, pillage and use their power as leaders to pit brother 
against brother and cause the worst genocide that Europe and in 
fact the world had seen since World War II.  The bloodletting has 
not finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dayton peace accord ensured that the former Yugoslavia would 
fracture.  It ensured that Bosnia would exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through force we have managed to keep the Bosnian Serbs, the 
Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Muslims together.  It is only by 
force that we have managed to do this.  One thing we have to 
realize in this House is that Bosnia only stays together through 
the power of international intervention by force.  If that force 
is removed, Bosnia will descend into the same bloodshed which 
existed four years ago.  The killings will continue. At the 
highest levels of policy making in the world, leaders recognize 
that.  We have to recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support completely the use of our soldiers in Bosnia at this 
time. However unless we want another Cyprus in our midst, because 
that is what Bosnia is going to be, we have to recognize that the 
only long term future for Bosnia is for Bosnia to fracture 
peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dayton peace accord was the proverbial finger in the dyke. 
It served to prevent further conflict at that time and through 
force we have prevented that.  We have largely prevented further 
bloodshed.  In the future no conflict is going to be prevented in 
the long term unless Bosnia fractures into two or three separate 
groups and unless we are prepared to sit there for time 
immemorial. So much blood has been spilled under the bridge that 
people there will never forget that.  As a result if we leave, 
SFOR leaves and the killings will resume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see it happening now.  Again Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo 
has started a war against the ethnic Albanians. He started a war 
against the Serbian president in Bosnia.  He has also started to 
stir up problems and is in a cold war against the leader of 
Montenegro.  This is only an example of some of the future 
conflicts that are stirring in this pot we call the Balkans and 
which we have barely managed to keep a lid on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we are prepared to stay there forever, we have to enter 
into peaceful negotiations to ensure that Bosnia fractures 
through negotiations and not at the end of an AK-47.  There is 
much we can do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT139"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT139"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2225

<A HREF="#LINKT138"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we accept the fact that Bosnia has to fracture peacefully for 
long term peace, then I challenge the minister to work with his 
compatriots in the OSCE, in the UN and the members of the contact 
group to accept that realization.  Work toward a negotiated split 
of Bosnia and separate the ethnic groups peacefully forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to realize there are other issues taking place. 
Yugoslavia represents the most egregious example in Europe in 
recent memory.  Conflict such as that in Yugoslavia sits under 
our nose like a ticking time bomb for years before it blows up. 
The genocide that took place in the former Yugoslavia represents 
a very clear realization that we have learned nothing from the 
concentration camps of Dachau and Auschwitz.  We have proven once 
again that we are impotent in dealing with impending conflict 
when it is in our face. We have tools that can solve this 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has developed a great deal of 
capital over the last two years through his work in banning land 
mines, through his work on human rights in China and through 
other foreign policy initiatives he has produced.  With that 
capital he can work with other countries to deal with the larger 
problem of conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying in medicine that prevention is a worth a lot 
more than a cure.  Preventing conflict is a lot cheaper, a lot 
more effective and infinitely more humane than managing the 
conflict after it has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have presented a private member's motion in the House of 
Commons.  It calls on the Minister of Foreign Affairs to bring 
like-minded nations together, as we did on the land mines issue, 
in Ottawa or wherever to identify the precursors to conflict and 
to put in the tools to address them. If we can build this nucleus 
of like-minded nations, other nations will come on board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is in the best interest of any nation not to sit 
beside or have conflict within their sphere of influence.  Indeed 
a conflict that may occur halfway around the world will come to 
roost within our own borders either through the egress of 
refugees and demands on our own social policies or demands on our 
defence and aid budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to realize that if a conflict blows up, all 
the incredibly valuable work our Canadian soldiers are heroically 
doing will be washed away within a period of days, weeks or 
months when war breaks out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we revamp the International Monetary Fund, it can be used as 
a tool, not only as a carrot but also as a stick.  Wars need 
money.  If we choke off the supply of money then we choke off the 
ability of a despot to engage in war. Most of the countries today 
that are under the threat of war rely on money from the IMF.  The 
IMF can prevent despots from using that money. It can freeze 
their assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IMF can use its power as a carrot to supply money to 
moderate groups that are prepared to work together with disparate 
groups to build bridges of tolerance and understanding.  It would 
reward those who are engaged in peacemaking.  It would reward 
those individuals who would face despots and say “No, you are 
not going to turn my country into a hell-hole.  You are not going 
to turn this into another civil war.  You are not going to pit 
brother against brother.  You are not going to cause my people to 
be killed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in an unusual position as a nation.  Canada has an 
unusual role to play in the international community.  We have the 
ability to act as negotiator to bring countries together to work 
through multilateral measures to change the IMF and use it as a 
tool for peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations needs a renaissance.  It was effective when 
it was put together at the end of World War II but it does not 
have the ability to address the security threats that we as a 
country and the international community face in the future.

are very potent, cogent, economic, reasonable and pragmatic 
reasons for getting involved and changing these institutions. War 
hurts everybody.  It costs us.  It costs the countries involved. 
It costs everybody and everybody loses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to work with other members of the House so 
that we can use Canada's power as a force in changing these 
multilateral organizations into tools of peace to address 
security threats, be they military, environmental or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Burundi, Burma, 
India, Kenya and Indonesia represent security threats in the 
future.  We need to deal with them now for everybody's sake.  I 
challenge the Minister of Foreign Affairs to work with us in 
doing just that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to speak to this House in support of Canada's 
continued participation in the stabilization force, or SFOR, in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly delighted, because in my capacity as the chair 
of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs, in November 1997, I had the privilege of heading a 
delegation of eight members of the defence and foreign affairs 
committee on a visit to Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw with our own eyes the components of the peace process in 
Bosnia and Canada's contribution to its implementation. 
Our military participation in the stabilization force headed by 
NATO ensures peace is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reconstruction is taking place with the help of the Canadian 
International Development Agency, non-governmental organizations 
and the Canadian Forces.  Efforts at establishing democracy are 
being carried out in co-operation with the Organization on 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, the international police 
group and other organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on all we saw, we concluded that considerable progress had 
been made in Bosnia in nearly two years, that is, since the 
signing of the general peace accord known as the Dayton 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were very proud to see and learn that Canada had played a 
major role in military and civilian aspects of this peace 
agreement. 
Since considerable effort had been expended and progress made, 
all members of our delegation felt the need for a continued 
international presence in Bosnia after the expiry of SFOR's 
current mandate in June 1998. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a consensus in our group that Canada should remain 
among the forerunners in this international effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House what we saw and how this led us to our 
conclusion.  Our first stop was in Aviano, Italy.  This U.S. air 
force base was the location from which six Canadian CF-18 fighter 
aircraft flew over 250 operational missions, enforcing the no fly 
zone over Bosnia last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Aviano we proceeded to Bosnia where over the next three 
days we visited all four major Canadian military facilities.  We 
started at Black Bear Camp in Velika Kladusa where we received 
detailed briefings on military operations in the Canadian area of 
responsibility which is roughly the size of Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coupled with the difficulties presented by the very mountainous 
terrain in this area, the challenge of communication and travel 
for our Canadian troops is immense.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy to describe the pride we felt to see our Canadian 
soldiers successfully meeting these challenges.  We were struck 
by the high degree of professionalism and the great pride among 
the Canadian military personnel serving in the region. We were 
impressed as well by their understanding of the mission and 
their commitment to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were all convinced that, if more Canadians had had the 
opportunity to see what we saw over there, they too would feel 
great pride in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also struck by the danger they were facing in this 
mission. 
One of the first briefings we attending was a mine awareness 
session.  We saw mines that were virtually undetectable, buried 
in a small mine field used for training purposes.  We were shown 
the equipment the mine removal crew wore.  We were given 
explanations of how to avoid or to deactivate mines, and this 
gave us considerable food for thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not merely a matter of learning to detect or to 
deactivate mines, but also of learning to live with this 
insidious and ever-present threat. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told not to leave the paved area of a road when getting 
out of a vehicle.  We were told not to walk on the grass 
surrounding local villages.  We were told that farmers fields 
were sowed with mines and not crops.  We saw miles and miles of 
yellow tape stretched throughout the land marking potentially 
mined areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also told that there were probably one million mines 
left in Bosnia.  We were moved by the horrendous impact that 
mines can have on day to day living.  It is difficult for 
Canadians living in such a rich and free country as Canada to 
understand such a horrible situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this trip, we were convinced that Canada had to maintain 
its participation in SFOR in Bosnia. I was also very proud of 
Canada's efforts to rid the world of antipersonnel mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you what else we saw in Bosnia. In Drvar, we visited 
a school that Canadian field engineers helped rebuild under one 
of our restoration projects. We also took note of the enormous 
task of reconstruction that will have to be undertaken to repair 
that country's infractructure, to restore what the war detroyed: 
hospitals, electric substations, bridges and roads. It will take 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere we went, people told us how important these projects 
are. 
They also asked us to thank the Canadian people and to convey 
their gratitude for what Canadians have done to help rebuild 
their country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military aspects of Dayton have been a clear success.  The 
fighting has stopped as far as help to guarantee that municipal 
elections take place peacefully and as far as actively supporting 
the UN international police task force in the restructuring of 
the civil police are concerned.  SFOR continues to monitor weapon 
storage sites and SFOR is also engaged in many other projects to 
help recovery. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the democratization process in Bosnia has been more 
than slow. The main issues yet to be settled are the inability 
of hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and refugees to go 
home and the presence of individuals accused of war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw why it is so hard for people to go home. Despite minor 
reconstruction work in some areas, houses in ruins can be seen 
everywhere in the countryside. In village after village, we saw 
houses that were destroyed by bombings during the war and others 
that were destroyed to prevent their rightful occupants to come 
back to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I will be glad to give my unconditional 
support to the continuing presence of the Canadian armed forces 
in Bosnia.

go to bed I started thinking how unfair life was.  Here I am.  I 
had my reception.  I had my good dinner.  Life goes on, but for 
those people their lives do not go on.  They have suffered a 
tragedy and they got no help from parliament tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was about to turn off the TV but I changed a couple of 
channels and happened to fall on CPAC to see a bit of this 
debate.  I thought how ironic it was for us to debate such an 
issue tonight after the vote that took place.  I started thinking 
why we were talking about Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what we are really doing?  The decision is already made. 
It is not like the government is coming in here and saying this 
is what it is thinking of doing and asking whether it should. The 
government made that decision, so why are we here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to have the debate on Bosnia, this take note speech 
or whatever it is called, is a simple diversion because of 
Liberal embarrassment about the vote we had in this place 
tonight.  This is an opportunity for them to stand after having 
done that and say “Aren't we good?  Can't we be proud?  Can't we 
reflect the pride of our military, of our peacekeepers back on us 
by the great thing we have done of simply authorizing them to be 
there?”  The answer is no, they cannot do that.  I could not go 
to bed and allow them to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the justice minister talk in the House about why there 
was no compensation for people who contracted hepatitis C prior 
to 1986.  He said there was no way that government should be 
compensating people, that it had no obligation to pay for people 
who had a problem that was not the result of government 
negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bosnia is not the result of the government's negligence.  Hate 
is not the result of the government's negligence.  Cyprus was not 
the result of the government's negligence or any of the other 
places we went.  Desert storm 1 and the almost desert storm 2 
were not the result of government negligence, but when people 
were in need the Canadian government responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight people were in need and the Canadian government did not 
respond.  It responded to the flood in the Saguenay.  Was that 
the fault of the Canadian government?  It responded to the flood 
in Manitoba.  Was that the fault of the Canadian government?  How 
about the ice storm? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is despicable that the Liberals have the temerity to raise 
this subject in the House tonight as a deflection of the vote 
that took place.  It demeans the good name of our Canadian 
military.  It is absolutely disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a reserve unit in my riding, the 44 field squad, an 
engineer squadron. 
It has served in Bosnia.  It has helped when there have been 
natural disasters.  It has done an infinite number of good and 
meaningful deeds in my riding and around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter recently from someone in my riding who is a 
conscientious objector.  She objects to the military and to her 
tax dollars going to the military.  She wanted to know whether 
there was some way she could have her taxes go to some special 
fund instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote to her and suggested that I understood her position, her 
abhorrence of war, and would hope we would all abhor it but 
sometimes have to stand up for people who through no fault of 
their own were being victimized.  I suggested to her that our 
military had a strong tradition of things other than violence 
such as peacekeeping and helping when disasters hit the people of 
this country.  That is what we should be focusing on.  We should 
not be using that to deflect what happened in the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should truly help the military and do something good 
for it instead of pontificating about its role over there and how 
proud we are that we sent the military there.  Somehow it is 
suggested that it makes us greater than them because after all 
they are just the grunts who went there; we are the wonderful 
people who sent them.  Instead, maybe what we should be doing in 
the House is looking at their lack of equipment, at their lack of 
training and at the bases that have been shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the best bases in Canada have been closed.  An almost 
new base in Chilliwack was rebuilt, almost completely overhauled. 
It was closed and the people were transferred to a base in 
Alberta that does not have enough room for them and they have to 
start adding additional facilities there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government does to the military makes no sense.  Yet it 
somehow feels it is right that its members should come to the 
House and suggest that they are good because they have sent 
troops over to Bosnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if it does any good to speak tonight.  Maybe I 
would have done myself more good had I gone to bed and caught up 
on my sleep, but I just could not do that.  It seemed somehow 
important to me to get this off my chest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not expect any more of the justice minister.  I did not 
expect any more of the Prime Minister or of the government whip. 
However I expected more of some of those backbenchers.  I know 
they were opposed to the government's bill.  I know some of them 
are people of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often said to people in my town hall meetings that Ottawa 
is not what they think:  “As I stand tonight as a Reform member 
of parliament I will say something that will seem strange coming 
from me.  There are a lot of good Liberal MPs in Ottawa.  It is 
not the people.  It is the system”.  I am not going to say that 
again because it is not true.  Tonight, wipe that out.  Tonight, 
completely wipe that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw people on those backbenches who were opposed, who felt 
that the victims of hepatitis C, of tainted blood were entitled 
to compensation, and yet they knuckled under.  They ignored the 
victims.  They ignored their constituents.  They ignored their 
duty to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had the temerity to come here and suggest that they were 
good and wonderful because they sent our troops to Bosnia.  Is 
that timing not just a little curious?  It was right on the heels 
of the vote they knew was coming on which they were going to take 
a lot of heat.  What unbelievable timing.  What an uncanny 
coincidence that it should happen tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it.  I do not think the Canadian people believe 
it.  I hope it took a lot of soul searching by the Liberals in 
terms of this incident.  If they truly feel what they have spoken 
tonight about the military, I hope they will do something 
meaningful in terms of equipment, in terms of bases and in terms 
of training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to send them into harm's way, they should give them 
the proper tools to do it.  If they want to take pride in 
something, they should make sure that notwithstanding the vote 
tonight they do something for those victims, the people who 
relied on them and whom they let down.
