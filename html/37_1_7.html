</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the bill would ensure that everyone has a 
chance to repay a mortgage before the mortgage expires or before 
the maturity of that mortgage without an interest penalty, 
thereby putting into law what is only fair practice in financial 
institutions.

production protection for the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the bill would provide a guarantee that 
the farmers receive a price that reflects the cost of production 
for their products.  It is similar in many ways to what the 
European countries, or indeed the United States, have for many of 
their products.

(deductibility of expense of tools provided as a requirement of 
employment). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the bill would amend the Income Tax Act. 
It would provide for the very fair provision that mechanics 
should be able to deduct the cost of their tools when they have 
to purchase these tools for work purposes.  Again, it is a bill 
that is based on equity for all Canadians.

mergers). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is a very important issue.  The bill 
would amend the Bank Act with regard to mergers among our big 
banks. It would allow mergers to take place on two conditions. 
The first would be that if one bank were to become insolvent 
then, of course, a merger could take place.  The other condition 
would be that a merger applicant would be successful only if the 
application passes in the House of Commons by virtue of a 
resolution of the House of Commons, whereby we collectively make 
the decision, not the Minister of Finance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-227, an act to establish the office of 
Pension Ombudsman to investigate administrative difficulties 
encountered by persons in their dealings with government in 
respect of benefits under the Canada Pension Plan or the Old Age 
Security Act or tax liability on such benefits and to review the 
policies and practices applied in the administration and 
adjudication of such benefits and liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the bill has the purpose of creating the 
office of a pension ombudsman to deal with all the problems that 
people have with the Canada pension plan, the old age security 
act and pensions of that sort under federal jurisdiction.  The 
powers of the office of an ombudsman would be in terms of the 
traditional powers those offices hold.

Plan (early pension entitlement for police officers and

they are involved.

First Nations veterans on a comparable basis to that given to 
other war veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this bill would attempt to right an 
historical wrong in the country.  It would provide first nations 
veterans who fought in the first world war, the second world war 
and the Korean war, or their families, with four things:  first, 
an apology; second, adequate compensation; third, a scholarship 
in their honour; and, fourth, a war memorial that is dedicated to 
their fighting for the country over the course of three different 
wars.  I am sure all members of the House would support this 
bill.

object on conscientious grounds to paying taxes that might be 
used for military purposes to direct that an amount equivalent to 
a prescribed percentage of the income tax they pay in a year be 
diverted to a special account established by this enactment. This 
account would direct funds toward peaceful purposes such as peace

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill is to ensure that 
the courts grant custody of a child to both parents unless there 
exists evidence that to do so would not be in the best interests 
of the child.  Automatic joint custody could reduce the number of 
parents forced to go to court to gain access to their kids, 
increase the likelihood of support payment compliance and reduce 
the likelihood of one parent denying the right of the other to 
see the children.

amend the Criminal Code (conditional sentencing). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, conditional sentencing was introduced in 
the 35th parliament as Bill C-41.  Since that time, tens of 
thousands of conditional sentences have been handed down.  Most 
of these sentences are for petty crimes.  However, many have been 
handed down for crimes as serious as sexual assault, 
manslaughter, drunk driving and drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in a 
decision regarding conditional sentencing that “if parliament 
had intended to exclude certain offences from consideration, it 
should have done so in clear language”.

excluded from any possibility of receiving a conditional 
sentence.

however the Liberals do not believe in allowing Canadians to

in the House of Commons which would, if adopted, prevent serious

be a right of Canadians to know who is residing in and around 
their homes if one of these persons is a convicted killer or 
serious sex offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently incarcerated inmates are able to apply for and receive 
changes of names, changes of drivers' licences and other 
documents.  When on parole or released, they can slip into any 
neighbourhood while an innocent, unsuspecting public believes all 
is well.  I am personally aware of serious sex offenders who have 
changed their names and even admitted they were a danger to the 
public when they were released.

before I begin my remarks, I would like to note that I am 
splitting my time with the member from 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to mark the passing of a colleague of ours, a former 
member of the House, Mr. David Iftody, who died suddenly last 
night.  He will be missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is the first time I have had an opportunity to speak in 
the House since the election, I will begin by thanking my 
constituents who have demonstrated their faith in me for the 
third time.  I am honoured by their support and I pledge, as I 
have always done, my efforts to serve them to the best of my 
ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank my wife and family.  I am blessed with 
three wonderful children and a wife who takes on a lot of extra 
responsibilities so that I may be here.  She gives up a lot and I 
really appreciate her efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank my many friends and volunteers who worked 
so hard for my re-election and worked with me throughout the 
intervening years to serve the people of Winnipeg South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to thank my staff who I believe are among the 
best in Canada and who work very hard for very poor pay, very 
limited remuneration and do an excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to welcome the new members.  I also want to welcome you, 
Mr. Speaker, as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the 
Whole.  We have a new Clerk but I think we have the same table 
officers returning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank all of the people around the Hill who work 
unseen by us to make our lives so much easier, whether it is the 
drivers, the security guards who are always so friendly and 
helpful, the people who clean our offices, the <I>Hansard</I> 
staff and an enormous number of people who toil day in and day 
out so that we may do the work that we are here to do.  They do 
not often get the recognition they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have very limited time, I want to simply highlight a few 
things.  I was very disappointed in the way this campaign evolved 
in the last election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hold the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
responsible for starting it.  We all launched into what was a 
very bitter and personal campaign.  As a result, I think the 
Canadian people lost an opportunity through that process to hear 
us debate some of the things we debate all the time around here. 
They lost an opportunity to hear some discussion of ideas to 
improve the country.  We lost a lot in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a few things our party put forward that were 
exceptional.  As a person who represents a suburban riding in the 
south end of Winnipeg and a university, there were a couple of 
things that went entirely unnoticed in the Speech from the Throne 
that are enormously exciting and important for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made a commitment, and it was repeated by the Prime Minister, 
to make Canada among the top five countries in the world in 
investments in R and D by the year 2010.  That is a staggeringly 
important announcement, not just for the research community 
but for our entire quality of life.  The government made that 
commitment and I am enormously proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also made a commitment to bring broadband access to all homes 
by 2004.  I am sure a lot of people do not know what that means. 
It is an enormously important commitment, one that says we will 
all have high speed broadband, wideband access to our homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone talks about getting television on their computers. 
That is a very small part of what it means.  It means having the 
power to drive the kind of interfaces needed in order to have 
user friendly access so we can take advantage of the services 
which can be made available with the new information and 
technologies.  It means we can literally talk to our television 
sets and order whatever we want by voice.  It means my mother and 
grandmother can interact with the technology.  It is shatteringly 
important and I am surprised we made it.  It will take a lot of 
effort to get there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the University of Manitoba, one of the best 
universities in the world and certainly an important resource in 
my community.  There are commitments around research and 
development, broadband access and registered learning accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about this as being the knowledge economy and the need 
for lifelong learning.  The government has now put its resources 
behind that.  We are giving people an opportunity to retrain, 
build their skills and invest in their own futures.  It is an 
incredibly important initiative and one that I am sorry was not 
debated more wholesomely during the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus on one set of issues because I have such limited 
time.  Each time I run for election I come back here and set my 
own agenda in addition to the ones that I have committed to with 
my constituents during the campaign.  We have some local 
infrastructure, an underpass and urban transit that we are going 
to work on.  I see that reflected in the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My big passion is the whole business of what is euphemistically 
called e-government, the adaptation by government of the 
information and communications technologies that have become so 
pervasive in the private sector.  Either Gates or Michael Dell 
said that the Internet changes everything.  We are just beginning 
to realize how true that is and what a profound change is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back at what has happened in the private sector with 
large corporations and all the talk about downsizing, 
rightsizing, flattening, speeding up and the customer is king, 
all the stuff that has taken place in the last decade and a half, 
there have been enormous and profound changes in the way 
businesses do business.  The world has speeded up.  Bill Gates 
calls this decade the decade of velocity.  The skill necessary 
now is how to deal in a world that is moving faster and faster. 
Government will have to get there and learn how to live in that 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we want to or not, we are going to evolve from a 
structure of government that is hierarchical and based on 
traditional methods of accountability and department structure 
into a more network form of government.  We are interacting on a 
very immediate basis with the levels of government and citizens 
in ways that are just unprecedented.  We have to get our heads 
around that and start thinking about what this means for our 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we change the structure and operations of government we 
cannot help but affect the accountability mechanisms, the 
governance. 
We cannot change the way in which information flows in a 
government and not affect the way that decisions are made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a particular passion for parliamentary reform.  It 
is not the thing that drives me.  However I see some portions of 
parliamentary reform as being critically important to advance the 
rate at which we adapt new technologies and the way in which our 
government will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canada lead that change.  We go back and 
forth in that leadership position around the world, but other 
governments in the industrialized world such as Japan and 
Australia are making some important strides right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to sound a note of caution.  There is a commitment in the 
Speech from the Throne to bring forward a review and a redrafting 
of the existing privacy legislation.  This will be a critically 
important debate, one to which we need to pay a lot of attention 
and one that I am concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is a right.  It is not just a right in the charter but 
it is a right that the supreme court has read into the charter. 
It is a right that we all exercise.  I am a little tired of 
people talking about customers, that we will move to a customer 
style of government.  This is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been tried around the world.  It has failed all over the 
place because it fails to recognize the fact that I may be a 
customer of government in a few transactions but I am a citizen 
of Canada all the time and as a citizen I have rights.  The 
government is accountable to me as a citizen.  One of the ways I 
exercise that right is in the way it respects me and the way it 
treats the information that it has about me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time there are huge values to be gained as a citizen 
by allowing the government to accumulate information to better 
serve me and to better understand how government functions and 
how society functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of that is privacy legislation.  Currently it 
is being worked on by a committee of bureaucrats.  I am sure they 
are bright and beautiful people.  However this is a bill that 
must be crafted on the floor of the Chamber by all of us.  This 
is a bill that concerns the rights of all of us.  It is something 
that we must be very involved in.  We cannot let it go through 
the House simply because it has received the stamp of approval of 
the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wish all members well.  I think it will be an 
extremely interesting few years in which we can make some major 
improvements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's 
speech very carefully.  I certainly agreed with him when he 
talked about how unfortunate it was that the election campaign 
was very vicious and dirty.  Probably members from all parties 
would agree with that.  I noted that he singled out one or two 
people as deserving some criticism in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member with all due respect that his leader, 
the Prime Minister of Canada, who at the start of the election 
campaign referred to my party, the Canadian Alliance, as the 
forces of darkness.  That kicked off the campaign and started us 
down the road of everybody tearing at each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians were absolutely embarrassed for the Prime Minister 
in the dying days of the campaign when he was in Atlantic Canada. 
He referred to the fact that he liked to do politics in the east 
because he did not understand westerners.  I think he said 
they were different. Then he said that he was kidding and then 
that he was actually serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the hon. member make a note of that fact?   Has he had a 
chance to talk to his leader to find out whether the Prime 
Minister was kidding or was he serious in the way he feels about 
westerners? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will resist the urge to 
play with this response.  I have never been embarrassed by the 
Prime Minister, and I am a westerner. 
The things that I talked about in my speech, which I think are so 
important to the future of this country, are there because of the 
Prime Minister's willingness to listen and work on these issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did single out one party.  It is possible for us to constantly 
spend our time in this Chamber looking at that little phrase that 
each one of us will misspeak at some time or another and pounce 
on it saying that this is what we mean.  The reason I singled out 
the leader of the Conservative Party was that was the first set 
of deliberate insults and deliberate fabrications that were put 
on public record in the first set of ads.  I think that is 
different from debate where we get into pulling out those little 
twists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently wrote a paper on communication.  It is very difficult 
for us, as politicians, to communicate because we are so used to 
listening to a person on the other side just long enough to find 
that phrase that we can flip back at them in order to discredit 
what they are saying.  We do not listen to what they are talking 
about and that soon becomes the way we function.  We never really 
hear what we are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dismiss that part of the debate.  However, I do think there 
were some deliberate acts that did not serve all of us very well. 
There has been a concern about the drop in voter turnout, but I 
think that has less to do with disinterest on the part of 
Canadians and more to do with disgust in this last process.

We do have at our disposal an extraordinary new tool in the new 
technologies and the Internet, but this is a tool that can have 
both positive and negative effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see what I would term the pre-generation of what the federal

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member was on a fact-finding tour across Canada 
on this and there will be a Canada-wide conference.  I would like 
to know from the hon. member if our duty as parliamentarians is 
to act as true watchdogs in order to ensure that these tools do 
not merely become tools of the high bureaucracy in order to 
control the system, and to ensure that democracy gains from 
them, rather than losing?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
interest and his assistance to us in meetings with the Quebec

</I></B></P><P align=left>Value will come from the ability to accumulate data.  What HRD 
did is something that we would like to see happen again.  We want 
to put proper safeguards and controls in place so that people 
understand what is happening and have the right to interact. 
However the member is absolutely right to identify it as an 
important issue.  It is critical that all members of the House 
get involved in this debate in the next couple of years.  If they 
want to learn about it, they can attend a conference at the end

</I></B></P><P align=left>I dedicated this election to my wife, Diane St-Julien, who has 
been following me and helping me through the last three mandates 
and who will continue to do so in this one. I also thank my 
daughter, Sonya-Kim St-Julien, who, for the last four elections, 
has been giving me advice on communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the voters of the large riding of 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik for giving me a fourth majority, in all 
of the riding's 68 polls. My hometown is the municipality of 
Val-d'Or, but I also represent a community located in Nunavik, 
2,000 kilometres north of it, called Salluit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Inuit from Nunavik, the Cree from James Bay, the 
Algonquin, the Algonquin communities and the other residents of 
my riding for this great victory, and particularly thanks to our 
leader, the Prime Minister of Canada and Liberal member for 
Saint-Maurice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, we were told that a better future awaits 
us. We must put forward a project that will not leave anyone 
behind. Above all, we must set priorities and draft a specific 
plan. This is what was done in the red book during the last 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that, during an election campaign, we must face a 
number of political parties. A 30 day election campaign is fair 
ball. There are pros and cons. Some people have claimed that my 
election on June 2, 1997, was a historical aberration. This is 
not so: it was my mother's birthday on that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who claimed that there was a historical aberration 
the day of my election has seen that we have fixed that 
aberration, as I was re-elected on November 27.  All of that to 
say that the member who made the statement in my riding was 
wrong again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, what are we concerned about today?  The specific 
plan of the Liberal government, with our Prime Minister at its 
head and the new options available to us, be they innovation, 
learning skills, connecting Canadians or trade and investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is providing prospects for children, 
families, health and quality care, a healthy environment, strong 
and safe communities, a dynamic Canadian culture and most 
importantly new windows of opportunity for us internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a large riding such as Abitibi, we are concerned with the 
price of metals in the mining sector.  We have gold, copper, 
palladium and vanadium. There has been a price war for the past 
three years.  The price of gold was always pegged at under $300 
and rose above it only once.  Cambior, a company recognized 
worldwide, got it because gold was sold on option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech calls for building our health care system. 
Last September, in an effort to modernize our system, the 
Liberal government gave the provinces an extra $21.2 billion 
over five years.  At issue is better meeting the needs of 
Canadians.  This is a priority, which received much attention 
during the election, and today we hear mention of it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important?  Not treating people in hospital as clients. 
Those sick in hospital must be treated as human beings. 
Together with the provinces, we must find solutions.  That is 
what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we must give thought to creating a registered 
individual learning account for employees, help Canadians 
establish a training plan and find the necessary funding.  For 
those aged 45 to 50 who have lost their job, new ways must be 
found to enable them to return to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important in recent years is that our government, with 
its expertise, has run this country with all members of the 
House and has paid down the debt, given fair tax breaks, and 
invested in health, in research and innovation, in families and 
children and in the protection of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the topic of research and innovation, we know that in a 
remote area such as Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, considerable money 
is needed to help universities and cegeps.  The rector of the 
Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue, in Rouyn-Noranda, 
has submitted projects involving primarily forestry in the Amos 
region. 
For Val-d'Or, the focus was on underground communications and 
multimedia, and for Rouyn-Noranda, on various other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is that we need this money to boost 
research, particularly in a riding where natural resources are 
so important, whether in mining or forestry.  We have trouble 
getting secondary and tertiary manufacturing going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, in the coming months and years we will 
improve prospects for people in our region.  The government will 
work closely with the private sector to offer broadband high 
speed access to citizens, businesses, educational institutions 
and all communities, particularly in a region such as ours, 
which takes in northern Quebec, Nunavik and James Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plans to introduce communications.  Recently, we 
have seen Bell Canada double its telecommunication rates in 
Nunavik.  Why?  The company told the Inuit and those working in 
this sector that, now that too many people were using the 
Internet, it would double their rates in order to lower rates 
for Internet users.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a good one on Bell Canada.  It is doing a great deal of 
harm in Nunavik, and the people do not find it amusing, since 
they are the ones having to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important for new approaches to be found.  I strongly 
believe that the government, via the minister responsible for 
the economic development of Quebec or via Industry Canada, is 
going to put new methods into place to help northern Quebec, 
James Bay and Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important in our area is health, quality health care in 
particular.  We know that we need to work hard in conjunction 
with the governments, the government of Quebec in particular, to 
find physicians.  We also need to improve the situation of 
hospitals and to add to the numbers of nurses in a region as 
large as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must speak of Nunavik, because it must be kept in mind that 
the Inuit pay taxes just like southerners do.  Recently I 
spoke with the President of Makivik corporation, Mr. Pita 
Aatami.  He said that new ways must be found to help the 
hospitals administered by Kativik corporation, by the Nunavik health board, 
and improvements must be made in order to attract nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is to work very hard in this House in order to 
be accountable to the taxpayers, to the people in that great 
riding, to Quebec and to Canada. 
We must plan in order to reduce taxes, move toward a new economy 
and strengthen our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is interested in the country's current equalization 
formula because he is from Quebec and Quebec is a recipient of 
equalization payments.  The current equalization formula keeps a 
province from drowning but falls far short in that it never gives 
a province the wherewithal to swim on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from Quebec, a province that receives equalization 
payments, how would he feel about a change in the current 
equalization formula to recognize that some provinces need a leg 
up to develop their natural resources? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent question. In 
Quebec, we have equalization payments and tax points. Also, we 
must file two tax returns, a provincial one and a federal one. 
Transfers will always be an issue. Let us not forget that under 
the equalization program there are rich provinces and poor 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of years, even Quebec had a deficit in the 
employment insurance sector of some three of four billion 
dollars. Who helped us? It was the other provinces. There is 
always room for improvement of the equalization program, but 
always in co-operation with the current government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Quebec Liberal Party, through the Hon. Jean 
Charest, made proposals regarding equalization and the handing 
over of tax points to the province. We are waiting to see what 
will come out of these proposals. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the hon. member if he is aware of the impact on his 
riding of the changes to the employment insurance program. I am 
convinced that he is pleased to see that the government has 
already introduced the new employment insurance bill. I would 
like to know the impact of these changes on his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member. 
Employment insurance is indeed an important issue in my region. 
Seasonal workers in a large ridings such as ours are like those 
from the Atlantic region, whether they work in mining or several 
other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 has been introduced. There is always room for 
improvement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the standards come from a committee of the 
commission, which comprises management and unionized employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important?  Finding the right solutions.  Requests come 
into my office either from Laurier Gilbert, from Val d'Or, or 
the Regroupement des chômeurs et chômeuses, wanting to appear 
before the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to look at both sides of the coin. 
A few years ago there were people using unemployment insurance 
in the last four months of the year, because during the year 
they had earned their full salary on Saturdays and Sundays 
earning double time and double time and a half.  When they saw 
they were going to pay too much income tax, they went on 
unemployment.  It was very easy to do so back then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are employers back home who say to me “With the new 
reform, we get more”.  Back home, Bélanger Électrique said “I am 
happy with this, because the electricians come to us.  Before we 
never saw them in construction”.  The same is true for PLC in 
Senneterre, which does not have mechanics any more.  The mechanics 
went off for three months.  We knew it, it was not a secret, 
some of them went off hunting and fishing and so on over the 
holidays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has to be improved and together, before the standing 
committee, we will find solutions.  Together with the 
government in office is the way to improve things for people. 
In any case, what counts is keeping permanent jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the House will join with me in offering 
congratulations to you on your position.  We all know that the 
House is in very good hands. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to offer my sincere thanks to 
the people of the riding of Medicine Hat who once again elected 
me to be their representative in Ottawa.  It is really a great 
honour.  I also want to say a special thanks to my family: to my 
wife Deb and my boys, Matthew and Michael, without whose 
indulgence it would be impossible to do this job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the foreign affairs critic for the Canadian Alliance.  My 
job is to scrutinize the government's foreign policy and to offer 
suggestions on how it might be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have just 10 minutes to speak, so an entire survey of 
the government's foreign policy is not possible.  I will focus 
therefore on what I believe to be the most important aspect of 
our foreign policy, the complex relationship between Canada and 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically I wish to offer ways to strengthen that 
relationship.  First must come a change in attitude.  We need to 
remind ourselves that every single Canadian benefits from our 
relationship with the United States, and not just a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 40% of Canada's annual wealth is generated by trade, and 
80% of that trade is with the United States, a $10 trillion 
economy.  In other words, trade with the U.S. accounts for about 
a third of all the wealth generated in our country every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could imagine the unemployment and cuts to government 
services if that wonderful relationship suddenly ended.  A strong 
relationship with the United States is very much in Canada's 
economic interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are anxious knowing that President Bush will make 
his first foreign trip to Mexico instead of to Canada. They are 
worried that Mexico will soon eclipse Canada as America's biggest 
trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not troubled per se by Mexico building a stronger 
relationship with the United States.  More U.S. trade with Mexico 
does not necessarily mean less U.S. trade with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between Mexico and the United States is 
probably underdeveloped and, in my opinion, very much to the 
detriment of the Mexican people.  I hope both sides of that 
relationship prosper because the wealthier they become the 
greater the opportunities for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What troubles me even more is the cavalier and even hostile 
attitude some of the Liberals betray toward the long, deep 
friendship between Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More trade between the United States and Mexico is not a threat 
to Canada's interests.  Undermining, snubbing or picking fights 
with the U.S. is a threat to our interests.  Nothing can be 
gained but much can be lost when prominent members of the 
government go out of their way to tweak the noses of the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples abound.  Consider Raymond Chrétien, former Canadian 
ambassador to the U.S., and his embarrassing statements last 
spring.  The ambassador said publicly that the Liberal government 
favoured candidate Gore over candidate Bush in the U.S. 
presidential election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the outcry if that had happened the other way around, if 
an American official had consciously interfered in a Canadian 
election.  Thank goodness the Americans mostly ignored the 
government's disregard of the tradition of non-interference in 
domestic politics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second example occurred in 1999.  A suspected Algerian 
terrorist making his way from Canada into the United States was 
picked up with bomb making equipment in the trunk of his car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS, our intelligence agency, reports that it is monitoring 50 
terrorist organizations that currently operate in Canada.  The 
Liberal government still largely ignores these U.S. concerns, to 
the point where Liberal cabinet ministers, such as the finance 
minister, have defended attending a fundraising dinner in Toronto 
for a group that CSIS and the U.S. state department have 
identified as a front for a terrorist organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third example occurred just recently.  Our current foreign 
affairs minister, regarding the U.S. proposal for a missile 
shield, made the amazing announcement that if President Bush 
satisfies the concerns of the Russians and the Chinese then 
Canada will be satisfied as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did we decide that Canada's foreign policy would be driven 
by the wants of the Russians and the Chinese?  I think that is 
absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister needs to be reminded that we are an ally of 
the United States, not Russia and China.  Perhaps he should 
recall that Canada and the U.S. are committed to mutual defence 
through NATO and NORAD.  Perhaps he needs to recall that the 
likely scenario would be a missile coming from across the Pacific 
toward North America with the idea being that the U.S. missile 
shield would be in place to shoot it down before it reached North 
America, something that is definitely in the interest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be sure, questions remain about the effectiveness of that 
shield, but it is irresponsible for the minister to dismiss it 
out of hand while casting his lot with the Russians and Chinese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reviewing the recent record, President Bush might be forgiven 
for wondering whether Canada is still the trusted ally that it 
once was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do more than quit annoying the Americans and undermining 
our relationship.  We must put greater effort and resources into 
building and improving that relationship.  Why should we do that? 
We should do it because it is in the interests of Canada.  Even a 
small percentage of increases in exports to the United States 
would result in thousands of new Canadian jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Prime Minister and the Department of Foreign 
Affairs would much rather talk about their elaborate efforts to 
promote trade with China and Cuba.  This is a little more than 
ironic because Canada's exports to China have gone down by about 
$800 million since the first trade Canada mission a few years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, our yearly trade with Cuba is $500 million dollars. 
We do more trade with the United States in half a day than we do 
with Cuba in the entire year.  The United States, moreover, is 
not a notorious human rights abuser like both China and Cuba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do much better.  First, we should start by forging 
much stronger relationships with the Bush administration, 
congress and senators.  We also need a new initiative to get to 
know governors and legislators because they are often the first 
to raise issues which can sometimes become full blown trade 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need to rebuild our military to more properly fulfil 
our NATO and NORAD commitments.  A strong and independent foreign 
policy requires a strong military behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need to crack down on terrorist organizations 
operating within Canada, not just for our own safety, which is 
reason enough, but also so the Americans will ease up on the 
restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border that impede trade and 
hurts the prosperity of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to show respect for American concerns if we want them to 
respect ours.  Nobody doubts that Canada should practice an 
independent foreign policy but not one driven by knee-jerk 
anti-Americanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guiding principle of foreign policy should be the 
deliberate, methodical pursuit of outcomes that are directly 
beneficial to Canada.  In other words, sometimes we will agree 
with the Americans because it is in our economic or security 
interests to do so.  Other times we will disagree, as we have on 
softwood lumber or Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic, again 
because it is in our interest to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an approach that we have used in the past to build our 
reputations as respected, fair and independent players on the 
world stage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge the government to pay closer attention to 
the critically important relationship with America.  In war and 
in peace we have worked together to our mutual benefit.  A new 
administration in Washington means a new chance to build on that 
relationship, but it requires a new Canadian attitude free of the 
defensiveness that the current Liberal government has so 
frequently displayed.  What we need is a tough minded, determined 
and respectful approach driven by the interests of the Canadian 
people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the remarks of the 
member for Medicine Hat with interest.  I have two questions for 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said that the Alliance Party has a different view from 
that of the government about the softwood lumber dispute.  I am 
wondering what its position might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago the forest industry pleaded and begged the 
government for the quota system to manage trade so that they 
could get five years of trade peace. In hindsight perhaps it has 
not worked, but it was on the basis of the industry's 
recommendation that the government proceeded to manage trade. Now 
there is talk about free trade in lumber.  What is the Alliance's 
position on softwood lumber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member referred to the social dinner with the Tamil 
community in Toronto, a cultural dinner.  I think it was $25 a 
head, hardly a big fundraiser.  I was there with two ministers. 
He talks about the Tamil community and sponsoring tourist 
activities in Sri Lanka.  What about other communities that are 
illegally sending money back to their home countries to help 
causes?  Why is he singling out the Tamil community?  Has he some 
information that the government does not have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me answer those 
questions in reverse order.  I simply point to the CSIS website, 
Canada's own intelligence agency, which raises the red flag about 
the particular group that sponsored the dinner the finance 
minister and the member attended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not information that we exclusively have.  If he would 
consult his own government then he would find out that there are 
concerns about this group.  It is not the Tamil community in 
general; it is this group.  I want to make that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is correct for the member across the way to 
misrepresent our position.  He has asked for our position on the 
issue of softwood lumber.  Our position is that we would like to 
have free trade with the United States in softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is what is the government's position.  We have 
the industry minister saying “I think the renewal of the 
existing agreement is something that will be part of the mix when 
we sit down at the table”.  He says that we should renew the 
softwood lumber deal, even though the industry does not want it. 
The industry is opposed to it but the industry minister wants to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the international trade minister says something 
different again.  Perhaps the member's question should go to his 
own ministers.  Then he could find out the government's position 
from them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat that we need a stronger military in terms of Sea 
King replacements, money and compensation benefits for the 
valiant men and women in our armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feeling that I am getting on this side of the fence is that 
a while ago they argued to put Canadian flags on their desks and 
now it sounds as if they want to put U.S. flags on their desks. 
It is obvious by his comments that Alliance members will support 
the nuclear missile defence shield which leads us all down the 
path to nuclear madness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also quite obvious by his comments that the Americans plan 
to open up the Alaskan oil reserves in Alaska and on the east 
coast.  President Bush also indicated a year ago that he would 
lift the moratorium on the Georges Bank on which Canada has 
placed a 12 year moratorium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member support the lifting of the Alaskan oil reserve, 
which has a great effect on our aboriginal people, on the 
porcupine caribou herd and on our fishing communities, if the 
moratorium is lifted off the Georges Bank? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the position of the 
Canadian Alliance with respect to all these issues is that we 
will do what is in Canada's interest.  Because I have not 
attacked the United States, my friend has suggested that means we 
would put American flags on our desks.  It is quite the contrary. 
We want to do what is in the best interest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes that means agreeing with the Americans. 
Sometimes it means taking the opposite position, such as we are 
doing on softwood lumber.  I think that is entirely appropriate.

what he has to say.  He referred to the campaign as being more 
than just a bit dirty, but the dirt and the innuendoes actually 
helped me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I started my campaign my crew knew that I had about 41% of 
the vote.  Then the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration made 
a speech which reached my constituency.  It was in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> and stated that I above everyone was 
anti-immigration.  Those words riled my constituents and I jumped 
about 5% in the polls because they knew it was absolutely untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then one night on television a former premier of the province of 
Ontario said that the Alliance in the west could put up a donkey 
and get it elected.  I know he was talking about me and I will 
say why: I am the one with the biggest ears over here. 
Immediately I went up another 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had an incident in which a reporter said, and he wishes 
he had not said it, that the Ontario vote was a sophisticated 
vote.  It is, as are the votes in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
British Columbia, but the tone in which he said that put me up 
10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this time my crew estimated that I had 61% of the vote.  The 
surge in popularity came more from comments that were meant to 
degrade me and my efforts in my constituency.  Finally, and this 
is a little humorous, one of the other candidates accused me of 
stealing his platform and that put me over the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense I say to people who tried to use a smear campaign 
that it blocked hundreds of Canadians from going to the polls in 
the last election.  If it continues we will have fewer Canadians 
exercising their right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Medicine Hat referred to security.  I wish to 
talk briefly about security at home.  He referred to security on 
the international level.  I know what it is like to look into the 
eyes of a child who lives with insecurity.  I know what it is 
like to look at elderly people who live with insecurity.  I 
certainly know from the past four years what insecurity means to 
my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be the Department of Veterans Affairs critic. 
I say to the government and to this side of the House as well 
that if those in veterans affairs knew that the veterans affairs 
committee was not an independent committee, I think they would 
feel insulted.  They would say they have enough on their plates, 
enough matters to be discussed, that they should be a separate 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask a question this morning in the House. The very people 
providing the security and the freedom we enjoy are now some of 
the most forgotten people in Canada, and that ought not to be. 
Many veterans out there have not received medals for the various 
campaigns they have been in.  They have been asking for them for 
years.  Widows of veterans have been cut off from some of the vet 
programs.  That ought not to be.  Where is their security?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it all off, a young fellow in the army reserve came to 
me.  He volunteered to go overseas to Bosnia and was ordered to 
get his passport.  When the passport came, unbelievably he had to 
pay for it.  A man who is volunteering his time to serve with the 
Canadian forces had to pay for his passport.  I hope he receives 
remuneration, but the last I heard he had not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask one more question.  I believe that a promise made is 
a debt unpaid.  It is clearly recorded that the government still 
owes merchant navy vets some $70 million.  I believe that should 
be paid and it should be paid now.  There was no mention of it in 
the throne speech, but I believe it should be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another forgotten group is grassroots aboriginals.  For years 
they have been crying out for help, telling us of the fraud, the 
theft, the corruption and the mismanagement.  These accusations 
reach my office and I am sure they reach the offices of members 
opposite.  These accusations come from rank and file aboriginals. 
They are not invented on this side of the House.  They have been 
crying out for years.  I can understand their feeling of 
insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech indicated that billions will be allotted to 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  I ask 
the government, and particularly cabinet, to listen to the rank 
and file.  Aboriginals should be included so that they have a 
degree of security on their own land.  They do not now.  People 
in Regina are on a hunger strike in the hope that the government 
will say that enough is enough and bring about security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security means fundamental changes.  We must respond to the 
auditor general.  We talk about the inherent right of 
self-government, treaty entitlements and land claims which will 
bring security to all.  However all of the claims mean absolutely 
nothing unless we change our approach to accountability for the 
common people, the grassroots people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend my last two minutes talking about the terrible 
insecurity that exists within my constituency and across the 
farms of western Canada.  Towns and villages are disappearing. On 
the main street of my town four businesses have closed.  They 
will never reopen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are watching a whole generation, fourth and fifth generation 
Canadians, completely deserting our province because the 
government bungles more money than ever got into the hands of the 
farmers of western Canada.  It has thrown away more money than 
will ever go to make agriculture a sustainable industry in 
western Canada.  We need to provide them with some measure of 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, since 1993 the government has deliberately used 
alienation to divide Canada and to give it the largest block of 
voting.  It believes in going ahead and alienating and it can 
always be government.  That is a national philosophy of which it 
should be ashamed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating you on your appointment and by thanking all the 
people of the big, beautiful riding of 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet for returning me to the 
House.  I also wish to thank the Prime Minister for his vote of 
confidence by appointing me to the position of Secretary of 
State for Science, Research and Development.  This morning I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Guelph—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members will no doubt realize, my remarks on the Speech 
from the Throne will provide an explanation and support of the 
Canadian government's programs to advance science and research 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the Canadian government has made huge efforts 
to develop this sector of activity and to make it possible to 
enhance the quality of life and standard of living of all of our 
citizens.  Research councils, which we call funding bodies, have 
been put in place, such as the Natural Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council of Canada, created in 1978 out of the National 
Research Council, and the Social Sciences and Humanities 
Research Council, which has its roots in the Canada Council. 
More recently, we established the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation in 1998, Genome Canada in 1999 and the university 
chairs in 2000.  In the year 2000, we also gave strong support 
to environmental research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's intention in focusing so much effort on R and D is 
aimed at national and international objectives, along with what 
I would term security and ethical ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foremost among the mandates is to keep our research scientists 
in Canada and not to see them leaving for other countries.  As 
well, we want to attract foreign researchers of international 
repute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has set itself the policy goal of moving from 15th 
ranking internationally in R and D to 5th within 10 years.  That is 
why there is a clear indication in the Speech from the Throne 
and in the Prime Minister's speech that the emphasis will be on 
innovation, research and development, and we shall be doubling 
the budgets devoted to this over the next ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our universities need substantial support. 
The Canadian Foundation for Innovation has made new funding 
available and this has led to agreements with the provinces and 
private sector for additional and increasingly innovative 
research in our universities.  However more work remains to be done, 
particularly with respect to support for indirect costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also tell the House that Quebec's universities are going 
to need some very tangible support, particularly with the 
about face by Quebec's Minister of Education this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to research being carried out in our hospitals with 
funding from both by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and 
our granting councils, many of our hospitals have actually 
acquired international reputations in research. 
Some of this research has resulted in the development of drugs 
now recognized throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various approaches to research in Canada.  The 
government has its own in-house research centres, such as those 
in the Departments of Agriculture, Natural Resources, the 
Environment, and Fisheries and Oceans.  All these research 
centres are now in the process of restructuring so as to meet 
the needs of industry in the various sectors concerned.  The 
primary purpose of this research, as I mentioned, is to give 
citizens access to quality products, new drugs and new 
technologies, whether in transportation, environmental 
monitoring, agriculture or food.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This research is vital to our economic and social development. 
It is also designed to maintain Canada's credibility in the 
international scientific community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working closely with a number of countries.  In his 
economic statement last October, the Minister of Finance 
announced an additional $100 million for the Canadian Foundation 
for Innovation for collaborative international research projects . 
The Canada Foundation for Innovation, which was given that 
mandate, wants to establish three or four major research centres 
in our country, where researchers from abroad can work in 
co-operation with our own scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation also wants to set up a program to allow Canadian 
researchers to work abroad with researchers from other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing regarding our investments is that they are 
profitable in the sense that we have partners who come to work 
with us. Genome Canada, among others, was set up barely a year 
ago with a budget of $160 million and has already collected $240 
million from the provinces, not counting the money that will 
come from the private sector for genetic research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives, which we want to further develop and even 
double in the coming years, are not only useful but 
indispensable to our country's development and, as I said 
earlier, to improving the quality of life of our fellow 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various types of research are conducted in co-operation. For 
instance, for the space agency, France, Canada and the United 
States are co-operating regarding telescopes set up in Hawaii. 
This is currently giving an incredible boost to astronomical 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the money aspect, the Canadian government will also have 
to concentrate on issues of safety and ethics. 
As people know, a lot of discussions are going on, primarily on 
biotechnological research.  There is the whole issue of research 
on human embryos, on human cloning, organ culture and genetic 
properties.  All of this must be debated and mechanisms must be 
put in place to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am currently working on creating what I call—but 
which will probably not be its final name—a national academy of 
sciences.  Canada is the only country of the G8 without such a 
body, which would be independent and could provide expert 
opinions, which would be available to the population at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are currently working to set up federal-provincial discussions 
on science, research and development. 
In the coming month, the first federal-provincial science 
ministers meeting will very likely be held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, Canada's scientific influence abroad is growing 
with our researchers.  Discussions with the Minister for 
International Trade are increasing.  I myself, as the Secretary 
of State for Science, Research and Development, have already had 
three meetings with the Carnegie group, which brings together 
the ministers of science of all the G-8 countries.  The next 
meeting of this type will be held in Quebec, most likely 
in Montmagny itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts that went into the throne speech for science, 
research and development are not only justified but 
indispensable.  I want to congratulate my colleagues on their 
support and I thank them for seeing the importance of developing 
this sector of activity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
During my speech I inadvertently used the wrong figure when I was 
pleading for the government to return the money owing to the 
merchant marines.  I should have said $10 million.  I think I 
said $70 million.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
Her Excellency the Governor General of Canada in reply to her 
speech at the opening of the session, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the House today, 
following the speech by the member for 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet.  I have two questions for 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concerns research and development.  I agree that some 
of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation projects have produced 
some interesting results.  For example, I know that the Centre 
spécialisé de technologie physique du Québec, in La Pocatière, 
received funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to tell me whether his vision 
encompasses a sufficient share of R and D investment both for 
Quebec and for areas outside the major centres, be they in 
Quebec or elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the trend in this field is to create centres in 
order to create synergy, but often there is a natural attraction 
toward the major centres.  There has been a tradition of 
research in certain areas for years.  For instance, the centre 
in La Pocatière benefited from the support of an experimental 
farm for some years.  Unfortunately, it was closed in 1994 as a 
result of cuts.  Since then, however, new areas of activity have 
been developed in fields related to technology, mass transit and 
all manner of other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think Quebec is getting its fair share? 
What about the regions?  When I see the number of federal 
research centres that are located in the Ottawa region compared 
to Quebec, I feel there is a very considerable disproportion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question deals with an issue which must be of concern 
to the hon. member.  During the election campaign, it was said 
that there would be other changes to employment insurance in 
addition to those contained in the former Bill C-44.  Now Bill 
C-2 has just been introduced and it is Bill C-44 all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign, the Prime Minister stated that certain 
problems, certain major shortcomings in the plan needed to be 
corrected.  The Secretary of State for Amateur Sport and the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, who is also 
the minister responsible for Quebec, suggested that other 
improvements needed to be made.  I know as well that the hon. 
member for Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet, with whom I 
participated in a debate on this issue during the campaign, has 
indicated a desire for such openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he explain to us why the government has not immediately 
brought in other modifications?  Does he believe it is possible 
for additional improvements to indeed be added through the work 
of the committee, and for the terrible clause trying to legalize 
the misappropriation of the employment insurance fund surplus to 
be eliminated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Gilbert Normand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. 
member for his very pertinent questions. 
As for his first question concerning the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation, this is a first because the foundation is investing 
not only in universities, but also in colleges. In fact, the 
Collège La Pocatière, located in the hon. member's riding, 
benefited from such subsidies, as did Cégep Lévis—Lauzon and 
several other cégeps in various regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also point out that one of our priorities is to 
demonstrate that research can be conducted in rural areas when 
the so-called critical mass is not indispensable to such 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give the hon. member several examples of what has been 
done in recent months. 
There has been, among other initiatives, the marine science park 
in Rimouski, the de-icing operations in Chicoutimi, some 
composite materials in Sherbrooke and, just recently, the 
establishment of the aluminum research centre in the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This area is indeed a government priority. I could add that in 
Rouyn—Noranda there is a research program on pain and various 
other initiatives. So, this is indeed a government priority. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, Quebec is getting its fair share and even more 
than its fair share. In recent years it has received over 30% 
of all the subsidies given across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must not only look at the research centres located in Ottawa 
to determine what is being done across the country, and 
particularly in Quebec, regarding research and sport subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the granting councils and the foundation select projects, 
that process is conducted by experts and is not dependent on any 
geographical consideration. It is innovation that counts. Quebec 
is very innovative, and it gets its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for employment insurance, the bill was tabled in its original 
form, as we said it would. It was referred to a parliamentary 
committee. It would have been ill-advised on the government's 
part not to leave it to members of parliament to propose 
amendments, and I am convinced that the hon. member opposite 
will propose amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you.  You look 
great in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to take part in the debate on the 
Speech from the Throne.  I thank the people of Guelph—Wellington 
for re-electing me for a third term as their member of 
parliament.  It is an honour and a privilege to stand here as 
their representative.  I promise to do all that I can to ensure 
that their voices are heard in the Chamber and across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne sets the course for the future.  It 
outlines the government's vision for Canada.  It explains how we 
will create opportunity for all Canadians in the 21st century. By 
working together to implement this moderate and balanced plan, 
all Canadians, men, women and children, will have the opportunity 
to be the best that they can be in the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally I am proud of our achievements as a government over 
the past seven or eight years, and this plan builds on those 
accomplishments.  We will continue to table balanced budgets, to 
pay down the debt, to cut taxes fairly, to invest in health care 
and social programs, to encourage research and innovation, to 
protect our environment and to help Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne will have a very real impact in my 
riding of Guelph—Wellington.  In order for Canada to continue to 
be a world leader in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship, we 
have to create opportunities for bright minds to learn and share 
their knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the nation's brightest minds study and teach at the 
University of Guelph.  The university and our community will 
benefit from the federal government's commitment to work with 
other public and private partners and to encourage research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will at least double the current federal investment in R and 
D by 2010.  We will strengthen the research capacity of our 
universities, government laboratories and institutions.  We will 
accelerate our ability to commercialize research discoveries. 
Many of these are made at the University of Guelph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Yukon Gold potato was developed by Dr. Gary 
Johnston, an employee of Agriculture Canada, doing research at 
the University of Guelph.  We will also support more 
collaborative international research at the frontiers of 
knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The University of Guelph, which is well known for its roots in 
the farming community in Guelph—Wellington as a whole, and 
Canadians from coast to coast will all benefit from the federal 
government's commitment to helping our agriculture sector move 
beyond crisis management.  Together we will work toward more 
genuine diversification and value added growth, new investments, 
better land use and high standards of environment stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the commitment to our farmers and their 
families.  Our agricultural community helped to make Canada what 
it is today, and we must give it the tools it needs to continue 
to grow and prosper.  Mr. Speaker, as our whip you talked a lot 
about having a tool box with tools in it so that people could 
achieve their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the well-being of our agricultural community is a concern 
in Guelph—Wellington, so too is the state of our health care 
system.  In the Speech from the Throne our government reaffirms 
our commitment to upholding the Canada Health Act.  We will work 
with the provinces to ensure that all governments continue to 
fulfil their commitment to the principle of medicare. 
We will work to help Canadians maintain a healthy lifestyle by 
encouraging physical fitness, combating substance abuse and 
tobacco consumption, and promoting mental health.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for Canadians to have confidence in our health care 
system they need to understand how it is run.  To this end we 
will create a citizen's council on health care quality to provide 
perspective on relevant and meaningful measures of how our health 
care is performing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also encourage active minds by creating registered 
individual learning accounts to make it easier for Canadians to 
plan for and to finance their education.  We will improve loans 
for part time students and provide support for young people who 
have difficulty staying in school or getting their first job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former chair of the Guelph—Wellington County Literacy 
Council, I am pleased to announce that the federal government 
will invite the provinces, territories and other parties to 
launch a national initiative to increase adult literacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new knowledge economy it is no longer enough to be 
literate.  Canadians must also be computer literate to succeed. 
The path to national prosperity and personal opportunity travels 
the Internet.  The federal government is committed to building a 
fast lane for Canada on the information highway by giving 
Canadians the skills and opportunities they need to become the 
most Internet savvy people in the world so that we can compete to 
win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make the Government of Canada the most connected 
government in the world to its citizens.  We will help entire 
communities go on line and create the framework needed to make 
Canada a world leader in e-commerce.  Getting Canadians on line 
will not only help connect us to the world but also to each 
other.  We can learn so much about each other if children in 
Whitehorse can chat on line with students in Gander, Drumheller, 
Guelph or Halton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot succeed in the knowledge economy unless we prepare 
our children for success.  To this end we will build on our 
efforts to eliminate child poverty.  We will develop new measures 
to help single parents overcome poverty and to create a better 
future for their families.  We will work with the provinces to 
modernize laws for child support, custody and access, and to 
ensure they work in the best interests of the children in cases 
of family breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guelph—Wellington has always been especially concerned with 
helping our children and with ensuring that they inherit a clean, 
safe country.  We all need clean air to breathe, clean water to 
drink and natural spaces to enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne commits the federal government to 
implementing the smog emissions reduction agreement signed with 
the United States to reduce vehicle emissions by 90%.  We will do 
our part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will develop stronger national guidelines for water quality 
and fund improvements to municipal water and waste systems.  We 
will invest in the creation of new national parks and make our 
existing parks ecologically healthy.  We will strengthen laws to 
safeguard Canadians from toxic substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure our communities are safe we will continue to implement 
a balanced approach to crime, focusing on prevention and on 
punishment.  We will take aggressive steps to combat organized 
crime.  We will reintroduce legislation dealing with young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a final note of good news for Guelph—Wellington, the Speech 
from the Throne includes a commitment to helping our municipal 
and provincial partners improve public transit infrastructure. We 
will stimulate the creation of more affordable rental housing, 
for which there is a very real and urgent need in my riding and 
in many other ridings across Canada.  My colleague from Halton 
and I were just speaking of the homeless issue and the things 
that we need to do and have done as a government to help in that 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are wide and broad and the needs are great, but the 
government has worked hard to have a balanced platform.  We will 
continue on that path to do the right thing for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the member 
opposite.  There were a couple of points I would like her to 
address that she did not mention. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She mentioned that one issue addressed in the throne speech was 
the commitment by the government to bring the agricultural 
community further than crisis management.  I would like to 
suggest to her that the program to get money out to the farmers 
with low incomes in disaster situations has not worked.  Only 50% 
of the money has been disbursed.  Does she have any comments on 
what the government will do to get that money out faster? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spring seeding is coming.  Many people in my riding and across 
Canada from coast to coast are having trouble in the agricultural 
sector to meet their needs.  I wonder if the comments in the 
throne speech, which say that tools will be given to get our 
agricultural community past this crisis and into other areas, 
mean that the government will try to help farmers to get off the 
land instead of help them to stay there.  If that is the approach 
the government is taking it is on the wrong track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do something immediately to get these funds off 
cabinet table and on to the kitchen tables across Canada.  Would 
the member comment on what she will do about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons met to 
deal with the parenting issue when families break up.  This has 
been on the table now for about two years.  The justice minister 
said she would not look at it for another two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue needs to be addressed.  Many Canadians are coming to 
my office asking questions on it.  They must be coming to the 
member's office as well.  Would she comment on the government's 
slow approach in dealing with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me assure my 
colleague that the government believes in the family farm.  There 
is no question we are committed to it.  We also believe as a 
government in a safe, affordable food supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look across the world we see people in food lines. They 
line up for hours for a quart of milk or a loaf of bread.  As 
much as 85% or 90% of their money goes toward that food supply 
and they are still hungry.  We have none of this in Canada.  This 
has been because the government has been committed to the family 
farm.  This has been because we believe that we need to have 
safe, affordable food for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not stand before the House today and say there are no 
problems in agriculture.  There are many problems.  Since the 
government was first elected in 1993 it has increased the safety 
net by 85%.  That is an important point, but there is no doubt 
there continue to be problems in the trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night the Prime Minister talked to the new president of the 
United States about this issue, which tells me that we are 
continuing to work on it.  Perhaps my colleague would like to 
infer that by the wave of a magic wand everything will be okay. 
That is not possible.  We have to continually work at problems in 
balance, and that is what we intend to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the hon. 
member.  For her to stand in the House of Commons and say that 
the Liberal Party cares about the family farmer is simply not on. 
It is simply ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that 22,000 farm families left the farm last year 
in western Canada alone.  Those are the facts.  They are 
undeniable.  When we speak to the children on the prairies about 
whether they are interested in the farming community, they say 
they want nothing to do with farms.  Who does she think will be 
the farmers that will feed Canadians in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government has 
continually been focused on a direction to help farmers.  All 
things are not perfect.  I will not stand here and say to my 
colleague that they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January I met with about 50 commodity groups.  All things are 
not bleak in all areas.  We have some areas of farming that are 
experiencing very tough times right now.  The government is 
committed to the family farm and a safe, affordable food supply.

Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to respond to the 
throne speech.  I will be splitting my time with the hon. member 
for Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all the residents of Saanich—Gulf Islands for doing me 
the great honour of re-electing me to the House of Commons to 
represent them.  I also thank my wife and my family, who have 
stood beside me for the last three and a half years and who are 
so important to me in doing this job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the international trade critic for the Canadian Alliance, 
while my colleague from Lethbridge deals with the agricultural 
issues in international trade.  It is difficult to get into all 
of the issues, but there are some that are very important and I 
will focus on those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was encouraged to hear in the throne speech that the 
government will work toward creating a free trade area of the 
Americas.  Canada can be number one of the Americas if we put our 
minds to it, if we work together, and if we put policies forward 
to ensure that we have free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has been sitting for only a little over a week since 
the last election, but I have to admit that I find some of the 
comments coming from the government and its cabinet ministers 
quite alarming.  I will focus on those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two issues are very important to Canada on the international 
trade front.  One is the softwood lumber agreement with our 
friends to the south, the Americans, which expires next month and 
which is very important.  At present, Canada has $1.2 billion in 
trade every day with the Americans.  Over $10 billion a year is 
traded in softwood lumber.  The industry is very important to 
Canada's economy.  There are thousands of jobs at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday as we were trying to put forward our concern about 
being in sync and having a unified position, in response to a 
question the Deputy Prime Minister maintained that “there is no 
threat or action on countervail against Canada on this matter”. 
That is the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been before the U.S. senate, while in January 
Ottawa launched a challenge to a U.S. law which states that 
countervail duties are non-refundable even if the Americans lose 
a WTO challenge on countervail action.  That law is seen as an 
incentive for the U.S. government to impose countervail duties 
even when an action is not likely to be upheld by the WTO.  Our 
own people in the international trade department, our own trade 
officials, conceded that they expect the United States to 
immediately begin action to impose duties on Canadian lumber once 
the deal expires on April 1.  This issue puts thousands of jobs 
at stake right across Canada.  I ask the government to look at 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his credit, the international trade minister seems to be 
saying the right things.  He is saying that he wants to let the 
agreement expire, which is the position of the Canadian Alliance. 
The member for Vancouver Island North has done a lot of work on 
this file and he has advocated this for the last year.  Do we 
need to let this expire?  Do we want to get to free market 
trading with the United States on softwood lumber?  Canada has to 
aggressively go after this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to let this agreement expire, but the Minister of 
Industry has come out with a position in which he says “I think 
the renewal of the existing agreement is something that will be 
part of the mix when we sit down at the table”. Canadians do not 
want that.  Industry does not want that.  The international trade 
minister does not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister waded into this debate by 
saying there was no threat of countervail duties.  That is 
exactly the threat we could face from the U.S.  Canada has to 
take a very strong position. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully members of cabinet will sit down and decide that there 
is only one position, not three, and that they can speak with a 
unified voice on this matter.  I do find it alarming that the 
Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday there is no threat.  In 
fact, right out of the U.S. senate, this is exactly what they are 
threatening to do.  At the confirmation hearings of Robert 
Zoellick, the U.S. trade representative, the Americans said that 
this is the most important issue between our two countries and 
that they want him to make it his first priority after his 
confirmation.  Again I ask the government to look at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue we need to bring up as we go to a free 
trade agreement with the Americas, if that is our goal.  We are 
now engaged in a dispute with Brazil over Embraer.  Canada has 
gone to the World Trade Organization.  Last year it won that 
case.  In December the World Trade Organization gave Canada the 
option of imposing sanctions against Brazil as the only way to 
fight this measure, but to date Canada has done absolutely 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I am concerned, in that we want to enter into free trade 
agreements with the Americas, which I absolutely 100% endorse, 
but even in the dispute we have now with Brazil, Canada is not 
acting with the tools available under the rules of the World 
Trade Organization.  We have been one of the principle proponents 
of these tools and have advocated for them, yet we have not been 
using them.  I find that alarming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go toward free trade agreements, Canada enjoys a very 
strong trading relationship with the United States, $1.2 billion 
in trade every day.  The U.S. is our most important trading 
partner.  Over 80% of Canada's trade is with the United States. 
There is no question, I would argue, that we have been considered 
one of the favourites of the United States and vice versa.  We 
have done a lot of trade with them.  That is about to change. 
There is the new administration in Mexico under Vicente Fox and 
the new administration under President Bush, and President Bush 
has made it very clear that he is looking to expand trade 
throughout the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International trade amounts to 40% of the wealth created in 
Canada.  It is so critical to our economy and, if we are not 
completely on the ball, we could be left behind in this evolving 
free trade area.  Brazil will play a role.  We know Mexico will 
be at the table in a major way and will become a very powerful 
trading partner in the Americas.  It is important for Canada to 
get a very strong trade policy and aggressively pursue it, not 
just with the United States but with Mexico and the states 
throughout Central and South America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the actions we have seen from the government in 
the last week, I am not sure if the government members are really 
sitting down and getting their position right or if they are all 
jockeying to see who can get out of cabinet first to get in front 
of the cameras.  It is alarming when one says one thing and one 
says another.  The headlines in every major paper across the 
country last week said that the Minister of Industry and the 
Minister for International Trade are fighting over who gets 
control of this file.  Quite frankly, Canadians really do not 
care who is in charge of the file; they just want to make sure 
that someone is and that Canada has a unified voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I, throughout this parliament, will look at 
all government policies and put forward constructive options that 
we believe will advance Canada's position in the international 
trade market.  I believe Canada can be number one if we have the 
courage to stand up to all these other nations, to make sure that 
Canada is on the forefront of these free trade agreements and to 
actively pursue them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate and was interested in the hon. member's comment about 
the importance of trade and relations between our country and the 
United States.  I agree that they are very important.  Clearly 
the United States is our most important trading partner as well 
as our close friend and neighbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of softwood lumber, what can the hon. member tell 
me about his party's position on the situation in Atlantic 
Canada, where the majority of forest products come from private 
woodlots? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Atlantic region has been exempted by the U.S.  The 
U.S. senators, congressmen and trade representative all recognize 
that in Atlantic Canada there is no question of any subsidy, even 
from their perspective.  They do not have the view that the 
lumber coming from Atlantic Canada is subsidized lumber.  They do 
not feel that there should be any quotas, export taxes or 
anything else on that lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are thousands of jobs in Atlantic Canada dependent on the 
lumber industry.  I wonder what his party would propose to ensure 
that the interests of Atlantic Canada are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I first want to emphasize 
that we do not come here to represent the views of Atlantic 
Canada or British Columbia or Ontario.  We come here to represent 
and look after the interests of all Canadians, from coast to 
coast to coast.  The Canadian Alliance, and again I give credit 
to the member for Vancouver Island North, has advocated the 
position the government has now taken, that is, the Alliance 
wants to see a free market without any countervailing duties or 
quotas, a free market in lumber for everyone in Canada, for 
British Columbians, for Nova Scotians, for everyone from the 
Atlantic regions, for everyone across Canada.  We believe that is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree that there are no subsidies for the lumber 
industry in Atlantic Canada, just like there are none in British 
Columbia.  Of course some of our opponents in the U.S., our 
competition, would argue that there are, but this issue has been 
to the World Trade Organization and Canada won.  The WTO ruled 
that the British Columbia forest industry is not subsidized. 
There are different practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will argue as aggressively for the people of Atlantic Canada 
as I will for the people of British Columbia, and for everyone 
else in between, that Canada pursue this very aggressively.  We 
should let the softwood lumber agreement expire, which I believe 
is the position of at least the international trade minister, and 
we should ensure that the lumber industry right across Canada has 
unfettered access to all U.S. markets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I ask the member to elaborate a bit more on the 
agricultural situation.  As we know, the grain and oilseed sector 
in this country is hurting very badly because of low commodity 
prices.  Some believe that those low commodity prices are due to 
European and U.S. subsidies for farmers.  Certainly in Europe 
something like 56% or 58% of their agricultural dollar is created 
through subsidies.  In the United States, it is about 38%, while 
in Canada it is somewhere around 9 or 10 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel the government has not been aggressive enough as a 
country at the trade table.  I ask the member to elaborate on 
some of the things that we as a country can do to help lever some 
of these subsidies down in order to create a better atmosphere 
for our agricultural community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from 
Lethbridge for his question, and as he will be responsible for 
the agricultural sector of international trade, I look forward to 
working together with him to provide solutions for the government 
over the next three or four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the United States subsidizes its farmers four 
times more than Canada does.  Canada has to start taking a very 
strong, aggressive position in the negotiations with the 
Americans.  Collectively we have to go after the Europeans on 
their subsidies.  If we are going to have a free market, we 
believe that Canada and Canadian farmers can compete if they are 
competing on a level playing field.  However, now they are up 
against a huge wall.  The subsidies in Europe and the United 
States are so excessive compared to those of Canada that 
competing is almost impossible.  The government has offered some 
relief, but the money has been left on the cabinet table and has 
never reached the kitchen table.

get on board and collectively go after the Europeans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I start, I would like to join my colleagues in 
congratulating you on your appointment as Deputy Speaker.  I look 
forward to working with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour for me to rise this afternoon in reply to the 
Speech from the Throne.  Earlier last year, following World Trade 
Organization negotiations in Seattle which I attended as a member 
of the Canadian delegation, I hosted a public meeting in my 
riding to discuss among other things world trade and 
globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many Canadians, constituents of mine who attended this 
meeting did not know a great deal about the WTO or NAFTA.  What 
they did know was that Canada has prospered from its involvement 
in international trade.  Globalization and Canada's involvement 
in the global economy were not viewed as inherently threatening 
but simply a natural progression brought about by freer markets 
and advancements in communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there were questions about what globalization meant 
for Canada's sovereignty or our ability to make policy decisions 
in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A common theme of this meeting was that globalization should 
bring prosperity to all countries and people of the world.  We 
know globalization has led many developing countries to increased 
prosperity and wealth.  However, for many others globalization 
poses a challenge.  The question for Canadians is how best all 
countries can grasp opportunities offered by globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly believe that freer trade and expanding local 
economies are the best engines for development and prosperity. 
The best hope for developing countries has always been to find 
ways of tapping into the vast resources of private capital.  We 
must stop thinking of government as the permanent engine driving 
overseas assistance and instead view the government as a 
facilitating partner.  Canadians should be encouraged to 
contribute directly to NGOs involved in foreign assistance. 
Governments can then match contributions given by the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An excellent working example of this system in practice is the 
Canadian Food Grains Bank.  The Canadian Food Grains Bank accepts 
donations of grains to send overseas for people in need.  The 
Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, matches the 
donations received by the CFGB on a four to one basis.  The 
government money is used to either purchase additional grains in 
Canada or to purchase grains closer to the area in need.  Through 
the Canadian Food Grains Bank and its partners, 98% of the food 
donated to the organization makes it to the people who 
desperately need it.  That is a true Canadian success story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, Canada must also continue to provide assistance for 
emergency relief efforts.  The minister responsible for CIDA was 
quick to respond to devastating earthquakes in El Salvador and 
India with $1 million and $5 million respectively.  I applaud the 
government for its prompt response to this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the November 27 federal election was dominated by 
domestic issues like taxes and health care, Canadians have come 
to expect that their country provides assistance to countries and 
people less fortunate.  Having said that, Canadians expect a 
certain level of performance, results and accountability for tax 
dollars budgeted for foreign aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in his 1993, 1996, 1998 and 2000 reports was 
critical of CIDA's mismanagement and institutional culture 
characterized by confusion and lack of focus.  It seems that over 
the years change has not come easily to CIDA  The Canadian 
Alliance believes that CIDA is simply not capable as presently 
structured of fulfilling its mandate effectively or efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier in my speech it is freer trade and expanding 
local economies that are the best engines for development and 
prosperity. 
Globalization continues to be the engine bringing countries 
together.  Globalization has helped to promote sustainable 
development and prosperity around the world.  Globalization 
represents opportunities and challenges for all countries in the 
world, including Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada entered the new century with some significant economic 
strengths.  However, it also has some troubling weakness.  The 
country's strength includes a labour force that is among the most 
highly educated in the world and a well developed infrastructure 
that includes advanced information and communications technology, 
both necessary requirements in a knowledge based economy. 
However, we have some glaring weaknesses including the relatively 
low rates of research and development, a capital investment rate 
that is far below the level of the United States, a high personal 
and corporate taxation and our relative slowness, again compared 
to the United States, in adapting advanced technologies and in 
seizing the new economic opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government announced a program in the throne speech 
to double the investment in research and development by 2010. 
This is a step in the right direction.  However, the government 
missed a critical opportunity in the throne speech to introduce 
real tax relief and encourage our best and brightest to remain in 
Canada.  Again the government has ignored the reality of the 
brain drain.  It is a fact that every year more and more of our 
best and brightest are attracted to the high earnings, lower 
taxes and better job opportunities offered in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look to the future, the United States is poised to 
introduce substantial tax reductions and to pay down the debt 
within the next 10 years.  Our finance minister has introduced 
tax cuts which are marginal at best and has an unambitious target 
of paying down Canada's debt.  Canada cannot hope to remain 
competitive with the United States if our fiscal structure is so 
terribly out of line with the others.  The government needs to 
make fiscal competitiveness with the United States a current 
priority.  This means real tax relief and a dedicated paydown 
schedule.  None of these important steps were mentioned in the 
Liberal throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics of globalization fear that economic integration is 
leading to a loss of Canadian sovereignty.  As policymakers we 
must adhere to our obligations under NAFTA and WTO which attempt 
to prevent policy actions that might create an unlevel playing 
field.  Similarly, Canada's policymakers must give careful 
attention to how their actions will impact the country's ability 
to attract investment and highly skilled workers.  There are 
concerns about foreign ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our undervalued Canadian dollar has given Canadian exporters an 
advantage in exporting their products and services to the United 
States.  However, it has made Canadian companies a bargain for 
American investors.  Former Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed has 
expressed concern about Canada's sovereignty since the signing of 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would say that globalization is extremely 
important.  With the summit of free trade of the Americas coming 
pretty soon, even the president of the United States is very keen 
to promote free trade, the issues and challenges of globalization 
must advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition has asked me to chair an 
advisory committee to address globalization and Canada's 
competitiveness.  I will talk with NGOs and Canada's business 
leaders to develop a sound plan for Canada to deal with some of 
the questions surrounding globalization.  I look forward to 
hearing from anyone who has something to add.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at 
the outset I want to indicate that I will be sharing my time with 
the member for Tobique—Mactaquac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privilege and pleasure this morning to speak for the 
first time in the 37th Parliament of Canada, my first time since 
being returned for the third time.  I want to pay tribute to some 
of those people who have made it possible for me to come back. 
First, I want to personally thank my wife and my family for their 
continued support and indulgence of my time to others. 
Being a member of parliament, as all of us in the House know, 
requires giving up a lot of our personal time.  I enjoy it and my 
family has agreed to allow me to do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to express my appreciation to the people of 
Huron—Bruce for their support over the past number of elections. 
Traditionally, my riding was a Conservative riding.  The people 
who normally supported that party chose to support me because of 
my representation.  I count it a humbling experience to come 
back, and from time to time I ask them to recommit to that 
support they first gave to me in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I want to commit my time to speaking on the issue 
of agriculture.  My riding of Huron—Bruce is primarily an 
agricultural riding.  It is an area which is now traditionally 
called the western coast of Ontario.  It is an area where we 
primarily make our living from the land.  However, we also have a 
number of other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the most notable industry in our riding is Sifto Salt. 
It represents the largest salt mine in the world.  When people 
travel the highways of Ontario or in other parts of Canada and 
the United States, they will likely be saved the embarrassment of 
finding themselves in a ditch because the salt on those roads 
probably came from Goderich, Ontario.  It is one of the things 
that we would like to forget for a while since we have had a long 
period of winter, but spring is not that far around the corner. 
That brings me to the concerns that I have regarding agriculture 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative to remember that we all look upon our farmers 
as the suppliers of our food source.  We rely on them to provide 
us with our daily food.  In the short time that has been 
allocated to me this morning, I want to give the members some 
illustrations of where agriculture is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is at a crossroads in Canada.  It is not because we 
have been unable to produce the food.  We have been able to 
safely produce food in adequate numbers and quantities for 
Canadians.  However, we have been unable to receive adequate 
returns in the marketplace to make it profitable for farmers to 
remain on their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a family of seven generations of agrologists, people 
who have made their living from the land.  The generation of 
people which follow me are not farmers today and will not be 
farmers.  They are making their life vocation in other sectors. 
That is disconcerting in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I can help members better understand where agriculture 
is today.  In my riding of Huron—Bruce, we produce more 
agricultural products in terms of dollar value than any other 
riding in Canada east of Winnipeg.   We have the largest grain 
inland elevators in Canada in a little village called Hensall. 
Every time I turn around or every time I go down a road I pass 
some of those farmers who have given us the food that we put on 
our tables.  I have a strong tradition in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember citing in the House of Commons in the 36th parliament 
the importance of agriculture.  Then I saw storm clouds on the 
horizon.  Today the storm clouds have developed into a major 
storm.  These people are seeking refuge and help.  They are 
calling upon government to intervene in the short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne the Governor General said “The 
government will help Canada's agricultural sector move beyond 
crisis management”.  Indeed, the government recognizes that 
there is crisis in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move now.  We are 90 days away from seeding in 
Ontario.  While I support agriculture in all corners of the 
country, my focus is largely on Ontario because that is where my 
expertise is.  When I speak of what is good for Ontario, it also 
has to be good for other parts of the country.  Every province 
needs to share in the wealth that we generate.  That is what 
Canada is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A farmer came to my office last Friday morning with a balance 
sheet of his returns from last year.  He had his own bookkeeper 
do the accounting and then sent it to the auditor for a final 
accounting so it would be accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This farmer is well known in my community.  He remains nameless 
in the House.  However he has allowed me to bring his numbers to 
the House to give some credence to the arguments we are putting 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a 600 acre operation, which is not a large one, he paid 
himself $110 per acre for the land he owns.  He included repairs 
and had very little depreciation because most of his equipment 
had been depreciated to a point where there was nothing left.  At 
the end of the day he was $90 per acre short on income and 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This guy would be considered a model farmer in his community. He 
had a $55,000 loss on 600 acres.  Last year he purchased nitrogen 
fertilizer at $150 per tonne.  He has two prices:  one a month 
ago at $350 per tonne for this coming spring and another which is 
effective now.  Unless he purchases it now, it will go to $450 
per tonne.  This is a 140% increase from two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For diesel fuel and other fuel sources, because he has a drying 
operation as well, we are talking about enormous increases in the 
90 to 100% range.  However his prices were basically put into 
effect in the 1930s.  There is not an industry in Canada that can 
sustain such losses over that many years.  I think food is much 
more important than we sometimes give it credit for.  The issue 
of food goes much beyond the farm gate.  It is an issue of 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want continued sovereignty over our food supply?  Do we 
want our rural communities, which share the wealth when farmers 
prosper, to continue to exist?  Do we want churches and schools 
to disappear from the rural landscape in Ontario and throughout 
the rest of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have choices to make.  This is a serious issue.  I do not 
often come to the House with an issue that is so profoundly 
difficult to talk about.  Because I know it so well, it is 
important that today and in the short term we find a vehicle to 
deliver cash to farmers which they can take to the bank.  If we 
do not, we will not have farmers in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did what was right for Bombardier.  Farmers will not argue 
that we did what was right.  It is important that we now do the 
right thing for agriculture.  Some 640,000 people in Ontario are 
directly or indirectly related to this industry and 24,000 people 
are involved in the aerospace industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do the right thing.  Let us deliver the money to our 
farmers before seeding time so that we can enjoy the food we put 
on our plates every day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am impressed with the hon. member opposite.  He ought 
to be commended for the beautiful, wonderful and insightful 
remarks he just made.  I congratulate him on his re-election to 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member brings forward a balanced position and puts it 
together nicely.  In light of his impassioned speech and his 
obvious understanding of the problem, why has his government not 
given to farmers the money it promised them, let alone a new 
program to help them with other problems?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not even done what it said it would do.  Why 
can the hon. member opposite, a member of the government, not get 
the Prime Minister to do what he said he would do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am indebted to the hon. 
member, who is a good friend of mine, for asking that question. 
It is not that we have not delivered to farmers.  It is a case of 
mixed messages being sent to our farmers.  Right now farmers are 
more interested in money than in another message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we began this process some two and a half years ago, we 
were looking at a request of $600 million.  We came in at $900 
million and raised that to $1.1 billion.  We have committed to 
three years at $1.1 billion and are now asking for another $900 
million of federal money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is speaking about the 20% that has not been delivered 
on the AIDA program, and he is absolutely correct.  If we have 
not delivered that money we ought to be delivering it.  It is not 
because I have not put forward the argument to deliver that 
money. I will continue to do that, but there are mitigating 
circumstances which have for one reason or another not allowed it 
to happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member for 
Guelph—Wellington who seemed to think there was no farm crisis. 
Then I heard my good friend, also with a farm background, mention 
that there was a farm crisis.  It is refreshing to have someone 
on the backbenches with an incredible amount of backbone to tell 
it exactly like it is.  I do not think a member on this side of 
the House could have said it as eloquently and as passionately as 
he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member understands that farmers in Ontario and western 
Canada are going through exactly what fishermen in the coastal 
communities of Atlantic Canada went through and exactly what the 
fishing communities of western Canada went through.  Conservative 
and Liberal policies have put the main producers of the food on 
our tables in a state of continual crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider the hon. member to be a great friend and a great 
member of the fishing community.  Will he take his comments 
directly to the agriculture minister and the industry minister, 
because they are the ones who need to hear them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have come to enjoy 
working with the hon. member from Nova Scotia on the fishery 
committee.  Not only will I take the message to the ministers to 
whom he referred, but I have already done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow I will deliver to anyone in the House who wishes one a 
copy of the farmer's financial statement I spoke of earlier.  All 
the member needs to do is ask and he will have delivered to him a 
copy of that statement.  The message must get out and we must do 
it as quickly as we can.  We have no time to lose.  I would be 
more than delighted to provide you with that document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  As a reminder as we begin the 37th 
parliament, please do not forget your Speaker.  Rather than 
addressing one another directly, it is more useful to speak 
through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Savoy (Tobique—Mactaquac, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with an overwhelming sense of pride and respect that I rise 
today in the House to respond to the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by thanking the constituents of Tobique—Mactaquac for 
giving me the awesome responsibility and privilege of 
representing their views and concerns in parliament.  During the 
election campaign I promised my constituents I would listen to 
their concerns and speak to those issues on their behalf when in 
Ottawa.  I intend to fulfil that promise to the best of my 
ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This obligation derives not only from the sense of 
responsibility that comes with being a member of parliament but 
in some measure from the fact that the Speaker of the House has a 
sister residing in my riding, who I am sure will receive regular 
reports on my performance in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Speaker of the House on his most recent 
election victory.  To be selected by your peers and assume the 
highest authority in the House of Commons is the greatest mark of 
respect your fellow members can show you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I congratulate all members of parliament on their recent 
election victories.  To be elected by the people of Canada to 
represent their views and concerns is both a formidable task and 
a tremendous opportunity. 
This symbiotic relationship carries a huge responsibility, one 
that I am prepared to accept while in public office.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly and most importantly, I thank my friends and family for 
their unwavering support and inspiration.  I especially want to 
extend personal thanks to my wife and my mother.  I thank my 
mother for teaching me to aim high and my wife for keeping me on 
track and helping me achieve my goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank Gilles Bernier, the former member for 
Tobique—Mactaquac, for his good work these past years, on 
behalf of the people of our riding. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Situated in western New Brunswick, my riding is known for the 
picturesque beauty of the Nashwaak, Tobique and Saint John River 
valleys, a beauty my ancestors no doubt dwelt upon when they 
first settled in the Saint John River Valley over 200 hundred 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region of the upper Tobique River in the north end of the 
riding has excellent fishing and hunting.  Both my grandfather 
and great-grandfather worked there as guides and lumberjacks.  As 
guides they respected nature.  While probably not schooled in the 
concepts of wildlife conservation, they understood its 
implications.  They knew that if everyone fished or hunted to 
excess there would be no fish and game for their children or 
their children's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say, as my forefathers did, that the government 
understands the concept of resource management.  It has 
explicitly committed itself to the protection of species at risk, 
to marine conservation and to the conservation of our natural 
spaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My forefathers fished and hunted alongside the aboriginal people 
of the area, and each depended on the other in times of need. The 
Tobique first nations are a proud people.  I am optimistic about 
the future of the government's relations with all first nations 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In aboriginal communities we are promoting programs to reduce 
the incidence of fetal alcohol syndrome in newborns and 
preventable diseases like tuberculosis and diabetes.  The 
aboriginal head start program will be significantly expanded to 
better prepare aboriginal children for the rigours of the 
educational system and to help those with special needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Tobique first nations will see the benefits of an 
increased focus on entrepreneurial and business expertise that 
will ultimately promote economic development and industrial 
growth in their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as some of my forefathers chose to be hunters and 
lumberjacks, others chose to be farmers.  The upper Saint John 
River Valley is home to some of the highest quality seed and 
table potatoes in the world.  The area is responsible for 95% of 
New Brunswick's potato production and most of it is grown on 
traditional family farms.  A superior product does not compensate 
for low market prices or offset unfair subsidization by other 
national governments, which has been an ongoing problem for 
Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged to see a renewed federal commitment to move away 
from farm crisis management toward long term agricultural 
sustainability, value added agricultural growth, improved land 
usage and increased investment in research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carleton county in the centre of my riding has the third fastest 
growing economy in Canada, fuelled by food processing, lumber 
operations and metal working.  As a professional engineer with 
extensive experience in local economic development, I know 
firsthand the commercial importance of research and development. 
Companies must either innovate or over time they stagnate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made innovation a top priority.  For 
engineers, scientists and business people across Canada this is 
music to their ears.  The government will double spending on R 
and D by 2010.  It will accelerate the commercialization process 
for new products.  It will support collaborative research with 
international partners.  It will strengthen the research capacity 
of Canadian universities and government laboratories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government's goal and encourage it as an 
attainable one.  The goal is to become one of the top five 
countries in the world for research and development by 2010. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I have spoken of my own experiences and those of my 
forefathers, but I would now like to talk about our collective 
future, that of Canada's youth, of our children, of my children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife and I have a 19 month old daughter and are expecting a 
second child in June.  I am proud to say that our country is 
built on liberal values, which accord the family its due 
increasingly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my children will benefit from the major spending 
that goes into social programs.  For example, by allocating an 
additional $2.2 billion to the early childhood development 
program, the federal government has reiterated its support for 
targeted social spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is doubling the length of parental leave and maternity 
benefits while continuing to increase child tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's children will grow up in a climate in which learning and 
education, the foundations of a better future, have become a 
national priority for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the millennium scholarship fund, scholarships 
will be accorded over the next ten years to over 100,000 
disadvantaged students.  In addition, the educational tax credit 
has been increased and tax cuts worth nearly $1 billion are 
planned one million students over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the registered individual learning accounts will help 
Canadians of all ages find the money they need for their ongoing 
training. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promoting opportunities and social benefits for families is as 
extremely important as protecting our families and children. The 
tragedy at Walkerton last summer saw the deaths of innocent 
Canadians, both adult and children.  In response to the incident 
I organized a drinking water conference in Fredericton, New 
Brunswick, which saw over 300 people from across Canada attend 
workshops and learn how to assess, remedy and ultimately protect 
themselves and others from contaminated water sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown a commitment to safe drinking water for 
all people in Canada by focusing on stronger national guidelines 
for water quality, by strengthening the role of the national 
water research institute, by funding improvements to municipal 
water and waste water systems, and by investing in research and 
development on better land use practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has shown vision.  Our government has shown 
innovation.  Our government has shown compassion for families, 
children and aboriginal peoples.  Our government has shown 
leadership.  I look forward to governing this great nation with 
my colleagues from all political parties.  The elected in each 
riding reflect the truly great citizens of a great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having listened to the member, one would think there are no

of students are leaving their post-secondary graduate studies 
with record levels of debt.  One would not think that a 
tremendous amount of fishermen are still making under $10,000 a 
year.  One would not think that 22,000 families left the family 
farm last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech concentrated heavily on the so-called new 
economy and completely neglected what was called the old economy 
of fishing, mining, forestry and agriculture.  Would the member 
comment on what he plans to do for Canada's largest employers in 
the so-called old economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Savoy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore for my first 
question, the encouragement and the welcome to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future lies in the concept of value added in each of these 
resource areas.  We must look at agriculture and the fisheries 
not only as a traditional resource but as a base product.  We 
must look at value adding to the resource by processing fisheries 
products further down the line.  Similarly in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding I have one of the experts in value adding in McCain 
Foods, the largest frozen fry producer in the world.  People have 
taken value added to the extreme.  McCain Foods produces not only 
french fries.  It produces juices, pizzas and a variety of value 
added products.  I believe the future lies in value added.

join in congratulating the hon. member and welcoming him to the 
House.  We benefit in this place by having people from all walks 
of life and different backgrounds.  In the case of the hon. 
member, we have the advantage of having a professional engineer 
who has significant experience in the field of environmentally 
sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member is aware of the government's plans in 
relation to the treatment of waste water and water.  How does he 
feel about the government's infrastructure plans in this area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Savoy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with regard to water and 
waste water infrastructure, the government has taken an 
initiative by investing over $2 billion.  Specifically in my 
riding with 14 small municipalities many have had boil orders in 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infrastructure program extends not only to the water system 
itself but extends to the waste water system.  Water 
contamination is frequently the result of improper waste water 
management.  The government has made enormous progress as far as 
investing $2.2 billion in water and waste water management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also looked at strengthening the National 
Water Research Institute.  It has looked at developing stronger 
national guidelines for water quality.  It is doing research and 
development in better land use practices, which means the 
protection of our surface water and our ground water sources. 
Some of it is common sense.  In layperson terms, one does not put 
a chemical plant within 100 feet of a municipal well head or 
municipal lagoon.  That is an example of better land use 
practice.  More research and development are being done into land 
use practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with the New Brunswick Environment 
Industry Association to organize our second annual drinking water 
conference entitled “Your Drinking Water: Ensuring Its Safety”. 
This conference will further educate people from across Canada on 
the perils and the contaminants potentially in our water source 
and how to assess and remedy them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like you to note that I will be splitting my time with 
the new Bloc Quebecois member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have already asked some questions and made some 
comments, this is the first opportunity I have had since being 
elected to actually rise and respond to the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by thanking a few people.  I am sure that 
the House will understand. My first thanks go to my wife Nathalie 
and my children Roxane and Vincent who, although still 
young—eight and eleven years old—have a very good, not to say 
an excellent, understanding of the demands made on a member for 
parliament.  I also wish to thank my family, the organizers and 
voters of the riding of Berthier—Montcalm, who have put their 
trust in me since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third election for a party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
which was not supposed to be around for more than three elections 
in a row.  In the riding of Berthier—Montcalm, my percentage of 
the vote went up starting in 1993.  I therefore think that there 
is room for the Bloc Quebecois and that it is using its position 
properly to defend Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me directly to the throne speech.  What are we to 
conclude from this particular throne speech?  The tradition after 
a general election was to have a speech that would give 
parliamentarians some direction, that spoke about the 
government's vision.  Things had to change.  There were new bills 
on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I must agree with many other experts and 
journalists.  In a nutshell, all the time put into the throne 
speech was pointless and very expensive.  As we have seen, it was 
even a very imperialist exercise, with the Governor General, the 
Queen's representative.  There is nothing, or nothing new anyway, 
in the throne speech.  It shows a complete lack of imagination on 
the part of this government, which is simply maintaining the 
course it embarked on after the 1997 election.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this was an opportunity to follow up on 
certain comments and wishes expressed by the public for changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no.  We can see for instance that, by wholly reproducing 
what was already in its red book—not to fault that, but it was 
unnecessary to have a general election and a throne speech—the 
government decided to continue its usual incursion into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction may be that the Bloc Quebecois is always saying 
that, but it is the very source of this country's problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that Quebec did not sign the 
constitution.  No Quebec premier signed it, whether Parti 
Quebecois or Liberal.  None has signed the constitution.  Yet 
here again we find a government preparing to invest—because it 
has the cash—in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  Just think of 
parental leave and education.  Is there any area, under the 
Canadian constitution, which falls more clearly under provincial 
jurisdiction than education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech we can see that the federal government's 
investment is under the pretext that there is a problem.  Yes, 
there is a problem, and not just in Quebec.  The problem has 
been caused by the federal government with its cuts to transfer 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are asking the federal government, which is 
accumulating billions of dollars, to transfer the money it took 
to the provinces, which are closer to the people and provide 
services directly to constituents so they may invest wherever 
there is a need, including among others in education.  It is, 
however, not up to the federal government to invest directly in 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the basis of a number of misunderstandings.  Let the 
government 
honour the Canadian constitution, which it boasts is good.  Let 
it honour it.  In doing so, they will end up with a lot fewer 
overlaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in education and health care, where the 
government will 
create a supervisory superstructure.  As if the provinces could 
not manage their hospitals and the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem, I repeat, was created by the federal government 
when it cut the transfer payments and money, which was in fact 
intended for these public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the matter of potable water.  It is true that this has 
been a problem in certain municipalities in Canada and Quebec. 
However, water quality and availability are provincial matters as 
well.  Will the federal government start investing in that area 
as well?  That does not line up very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the government opposite is very arrogant.  I 
understand that it is quietly pursuing the same approach since 
1997.  Perhaps it should realize it is off track.  The Bloc 
Quebecois will be there to remind it.  We will be there to get 
the most for Quebec, to remind the federal government that it is 
off the beam in the case of many bills and we will try to 
influence it, as we have done in the past. 
Through it all, we will continue to do our job and we will 
respect provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be honest, there was at least one positive thing in the 
throne speech, and I can hardly wait to have it in my hands. 
This is the anti-gang legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will recall that when the Bloc Quebecois spoke about 
the problem of biker gangs in Quebec and in Canada, the 
government members opposite practically laughed in our faces. 
They said there was no problem, that the Criminal Code was 
fine the way it was and that additional legislation was not 
necessary.  All the Liberals in the House heard the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Justice tell us this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the wake of the election campaign, people realized 
that Canada did not in fact have the tools to effectively 
combat organize crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We read in the throne speech that the federal government is 
preparing to introduce anti-gang amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has understood, and this is why the Bloc Quebecois is 
important.  Without us, the government would have done nothing because 
it did not understand the problem.  We got the message across. 
We are going to continue to speak out because there are other 
messages that must get across to the government, including 
the one having to do with the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought that after an election campaign the 
government members opposite, especially those from Quebec, would 
have understood that Quebecers do not want the Minister of 
Justice and the federal government meddling with the Young 
Offenders Act.  This legislation has demonstrated its worth in 
Quebec, where the crime and recidivism rates are the lowest in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are succeeding where other provinces are not. 
Why? Because we apply the Young Offenders Act while some 
provinces do not. They do not have the necessary infrastructures 
to deal with young people who have a problem with crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the minister do? Will she listen to Quebec? Will she 
follow Quebec's example, since our approach is successful? Have 
the Quebec Liberal members of parliament managed to convince the 
minister? They have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the throne speech, the minister introduced a bill 
repealing the Young Offenders Act. She used the lowest common 
denominator, that is those provinces that had the lowest success 
rate with young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the government is saying “Quebec will have to apply the 
same provisions as western Canada”. This says a lot about the 
value of the motion passed by the government to recognize Quebec 
as a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Liberal members from Quebec, I would be ashamed to 
belong to this government given the way it is dealing with the 
Young Offenders Act. They have failed in their responsibility to 
get the message across to the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us, we will continue, along with the national assembly, 
the coalition and the Quebec consensus, to oppose the government 
regarding such an important bill for the future of our young 
people and having to do with the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up, so I am leaving the floor to my 
colleague. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to say that I was very honoured to be 
elected on November 27 by the people of 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel to represent them in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my constituents, my wife Francine, my 
daughter Joëlle, my son Mario junior, all my political 
organizers as well as my predecessor in the House, Maurice 
Dumas, who has retired after seven productive years here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I entered into the election campaign when Mr Dumas' departure 
was announced, on the day the election was called. For me it was 
of course quite a jump. At this time last year, I was president 
of the Union des municipalités du Québec. It was a big challenge 
for me, particularly when I heard that I was running in a 
constituency targeted by the Liberal machine in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am even more thankful to the people of 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel when I remember that, during the 
campaign, the  Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the 
Minister of Public Works and even the Minister of Finance came 
to help my opponent in his attempt to defeat me. The people of 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel were not fooled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding spans more than 6,000 square kilometres between the 
greater Montreal and the metropolitan Outaouais. The federal 
system had a harsh impact on this area over the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The  riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel is located between two 
major populated areas, but there still is no highway linking 
these two important areas within the same province. It is the 
only place in Canada where such a situation exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the riding of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel includes an 
international airport, Mirabel airport, where no development 
plan has yet been prepared. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also hit hard by an annual unemployment rate that hovers 
around 10% annually, at 8% in the summer and about 14% in the 
winter. Members will understand that this riding's 
economy relies on forestry, agriculture, tourism and, of course, 
these past years on industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, members will also understand that in tourism, 
agriculture and forestry employment is seasonal, not 
workers. Consequently, this 10% rate of unemployment is 
compounded by a 10% rate of people who are able to work yet are 
receiving income security benefits from the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, as we speak, 20% of the workers in the riding of 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel are not working. This is a situation 
that has no justification whatsoever, and we have been waiting 
and still are waiting for changes to the Employment Insurance 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the strategies outlined by the federal government in 
the last Speech from the Throne had nothing to impress the 
citizens of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing proposed regarding employment insurance 
is that workers be given back 8% of annual surpluses taken from 
the federal government's budgets. The government wants to dip 
into the pockets of the workers in Quebec and Canada to the tune 
of $32 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election, at the peak of the campaign, the Prime 
Minister of Canada openly recognized that he had made a mistake 
with the Employment Insurance Act. The leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois wrote a letter to the leaders of all the political 
parties in the House asking that the House be recalled on 
compassionate grounds before the holiday season to 
give some hope to the workers of Canada and Quebec who had been 
penalized by the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Liberal Party was the only one to refuse to 
have the House recalled on humanitarian grounds before the holiday 
season, which is absolutely inconceivable and unworthy of a 
political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Speech from the Throne, intrusion into areas such as 
health and education is still to be found everywhere. 
The Liberal Party has no intention of putting an end to the war 
against the provinces, which has been going on for too long. 
This government has decided once more to intrude into 
provincial jurisdiction, namely health, education and the 
legislation on young offenders. My colleague mentioned this 
earlier; the federal government is still waging war against the 
provinces. This is obviously a bad thing for economic activity 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the whole story of the November 2000 election 
campaign has been the most shameful in modern Canada, to 
paraphrase the Prime Minister's words. It was the most shameful, 
because it was the election of one man, as in <I>Un Homme et son 
péché</I>. It was a case of power-hungry people who tried to catch 
the other political parties off guard. This is the only reason 
we had an election in November 2000. There was no other 
justification for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last election, which had the lowest participation rate in 
the history of modern Canada, was the most shameful election of 
modern times in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the citizens of Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, I 
predict that if the next five years, which have been launched by 
this Speech from the Throne, are similar to the last 30 years, 
Quebec will no longer be represented in this House when the next 
election rolls around. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened with a great deal of interest 
to the remarks of my colleague from Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that the member for that riding has 
developed a great deal of expertise in municipal politics and 
has decided to use his experience for the benefit of Quebec and 
of the Bloc Quebecois. I am very pleased that electors in that 
riding have put their trust in him. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me in his remarks was the similarities between his 
riding and mine. One example is the importance of forestry, an 
industry that has a direct impact on seasonal workers. He gave a 
very concrete example. In his riding the unemployment rate 
varies between 8% in summer and 14% in winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell the House whether it would be 
interesting if we could make sure that, when the lumber 
agreement expires on March 31, 2001, we could go back to free 
trade in the lumber industry, like producers in Quebec and 
Canada would like? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For forestry workers, the best way to get a fair return on their 
contribution to the elimination of the deficit is not only tax 
cuts, but also an employment insurance system that would provide 
them with sufficient income when they are out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the earnings of workers are not very high, it is frequently 
the supplement coming from the employment insurance plan that 
helps make ends meet and financially sustains their family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows, the forest industry has demanded that free trade 
apply unconditionally to everything it has developed during the 
last few years. It is important to understand the problems 
facing the forestry workers and the owners of the logging 
companies throughout Quebec. Forestry is a huge asset for 
Quebec, and going back to the free trade agreement would 
obviously help this industry to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to my colleague's second question, major improvements 
are expected to be made to the employment insurance system, 
because it is the jobs in the forest industry, not the workers, 
that are seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can expect the grace periods to be abolished, the workers to 
be able to hang on to the $32 billion in the EI fund and the 
national program to be based on the needs of the workers in 
every industry, including the forest industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague from Hillsborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I want to thank my fellow citizens in the riding of 
Chicoutimi—Le Fjord who were inspired enough to elect me for 
another mandate, so that I could strive to serve them 
efficiently. They can be assured that I will do everything I 
possibly can to show them that they did the right thing in 
supporting me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see on my jacket, my first priority is still the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area. Before making my comments on the 
Speech from the Throne, I want to say that I listened to what 
some of my colleagues in the Bloc and in other parties had to 
say. They are always talking about the Canada-Quebec dynamics, 
Canada versus the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I was reading the book written by Mr. John Ralston Saul 
where he was wondering if the problem of Canada is not related to 
the fact that the wealth is not shared equally within the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our regional university, an economist, not from 
London but from the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, who 
proved, supported by figures, that our region was highly 
disadvantaged by Quebec government that was extremely 
centralizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought that I should make an analysis to see where the 
problem lies as far as the sharing of wealth is concerned. I have 
the figures here. The federal government is sharing the wealth 
with every province, a given amount per capita. The unemployment 
rate and the wealth index are also thrown into the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major programs. There is equalization, a lump sum 
payment that provinces can do what they want with, and there is 
the Canada health and social transfer, for health and social 
programs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in Quebec is that our regions are in a very 
precarious situation. We are looking at ways to keep our young 
people in our regions and we are seeking the best method to stop 
the migration of our young people. Yesterday, I asked the member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière if he could tell me about the 
measures needed to stop the migration of these young people and 
to offer them interesting jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I sometimes am under the impression, that the 
members of the Bloc want all Canadians 
to be on EI. I do not think this is the thing to do. The bill 
was introduced. It will then be referred to a parliamentary 
committee. Some interesting amendments will be made. 
Significant changes have already been made. I am confident that 
in the end the EI bill will please everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered how I could continue to help my region. I thought 
we should analyze the areas where the government wanted to 
invest. Health care is a major issue, especially in the regions 
where the average age is increasing because of the incredible 
migration of young people. Consequently, we must invest in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is aware of what happened in our regional hospitals. 
The doctors and the nurses were pushed into early retirement 
with huge cash outs. Friends and colleagues of mine told me this 
“How can someone stay on with an offer like that?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we are in an extremely difficult situation. With regard 
to the health care budget, it is all fine and well to transfer $21,5 
billion to the provinces. However, this is a provincial 
jurisdiction and a Quebec jurisdiction, and I for one want to 
make sure that our regions are in a position to provide health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, and this is a proven fact for the past 10 to 15 
years, we need about $75 million more each year. The Canada 
social transfer and equalization payments will go from $11.5 
billion or $12 billion in 1994-95 to more than $14 billion in 
2004. There is certainly a management problem. The provincial 
government does not pay attention to the regions. The current 
Quebec government is a centralizing government which 
arbitrarily is using equalization payments to build a $900 
million hospital in Montreal while letting the hospital in 
Chicoutimi die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an hon. member from the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, I think 
that when the amount of transfer funds are negotiated, it is 
important to ask our government to make sure that regions are 
well represented and have what they need to fulfil their role, 
particularly in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noticed that the throne speech insisted on the importance 
of skills. The federal government talked about literacy and the 
need to reach agreement with the provinces. One third of the 
Canadian population has a literacy problem. That has a tremendous 
cost for business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government insists a lot on research and development. During 
the last parliament, I was in the opposition and I worked on a 
very major project for my region, a major aluminum plant. 
We actually produce 50% of all the aluminum in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has been done yet in terms of processing. We lost 8,000 
jobs in the aluminum industry. With the help of my colleagues 
with whom I now sit, particularly the Minister of National 
Revenue, we will be building next spring a national research 
centre for the processing of aluminum that will allow us to 
create good jobs for our young people. The issue of aluminum is 
of critical importance to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the forest issue. Natural resource areas such as 
ours are there strictly to be developed. No one is helping us 
with our development. The first aluminum processing plant, partly 
financed by the Quebec government via the SGF was built in the 
Montreal area. 
We lost 8,000 jobs in our community, even if we were named the 
aluminum valley last year. It must not become a valley of 
tears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. 
It is the issue of infrastructures. A region cannot develop 
itself without a highway infrastructure (The Europeans, the 
Americans understood that). This is a major element. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years, the federal government has formed 
partnerships with the private sector. I hope the Quebec 
government will take advantage of these programs in order to 
help our region to be connected to the North American continent 
and to the beautiful greater Quebec City area by a highway 
between Quebec City and Chicoutimi. This does not involve 
billions of dollars, but it is important. Land communications 
are the precursors to development, they do not follow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all the industrial development support programs, through 
Economic Development Canada, as well as research programs which 
I hope will be increasingly set up in the regions. 
The guidelines the government wants to set for itself are 
promising for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole aspect of poverty.  I would need more time to 
speak about it, but I will come back to it.  I think that one 
day the federal and provincial governments will have to look 
carefully at a method to combat poverty effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has created good programs, such as the child tax 
benefit, worth over $9 billion.  There is the early childhood 
support program worth over $2 billion.  There is the whole 
business of more progressive taxation over the next five years. 
One hundred billion dollars less in income tax to pay will 
benefit everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a difficult issue to define. 
The European economic community and a number of other countries 
are currently looking into the following possibility. Rather 
than increasing the number of programs, consolidating federal 
and provincial assistance programs, or within a federation such as 
that of Europe, to fight poverty effectively with a 
single program, there could be guaranteed minimum income. It 
would be easier to manage and easier for recipients to identify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain that, in addition to the program's being more 
effective, everyone would be content to know that, as Canadians 
over 18 years of age, they have something to get them started in 
life. I hope that one day a future agenda will include the 
important item of giving thorough consideration to the battle 
against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1967 the American government pointed out that this was 
probably an approach worth considering.  Unfortunately, there 
was no follow-up. The Macdonald commission examined this 
aspect.  It considered it a positive avenue.  One day we will

am stunned by the speech of the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member changed sides in the House of Commons, his 
views have also changed drastically. Part of his speech dealt 
with health and was to the effect that the reason there are 
problems in Quebec is because the Quebec government is too 
centralizing. This takes the cake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Toronto MPs applauded him. He delivered a speech that 
got applause from Ontario MPs. Mr. Speaker, I hope your 
constituents are listening, because I am going to remind the 
hon. member of some of the statements he made here barely a year 
ago.

the provocation carried on for the past 30 years by the leaders 
of the Liberal Party of Canada”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That comment was made on November 29, 1999. On March 20, 2000,

both sides of his mouth in the House, make completely 
contradictory statements and, above all, blame a government for 
something that does not come under its jurisdiction. It is the 
federal government that is to blame, not the provincial 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I have made speeches and the 
Bloc members should quote them all. I will continue to stand up 
for my region. Since I made my speeches, tax cuts in the order 
of $100 billion have been announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the Quebec government, a study by Dr. Moussaly revealed 
that Quebec is siphoning $300 million in my region. All the 
multinationals, all the tax measures which favour the Quebec 
government, all that never comes back to our region but goes to 
the greater Montreal region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to talk about the last election, I can 
tell him that I defended my fellow citizens of Chicoutimi—Le 
Fjord against the whole PQ government. 
Still, we succeeded in defeating them because it is important to 
have people in this House to fight for research, for the park 
highway, so that the regions are taken into account by the 
Canadian government as much as possible, whenever possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 20 of last year, we received $52 million to create a 
research centre for aluminium manufacturing. This is a good 
thing and we did not wait for the Quebec government because it 
would have taken another five years to reach an agreement.

the member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to hear the Bloc people talk about Toronto and 
other things.  They conveniently forget that Mr. Bouchard 
squirrelled away close to $1 billion of health money in a Toronto 
bank, money that was earmarked for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask that great Quebecer and great Canadian, the member 
for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, if he would explain to us the kind of 
good work the federal government is doing with respect to 
eradicating poverty, not only in Quebec but across Canada. I 
would like to hear his views because I know he is a very eloquent 
and passionate Quebecer and Canadian. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am first and foremost a 
regionalist and I find myself somewhat in agreement with <I>La 
Presse</I>'s Lysiane Gagnon, who says that Bloc Quebecois members 
are on a picnic here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of an election, Bloc Quebecois members are 
pretending to defend Quebec's interests.  Let us begin by 
defending the interests of our region, which needs help badly. 
The Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region generates an extra $300 million 
annually for Quebec, because of the multinationals that exploit 
us but do not leave us with any jobs to show for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we had jobs from exploiting our resources, we kept 
quiet.  But now natural resources are being exploited in a big 
way and jobs are disappearing.  Quebec is therefore benefiting. 
We have the figures to prove it. 
I invite Bloc Quebecois members to read the latest study by 
Dr. Moussaly and they will see what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take this opportunity to thank the voters of 
Hillsborough for their confidence in my candidacy.  It is an 
honour and a privilege to serve in the House of Commons. I am 
grateful to have been given this opportunity.  My pledge to each 
of them is simple:  to work hard, to represent the district to 
the best of my ability and to be guided by the values of the 
people of Hillsborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I must tell you that I am enjoying the view from 
this side of the House.  When I left my previous place of 
employment, my associates gave me a present.  They gave me a set 
of binoculars.  They told me that where I was going in the House 
I would not be able to see either you or the chair without these 
binoculars.  I am pleased to report that my view from this chair 
is excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time I want to pay tribute to my predecessor in 
Hillsborough, Mr. George Proud.  Mr. Proud served the 
constituents of Hillsborough with dedication and distinction 
during the last three parliaments of the House.  George Proud was 
a hard worker, was committed to the people of Hillsborough and 
always maintained a very close contact with the common person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Hillsborough is comprised of the city of 
Charlottetown and a portion of the town of Stratford. 
Charlottetown is a very historic location, especially as it 
relates to this country and this very institution.  It was there 
in 1864 that delegates from Upper and Lower Canada and from the 
colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 
met for the purpose of exploring the possibility of forming a 
union which eventually led to this federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament, it would assist us to reflect on the 
challenges and obstacles that faced those delegates who met in 
Charlottetown in September 1864.  The obstacles were immense: 
cultural differences, historical differences, language 
differences, differences in trading patterns and religious 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those delegates faced what in today's parlance would be 
considered insurmountable obstacles.  However, they had one 
overreaching objective:  to form a country, a country that would 
be greater than the sum of its parts.  That was exactly what they 
did, and that is why we are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated previously, the view from this seat is excellent. 
It is through this vantage point that I can report to the people 
of Canada that the government is doing a good job, not only here 
in the House of Commons but also in administering the affairs of 
the nation.  By following sound economic principles and 
implementing a balanced approach, an annual deficit of $42.1 
billion has now been eliminated and replaced by a surplus of 
$12.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced approach includes paying down the debt and cutting 
taxes fairly.  It includes investing in health care, research and 
innovation.  It includes investing in families and children.  It 
includes protecting the environment.  This balanced approach is 
the reason why the Canadian people gave the government a third 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme throughout the Speech from the Throne that impresses 
me the most, as a first time member of the House, is that of 
inclusion.  Any time a country, such as Canada, experiences 
economic growth both social and economic inequities arise. 
This occurred during the industrial revolution and, to a lesser 
extent, has occurred in western economies that have experienced 
economic growth mainly brought about by the increased use of 
technology.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic and social inequities, if allowed to persist, are 
counterproductive to further economic growth and will eventually 
lead to social unrest.  We cannot separate social and economic 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne establishes an agenda that will 
widen the social and economic circle of the country.  It includes 
programs to improve the lives of the poor, especially poor 
families with children, our aboriginal communities, the disabled, 
people who have a lack of skills or training and people who are 
illiterate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest challenges facing the government is the 
issue of child poverty.  In the throne speech, the government has 
announced initiatives which, taken with commitments already 
announced, will provide children with a good foundation so that 
every child has a good start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the commitments already announced by the government 
include:  spending $2.2 billion over the next five years for 
early childhood education; the doubling of maternity and parental 
benefits available under the employment insurance legislation; 
the doubling of the child tax credit; and the lowering of income 
taxes for lower and middle income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see in the throne speech that the government 
will continue to expand on these initiatives.  It has committed 
to implement new measures to help single parents overcome poverty 
and become more self-sufficient.  It has committed to work with 
the provinces to modernize the laws relating to child support, 
access and custody.  It has committed to take steps to enable 
parents to provide care for gravely ill children.  Perhaps most 
important, it has committed to provide further income tax relief 
directed primarily at lower and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another challenge facing the administration is the conditions 
found in our aboriginal communities.  Too many aboriginal 
Canadians continue to live in poverty, without adequate housing, 
health, education or job opportunities.  I am pleased to see in 
the throne speech that the government has made it a priority to 
ensure that the basic needs of aboriginals for jobs, health care, 
education, housing and infrastructure are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken a number of initiatives, including 
commitments for aboriginal post-secondary education and the 
creation of the aboriginal heads start program.  There are a 
number of initiatives outlined in the throne speech that take 
these commitments a step further.  A lot remains to be done but I 
believe the agenda is the correct one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third group that the throne speech reaches out to is those 
Canadians who do not have the necessary skills or training to 
compete in today's marketplace.  The throne speech calls for a 
renewed effort in building a skilled workforce and the 
establishment of a national literacy initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the House, I am pleased that our government has 
come forward with this agenda.   The focus has shifted from 
economic survival to economic and social renewal.

congratulate the hon. member on his excellent maiden speech.  It 
is a pleasure to have the hon. member from Atlantic Canada and 
the great province of Prince Edward Island here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enjoyed the member's speech.  He covered a wide range of 
important topics on the government's agenda and on the past 
performance of the government.  He touched on important problems 
and issues that are of concern across the country.  They are 
certainly of concern in his riding as they are in mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to comment on one part of the government's 
plans, the area of innovation?  Would he tell us what he thinks 
will be the impact of those important efforts in Atlantic Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Shawn Murphy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very excited about 
the steps the government has taken with regard to innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was especially pleased last June in Halifax when the Prime 
Minister announced the Atlantic investment partnership.  It 
called for approximately $300 million to be spent in Atlantic 
Canada on innovative projects, mainly geared toward our 
university research institutions.  I believe that is the right 
path.  It will develop our innovative infrastructure in Atlantic 
Canada and we will see results in the years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too want to congratulate the hon. member for his 
maiden speech.  I remember the first speech I gave in the House 
of Commons.  It is a very nerve-racking experience and can be 
very disconcerting.  The member did an admirable job and I 
commend him.  The only trouble is he is on the wrong side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  He is on your side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  He is on my side but he is with the 
government over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was rather impressed with the way the member dissected the 
Speech from the Throne.  I think he did a pretty fair job of it. 
However, this morning a private member's bill was introduced that 
deals with the custody of children when parents divorce. The 
Speech from the Throne did not really deal with that issue.  I 
know the member cares about that issue because the people in 
Prince Edward Island are very concerned with families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member tell us what his position would be in 
terms of joint custody for children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Shawn Murphy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I am on the same 
side of the House as the learned member.  However, my goal in the 
House is to get to the other side of the House.  If there is 
anyone over there, especially on the front benches, who wants to 
trade with me, I am willing to talk with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the custody of children in cases of divorced or 
separated families, the only principle, and by far the most 
important and significant principle, that has to be taken into 
account in any legislation that comes before us and is passed by 
the House, is that the best interests of the child be taken into 
account.  All other interests are secondary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
also congratulate the member for Hillsborough.  I know he comes 
from a very distinguished career on Prince Edward Island, 
including being on the board of the CDIC, and many other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was curious about his comments with regard to the linkage 
between social and economic policy.  He also cited a few 
examples.  Could develop that theme a little 
further, particularly in the areas of early childhood 
development, health care, drug abuse and other aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Shawn Murphy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
issue.  When we look at the history of nations, any time there 
are disparities or there is economic growth, economic and social 
inequities develop.

social legislation we have.  It is important to bear this in 
mind.  There are inequities in the wage levels in Canada, and 
that is why, in this 37th parliament, we have to bear in mind the 
family, children and the disabled.  We have to widen the circle, 
not only the economic circle but the social circle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak in support of the Liberal Party of 
Canada and its initiatives and plans for Canada on issues that 
are exceptionally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been in power since 1993.  At the time we came 
to power, the economic state of the nation was, to put it mildly, 
a mess.  There was a deficit of over $42 billion and there were 
huge debts.  There was a lack of confidence in the economy as 
well as a lack of confidence in the institutions themselves, 
whether it was parliament or the government itself.  As well, 
there was a high unemployment rate in excess of 10%.  Inflation 
was at an all time high.  Bankruptcies were in the hundreds of 
thousands in almost every single sector of the economy.  The 
international community's confidence in our economy was on shaky 
ground to a large extent.  The picture was not very pretty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada gave us the opportunity and the mandate to 
govern.  This government, in a three step approach, has taken a 
number of initiatives which I will put in a global setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step the Prime Minister and his government took was to 
restore confidence in the institution.  To that extent, the 
government undertook one of the most dynamic and pragmatic 
analysis ever of almost every single program at the national 
level.  In essence, the objective of that analysis was to find 
out in terms of plans or programs what should be in the federal 
domain and what should be in the provincial domain.  A number of 
good things came out of that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Government of Canada decided to let go in excess of 
42,000 public servants, which caused a lot of harm in this 
community and this region.  However, the government did that 
because it felt that it first had to clean its own house and set 
its own affairs in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government brought back confidence on the economic 
front.  To that extent, the government had an exceptionally 
aggressive strategy to encourage trade and to look at every 
single segment of the Canadian economy, the manufacturing sector 
as well as the service sectors and others, in order to figure out 
the things that were necessary to put in place in order to 
support those sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government thus adopted a policy of low interest rates, 
without dictating to the Bank of Canada what should and should 
not be done.  The government also embarked on a major 
infrastructure program, which created hundreds of thousands of 
jobs across the country.  This program was exceptionally popular. 
The federal government provided one-third of the funding, the 
province put in a third and the municipalities put in a third. 
The program generated an economic stimulus across Canada.  It 
created jobs and helped municipalities undertake projects they 
would not otherwise have undertaken.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing for the government to do is to start investing 
in the future, based on the results of the first and second steps 
undertaken by the government.  We have moved from a situation of 
having a $42 billion deficit and a huge debt to a situation 
where, for the first time in a long time, we have a surplus. When 
the government started to generate the surplus we were able, for 
the first time in a long time, to start, at the turn of this 
century, to pay down the national debt.  Our house is in order, 
public trust in the national institutions has increased and is in 
place and the economy is moving forward.  Now that the Liberal 
Party has been elected for the third time, it is time for 
investment.  That brings me to the third point, which to a large 
extent is the Speech from the Throne, which the House of Commons 
is now debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me very proud, first as a Canadian and second as a 
member of the Liberal Party of Canada, to see such a wonderful 
initiative put forward by the Prime Minister and his team.  It 
makes me proud to be a Canadian and proud to be a member of this 
House.  When I heard the Speech from the Throne I felt good and I 
thought, wow, it is really wonderful to be a member of this 
nation, this party and this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will bring about very positive and managed change for 
Canadians over the next few years.  We will see investments 
accelerating in areas that are exceptionally important and close 
to the heart of every Canadian.  One case in point is the 
investment in education and training, in lifelong learning.  The 
ability of a citizen to go back to school with government 
support, regardless of his or her age, is a wonderful thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago the government initiated a $400 maximum 
investment per child for each $2,000 a parent invested in an 
RESP.  That was a wonderful initiative, which will go a long way. 
With a situation like the one we have in Canada, where close to 
25% of people have difficulty reading an application form or 
properly reading, writing or performing a very simple 
mathematical skill, it is high time for government at the 
federal, provincial and municipal levels to take initiatives to 
bring about positive change in the lives of our people.  In 1986 
a business study showed that the cost of illiteracy to the 
economy was in excess of $10 billion annually.  That is the 
direct cost, but the indirect cost of illiteracy to the nation is 
huge, in the tens of billions.  To that extent, it is 
exceptionally important for the Government of Canada to embark on 
a program such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring up this point in order to say that it is only one good 
initiative the government has undertaken.  There are a number of 
other initiatives on which I am sure my colleagues will elaborate 
in their own speeches.  I was delighted, however, to see the 
Government of Canada embarking on this magnificent initiative.  I 
know my constituents in Ottawa Centre will be thrilled to know 
that not only will they now be able to save for their children's 
education and have the government provide them with incentives 
and support, they can also do it for themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his speech today.  He is of course the 
member for Ottawa Centre and Ottawa has experienced tremendous 
economic activity in the last few years.  I wonder if he would 
like to comment on and suggest how other areas of the country 
might try to emulate the success that Ottawa has had, 
particularly in the Kanata area with the high tech sector, and 
whether he would comment on what the innovation plans of the 
government would do to assist in that regard.

people found themselves without jobs.  On top of that, the 
economic situation overall was not that great.

Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your guidance and 
your help this morning.  As well, I acknowledge and thank my 
colleague from New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, who I will be 
splitting my time with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this moment it is important that I express my sincere 
gratitude to the constituents of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, as 
they are the people who are responsible for me being in this 
wonderful House of Commons.  My job as a member of parliament for 
my riding is that of a servant.  I am very proud and humbled that 
they have chosen me to represent them.  The people of 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar put their faith in me and the 
Canadian Alliance Party that I represent.  I know they want to 
see things done differently.  I know they want their voices 
heard.  I will do my very best to make sure that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar is a beautiful 
part of Canada, a large rural riding with an urban component. 
Agriculture is of vital importance to the people of 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, not only in the rural communities 
but also in the city of Saskatoon, where the spinoffs from the 
industry are prominent.  It is very unfortunate that there was 
only a passing mention of Canada's agriculture industry in the 
throne speech.  I find it hard to believe that an industry so 
important to our nation was not given more emphasis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, the government says it will “help 
Canada's agricultural sector move beyond crisis management, 
leading to more genuine diversification and value-added growth, 
new investments and high standards of environmental stewardship 
and food safety”.  I do not believe there are many members in 
the House that know more about agricultural diversification, 
value added growth and new investment in agriculture than I do. 
Perhaps that is why I find the Liberal government's flippant use 
of the words ringing hollow and so without meaning and true 
intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Liberal government, the farming industry has been left 
in dire straits.  Continuing international farm subsidies, thin 
trade negotiations, low commodity prices, government indecision, 
bureaucratic red tape and the gross inefficiency of farm income 
assistance programs have driven farm families across the country 
to desperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, we have diversified.  There is not one 
farm family I know of that has not moved from traditional grains 
to trying oilseeds and pulse crops.  Some have developed 
community based investment options to diversify into seed 
production, seed cleaning or larger livestock operations. Farmers 
are turning grain land to grass and raising traditional 
livestock.  Some are taking on huge debts to convert traditional 
livestock operations to specialty livestock.  Others are 
experimenting with herbs, spices, vegetables and an assortment of 
other products that boggle the mind, anything to try to make ends 
meet and to diversify as their governments keep telling them they 
must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one farmer I know of who relishes the fact that he 
and his wife must work off the farm to keep the farm running. 
There is not one farmer I know of who likes going to farm rallies 
or who likes lobbying the government for help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one farmer I know of who watches sons or daughters 
leave the farm and is not literally heartbroken, just as my 
husband and I were when both our sons, their wives and our 
beautiful granddaughters left our farm and our small community 
for jobs in Regina and Edmonton because they could not make a 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's loose use of catchphrases like diversification 
and value added is very convenient for its speech writers and 
bureaucrats, who cannot in a million years understand the 
situation on Canadian farms right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely why it is so disappointing, discouraging and 
infuriating for farm families to repeatedly be told by government 
that this is what they must do to survive in agriculture today. 
Yes, the agricultural industry is changing quickly, as is any 
other industry affected by our fast paced, technology reliant 
global economy, but do not tell us what we already know.  Help us 
adapt, help us get there and help us continue to be the best food 
producers in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for farmers to move past crisis management, the 
government must seriously and immediately deal with international 
agricultural subsidies.  It has been all talk and no action from 
the Liberal government.  While Canada has reduced agricultural 
subsidies, the American and European governments continue to 
subsidize their farmers at high levels.  It is a simple case of 
competition, and we cannot compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International subsidies are crippling the agricultural industry 
in the country, and while the Liberal government took a tough 
stance to protect Quebec airplane manufacturer Bombardier from 
international subsidies, its stance  to protect Canadian farmers 
against U.S. and European countries has been positively limp and 
lethargic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to believe that the weak mention of agriculture in 
the Speech from the Throne was an oversight by the Liberal 
government.  It is a very sad situation if that is the case. 
However, it may very well be the start of a tough love 
demonstration promoted by the Prime Minister for western 
provinces.  If that is the case, it is a demonstration that 
affects agricultural producers from our nation's eastern shores 
to the coast of British Columbia.  It is an insult to the 
industry that built this country and that has fed our people, an 
industry that has fed the world and that needs our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am committed to working on behalf of the agricultural 
community in my constituency and on behalf of all Canadian 
farmers.  Before my term is up, I intend to make sure that each 
and every member of the House understands the importance of 
agriculture to the economic and social fabric of our country. The 
members of the House will be diversified right up to there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there has been one thing that has become clear to me since my 
decision to seek a position as a member of parliament, it is how 
important family is.  There is nothing more precious to me than 
my own family.  Since the election it has become increasingly 
obvious that my work on behalf of families in my constituency 
will be some of the most important work I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my first few weeks on the job, I was approached by people 
with a variety of concerns:  a woman in a situation of domestic 
violence who was dealing with the justice system; a couple who 
were not getting any answers from the AIDA program; and an 
elderly man who could no longer look after his ailing elderly 
wife in their home.  There were others.  The one thing all these 
people had in common was family, family members who were there 
trying to help them and support them through their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so discouraging about the direction of the Liberal 
government over the last decade, and which continues to appear in 
the direction of this throne speech, is that it continues to put 
politics ahead of family.  Families are forgotten.  It does not 
matter what one considers:  health care, where families cope with 
long surgical waiting lists; a mom who is a nurse and who is 
hardly home because of the tremendous numbers of shifts she 
works; financial issues, as families struggle to pay skyrocketing 
fuel bills; justice; child poverty; and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian families need our attention, especially the members of 
our family who have helped build this country.  I especially look 
forward to spending time with and working for the senior citizens 
of my riding.  They are special people who have contributed so 
much to building our communities, our province and our nation. 
They are our roots.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague 
for her first speech in the House of Commons.  Beyond what she 
said, I also want to compliment her on the tone of what she said, 
because she is speaking as a true representative of her 
community.  I hear an urgency in her voice in regard to what she 
is talking about, which is the plight of her community, 
especially of the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been around the House for long enough to know, and I have 
come to understand that when it comes to big government programs, 
the Liberals cannot manage.  Yesterday we had the minister 
answering some questions in the House of Commons about farm aid. 
Basically he was saying that his hands are tied and that he is 
doing the best he can in spite of a bad situation.  However, he 
did not offer any solutions or any hope of relief for desperate 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we had tractors on the Hill.  That was a sign of 
desperation.  We have an AIDA program and the government says 
that is its answer, but I want to ask my colleague this:  what is 
the practical situation in the kitchens of some of these 
farmhouses across her riding?  Of those who are expecting AIDA to 
help them, what is their situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is desperation at 
our kitchen tables in Saskatchewan.  People need their money.  We 
have people waiting who filed their AIDA forms last September. 
They have been told by the AIDA office that their forms will not 
be looked at—for the first time—until March.  These people need 
their AIDA payments at this moment.  We would like the Liberal 
government to make sure that this is done as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to congratulate the hon. member on her 
maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at agriculture and listen to her comments, we 
see that things are changing rapidly in agriculture.  This year 
alone, some of the input costs have gone through the roof, such 
as fuel, energy and fertilizer costs.  The costs for all of these 
things are going up and will further adversely affect farm 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member, as an active farmer, relate to the House 
and to Canadians some of the difficulties she and her farm family 
are facing due to this increase in expenses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all know about the 
soaring price of natural gas.  This immediately increases the 
cost of fertilizer.  Any farmer who wants to get fertilizer is 
finding it very hard to obtain.  We have fuel dealers who are on 
the verge of bankruptcy because their bills from last year have 
not been paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm families need immediate assistance.  Unless assistance is 
given immediately, we will not have a crop put in this spring. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too would like to congratulate the 
member from Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, and I wish to ask her if 
she has the same theme in her part of the province:  we lost a 
large number of students this year and that has effectively 
closed some of our schools.  The number of young people leaving 
the rural areas is so large that in many areas the traditional 
curling teams and hockey teams are done for, probably forever. 
Is that true in the hon. member's community?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
important issue.  In rural Saskatchewan we have lost basically a 
whole generation of farm families.  They have all moved away, 
either to the city or to another province, because there are no 
jobs available for them in the rural communities.  We find that 
they are having trouble getting into technical schools to further 
their education because the seats are already spoken for.  We are 
losing that whole generation of agricultural people in 
Saskatchewan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Superior North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I bring to your attention today the story of a great 
Canadian, a fine citizen of Thunder Bay and a very good friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charlie Grant was born in Winnipeg in 1918.  His first job was 
selling newspapers to help support his family.  He married his 
childhood sweetheart, Dorothy, in 1943.  They have 5 children and 
12 grandchildren whom they love very deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charlie worked for the CPR and was transferred to Thunder Bay, 
thank goodness, in 1949.  Every award that can be bestowed upon 
Charlie Grant by the city of Thunder Bay has been bestowed upon 
him.  He was a builder of his church and was involved in little 
league baseball, the minor league hockey, Boy Scouts, Red Cross, 
United Way and so on.  He was a teacher at Confederation College. 
When he retired he went into business for himself and now owns 
several travel agencies throughout Ontario.  In his spare time he 
is up at 6 o'clock in the morning and finds his way home some 
time around 10 o'clock in the evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real tribute to him is that like you, Mr. Speaker, in his 
spare time he reads <I>Hansard</I>.  His motto in life is never 
retire.  He is a wonderful person.  I wish him luck.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FOOD FREEDOM DAY

<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is Food Freedom Day, which means that it takes 
only 37 days for Canadians to earn enough money to pay for their 
food supply for an entire year.  I salute the farmers who provide 
Canada with the safest, highest quality and most affordable food 
supply in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I must raise an important point: the increasing gap 
between what consumers pay and the money that actually reaches 
the farmer's pocket.  Do we realize that by January 9 we have 
paid the farmer for a year's worth of food? Nine cents is all 
that a farmer receives from a $1.50 loaf of bread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture industry is the third largest employer in 
Canada.  When it is hurting, all of Canada is hurting.  It 
saddens me to say that the only place there will be starvation 
this year is down on the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have built this country.  Canada must not turn her back 
on them in their time of need.  The government needs to recognize 
these facts and be willing to take some action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, happy 
Food Freedom Day.  It is like Tax Freedom Day except that it 
pertains to food.  It is true that if we put 100% of our income 
toward our basic food requirements, today is the day that we 
would have our bill paid in full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oh happy day, unless one is a farmer.  The portion of this bill 
that is paid to the farmers was paid way back on January 9.  It 
is sad, is it not, that it takes us 37 days to pay our entire 
food bill and only 9 days to pay our farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last week's throne speech the Governor General stated that 
the government would help Canada's agriculture sector move beyond 
crisis management.  I applaud her for that.  I also applaud the 
Prime Minister for promising that the matter of high U.S. 
agricultural subsidies would be the first order of business when 
he meets with the U.S. president this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime our farmers need support that they can take to 
the bank.  I am calling upon every member to support our primary 
producers with a lobby for cash.  Let us make Food Freedom Day a 
celebration for everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is Food Freedom Day in Canada, as the annual food 
bill for consumers is paid in full.  As of today Canadians have 
earned enough money to pay for their entire year's food supply, 
food which is the safest and most affordable in the world.  It 
takes just 37 days for us to pay for our groceries.  That is just 
10% of our personal disposable income.  In France, it is 13%, in 
Germany 15% and in Mexico 33%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers are the most efficient and productive in the world, 
but while those who eat food celebrate today it is astonishing to 
note the date on which farmers get paid for all this food.  It is 
January 9.  It takes only nine days to pay farmers for a year's 
worth of food.  Statistics Canada figures show that a waiter or 
waitress will make more on tips for serving the food than the 
farmer does for producing it in the first place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the auditor general, who states “The short term hiring 
practice shows a lack of long range planning with little regard 
for long range needs.  There is no analysis of labour markets to 
assess trends”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best and brightest are being courted and recruited by the 
private sector while the government pays no attention to filling

</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to the dedication and devotion with which he 
served in the House, working tirelessly for the people of

for what he believed in, at times when it might have been easier 
to go with the flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He fulfilled his role as a parliamentarian on issues that were 
dear to his heart.  His position as Parliamentary Secretary to

work on behalf of small business allowed him to display in the 
House his sharp wit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His love of the outdoors and his support for the rural way of 
life were always evident.  One could feel the pride he felt in 
his grandparents' struggle to establish roots in their chosen

Prime Minister of Canada, was an historical and emotional moment 
for David.

Speaker, today is Food Freedom Day.  Canadians have now earned 
enough money to pay for groceries for an entire year.  It takes 
Canadians 37 days to pay for food for one year, but it takes only 
9 days, to January 9, to pay the farmer for producing that food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers receive a small share of the Canadian food dollar. From 
a loaf of bread that sells for $1.50, the farmer receives only 9 
cents.  From a food basket of $10.50, including chicken, bread, 
vegetables and milk, the farmer receives only 73 cents. The 
farmers, not the large corporations, deserve a greater share of 
the food dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, because of the crisis in agriculture now, the federal 
government needs to put an immediate cash injection in the hands 
of farmers and come up with a long term farm program based on the 
cost of production.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is discouraging to witness new incidents of waste and 
mismanagement crop up hydra-like after older ones have been 
discovered— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New and ongoing mismanagement.  In the red books that we hear

are very diligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the Leader of the Opposition that when we 
came to office in 1993 the federal government was spending 
something like $121 billion on programs every year.  Since that 
time we have reduced the level of spending on programs by 20%. 
After seven years we are not back to the $121 billion.

spending extremely seriously.  Whenever there is an error we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

increased.  So with less money he is creating more problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has some simple advice for the government: 
“Don't waste public money.  Do nothing illegal.  Act 
impartially, honestly and fairly”.  The auditor general goes on 
to say that while these principles may seem self-evident, most of 
us would agree: “don't waste public money.  Do nothing illegal. 
Act honestly”.  Yet he goes on to say they are self-evident and 
not clear enough to have prevented breaches.

latest one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows that Mr. Lemire and Mr. Pepin have been charged with 
fraud and theft in their handling of government grants in the

$600,000 more by using previous federal grants for seed money.

full sanction from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the industry minister has announced that he is 
trying to demand money back from Lemire and Pepin proves that 
there was impropriety with taxpayer dollars.  That is why we sent

negotiating an agreement with a delinquent company.  The first is 
through voluntary disclosure, where the error is admitted before 
it is discovered.  The second is through a decision based on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, <I>La Presse</I> noted this morning that the Minister of

with the law firm of Smiley, Cauchon, which specialized in 
copyright and credit arrangements in the area of film and 
television production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of a concern for transparency, would the minister tell this

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if we are talking about my situation when I was a lawyer, 
have I acted as the lawyer for the company being referred to, 
that is, CINAR?  To the best of my knowledge, I have never been 
CINAR's lawyer, and I know that this has been stated publicly and 
that CINAR was approached on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I imagine that CINAR was approached on this question.  But I, to

and, once again, I do not get involved in the investigations of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr.

forgot part of my question about whether he had acted as the 
lawyer of any of CINAR's subsidiaries, or companies or 
individuals linked to CINAR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, in this particular case, could the minister confirm

The Income Tax Act is clear.  There is a specific section on the

insurance commission has no explanation of how it sets 
contribution rates.  These high rates have helped to increase the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that the bill before the House

<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
clear that the auditor general keeps raising it.  So does the 
public but the government does not deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment insurance surplus has ballooned to a massive 
$30 billion and it continues to grow.  According to HRDC's chief 
actuary, that is twice the reserve that is needed.  The auditor 
general and all Canadians want to know why the EI bank account is 
so fat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister, how fat does the EI account have to become

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that in the House there is a bill that 
specifically deals with the auditor general's recommendation that 
we review the rate setting process.  I again ask the hon. member

the $100,000 grant back from ARC.  Obviously the funds were 
used improperly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Industry tell the House exactly what the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

that had been transferred had not yet been accounted for. The 
department, taking routine measures, sat down with the receiving 
organization and came to an agreement to recover those funds. 
This is the purpose of the audit process when it is done on an 
ongoing basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that $100,000 of grant money was misused by the 
same two men charged in two other cases of fraud and theft.  If 
he will not ask the RCMP to get involved, will the minister table 
a full accounting of this matter with a complete explanation as 
to the improper use of taxpayer funds?  Will he table it in the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given everything we know about salmonella and E.coli and now mad 
cow disease, how can it be that the government has no such 
standards?  Will it immediately introduce a pathogens reduction 
program? 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I confirm to the hon. member and everyone 
in Canada that the explanation of how this system works is being 
given to the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States asks that we use its system of inspection to 
reach a certain point.  It is a different way of getting there. 
If we get there exactly the same way, only we use a different 
track with the Canadian inspection system, I can assure her that 
if a product is not suitable to be exported it will not be 
provided to the domestic food chain either. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the health minister who has ultimate 
responsibility for food safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general showed that the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided not to regularly 
inspect non-federally registered establishments.  We are talking 
about infant formula, unpasteurized juice, peanut butter and 
other products in a sector where about half the recalls in terms 
of food happen and which only gets about 5% of the food safety 
resources of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a violation of the Food and Drugs Act.  The minister is 
in dereliction of duty.  Will he correct this matter immediately? 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I explained to the House before, the 
role of the food inspection system in Canada is to monitor and 
enforce regulations set by the ministry of health.  The ministry 
of health monitors the actions of the Canadian food inspection 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have federally inspected plants.  By the Constitution, we are 
not involved in the inspection of food produced in provincially 
inspected plants.  That is the role of the municipality and the 
provincial governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  Recent 
disclosed information tells us that the Virginia Fontaine clinic 
in Montana received $37 million and is owned by Perry Fontaine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence of highly questionable funding and spending 
practices.  An exorbitant amount of money was approved by Paul 
Cochrane, an assistant deputy minister at health who resigned two 
weeks ago, and whose wife purchased condos at Mont Tremblant on 
behalf of Mr. Fontaine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister explain how his former ADM could authorize 
such an enormous amount of cash with little or no departmental 
scrutiny? 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the transactions referred to by the member are the subject of an 
inquiry, either by the police, by auditors or by both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we are before 
the courts in Manitoba this week to make sure we get access to 
all the documents necessary to understand how public funds were 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member and the House that we will do everything 
possible to trace every one of those public dollars, and if any 
were misspent to recover them on behalf of the public. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it certainly begs the question when did the minister 
first become aware of it and why did he wait so long to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the staggering amount of taxpayer money that has been 
handed out by his department while hospitals across the country 
continue to struggle under his government's cuts, will the 
minister confirm that this matter, if warranted, will be turned 
over to the RCMP?  Will the forensic audit also include an 
inquiry into why his department delayed so long before acting? 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on the question of timing, I can tell the member that some months 
ago when these matters were brought to my attention I directed 
the department to suspend further payments to the centre until 
all questions were answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the RCMP, I can tell the member that the RCMP 
is already very much involved in investigating many of the 
transactions to which he has already referred. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, native people all across the country are looking for 
financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of the Sayisi Dene nation in Manitoba. 
The Virginia Fontaine treatment centre sent its staff on a 
Caribbean cruise.  Guess who went along?  The assistant deputy 
health minister who was wheeling and dealing with the president 
of the treatment centre to buy condos at Mont Tremblant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band council reneged on a $100,000 payment to the Russell 
Funeral Home.  It continues to owe $3 million to Wing 
Construction and band members still do not have decent housing or 
schools for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much evidence does the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development need to initiate a forensic audit on this 
band's books? 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have already talked about some of these issues.  I share the 
member's concern.  I too am troubled by what we see at this 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have undertaken a forensic audit.  In fact we 
have stopped funding the centre, cut off further funds.  We are 
in front of the court to make sure we get access to all the 
documents we need.  I have assured the House, and I do it again, 
that we will do everything possible to trace every public dollar 
that went to that centre, and if any were misused to recover that 
money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is much more than a matter of the health 
department.  This is really under the jurisdiction of the 
minister for aboriginal affairs.  This issue continues to grow 
and grow.  It is just the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately it is 
one of the many cases across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech the government stated that it would support 
first nations communities, implementing more effective and 
transparent administrative policies.  I recently heard the 
minister say “It is time to stop the talk and start the walk”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is serious about walking the walk, will he today order his 
department to initiate a full forensic audit of this band's 
affairs and offer its members and all Canadian taxpayers full 
financial accountability of taxpayer money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome our new critic. 
The first thing he probably should do is get himself a full 
briefing by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he had bothered to take us up on our offer of a full 
briefing, he would already know that the department has put the 
Sayisi Dene under third party management.  The department is 
looking after the books on behalf of the members of that band 
until their financial situation is rectified.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is the position that our government has always advocated. 
However, we must also take into account the fact that the 
Americans have some responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the president very clearly indicated that he was in 
favour of free trade and that one of his main concerns at this 
point was to make sure that the free trade that exists between 
Canada, the United States and Mexico was extended to the other 
countries of the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then pointed out to the president that the principle which he 
was upholding should also apply to softwood lumber.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
Prime Minister tell us whether the American president gave him

exports of softwood lumber, as they did in the past? 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I did not get any such indication. We undertook a dialogue with

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of privilege related to a committee.  I want 
to point out that last March the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs studied a matter dealing with confidentiality 
of the work of legislative counsel.  In fact the matter was 
referred to the committee by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a series of committee meetings, which started on March 
28, 2000, the committee heard from a number of witnesses.  In 
fact, on March 30 two employees in the office of legislative 
counsel, namely Louis-Philipe Côté and Diane McMurray, appeared as 
witnesses before the committee at the request of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making any statements, one of the witnesses asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the committee in a position to offer any safeguards against 
future reprisals for our wish to fully assist the committee in 
its deliberations with respect to the rights and privileges of 
members of Parliament as they relate to solicitor-client 
confidentiality? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an examination of the transcript of that meeting, it is 
clearly evident from the witnesses' testimony that they 
alleged—and I want to emphasize alleged—chastisement and 
harassment for a period of some four years prior to this event 
before the same committee of the House.  In fact, there was an 
harassment complaint laid by them at the committee on March 30, 
2000 which had still not been resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the discussions that ensued among committee 
members regarding the request for the granting of protection, the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, Mr. Chair, I would strongly urge you to give them 
certainly the assurance that they will if they tell the truth, 
which I fully expect they will, there is going to be no backlash 
or effect on their jobs or any sanction or any interference with 
their careers by virtue of coming before this committee— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an examination of the transcript of that meeting, it was 
very clear and evident that the committee had afforded to them 
the protection of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely interesting to note that after their appearance 
these witnesses, as employees of the House, were shuffled.  In 
fact, during early April they were told one would be seconded to 
the Library of Parliament and the other would be seconded to the 
Senate effective April 18.  That was about two and a half weeks 
after they appeared before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of complaints later regarding this.  On 
April 16 it was agreed that the two of them would go on sick 
leave for a short period of time.  On June 9 they offered to 
return and were told no.  They were put on leave with pay, 
notwithstanding their offer to work immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September, with a view to returning to work, the harassment 
charge, which was outstanding, was withdrawn.  Again, they 
requested to return to work.  They were not working, they were 
being paid but they were not allowed to return to work.  It 
appears that they were ready, willing and able to return to work 
but they were being denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, October 13, after approximately four months of not 
working but being paid, and just as the election writ was 
descending, they received individual letters of termination. 
They were fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that the shotgun firing failed to relay or 
specify in any way specifics.  There were no details or 
particulars.  There was nothing but allegations and a push out on 
to the street. 
There was no severance package and no specific reasons.  There 
was just a forced exit out onto the street on the eve of the 
election.

to be given. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is patently clear that this privilege was requested by these 
witnesses.  It is patently clear it was given to these two

cannot, should not and will not tolerate this type of 
interference with witnesses who have appeared before it.

evidence.  I would have to ask who would blame anyone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally and most importantly, I would submit to you, Mr. 
Speaker, the temporal connection between their appearance before 
the committee, their workplace shuffle, the secondment and then 
out the door and their ultimate firing on the eve of the election 
call is far too coincidental to be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I submit that this is a prima facie question of 
privilege and I await your ruling as to whether I can put the 
question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this question 
of privilege.  I am sympathetic to some of the points raised by 
my hon. colleague.  I think many members of the House of Commons 
are asking for increased resources, especially in legal counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that some of the institutional knowledge and the 
historic understanding of how we do business has been lost 
because these very experienced lawyers are not here to serve us 
daily.  Therefore, I understand the need to have increased 
resources in the legal department.  It is something that the 
Board of Internal Economy and members should be concerned about. 
I hope they will continue to raise the issue of how best we can 
serve all members of parliament on both sides of the House who do 
not have access to the government resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the promise in the throne speech that talked 
about increasing research dollars for the library also includes 
legal services to members in a way that helps us to do our jobs 
most effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a problem with raising personnel issues on the 
floor of the House of Commons.  I hope we can come to a speedy 
resolution or even an understanding of all the complexities that 
go into this sort of an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these two employees of the House appeared before the 
standing committee and asked for protection of the House, we did 
not understand that there were outstanding grievances between 
management and the employees about the working conditions and 
different things.  We ended up hearing a kind of a rehash of the 
ongoing problems for which we did not have the background 
knowledge to deal with.  In my opinion, it was not appropriate 
for the standing committee to hear the grievance process.  It is 
not what the union agreement calls for.  We should not handle a 
grievance process, in a public forum, on the floor of a committee 
or on the floor of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals certainly have the right of protection before a 
standing committee when they bring testimony and they should be 
allowed to speak freely.  However, there is a question which 
needs to be asked before their testimony is heard.  If it deals 
with an issue that has proper process in place, as long as the 
process is going ahead, then we should allow the management, the 
union and the representatives to move that forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am sympathetic to many of the concerns raised by the 
member, especially in regard to resources to members in the area 
of legal services, I do not think that we should try to solve it 
on the floor of the House.  I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you 
also take that into consideration in your ruling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say that I am disturbed, to say the least, by the 
matter raised by the hon. member for Sarnia<B>—</B>Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am well aware that, as a member of the House of Commons Board 
of Internal Economy, I am held to a certain degree of 
confidentiality as far as the decisions taken are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my colleague, the House leader of the official 
opposition, has taken care to point out that there were two 
overlapping subjects, if I may say so. First, was the 
administrative problem, a personnel management problem, and on 
top of that, the matter of the appearance of two legislative 
counsels before the procedure and House affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of decisions were taken subsequent to the first 
problem.  I must acknowledge right at the start that the outcome 
described to us here by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton does 
not seem to me to be in line with what the House leader of the 
official opposition calls the standard administrative procedure 
for dealing with a personnel management problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit to being very surprised at the outcome of this 
so-called standard administrative procedure relating to a 
personnel management problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the other overlapping question, immunity of 
committee witnesses, perhaps there is no connection between the 
decision taken on the administrative level and the appearance of 
the two people before the procedure and House affairs committee. 
It must be admitted, however, that there appears to have been a very 
obvious connection between the appearance of the legislative 
counsels before the procedure and House affairs committee and 
what led to the standard administrative procedure, as the 
parliamentary leader of the official opposition called it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I wonder about the very legitimate issues raised 
by the member for Sarnia—Lambton. While parliamentary committees 
may not be the forum or the arena to deal with administrative or 
personnel issues, I must admit, in the defence of the two 
legislative counsels who appeared before the committee and who 
asked for and received the committee's protection, that it was 
not so much because they wanted to do reveal all that they did, 
but because the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs asked them to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it was not prudent on our part to ask the questions that 
we asked. Perhaps we should not, as members of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, have exposed all that. 
But the fact remains we did ask questions and the two 
legislative counsels answered them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, some of the answers provided were disturbing to say the 
least. If we were, and this is in reference to the comments made 
by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton, to accept what happened, 
we would send to these House officials or to public servants who 
may be called to appear before committees the message that, if 
they do their job may be on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may not be any connection, but some will make one. Our 
parliamentary institution would lose if House or departmental 
officials were afraid to appear before our committees to answer 
questions put to them by parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, I agree with the opposition House leader when he 
says that this situation is to be deplored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you know better than anyone that some in this House 
have for a number of years criticized the lack of resources at 
members' disposal to draft motions, bills and amendments.  At the 
end of what appeared to be the conclusion of what my colleague 
the opposition House leader called the usual administrative 
process, it seems that we must assume we have lost, as my 
colleague the leader put it, part of the institutional memory of 
the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be acknowledged that, in recent years, we have lost a 
number of elements of the House's institutional memory.  Be they 
services of the clerks, legal services or legislative counsel, we 
have lost these resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have the means, as an institution, to do away with some of 
these resources?  Mr. Speaker, I put the question to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the question of privilege raised by my colleague from 
Sarnia—Lambton should be considered and given a positive answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit this for your consideration, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am very grateful for the members' interventions 
on this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is 
rising on the same point, and others may rise as well, but I 
wonder if members could direct themselves more to the question of 
whether the privileges of this House or of its members have been 
breached.  That seems to be the issue raised by the hon. member 
for Sarnia—Lambton.  I would appreciate it if members would 
direct their comments more to that point rather than to the 
events that led to the claim. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to follow that direction.  Since this is 
an issue that really strikes at some of the grander issues and 
those that flow from parliamentary privilege that were discussed 
in the context of the committee, there is a tendency to go far 
afield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I think the member from Sarnia—Lambton is speaking 
specifically of two individuals whose careers have been 
sacrificed on the altar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Board of Internal Economy, you 
will recall some of the specifics of this issue, so there is 
little need to delve into its history.  However those individuals 
were given a false sense of security when they testified before 
committee.  This perhaps touches on the larger issue of 
protecting the integrity of witnesses who appear before a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the individuals were there on a personal matter, the 
issue was of great importance to the House as it bore directly 
upon the ability of individuals to draft private members' 
business and partake in matters of a legal nature.  Those 
employees of the House provided a very valuable service, and that 
department provides, I would submit, a crucial service to members 
of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize, Mr. Speaker, that the matter was dealt with at 
committee in the last parliament.  While some would argue that it 
may be administrative and reserved for the Board of Internal 
Economy, I would suggest that a broader issue must be examined 
here.  When House employees are subject to reprisals for 
providing valuable information that may affect them or others, or 
members of the House, it creates an intimidating atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have suggested that we should be looking at whistle blower 
legislation.  Many internal, and some would deem labour, matters 
come before us as members of parliament, members of the board and 
on committees.  We should be concerned about the atmosphere of 
intimidation and the fear that heads will roll.  No one should 
feel that while seeking the truth about a matter, whether a 
personal labour matter or one pertaining to privileges of 
members, that there will be reprisals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is such an air about this matter.  Two 
longstanding public servants, valued members of the legal 
counsel, were dismissed and there does not appear to be a forum 
in which to settle this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, given some of the circumstances here, that this 
should go back to committee.  We should perhaps examine all the 
circumstances and bring all the facts forward because the fear is 
there.  The fear is in the ranks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to employees of parliament as recently as today who are 
embarking on similar exercises and trying to have matters 
addressed.  I will be very frank.  Members of the language staff 
provide services in terms of helping individuals to become 
bilingual.  It is a very important service that is available to 
members.  They are not satisfied, yet there appears to be no 
forum to address their issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that what has happened here was born out of 
frustration.  It was a matter that had festered for some time. We 
must be concerned about the ability to get at the truth and the 
ability to get at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton has raised the issue now. 
The Speaker has the prerogative to delve further into what has 
occurred.  If in your wisdom you deem it appropriate, I suggest 
there are grounds for the matter to go back before committee so 
that there could be a proper resolution.  At the very least 
members and the individuals affected would have peace of mind as 
to what took place so that we might avoid such situations in 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to labour matters and the treatment of employees 
of the House of Commons, we should set a higher standard.  We 
should set a standard for all Canadians to look at as a model. We 
should not be mired or back away from situations that arise 
because of the connotations or the potential personalities that 
are often involved.  We should be very prudent and proactive when 
approaching these matters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
will try to focus on the precise issue of whether or not this is 
a matter of privilege which should be dealt with at this time or 
at your discretion later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is not.  While it is an issue that members have 
commented on and have concerns about, I do not believe it is a 
matter that directly or even indirectly involves the actual 
privileges of members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks more like a matter of employment conditions, 
termination of employment, or issues of that nature.  Those 
generally, I think all members will agree, are taken care of by 
the Board of Internal Economy.  If it is an employment related 
issue, the Board of Internal Economy should see to it.  If it is 
not, it is the circumstances of employees that are at issue and 
not the privileges of members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another perspective.  In the event, Mr. Speaker, that 
you see this as a committee issue involving the protection of 
witnesses at committee, I suggest it is perhaps an issue that 
should be taken up at committee first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the issue has arisen in committee and is one the committee 
would want to look at—perhaps the committee should; I do not 
know—then the matter should be taken up by members at the 
committee.  It should be looked at there first and, if necessary, 
brought back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully suggest that while the issue is of concern and 
while other discussions may be had elsewhere at committee, it is 
not a matter of privilege which the House needs or could or 
should take up at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will withhold my comments with regard to 
congratulating you until a more formal time in terms of a speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to concur with my colleague from Sarnia—Lambton as well 
as with the comments of the House leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  I believe this is a matter that raises the 
issue of the ambit of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the circumstances, although dealt with by a 
committee, may not have had ample hearing from all members of 
parliament who at the time knew a bit more about the situation 
and were concerned that the two individuals, in my view and the 
view of many members of parliament such as those who have drafted 
successful private members' bill, were very capable and able 
individuals that were perhaps too good at their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the narrow question of the dismissal.  I 
believe the House has an obligation to look at the reasons behind 
it.

there can necessarily respond to and replace the effectiveness of 
those two individuals.

Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is February 2001 and we 
have heard from the government, at least in a circular way.  The 
throne speech offered thin gruel of leftovers to a nation starved 
for administrative substance and political inspiration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Liberal backbenchers had the courage to truly speak up for 
their constituents, there would maybe be a New Westminster-like 
springtime in this cold town.  Today, the lawns are green; the 
tug boats ply the mighty Fraser River; and the schoolchildren 
need no mittens as they play in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My former high school teacher, Mr. Morrison McVea, still warms 
to the challenge to remind me that Canada needs participatory 
democracy.  These are concepts that he has talked about since the 
earliest days of his teaching career.  He longs to see the 
realization of his vision of a political springtime for all of 
Canada, which sadly remains frozen in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a springtime of ideas.  We should not be afraid of 
more democracy and accountability.  That is what the Canadian 
Alliance offered in the last election, but too many frozen hearts 
could not feel it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a new Speaker and a renewed government mandate to hang on 
to power, we in Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition will keep trying 
to raise the standards of governance and to do our best to 
require the government to justify itself to the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the way let us pray for a thaw on the government side to 
allow the House to blossom with parliamentary reform and to lift 
the nation out of the grey mediocrity and missed opportunity that 
we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have been privileged to be in the House since 1993 I 
have observed Liberal backbenchers allow the inner few who are 
close to the Prime Minister to stumble along with disjointed 
incrementalism.  I challenge those backbenchers to get some fire 
in the middle, to realize that no laws need to be passed and no 
standing orders need to be changed for the House to come alive. 
All they have to do is gather the courage, empower their 
constituents through them, and simply take charge and live 
democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should refuse to co-operate with the corruption, the 
patronage, the lack of candour and the defending of their club at 
all costs.  Backbenchers should empower themselves and all of 
Canada to give the nation a balanced, credible, citizen's 
initiative process law.  That is what some of my constituents 
want from parliament.  They want and expect higher standards of 
governance.  They deserve to have mechanisms in their hands to 
ensure that it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the government backbench refuses to go along to get 
along, there will be little improvement and the nation will 
remain politically frozen in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians are provoked and resentful of the 
government's poor performance.  They recoil from the political 
expediency of how all federal programs are refracted through a 
prism of regional advantage deliberately designed to shore up 
government support in the marginal constituencies needed to win a 
majority in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why New Westminster residents sent me here to help fix 
it.  However, because there was no change at 24 Sussex Drive, 
sadly many will just continue to pack up and move to the United 
States.  They cannot bear the thought or cost of lost 
opportunity, of another four years of unnecessarily high taxes, 
wasteful programs, billion dollar boondoggles and pork barrel 
politics.  They do not like cheaters, especially the smug 
political cheaters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec thinks itself a nation then British Columbia is an 
alienation for we understand how so few determine so much in 
decision making.  It is not simply that the cabinet drawn from 
the party of most members in the House and the Prime Minister 
have so much unaccountable power, for indeed they do.  The 
tragedy is that too few Canadians take the time or find it worth 
while to get involved in federal governance.  It is for good 
reason. 
They have found that it does not make much difference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada is an amalgam of local riding 
associations, many with just a few hundred members at best.  Of 
them 80,000 are national card carrying members, but only 2% 
attend a so-called national policy meeting as voting delegates 
where the planned script unfolds.  A few thousand put on a show 
for television and elect a leader, who will then rule and not be 
accountable to those delegates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the local candidates for parliament are chosen, they might 
be appointed or perhaps elected by a few hundred delegates or 
less.  Too few Liberal ridings in the run up to the last election 
had full blown secret ballot contests for nominations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the victorious candidate goes to Ottawa because perhaps 
15,000 or 20,000 voters went that way locally for a number of 
reasons.  From the crop of 172 Liberal MPs, the Prime Minister 
approves a list of a small group of MPs to become ministers, who 
will then be run by an even smaller number of perhaps unelected 
operatives close to the Prime Minister.  Even the cabinet has its 
power subgroups, its Treasury Board, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few hundred people or less in Canada dictate the Liberal 
platform, choose the leader, and even fewer run for government. 
Consequently the time to care about our country is not when a 
minister introduces a bill for the dye is cast, especially 
according to the Prime Minister.  The critical time is when a 
party is deciding what it stands for, who its leader will be, and 
what will be the rules for policy development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been admitted many times everywhere that the Liberals 
stand for nothing more than getting power and keeping it.  They 
have hurt Canada for so long in that way.  That malaise must be 
overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians under the Canadian Alliance banner seek to remedy that 
national plight.  We cast the net widely to permit as many 
Canadians as possible to participate in policy development and 
every member in Canada could directly vote for the leader.  We 
are doing it right.  We have the processes and the plans.  We are 
ready to repair the nation.  It all comes together under the 
broad themes of national fairness and the need for wealth 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record shows that the government has failed to make that 
kind of leap forward.  Our national productivity rates and the 
work ethic are not leading the world.  We do not lead in 
technology or science.  The government climate hurts the 
operation of the markets and the velocity of ideas and 
investment.  We are far from the top.  Fortunately we are not at 
the bottom.  We are mediocre.  We are in a daze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's lackluster program remains dreary, and Canada 
could do so much better.  That is what British Columbians said in 
the last election.  That is why the west is not content with 
merely old style Liberal and Conservative governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is there to inspire young people anyway?  What will lift 
them?  We must lift up our eyes and engage global competition 
with a national economic political machine that can fight like an 
army but yet nourish like a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must better protect our natural environment for future 
generations while we more appropriately derive sustenance from 
its diminishing bounty.  Polluters receive unfair subsidies. 
Failing to deal with environmental factors is deficit financing. 
Canada has been there and we must forsake it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The talk around this place is of finding a legacy.  The Prime 
Minister wants to be well thought of historically.  I would 
oblige him, for I could not help myself if he delivered on our 
change the system package of expanding the present boundary 
limits of democracy within the House and for the voter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to empower Canadians democratically by giving them 
responsive parliamentary systems that give MPs the freedom to 
represent their constituents.  We need to build a federation 
based on equality, respect and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close with this observation.  Trudeau's legacy is the charter. 
The next step up is right before us.  Let us have a real 
democratic country.  It is called participatory democracy.  That 
possible legacy is lying right there before us.  Who is 
positioned to pick it up and carry it forward or higher? I say to 
the Prime Minister that Canadians are waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal backbench should find the courage our country needs. 
The Prime Minister should use the gift of power wisely and make 
a legacy for the country, not for himself.  We have enough people 
who think they can tell it like it is.  What we need are more of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
getting tedious to hear yet another Canadian Alliance speaker who 
had no comment on the Speech from the Throne.  I guess it is that 
good.  They suggest that we should speak up on the Speech from 
the Throne.  I would implore him to listen because I for one 
already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day of the Speech from the Throne I released a press 
release in my riding that explained a number of the excellent 
items in the Speech from the Throne.  For the first time in a 
long time a number of issues dealing with social policies were 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech is a great move forward for this country.  It 
is great for my constituents because aboriginal children were 
addressed and emphasized in the speech.  The speech helps those 
in poverty.  It is great for businesses to improve trade 
investment.  It is great for the science community and the new 
knowledge based economy.  It will assist in the movement in 
trade and investment.  It is good for the education system 
because lifelong learning has been addressed.  It is excellent 
for our first nation people because there is support for first 
nation businesses.  It is excellent for the municipalities 
because there is more support for infrastructure, for improving 
water and for improving the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a past president of our literacy association, I was delighted 
to see that literacy was being covered and supported in the 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance should stand up with courage, not us, and 
start to deal with the poor and the disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Madam Speaker, there we have it, a 
typical repetition of the mantra of the Speech from the Throne. I 
was talking about going beyond the banalities of a predictable 
throne speech and empowering Canadians so that they would be 
truly reflected here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have true participatory democracy.  The throne speech 
vaguely alluded to parliamentary reform.  We should continue to 
expand the bounds of democracy and that long tradition of great 
reform bills in England where it had the revolutionary idea of 
actually giving the vote to more citizens.  We eventually gave 
the vote to women, but we continued to expand on those bounds of 
democracy by, believe it or not, giving aboriginal Canadians 
voting rights in 1960. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am talking about is the continuation of that tradition. 
Canadians should be empowered to participate and test what they 
want in a secret ballot box on national issues where a government 
has to be accountable on an ongoing basis to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not follow through on that vision, Canadians will not 
show up on national voting day because they know that they will 
have more of the same thin gruel for a nation that is starving 
for leadership and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been talking about in the House for a long time is 
empowering Canadians and expanding the bounds of democracy, not 
continuing to limit and not having top down control but bottom up 
liberation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for my colleague on his excellent 
presentation.  I certainly agree with everything he has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker from the Liberal side of the House talked 
about the throne speech, about all the wonderful ideas, about 
what they are planning to do and about all the new programs that 
they will implement.  A lot of that is good news for a lot of 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the most practical way of bringing these things about 
is that one presents not only the programs, but a budget and the 
cost to implement them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone across the country has applauded the throne speech. 
Everyone thinks it is wonderful.  However, what we have done is 
given the government a blank cheque to do what it darn well 
pleases.  Canadians are tired of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that what he is talking about fits 
in terms of how we cost out these ideas?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not the most senior 
member of the House but I have experienced at least four throne 
speeches.  I have some experience in listening to the 
generalities and banalities of throne speeches that have come 
from the government since 1993.  There is a disconnection between 
nice sounding phrases and practical, sound and wise management of 
government administration, especially at the street level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard in question period today of how the government cannot 
manage.  Today the auditor general has said again how the 
government cannot manage its money.  We must change the system 
somehow.  Instead of continuing the political rhetoric in the 
nation, we must provide real political power to Canadians through 
the ballot box so that they can drive the agenda and hold the 
government accountable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I want to thank the people of the riding of 
Westmount—Ville-Marie once again for giving me the mandate to 
represent them for the third time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that it is, I think, the title of which I am most 
proud.  I am committed to working relentlessly for the social and 
economic development of that riding, which, through its diversity 
and its vigour, is a true reflection of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few months ago, Canadians from coast to coast went to the 
polls. The result was a clear endorsement of the program set out 
by our government for the future of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent election campaign, we explained to Canadians 
the values that we believe in and for which we stand. Our platform 
was clear and our commitment, unequivocal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians embraced these values, the values of an open and 
receptive government that cares about the quality of life of 
people and communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we begin our third mandate, we will continue to build an even 
stronger and ever more inclusive Canada; a country full of 
opportunities where the quality of life is unparalleled; a 
supportive country that is respected throughout the world and 
cited as an example to show all the things people of various 
origins can do when they are bound together by common values and 
by a firm commitment to the welfare of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our two previous mandates, we were able to lay the foundation 
that will bring prosperity to Canadians. We must now protect what 
we have while continuing to build our future together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new economy, success will come to those who concentrate 
on ingenuity, innovation and education. Canada remains a 
relatively young country within the international community.  It 
is a young, vibrant and energetic country where ideas abound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to encourage our scientists and our businesspeople to be 
daring. The government and the private and voluntary sectors have 
to work in partnership to provide the tools needed so that each 
of their projects can be carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve the quality of life for Canadians, we have to move on 
several fronts. Each and every department and government agency 
has a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Treasury Board Secretariat is no exception to that rule. 
Granted, my department is not well known to the public. More 
often than not, our fellow citizens just have a vague idea of its 
main purpose. But the Treasury Board Secretariat does play a 
crucial role in the government. It ensures sound fiscal 
management, acts as employer for all civil servants and even 
oversees management reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years, we have also assumed increasing 
responsibility regarding some Canada-wide initiatives, like 
government on line and Infrastructure Canada.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss some of these activities in the context 
of the Speech from the Throne.  Infrastructure is one of the most 
concrete and tangible programs we administer.  It is also a 
central part of our strategy for laying the foundation of 
Canada's economy in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all agree that a strong national infrastructure base is 
essential to Canada's competitiveness and long term growth. 
Investing in our infrastructure is a direct investment in 
improving the daily quality of life for citizens across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government set aside $2.65 billion for a new physical 
infrastructure program.  The new program has two components: a 
municipal component that will account for $2 billion and a 
highways component that will account for $600 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few months we have signed agreements for municipal 
infrastructure with all provinces and Yukon.  We have put 
together partnership programs where we share costs and decision 
making and work together to ensure that funding will go where it 
is needed most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements demonstrate the full potential of what can be 
accomplished when federal, provincial and municipal governments 
work together collaboratively for the common good.  When we sat 
down with our partners we made it clear that we wanted to take a 
grassroots approach.  We wanted the municipalities to be at the 
heart of the new program because they were in the best position 
to understand the needs of their communities and establish 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already seeing positive results from our partnerships. 
As part of Infrastructure Canada we have set aside $2.5 million 
for an important national initiative identified by stakeholders 
involved in the construction and upgrading of municipal 
infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with our partners on the production of a national 
guide to sustainable municipal infrastructure.  Municipalities 
have told us that this is something they desperately need.  It is 
a compendium of best practices that will be a source of 
information for municipalities on infrastructure planning, 
construction, maintenance and repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are projecting that the adoption of best practices and 
innovations will save municipalities across the country anywhere 
from $800 million to $1.5 billion a year on infrastructure 
maintenance costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we factor in our $2 billion commitment with that of our 
provincial, territorial, municipal and private sector partners, 
we are looking at an investment total of approximately $6 billion 
over the next five years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another equally important commitment made by the government is 
to help Canadians to fully take advantage of the technological 
revolution. We have reiterated our commitment to put our services 
on line by 2004 so that Canadians can have quick and easy access 
to information and services provided by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better use the technology, we have to make it more accessible 
and available. We have taken major steps to make Canada one of 
the most connected countries in the world. We have also promised 
to continue to help Canadians gain access to the Internet and to 
the world of new possibilities it has created for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an incredible potential for developing programs and 
services which are more open and more people-centered.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our new website is an example of the kind of opportunities 
providing Canadians quicker and easier access to government 
information and services in the language of their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want and deserve efficient, reliable and cost 
effective services from their government. They are also entitled 
to receive services in the official language of their choice, 
whether they are anglophones in Gaspé or francophones in 
Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased about our government's firm and 
reaffirmed commitment to linguistic duality, a value that is 
fundamental to our Canadian identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government firmly believes that the official languages 
policy is a matter of mutual respect and that it shows our 
willingness to use our diversity as a driving force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building on the heritage of its predecessors, the government 
will revive efforts to promote and preserve this precious 
heritage and to allow Canadians of all ages to acquire a better 
knowledge of it, to contribute to it and to benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government intends to develop an action plan in order to 
meet its objectives. Above all, we want our fellow citizens 
across the country to recognize linguistic duality as a value 
that is unique to us and that sets us apart, and to support our 
efforts in a concrete way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see to it that government on line and other developments 
of this kind do not dilute support for both official languages, 
but rather that they result in increased services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work actively to ensure that French has its place on the 
Internet so that the French language and the French culture can 
remain strong within a Canada where linguistic duality is 
considered an asset. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of our initiatives, projects or objectives will be realized 
without the continued hard work and dedication of public service 
employees throughout Canada and abroad.  After all, the best 
intentions and ideas amount to little without the talented and 
professional workforce to translate them into reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is blessed to have an exceptional public service.  The 
Public Service of Canada is a vital institution and the 
government is committed to ensuring its long term health and 
vitality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne was clear.  We will take the 
necessary measures to ensure that the public service is 
innovative, dynamic and reflective of the diversity of the 
country, and that it is able to attract and develop the talent 
needed to serve Canadians in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt that the  government faces some very 
serious challenges.  Demographics are changing and the workforce 
is aging.  Competition for the talent we need to meet future 
challenges is becoming more and more intense.  We are focusing on 
building a more inclusive and supportive environment, a working 
culture where people feel like they can make a meaningful 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are striving to fashion a new, more productive and mutually 
beneficial relationship between unions and management.  We have 
engaged several outside groups such as the Advisory Committee on 
Senior Level Retention and Compensation, the Task Force on the 
Participation of Visible Minorities in the Public Service of 
Canada, and the Task Force on an Inclusive Public Service to 
identify areas where we can and should make improvements to our 
human resources management regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more work remains to be done but I am very confident that 
we have the will, the talent and the energy to effect the 
necessary positive changes.  As President of the Treasury Board I 
have made this a personal commitment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to quickly go over some of the elements of the 
throne speech that are more directly related to my department. I 
want to conclude however by saying that these are only a few 
elements of an ambitious program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have once again put their trust in us, because they 
realize that our balanced approach, and dare I say our Liberal 
approach, has helped us to gingerly step into the 21st century. 
They also realized that in a world of quick technological and 
economic changes, we did not intend to leave anyone behind. We 
firmly believe in equal opportunity, and that is the vision we 
expressed in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Speech from the Throne forces us to provide the people of 
Canada with good government. What does that entail? A government 
with ambitious goals that focuses on results. A government that 
listens to the people. A government that shares the values of the 
people it serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Canadians want and they deserve no less. This is 
exactly want our government intends to do during this new term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank 
the minister for her comments on the throne speech and 
specifically her comments on infrastructure.  I should like to 
ask her about something that is concerning the people in 
Dartmouth and Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harbour solutions project is a major infrastructure project 
to clean up the harbour.  It will cost over $300 million. 
Traditionally such infrastructure programs have been split 
one-third, one-third and one-third municipal, provincial and 
federal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the federal government prepared to provide one-third of the 
cost for the harbour solutions project?  Major environmental 
projects such as this one cannot be funded by a municipality. 
Often municipalities can go nowhere near that kind of funding. 
Where is the infrastructure program now in terms of this 
paramount project for Atlantic Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I said in my 
speech, we have already signed the agreements with all of the 
provinces and Yukon.  It is clear according to the agreements we 
signed that the priority of the program should be on green 
infrastructure.  This is an important element of the program with 
all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear also is that the choices should be made by the 
municipalities.  The municipalities should bring the project to 
the table so that we can study it and decide if a project is 
accepted or not.  They have to decide their priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a limit to the amount of money that each province 
receives.  Even if it is a $6 billion program for the country 
there is a limit.  It is a matter of choice, but I would say that 
the project is eligible according to the infrastructure Canada 
program.

incredible to hear a speech such as this one. I am not used to 
it yet. I heard things such as “firm commitments” and “trust 
us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board was there. She must have 
gone through my riding of Châteauguay on her way to 
Beauharnois—Salaberry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, she promised $357 million to build two bridges as 
well as money for a little piece of highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering why, when the announcement was made only a few 
days before the election, such an important announcement, when 
one knows that the throne speech will be in force for three or 
four years, no mention was made of this important aspect, this 
commitment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about her government's firm commitments and 
said voters should trust the government. But voters in 
Châteauguay and in Beauharnois—Salaberry were also to trust 
comments and promises made by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking the minister is: How can she say that people 
can trust the government? Is she willing to make a commitment 
and say “Yes, these $357 million will be reinvested in bridges 
and in the economic development of the Châteauguay area and the 
Beauharnois—Salaberry riding”? I would like the minister to 
answer my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Madam Speaker, voters trust us so much 
that they reelected us with a huge majority across the country 
and especially in Quebec. We saw how great was the trust of 
voters in every region of Quebec, including Montérégie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very happy that Beauharnois—Salaberry is represented by a 
new member who is going to join the members of this government 
in improving the social and economic development of the south 
shore of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very clear. We had an election platform and we presented 
it to the electorate. As a matter of fact, voters knew more or 
less what to expect. They have seen us govern the country for 
the last seven and a half years. They know this government is 
competent and they know this government is always true to its 
words. It is very clear, we presented our election platform to 
voters. They put their trust in us, and we are undertaking, 
during our mandate, to fulfil the promises we made in our 
platform.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation to an esteemed 
position in the House of Commons.  I wish you all the best in 
your deliberations.  I will be splitting my time with the member 
for Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the voters of Regina—Qu'Appelle for having confidence 
in me and re-electing me as their member of parliament.  This is 
my ninth parliament.  I was first elected in 1968.  Over those 
years I have seen many changes in the House of Commons.  There 
are a couple of general themes that I am really concerned about, 
the themes of democracy and equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the sixties and seventies when there was a tremendous 
move in the country for better social programs and greater 
equality among people.  There was a real fight in the student 
movement and others to have a more democratic society.  I 
remember Pierre Trudeau and the talk about a just society and 
participatory democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word inequality or equality was not even mentioned in the 
throne speech last week. Some 30 years later we find that the gap 
between the rich and the poor, after narrowing in the fifties, 
sixties and throughout the seventies is now starting to widen 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently there was a study of the family by the Vanier Institute 
which showed that the gap between the rich and the poor is now 
widening throughout the decade of the 1990s. That should really 
concern us as a country and as policy makers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to place a couple of very worrying trends on the 
record of the House of Commons in terms of the growing gap 
between the rich and the poor.  If we look at the wealthiest 20% 
of Canadians, in the beginning of the 1990s compared to the 
latter part of the 1990s their share of the national income went 
up from 37% to 39%, an increase of 6.6% of their share of the 
national wealth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the poorest 20% of the Canadian people, their 
share of the national income went down in the nineties.  At the 
beginning of the nineties they had 7.6% of the national income 
and national wealth.  At the end of the nineties they had 7.1% of 
the national income and national wealth.  As we can see, the 
incomes of the wealthy went up while the incomes of the poorest 
went down.  This is a sad commentary on the progress we have made 
as a society as a whole, not just at the federal level but at the 
provincial and municipal levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention a couple of other statistics that are 
interesting.  In 1989, 29,200 households in Canada went bankrupt 
compared to 85,000 in 1997.  This again is growing evidence of 
the widening gap between the rich and poor in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of savings, the household average in 1989 were $6,250. 
In 1998, household savings on average were $1,664.  This 
represents a tremendous drop throughout the decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Vanier Institute, by the end of the 1990s 40% 
of the poorest Canadians spent more than they earned.  The middle 
20% spent all that they earned by the end of the 1990s. If a 
dollar was earned, a dollar was spent.  However, the wealthiest 
40% of the Canadian population had increased savings in the 1990s 
while the average went down radically throughout that decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we see the redistribution of wealth and income 
widening.  It seems to me that the challenge of a parliament in 
any country is to govern on behalf of the common good, to create 
greater conditions for equality and opportunity, and to 
redistribute wealth so that people have a better opportunity to 
pursue what they want in their individual lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example more specific to my riding concerns the farm crisis. 
The grain and oilseed farmers today are facing the biggest crisis 
since the 1930s.  Farm income is dropping.   Between the fall of 
1998 and the fall of 2000, 22,000 prairie farmers left the land. 
However, we have a federal government that provides very little 
assistance to farmers in comparison to what is happening in 
Europe and the United States.  That is another example of the 
widening gap between the rich and poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are homeless and living on the streets.  We have young 
people who are poor.  The Vanier Institute stated that among 
single parent families and the young, the poverty rate was 
increasing while take home pay was decreasing compared to wealthy 
people in Canada.  It is our obligation as members of parliament 
to address those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue I want to address is the issue of democracy. 
Democracy in Canada is in a crisis today.  We have to look at 
electoral democracy, parliamentary democracy and economic 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of electoral democracy, the Prime Minister will soon be 
naming 12 more people to the Senate, a legislative body that is 
not elected, not democratic, not accountable and supported by 
only 5% of Canadians.  Yet, as parliamentarians, we do nothing 
about it.  The time has come to abolish that unelected body and 
bring the purpose of the Senate for checks and balances into a 
reformed House of Commons.  That should be done as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at bringing our democracy into the modern 
world.  We should bring in an element of proportional 
representation, as have other countries in the world with 
populations of more than eight million people, such as the United 
States and India.  Most countries in the world have some element 
of proportional representation that treats all voters as equal. 
This means that a vote is a vote and no vote is wasted.  Those 
are some of the things that have to be done.  If we do not do it 
soon we will have a tremendous crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The turnout in the last election campaign was barely 60% of the 
population.  In 1997 it was 66% of the population.  If we go back 
to the fifties, sixties and earlier seventies, it was closer to 
80% of the population. 
There is no doubt that we are sleepwalking toward a crisis in 
democracy on the electoral side, on the parliamentary side and on 
the economic side.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of parliament, the power of the Prime Minister is much 
too great in our constitution today.  We need stronger committees 
that are more independent.  We need to have fewer confidence 
votes in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of the PMO to make appointments, whether it be the 
Senate, the Supreme Court, the RCMP or every important 
legislative body or important institution, should be thwarted and 
democratized.  Perhaps we should have appointments nominated by 
the Prime Minister but approved or rejected by the relevant 
parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should not have the power to set election 
dates.  There should be a fixed and set election date.  Perhaps 
we should even have a term limitation for the Prime Minister of 
Canada.  These are ideas that many countries around the world 
adopt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to economic democracy, the trade deals today and 
the large transnational corporations are really an assault on 
democracy.  They take away a lot of the political power which 
nation states used to have to make important decisions over the 
lives of individual citizens.  That is an area we have to address 
as we begin a brand new parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, I want on behalf of our caucus to move a 
subamendment. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK259">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by adding, after the word 
“provinces” the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“and further that this House strongly condemns the government 
for its support of the proposed U.S. National Missile Defence 
System as well as undemocratic trade deals such as the WTO, 
NAFTA, and the proposed FTAA that do not ensure respect for human 
rights, labour, and the environment”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it is an assault in democracy by these trade 
deals.  We have lost democratic control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of being for or against trade.  We are all 
for trade.  We are a great trading nation.  In the process of 
doing that let us make sure we reassert some national sovereignty 
and democratic control so that in these trade deals we can have 
minimum standards or a waiver for social programs, for the 
environment and for health.  That is what we should be building. 
Also within those trade deals in the context of transnational 
corporations we should not give away our sovereignty and 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing democratic about some of these large 
transnational corporations that have an economy bigger than these 
nation states.  Wal-Mart has about the 10th or 12th largest 
economy in the world.  That is bigger than nation states.  These 
big transnationals are not run by entrepreneurs or free 
enterprise.  They are run by technocrats and bureaucrats.  They 
are like big icebergs that bump around the world destroying the 
economies of nation states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for people to reassert democratic control when 
it comes to the economy of the world and the economy of our own 
country as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The Chair will take 
the amendment to the amendment under advisement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was struck by a comment that the 
member opposite made in his speech that household bankruptcies 
had more than tripled in the last 10 years according to the 
figures he saw.  I wonder if that seems to correlate with the 
rise of gambling in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last decade the gambling revenues coming from the general 
public started at zero and now account for more than $1 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member opposite consider whether the rise in household 
bankruptcies may be connected with gambling which seems to be 
directed, particularly if we look at the casino in Winnipeg, 
toward the people who have the least to spend and who are 
probably the poorest in our society, and yet these are the ones 
most in jeopardy with the rise in gambling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have never seen a 
study connecting gambling to household bankruptcies but I suspect 
there is probably a correlation there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the number of people who become addicted to the 
practice of gambling, more damaging than casinos, and I am 
familiar with the casino in my home city of Regina, are the VLTs 
that have sprung up like mushrooms all over the country.  The 
VLTs are sort of the crack cocaine of the gambling world.  A lot 
of ordinary folk without much cash can go in and spend a lot of 
money.  They get addicted to that particular practice.  That is 
something we should probably take a look at as a parliament and 
at the provincial jurisdiction as well.  That may be one of the 
factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is or not, the fact of the matter is the gap between 
the rich and the poor is widening instead of narrowing in a 
society that is very wealthy.  As a Canadian that really disturbs 
me.  We have to look at how we can turn that around.  We were 
doing that particularly throughout the sixties but also into the 
seventies with some of the new social programs and changes in the 
tax system.  Now all of a sudden we have gone in the other 
direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, there were very passionate comments made by the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle.  I was very interested in his comments 
with respect to transnationals which are part of his amendment to 
the actual amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in his comments with respect to Wal-Mart.  No 
doubt he is aware that other nations have taken it upon 
themselves to look at dominance by various retailers, 
particularly with respect to the impact on consumers and 
obviously the impact on competition.  In Germany, for instance, 
even though Wal-Mart only had a few per cent of market share it 
was told to drive its prices up so it would not snuff out small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about and the question I want to ask the 
member deals more with the bigger question that he tried to 
illustrate under several points.  He referred to bankruptcy, 
farms, poverty, democracy and the question of wealth in the 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard about a study this morning that almost counteracts and 
countermands the issue of people living in poverty with the 
assumption that for the first time since the 1960s, and certainly 
in this decade, we have seen actual incomes for Canadians rise, 
and there is a necessity now for two people to work in order to 
make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the hon. member looked at this recent study?  How does it 
reflect on the Vanier study with respect to poverty and families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I had a chance to take 
a glance at it.  Indeed the average income of Canadians has 
increased over the decade.  If my understanding is correct, it 
has increased mainly because we now have two people working in a 
family and sometimes three.  It has also increased because people 
have been working extra hours or have an extra or part time job. 
The family income has gone up because of the extra hours that the 
family puts into the workplace.  I am not sure that is the way we 
should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a technological society and innovation we were supposed 
have more leisure time.  I remember these debates about 10 years 
or 15 years ago when technology started to become the thing to 
talk about.  One of the advantages of technology and computers 
was to reduce the time at work and free up more time to pursue 
leisure, arts, sports or whatever one wanted to do.  The fact 
that we have more and more part time jobs and fewer full time 
jobs, and probably fewer jobs in the general sense that are 
unionized and have good benefits and wages, people are generally 
making less per hour and putting in more hours.  At the end they 
make more money but what happens to the quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all things we should look at.  We are beginning a new 
parliament which is really a new phase in the development of our 
country.  It is important that we look at the issues of equality 
and how we close the gap rather than see it widen.  I really mean 
it when I say the issue of democracy is one that is really 
important.  Our electoral and parliamentary system and the 
thwarting of democracy or the assault on democracy by big 
transnational corporations is really quite a thing. 
It is not really a free enterprise thing either.  Free enterprise 
and entrepreneurs believe in the marketplace.  A lot of the big 
corporations are run by technocrats and bureaucrats with little 
sensitivity to anything called a free market or fair market. 
Again, that is a thwarting of democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are sort of fleeting away from our hands.  We have 
to look at ways to return power to the people, empower them and 
make our society and our country more inclusive.  I think that 
can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to do that is to make this place a little less partisan 
through fewer confidence votes and stronger committees, and by 
electing the chairs of committees and letting them have the right 
to timetable things out.  These are not radical moves.  These 
things happen in countries around the world that are advanced 
democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the idea of proportional representation as well. 
The time has come.  We are one of only three countries in the 
world with populations of more than eight million people that 
does not have it.  That would create the situation where all 
votes are equal, no votes are wasted and people would genuinely 
be empowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The Chair has had 
occasion to examine the subamendment proposed by the member from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle and the motion is in order. Debate will 
continue on the subamendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like also take this opportunity to congratulate you on your new 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank all of the members who ran in this 
election, the people who won and those that did not.  It is an 
important place to be and I value the struggle that everyone went 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the people of Dartmouth, Cole 
Harbour, the Prestons, Cherry Brook and Lake Echo who have once 
again returned me to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I should also make a comment with respect to Her 
Excellency the Governor General.  She is doing a most excellent 
job and is a credit to her office and her country.  I would not 
like it to be thought that my comments on her speech reflect 
poorly upon her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third Speech from the Throne which I have witnessed 
since being elected in 1997.  Like the others, I believe the 
speech was long in rhetoric and short on specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use my time to comment on two things which are 
the skepticism created by failed Liberal promises and the lack of 
overall vision to deal with the problems facing us in the years 
to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from Dartmouth.  People in Dartmouth are not usually 
satisfied with good intentions.   They want to know what we are 
going to do.  They are skeptical and, given past Liberal 
performances, they have a right to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A current example of how Liberals created this feeling is the 
so-called home heating rebate, which is now being received by 
some of my constituent.  People were led to believe they would 
get help.  Page 5 of the Liberal platform said “we will provide 
fuel tax rebates of up to $250 per household to help low and 
modest income Canadians cope with the higher costs of fuel prices 
this winter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been delivered instead is a slightly augmented GST tax 
credit which does nothing to rebate anyone.  The cheque is being 
given to people based on their eligibility for the GST tax 
credit, not on their heating cost.  This program also does not go 
to any modest income families because they make too much to 
qualify for the GST rebate.  In short, the program has no bearing 
on the ability of a person to pay his or her heating bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have always believed that tax support for our lowest 
income families has been too low and support an increase to this 
tax credit, calling this a home heating rebate fails every test 
of good public policy or even common sense.  It does not deliver 
what has been promised because there are working families facing 
desperate economic circumstances but receiving none of the 
promised help from the federal or the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a social division being exploited as those with 
high heating costs get no help and many who are getting help do 
not directly pay for their heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This policy is not helping my community get together, it is 
dividing it.  My riding office phone has been ringing off the 
hook.  I sympathize with the callers.  As I said, this kind of 
thing keeps them skeptical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance said that this happened because the 
government was anxious to get the cheques out quickly.  However, 
the timing of the rebate only seemed to allow an announcement 
before the election and then to release the flawed details after 
the election.  I am not convinced by this explanation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians are now on the verge of filing their taxes 
as they do every spring.  If the government were serious about 
actually getting help to those facing huge increases in heating 
costs this winter, it could have used the tax system to help them 
when the mini-budget was announced last fall and people would 
have received rebates when they filed their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, the oil companies, which are reaping record profits 
because of the increased fuel prices, received help on their 
corporate taxes in last fall's budget.  Their cheques, a real 
rebate in the form of reduced corporate taxes, will soon be in 
the mail.  However hard working, modest income families in 
Dartmouth have been left with a promise, not a cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply one example of how the government has made 
choices under the cover of platitudes.  I believe the other 
modest initiatives mentioned in the throne speech will suffer a 
similar but predictable fate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mention of support for employment programs for persons with 
disabilities will probably do nothing for the millions of 
Canadians who have a disability but are currently unable to 
qualify for EI or CPP because of their tenuous relationship to 
the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The building of broadband access does not say how low income 
Canadians will be able to afford this service, let alone buy a 
computer.  It seems predestined to support bigger dot com profits 
before providing support to the people who are not willing to 
line up at community access sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cultural initiatives in the throne speech are likewise 
vague.  While artistic creators still receive no targeted tax 
relief and exist at minimum wage levels, my constituents and I 
remain skeptical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My most important concern is the lack of a real vision of Canada 
in the Speech from the Throne.  Last year we saw the passing of 
the Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau, someone who had a vision for 
Canada.  He could inspire us.  We did not always agree, but we 
always had some respect for him.  He was not ambiguous.  He saw 
our country's problems on the horizon, brought them to our 
attention and offered his opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current throne speech has failed to do that.  There are huge 
problems facing the people with which we have to deal.  Our 
democracy is declining.  Voter turnout is plummeting. Alienation 
is growing in many regions and among our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a wide belief that the powers of this place have been 
subverted to those in the Langevin block.  Above all, there is a 
growing sense that the powers of Canada as a state have been 
subverted to the powers of trading blocks, transnational 
corporations under NAFTA, the WTO and, maybe worse, the proposed 
free trade of the Americas regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech is silent on how to reintegrate young people 
and the disaffected of Quebec or the west into our democracy.  It 
is silent on how to reassert our national sovereignty when 
foreign companies demand our resources at a lower price, demand 
access to our water, and demand an end to public delivery of our 
health services, our education system and our public 
environmental protections.  In my humble way I will be bringing 
forward suggestions on how to give us some protection in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government should limit the concentration of 
ownership in our private media and restore its past support to 
the CBC so that information can flow to citizens as ideas for 
public debate, not just as content dressed up to attract 
advertising dollars.  Any parliamentary package which neglects 
this aspect of our living democracy is flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of any mention of our need for cultural, environmental, 
labour and public service safeguards, while talking about new 
trade agreements including the free trade of the Americas 
initiative which the throne speech so proudly supports, is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government forgotten the humiliation which we suffered 
two years back when we surrendered control over our magazine 
sector because the cultural carve out in the FTA and NAFTA proved 
to be worthless? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the work of the Minister of Canadian Heritage on building a 
separate international agreement on culture already been 
sacrificed to the Americas so the Prime Minister can go bass 
fishing in Texas or host a banquet in Quebec City in April? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the fact that government subsidies to public broadcasters are 
being threatened in Europe under the free trade rules being 
forgotten by officials in the Langevin block, or have they simply 
decided that private media conglomerates should control all 
information for the Canadian public?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a stand saying that we are a rich people with a 
great and vast country and that we will trade fairly with the 
world.  At the same time we must tell our trading partners that 
this country is ours and this parliament should make our laws, 
not some NAFTA trade arbitrator and not a transnational 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech should have made it clear that until we have 
binding protection for our culture, environment, education and 
health care systems, we will not expand our trading agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make it clear to all abroad that only we as members of 
parliament are accountable to our constituents.  We should be 
saying to Canada: let us work together; let us prosper; let us 
defend our country together from the onslaught of corporate 
power; and let us revitalize our democracy together.  That should 
have been the primary vision of the throne speech.  The 
government had the opportunity to give us this vision but it 
declined.  I hope that over the life of this parliament we can 
get the government to change its mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too congratulate you on your appointment.  I think the 
Prime Minister made a very good choice.  I have worked with you 
in the past and I know you will do a very good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly support the throne speech given by the Governor 
General last week.  My question to the hon. member deals with 
rebates that she mentioned she opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I campaigned at the same time as her but in different provinces. 
My riding of Brampton Centre was happy with the rebates.  I do 
not know what is the complaint.  She says that we are giving 
rebates to those who have low incomes and receive the GST rebate. 
We did not hear about a government giving rebates to those with 
high incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she support giving rebates to those with high incomes and 
high taxes?  I do not know what her objection is regarding giving 
rebates to those with low incomes who receive the GST rebate.  I 
am confused.  I do not know which way she will go.  Maybe it 
should be changed again and the rebates given to those with high 
incomes and those who pay high taxes to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe that the $250 
maximum tax rebate being given to people who are eligible for the 
GST tax rebate is a start.  We accept the minister's statement 
that this was a speedy method of getting some money out to 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply do not believe that it went far enough. Many Canadians 
are now facing a 38% increase in fuel bills and have no way on 
earth of paying these increased costs.  The government should 
create a much more substantial support program to help Canadians 
with these home heating fuel costs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for clarifying her position with 
respect to the home heating fuel rebate.  She will remember in 
the last parliament that it took almost three and a half years to 
try to convince everyone in the House that it was the best way to 
provide people with an opportunity to fend off a particularly 
cold winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that oil companies have a tendency to add 20% margins in 
Canada on home heating fuel over and above what the U.S. market 
would allow, I was glad and comforted to hear that the government 
had taken a good first step.  It was validation of the work this 
member of parliament had undertaken for a couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to the member's concern about Canadians being able to 
fend off the high and unusual increases in non-discretionary 
items like heating, would she comment on the level of 
concentration in Canada's energy industry?  That may be at the 
root of her concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would she also comment on the good work done by the Competition 
Bureau in removing the restricting covenant on the Come By Chance 
refinery, which has now permitted the possibility of having yet 
another competitor come in and provide home heating fuel in the 
Atlantic provinces?

comment on that. I am not familiar with that regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have stated that the particular rebate is giving some 
comfort to Canadians, some of the are things that were absent 
from the throne speech would have given much more comfort to 
Canadians. New Democrats are very concerned about a national 
child care program.  We did not see it in the throne speech and 
we will still be fighting for it in the 37th parliament.  It 
would go a long way in buffering the harsh economic climate out 
there.  We need a pharmacare program and a home care program. 
People with disabilities need adequate income support programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech mentioned an increase in training programs for 
persons with disabilities.  It is limited to people who are 
eligible for EI.  Many Canadians with disabilities, up to 70% of 
them, are not in the labour force and not even eligible for EI. 
Many people live in quite a vulnerable state and are totally at 
the mercy of such things as increased heating oil.  That is the 
kind of issue we have to deal with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  I congratulate you and your fellow 
Speakers on your appointments.  The positions that you occupy are 
of paramount importance for decorum in the House.  Some 301 
representatives debate the issues of the day and try to ensure 
that Canada remains one of the best countries in the world in 
which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the electors of Kitchener—Waterloo for the great honour 
they have bestowed upon me by electing me as their representative 
to the Parliament of Canada for the third straight time since 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all the volunteers who assisted candidates of all 
political parties in the last election for involving themselves 
in the democratic process which has resulted in the 37th 
parliament.  The volunteers in Kitchener—Waterloo who assisted 
in my re-election as their representative to the Chamber give a 
deeper meaning to the democratic process for me.  I am certain 
these sentiments are shared by all candidates in the last 
election with respect to the thousands of volunteers across 
Canada who worked on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I were to forget to mention the support of 
my wife Nancy and my daughter Erin who have been my partners on 
this journey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give my first speech in the 37th parliament with a sense of 
humility for the privilege of being a member of the Chamber and 
with a new sense of collegiality and respect for all members who 
are here representing their respective constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I will vigorously debate the points or differences of my 
colleagues based on differences in policy, I hope I will do so 
with respect, in recognition of the fact that we have all been 
sent here by our respective electors as temporary guardians of 
the public trust.  We are here to serve our constituents to the 
best of our abilities and to contribute to building a strong and 
united Canada, a Canada that works for all Canadians from coast 
to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected to the House in 1993 the fiscal 
challenges we faced as a national were most daunting.  We had a 
$42 billion deficit, the highest in the nation's history, coupled 
with an ever increasing national debt in excess of $500 billion. 
These fiscal circumstances threatened the economic sovereignty of 
our country.  Due to the hard work of Canadians and the sound 
fiscal management of the government, the deficit has been 
eliminated and the debt is being paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have put our fiscal house in order, we have been able 
to cut taxes fairly. This will serve us well in meeting present 
economic challenges.  By having effectively addressed our fiscal 
reality we have struck the right balance of investing in health 
care, families and children, investing in protecting the 
environment, and investing in research and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Kitchener—Waterloo is a good example of what is 
entailed in the new economy: innovation, research and 
development, and investing in Canadians through higher education 
and skills training.  The economic profile of my community is 
based upon insurance, education, high tech companies, many medium 
size businesses and the service sector.

Equitable Life, Lutheran Life, Economical Mutual and the Canadian 
headquarters of Manulife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is limited I will focus on the importance of 
post-secondary education, skills training and research and 
development from the perspective of my community.  I want to 
share with the House how education benefits my community at the 
local level and how it contributes to our national economic 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conestoga College, the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid 
Laurier University are all in my riding.  The excellence of our 
post-secondary institutions is well known worldwide.  They are 
the engines of our economic growth.  They provide occupation 
opportunities to Canadians and contribute to the economic output 
at the local, provincial and national levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the visionary pioneers in Kitchener—Waterloo who 
invested their time and effort in starting up our post-secondary 
institutions has resulted in great contributions to and are at 
the core of the community's cultural, social and economic life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the University of Waterloo was started in 1957 in a 
farmer's field, it inspired a book titled <I>Of Mud and 
Dreams</I>.  The university established the first co-operative 
engineering program.  The pioneers who started that co-operative 
program were called heretics, as one did not take a professional 
program like engineering and debase it with a blue collar 
component such as work terms.  Co-operative education, which 
offers an academic term matched by a work term, is now common 
practice throughout Canada and the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its inception, the University of Waterloo has also 
embraced computerization.  It now has the biggest computer and 
mathematics faculties in the world and is world renowned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three post-secondary educational institutions in my riding 
are equipping Canadians with the cutting edge skills and learning 
that they will need to prosper.  This will enable them to realize 
their unique potential and through lifelong learning to succeed 
in the new digital economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's record of supporting achievement in education 
is reflected in our having developed the Canada millennium 
scholarships, the Canada education savings grant, the Canada 
foundation for innovation and increasing the education tax 
credit.  All of these will build upon our goal of having at least 
one million more adults take advantage of learning opportunities 
during the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic spinoffs from our post-secondary institutions are 
found in the association of Canada's Technology Triangle and 
Communitech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall how the Atlas Group, representing the largest 
information technology companies in my community, made its first 
visit to Ottawa in the fall of 1994.  Today the group has evolved 
to over 200 member companies of the technology industry within 
Cambridge, Guelph, Kitchener and Waterloo.  Counted among its 
members are software developers, system integrators, 
telecommunication companies, Internet companies and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Names such as Research in Motion, Open Text, Dalsa, Descartes 
and Mitron are just a few of these companies, and they are world 
renowned 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember visiting the company Research in Motion in Waterloo 
with the Minister of Industry in 1994.  The company had just 40 
employees operating out of rented space.  Since then, it has 
received two Technology Partnership Canada loans totalling less 
than $40 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Research in Motion employs over 1,000 people in high 
paying jobs, owns its facilities, has produced two billionaires 
and hundreds of millionaires in my region.  Its product is the 
blackberry, a wireless e-mail device that many of my colleagues 
in the House now use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister sent his first e-mail on the device, and the 
new Minister of External Affairs was the first cabinet member to 
have one.  The blackberry is the favoured communication tool of 
people such as Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell 
computers and former vice-president Al Gore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research in Motion is a world leader in wireless communications. 
Besides creating a tremendous amount of wealth and providing 
employment opportunities to a large number of people, it has also 
given back to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two former Research in Motion employees, Louise MacCallum and 
Michael Bamstijn, donated $12 million to the community foundation 
in the Waterloo region and $1 million to the Waterloo Regional 
Museum.  This was to celebrate their retirement at the ages of 39 
and 41 respectively.

$10 million from Jim Balsillie and $10 million by Douglas Fregin, 
for a total of $120 million to establish a world class research 
institute for theoretical physics.  It is believed to be the 
largest private donation in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important at the time, much criticism was made of research 
in universities being driven by company priorities.  Here we have 
a record donation made by Research in Motion, with no strings

establishing the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, 
Mike Lazaridis, Jim Balsillie and Douglas Fregin from Research in

post-secondary educational research and development, I am excited 
that we will at least double the current federal investment in 
research and development by 2010.  That will strengthen the 
research capacity of Canadian universities, government 
laboratories and institutions.  I also strongly endorse our 
commitment to ensure access to affordable post-secondary

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, let me say how pleased and proud I am to see you in the 
chair.  I congratulate you and all of your colleagues on their 
appointments.  It is great to see you there.  I have no doubt 
that you will preside with the fairness and wisdom you have 
garnered over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the people of Etobicoke—Lakeshore as I begin my initial 
speech in the House.  In returning me for a third term to the 
House they have placed their confidence in me to represent their 
interests in parliament.  It is my privilege to represent the 
people of this riding.  I can assure them I will do my very best 
to make their concerns heard in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank my family, friends, campaign team, the many 
volunteers and all those who worked so hard to ensure a 
re-election victory.  I say to them and to the House that I am 
indeed very grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to respond to the Speech from the Throne, to take 
this opportunity to speak at the beginning of the 37th 
parliament.  I will focus my remarks on the theme of creating 
opportunities for Canadians, as this is central to the Liberal 
government's plan for building a progressive and dynamic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few words about my riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore. 
Situated in proximity to Lake Ontario, my riding is as diverse as 
Canada itself.  It is the southernmost of three federal ridings 
in what was formerly the city of Etobicoke.  Over 360 small and 
medium size businesses in Etobicoke—Lakeshore cut across the 
manufacturing, retail trade and business service sectors of the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne gives me the opportunity to assure 
the people of my riding that they can count on the government to 
create a brighter future, a Canada that will have an even 
stronger economy in this century, a Canada in which every 
Canadian will have a higher quality of life, a Canada in which 
all Canadians will have the opportunity to harness their skills 
and talents.  This is the Canada the constituents of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore envision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges and the pace of the new global economy put a high 
value on knowledge, research and innovation.  The member who 
spoke prior to me brought to the fore the research and innovative 
things in his riding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot afford to be unprepared to meet the challenges of 
the new economy and of the future.  We must ensure that the doors 
of the new economy are open to all Canadians.  We must continue 
in our efforts to ensure their talents, ideas and skills are 
utilized in building our country in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throne speech 2001 outlines the next steps in the government's 
moderate, balanced plan to create opportunity for all Canadians 
in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will make good on its commitment to make 
education accessible to my constituents and to all Canadians.  It 
is important to the government that no man, woman or child is 
left behind as we move forward in building economic prosperity 
and sharing opportunities.  That is why we continue to promote 
skills and learning as part of our plan to create opportunities 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent many years in education and can say that skills and 
learning are essential, especially to our young people. Equipping 
Canadians with marketable, cutting edge skills will ensure they 
have the tools to prosper and to realize their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reassuring to many young people in my riding.  They will 
not be caught in the never ending cycle of no skills no jobs, no 
jobs no skills.  The government will continue to help young 
Canadians contribute to their country, gain employment and apply 
their business and creative skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a skilled labour market is not an easy task, which I 
think the government realizes.  We know that many Canadians have 
difficulties finding the resources to commit to learning and 
skills upgrading.  We know that youth at risk are more vulnerable 
to being left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to skills and learning in the 2001 
throne speech will meet these challenges.  As the Prime Minister 
indicated, the government wants to help at least one million more 
Canadian adults take advantage of learning opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, the government outlined in the throne speech that 
it would create registered individual learning accounts to assist 
Canadians to finance their learning needs, to improve loans 
available to part time students and to help workers learn while 
they earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work in partnership with the provinces, the private 
sector and voluntary organizations to ensure that young people 
who are at risk, who need help staying in school or getting their 
first job, will receive that support.  We will work to ensure 
that persons with disabilities and aboriginal Canadians are able 
to realize their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are laudable goals, but I want to address the issues of 
one group at this point.  I am referring to immigrants who have 
contributed to our economy and our quality of life since the 
formation of Canada.  Every year Canada receives newcomers.  They 
are eager to put their skills and talents to work in our economy. 
Like so many other Canadians, they want to participate fully in 
the various sectors of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford to have highly skilled, well educated 
immigrants languish on the margins of Canadian society.  We 
cannot afford to watch them toil away at dead end jobs, 
especially when they could put their skills to use for the 
betterment of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Etobicoke—Lakeshore many well trained, highly skilled new 
Canadians are not realizing their full potential.  Some come from 
various parts of Europe and Africa with degrees as lawyers, 
doctors and engineers, to name a few.  They come with the hope 
and dream of continuing to practise their professions and to 
create a better life for themselves and their families.  Sadly 
they are often disappointed when they learn their foreign 
credentials are not recognized in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that the Speech from the Throne addressed that 
issue.  I will work, and I am sure you will work with me, Madam 
Speaker, as will all members of the House, to ensure that we find 
a way of working with the provinces and with the various authorities 
to ensure that Canadians' experience and credentials and 
those requested of newcomers will in some way be recognized as 
well as the credentials of 
those individuals.  I thank the government for that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to address the issue of the high speed broadband 
Internet access, which will be available to the residents and the 
businesses in Etobicoke—Lakeshore by the year 2004.  My 
colleague, the member for Winnipeg South, who has some expertise 
in that area, spoke to that this morning.  This issue has some 
resonance for the businesses in my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the government again on that part of the speech 
that addresses the issue and that would put us in that forward 
global economy and provide the kinds of experiences Canadians 
will have as we build the kind of society in which young people, 
those at risk, new immigrants and newcomers to our society, each 
and every one of us, will have the opportunity to grow, develop, 
build and have a country that will continue to be one of the 
countries in the world that is admired by all.

pleasure it is to have you in the chair.  Congratulations on your 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the hon. member's comments on the throne speech, I 
must preface my remarks by saying that I highly value the 
contribution the member has brought to the House of Commons, but 
earlier we heard from one of the members on the backbenches of 
the Liberal side who gave us a great discussion about the crisis 
in our farm industry.  Right now we have a grave situation facing 
our family farmers throughout the country.  It is the same 
situation that is facing our family fishermen.  I would like the 
hon. member to address why the throne speech was so silent on 
those very important issues which face so many rural Canadians in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have admiration for 
the member and his concern for the issue of farmers and farming 
and the situation of subsidies and the comparative nature of our 
agricultural base as we look at what is happening in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know and have sat with so many of the farmers who have come to 
my constituency.  Although we are in an urban area, the issue 
that is of concern to them is an issue of concern to all of us as 
Canadians.  As legislators I think we have to do everything 
possible to assure the farmers who provide food and sustenance to 
our entire country that we support all of their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult at this time to begin to discuss the issue of 
subsidies, of what we need to do and how we need to do this, but 
I think a good scrutiny of the Speech from the Throne will also 
show that the words are there that do address themselves to the 
issue of agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech debate today, let me touch briefly, if I 
may, on three very important points as they affect the province 
of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last parliament I spoke repeatedly about the 
devastating effect that cuts to the federal transfers for health 
and post-secondary education were having on the smaller provinces 
in Canada, but especially on the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  For many Canadians, those transfers have been restored 
to early nineties levels with the new agreement on health and 
post secondary education.  However, in the case of Newfoundland 
and Labrador, we will not return to nineties levels until the 
year 2006.  That is having a very devastating effect on poorer 
provinces.  It is having a devastating effect on the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  That is one issue that I hope the 
regional minister for Newfoundland will be able to address.  He 
is a very good friend of the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister, so I know that he will be quite happy to deal with this 
particular item when it comes across his desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, when he was premier of Newfoundland just a 
short time ago, he described the agreement that the federal 
government signed with the provinces as being no bonanza for the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador.  He pointed out that the 
funding formula was done on a per capita basis.  When the 
population is declining like it is in Newfoundland and Labrador 
and when health care is funded on a per capita basis, that is 
bound to have a detrimental affect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old EPF funding formula in place prior to the CHST always 
had in place an equalization component that could be used for 
areas with small populations.  The equalization formula in the 
old EPF scheme of things also took into account geographic 
differences.  For instance, the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador has hundreds of smaller communities scattered along 
thousands of miles of coastline.  The old EPF formula ensured 
that an equalization component was built in so that it could take 
into account the geographic differences we have.  We do not see 
that today in the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second item I want to have a word on is an important item, an 
environmental problem currently being experienced in my riding in 
St. John's.  It has to do with the cleanup of St. John's Harbour. 
This is an issue that is not only a very important environmental 
issue but an issue that came to the fore in the recent election 
campaign and I would be remiss if I did not say a few words about 
it.  It is a matter I raised in the House on a number of 
different occasions in the last parliament and is an issue that I 
raised on a number of different occasions in the media.  Of 
course in November it became an election issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the regional minister for the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, who is the present Minister of 
Industry, make the statement that he would be working very hard 
with the Prime Minister and with the Minister of Finance, who is 
a very close friend of the regional minister, to secure funding 
for the St. John's Harbour cleanup. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only a $100 million project, and the province has 
committed its $30 million.  The city of St. John's, Mount Pearl, 
and the surrounding area, Paradise, have committed their $30 
million.  The only holdout in this whole funding problem is the 
federal government.  I note that the federal government made 
available, just before the election campaign, $1.5 billion for 
the cleanup of Toronto Harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of us would begrudge Toronto its right to have its harbour 
beautified and what have you, but I would ask for similar 
treatment to be given to the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador in the area of harbour cleanup, a very important 
environmental issue that needs a measly $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the federal government had no problem coming up with 
$2 billion a couple of days ago for Bombardier.  Again, we do not 
begrudge Quebec or any other province their windfalls, but surely 
an environmental problem of this proportion needs to be looked at 
very closely by the federal government.  Hopefully the regional 
minister can get together with his good friend, the Minister of 
Finance, and have this problem looked after immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other subject that is very close to the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador is the current equalization formula 
that we happen to be under.  The Canadian equalization system is 
a really good system.  It will keep us from drowning but it falls 
far short of helping us swim by ourselves.  This is where the 
equalization formula, in the way it is drafted right now, fails 
the poorer provinces that have to be recipients of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me elaborate a little.  Under the current equalization 
formula, new resource revenues raised by the provincial treasury 
are clawed back dollar for dollar by the federal government. That 
is not a very good way of doing business.  A province is trying 
to develop resources, but for every dollar in resource revenue 
taken in by the province the federal government comes along and 
takes a dollar back.  There are not too many incentives built 
into that kind of system for any province that wants to develop 
its resources in the manner it wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very encouraged by the fact that today we have the premier 
of Nova Scotia, Mr. Hamm, in town to talk about the current 
equalization formula.  Hopefully he will put forth a series of 
recommendations to help rejig or retool the formula we have at 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland we had the Hibernia project, developed just 
recently.  We were able to do a deal with the federal government 
in which the federal government said it would take back 70 cents 
instead of a dollar, thus allowing the province to develop the 
resource base a little more and to keep some of the revenues 
associated with that.  On top of that, the federal government 
came up with a $1 billion loan guarantee and a $1.5 billion 
grant.  In spite of that, it was able to say that we needed some 
kind of a better deal as it pertained to the Hibernia 
development.  Of course that was done by the federal PC 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had virtually no recognition from the federal government 
since that time that the equalization formula should be retooled 
and rejigged to help provinces like Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba.  Only at the point when we have a new deal on 
equalization for Newfoundland and Labrador will we be able to 
rise above a beggar.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to note that the zone guarantee was not 
moneys that were directed toward Bombardier as loan guarantees. 
My hon. colleague knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to what the he had to say.  We have 
agreements to help less productive provinces, which basically is 
the member's point today?  How would the member respond to Mr. 
Klein's accusations that too much money is coming out of Alberta, 
that it is not getting its fair share and that Atlantic Canada is 
getting a tremendous amount?  There seems to be a different 
philosophy in the member's party from one area of the country to 
the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is great if one 
happens to live in a very affluent province.  Alberta is rapidly 
becoming a very affluent province and probably already is.  It 
has its own set of problems to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada constantly gets criticized for the kinds of 
regional programs it has to prop up its economy.  The Liberals, 
the Alliance and other parties criticize the kinds of regional 
development programs there.  They say that they do not work and 
that we have to do something new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in the year 2001.  The have not provinces, the 
provinces that are the recipients of equalization payments, want 
to be net contributors to this country.  The only way they can do 
that is to have some kind of an incentive to develop these 
resources.  The only way to do that is to retool and rejig the 
equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some recognition.  When the Minister of Finance 
came to Newfoundland during the byelection campaign in St. John's 
West, he made some very good comments about equalization. He said 
it was time to have a look at it and see what could be done to 
help out the poorer provinces.  A couple of days after he got 
back, I questioned him on that particular issue and he skated 
around it.  I had reason to believe that he was not really 
serious about what he had said in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the current regional development programs in Atlantic Canada 
are not working, and maybe some of them are not, then I believe 
it is time to try something new.  The various provinces like 
Newfoundland, Labrador and those that are the recipients of 
equalization payments need to have a rejigging and retooling of 
that formula. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask my hon. colleague if he shares with me a 
certain excitement about the future of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at Ireland 10 years ago and compare it to Atlantic 
Canada today, I think the House would agree that a lot of 
comparisons that can be drawn. 
The fact is that a tax based strategy, largely based on the 
transfers from the EU, allowed Ireland to transform itself over 
that period of time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could change the equalization to make it more effective and 
enable provinces such as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to keep 
more of the offshore revenue to lower taxes and debt.  Would the 
hon. member agree that transforming Atlantic Canada by using 
economic development strategies we know work in other parts of 
the world would be a great legacy?  Can we not change 
equalization to work now instead of dilly-dallying and doddering 
around and dealing with old economic development strategies that 
have failed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, how could I not agree 
with the hon. member?   He is such a forward looking individual 
and such a sound thinker.  How could we not agree with him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very exciting future in Atlantic Canada but we have to 
have a forward thinking government to take advantage of the 
opportunities that are in Atlantic Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, before 
I begin, I have to take care of three very important orders of 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Madam Speaker, I would like to compliment you on your 
appointment to Acting Speaker.  I know it is something you are 
going to appreciate.  You will get to learn from the learned 
member from Kingston.  I wish you all the best throughout this 
term in your capacity as Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have this opportunity to speak in the House of Commons, the 
sacred place that as parliamentarians we all should embrace, due 
to the privilege that has been bestowed upon for the second time 
by the electors of Fundy—Royal.  I want to thank the electors 
who reside in my fabulous riding of Fundy—Royal for this 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to pay tribute to two individuals who have 
made an immense contribution in the last parliament with respect 
to getting the EI issue for seasonal workers on the political 
map.  Lots of other individuals played a role in that but I would 
like to pay particular tribute to Jean Dubé and Angela Vautour. 
They spoke out for the seasonal communities who really needed a 
voice in this parliament.  They were clearly magical components 
in the recipe that got that bill tabled.  We now have the bill 
before us again.  Their legacy will benefit many citizens who 
reside in their communities for many years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague Jean Dubé who 
was successful last evening in a byelection.  He is now the 
member of the legislative assembly in Fredericton and for the 
riding of Campbellton.  He is going to continue that public 
service commitment.  I also want to pay tribute to Mr. Moore, 
another Tory, who was successful in the riding of Caraquet.  The 
legislature only got stronger last night in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the EI bill which has just been reintroduced. The 
bill with respect to immigration has also been reintroduced. We 
are also going to see the government make its third attempt at 
bringing forth legislation with respect to protecting species at 
risk.  Also, there was a bill on the order paper with respect to 
financial services.  The government tabled it five years after it 
said it was a priority however it died on the order paper. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be quite appropriate to say that the government is a 
government of improvisation.  It makes it up as it goes.  No 
longer are we seeing that with respect to the Marshall decision. 
The government was not ready for that particular incident, 
despite the fact it must have had people in the Department of 
Justice saying the decision may not have gone the way the 
Government of Canada had expected.  We saw that in 1995 
referendum, in the postal strike and in the farmers' crisis as 
well.  It is a government that manages by crisis and not by 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech there was no real commitment to developing 
and augmenting health care in the country.  Basically, the 
government reflected back upon the agreement it signed with the 
provinces in September or what I call the postdated cheque bill. 
The government returned the money that it gutted from the health 
care system in 1993-94 and agreed to return descending levels to 
that threshold again.  When?  Not today but three years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I campaigned in the recent election, they said 
categorically that given the government was in a surplus and if it 
had its priorities in order, before it did anything else, it 
would have returned that money to the health care system today, not 
three years from now.  This fact may not be known, but 
the province of New Brunswick will not return to the 1993-94 
threshold for health care funding until the year 2005-06.  New 
Brunswick actually waited five years for the government's 
postdated cheque on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Minister of Health to return that money now and 
to escalate the accord that was signed in September as opposed to 
the take or leave it deal that it left the provinces in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about one perspective.  We have seen a lot 
of economic indicators in the last little while that would say 
the North American economy is starting to slow down.  It is 
unheard of and unprecedented that the Minister of Finance would 
not have the fortitude to provide the leadership that the country 
fundamentally needs to ensure that Canada will make the necessary 
investments in our economy to ensure that it maintains its place 
in the world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not have a budget tabled that would recognize the fact 
that Canada has the second highest corporate and personal income 
taxes as a per cent of its GDP in the industrialized world?  Why 
would we not have a budget right now that would send a signal 
that Canada is going in the direction of lowering its taxes so it 
can have more growth to keep up with its principal trading 
partner, the United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we categorically have to make investment for the 
younger generation.  The best investment we could possibly make 
for younger generations right now is to set out a methodical 
strategy about paying down our national debt.  That is the least 
we owe to our future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no clear signal that the government will in a prudent, 
methodical way pay down debt.  If we want to send a signal to the 
international investment community that Canada is getting its 
economic fundamentals in order, that it is a place to grow and 
invest those important dollars in, no signal would be more 
valuable than a methodical approach to paying down national debt. 
I want to pay tribute to the member of Kings—Hants, our finance 
critic, who played a fundamental role in ensuring that that 
element was in the platform we bestowed upon Canadians in the 
recent election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one issue that I was very shocked by and that the Right 
Hon. Adrienne Clarkson did not utter the words because they were 
not placed before her in the throne speech.  The member for 
Burin—St. George's obviously does not think my next point is 
going to be all that important. 
I know students who live in Burin—St. George's.  When the member 
was a Tory, he actually thought this was a problem.  Now that he 
is a Liberal, he has forgotten about the students.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you, Madam Speaker, go to a high school, a community college 
or a university near your riding and say that post-secondary 
education is accessible to everyone?   We cannot do that right 
now because we do not have the guts to invest in post-secondary 
education to the level that we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message I want to send throughout this debate on the throne 
speech is that this is a government of improvisation.  I want to 
be a friend of Fundy—Royal and a friend of Canadians as a 
parliamentarian who advocates these particular issues.  I want to 
be a friend to farmers to ensure that we actually have an income 
stabilization system that would address catastrophic loss of 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that we are friends to students. I want to 
ensure that we do things in terms of being a friend to the 
environment, to safe air and safe water, to protect species at 
risk and to address climate change.  Those are the issues that we 
had in our platform.  I am sure, Madam Speaker, that you actually 
read our platform with wholehearted intensity during the course 
of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a friend of the environment, of farmers, of students and, 
above all, I pledge today that I will be a friend of my great 
riding of Fundy—Royal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment to the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask a question of my colleague from Fundy—Royal.  Is 
he suggesting that the government should totally neglect and 
forget about the $42 billion deficit that the former 
administration left this country with before the Liberals came to 
power in 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not realize that student debts and problems 
with student loans is a result of the mismanagement and 
overspending of the former administration led by former Prime 
Minister Mulroney? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member for Fundy—Royal advocating that we should return 
to blind spending, to increased student debt and to not dealing 
prudently with the finances of this country?  I would like to 
hear the hon. member's response to those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, a lot of my friends who 
have been in public life before have always said that the second 
term is always more enjoyable.  If I get more members on the 
other side leading with their chins like that, it will indeed be 
that much more enjoyable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Flip-Flop, as we refer to him right now, understands that 
economies such as Great Britain, the United States and most of 
the industrialized nations were in a worldwide recession at that 
time.  The only reason we are in a surplus position right now is 
because of initiatives brought forward by the Progressive 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member that when he was the chair for the 
Brian Mulroney campaign he actually had some good sense.  The 
initiative that was brought forth during that era was something 
called the free trade agreement.  Some of my colleagues here 
might remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We left a legacy for this country in terms of economics.  In 
1988 our trade with the Americans was about $90 billion. 
Compliments of the free trade agreement, today trade with 
Americans is $320 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not advocating that we go back into a deficit scenario, 
because systematically what this country needs is a debt 
repayment schedule.  That is the least that we owe future 
generations.

Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, as I would say in your native 
language, <I>evha risto</I> and <I>kali nehta</I> to you as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member of the Conservative Party talk about health 
care, education and the environment.  I was just about to sign 
him up for the NDP because those are what we have been preaching 
about for years and years.  It is nice to see them turn on the 
light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He keeps harping on about the great amount of trade we have done 
with the United States and what a great thing it is for Canada. 
The fact is that child poverty has increased in Canada. When they 
were in government in 1989 Ed Broadbent moved a motion in the 
House to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000 that was agreed 
to by all parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of free trade, NAFTA, deficits, debts and surpluses, 
child poverty has increased by four times.  The Conservatives 
were in government for four of the years.  The Liberals were in 
government for nine of those years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the throne speech is silent on what they will do to 
help the children and the parents to get out of child poverty. 
What immediate answers does my good colleague from Fundy—Royal, 
in the beautiful province of New Brunswick, have to address those 
serious issues at this very important time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, the question is quite 
long to give an appropriate response.  Clearly we should be 
sending some signals such as raising the basic personal 
exemptions for working poor individuals.  It sends a very wrong 
signal that we tax individuals who make about $14,000 less than 
the poverty line.  Raising the basic personal exemption would be 
a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other things we should be doing, such as doing 
away with the HST and GST on home heating fuel.  Those are the 
kind of initiatives that we should be doing.  We should be doing 
those initiatives rather than sending a fuel rebate tax to 
prisoners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your new appointment.  I know that 
your experience in parliament and all the work that you have done 
will lead you as an excellent Speaker in the House.  I look 
forward to listening to you and working with you throughout this 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my constituents in Chatham—Kent Essex.  I appreciate 
the support they have given me in returning me to the House.  I 
know that I will work as hard as I can to help with the 
confidence they have given to me and the Liberal Party in 
returning a Liberal government for a third mandate.  I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the comments made by hon. members in response 
to the Speech from the Throne I was struck by the comment made by 
the Leader of the Opposition.  He said that reducing taxes and 
debt and investing in the needed economic and social 
infrastructure were complementary goals.  By reducing taxes, 
reducing the debt, invigorating our economy and increasing 
revenues, it is with an invigorating type of fiscal position that 
we can help with social programs for Canadians, social programs 
that Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for endorsing the Liberal 
plan.  This is exactly the approach the Liberal government has 
taken.  It is an approach that has received overwhelming support 
from people across Canada in three successive elections.  The 
Liberal vision has long been based on striking the right balance 
between prudent fiscal management and smart investments in key 
economic and social priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This vision has served Canada extremely well.  It is no 
coincidence that for the past seven years in a row the United 
Nations has proclaimed Canada as the best place in the world to 
live.  There is absolutely no question that since 1993 our nation 
has come the distance step by step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 our public finances were in a mess, with spiralling 
debt, a record $42 billion deficit, high interest rates, combined 
with more than an 11% unemployment rate and continuous tax 
increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we have eliminated the $42 billion deficit we inherited 
and the Liberal government has recorded three consecutive 
surpluses. 
Last year we reduced the national debt by more than $12 billion, 
the largest paydown in Canadian history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne reaffirms our commitment to rock 
solid, prudent, fiscal management.  Our extraordinary fiscal 
turnabout has allowed us to introduce the largest tax cut in 
Canadian history of some $100 billion.  This means more money in 
the pockets of every Canadian, particularly moderate and middle 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate has fallen to 6.8%, its lowest level 
in over two decades.  Over two million new jobs have been created 
under the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economy is doing well.  In fact our economy is enjoying 
the longest run of growth since the sixties.  At the same time 
the Liberal government has been investing in our youth, our 
children, our families, health care, knowledge, innovation, 
infrastructure and environment.  Together we have built a strong 
foundation, but we cannot rest on our achievements.  We must and 
will do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many challenges and opportunities lie ahead for us as we enter 
the new millennium.  We will continue to build a stronger Canada, 
secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians and ensure all 
citizens have a chance to participate fully in making our society 
the best it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our success today and in the future is in the hands of our 
children.  The Liberal government takes this investment seriously 
with the early childhood development agreement and the national 
child benefit, and by doubling the length of maternity and parental 
benefits our investments in families and children have been 
second to none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes there is no higher priority than the 
welfare of Canada's children.  That is why in the throne speech 
we have committed to developing new measures to help single 
parents, to working with provinces to modernize the laws for 
child support, custody and access, and to improve the support to 
parents and caregivers in times of family crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system is also cherished by Canadians.  Canada's 
health care system embodies the values we share as a nation.  It 
reflects a society that is caring and compassionate with a strong 
sense of justice.  It provides quality service to all citizens, 
not just those who can afford to pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent health action plan agreement, agreed to by all first 
ministers, marked a historic step forward to renew our health 
care system for the 21st century.  The Speech from the Throne 
echoes the deep commitment of the Liberal government to 
universal, publicly funded health care, to upholding the 
principles of the Canada Health Act, and to ensuring our system 
better meets the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government plans to invest in health care more than 
$21 billion over five years, including $8 billion in Ontario. 
This means shorter waiting lists, more doctors and nurses, better 
delivery services and improved access.  This is important for all 
Canadians, especially those who live in rural and remote areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the throne speech which is of particular 
relevance to rural Canadians, including those of my own riding, 
is the government's pledge to help Canada's agricultural sector 
move beyond crisis management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers are facing a crisis beyond their control.  High 
foreign subsidies and historically low prices are making it 
difficult for farmers to survive and compete.  It is incumbent 
upon us to commit to doing more to support our farmers to enable 
them to compete on equal footing with their American and European 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians face the challenges of this intense competition. 
We live in a fast paced, technology driven, global economy.  The 
government has developed bold programs to ensure that all 
Canadians have access to the education, tools and information 
they need to develop skills that are in demand.  Prospering in an 
economy requires being connected to the technologies that will 
drive the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date our government has achieved an enormous success with 
initiatives such as SchoolNet and community access programs which 
help communities, public schools and libraries across Canada get 
on line.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many communities in my riding, including Blenheim, Chatham, 
Highgate, Leamington, Merlin, Ridgetown, Tilbury and Wheatley, 
have benefited from the national strategy for connecting 
Canadians across the country.  I am pleased to see that the 
federal government will continue to support this strategy and 
build on its progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech sets forth bold goals in the areas of skills 
and lifelong learning as well as research and development.  We 
intend at least to double the current federal investment in 
research and development by the year 2010.  Over the next five 
years we will help at least one million more Canadian adults take 
advantage of learning opportunities and improve their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make it easier for Canadians to finance their learning 
by creating the registered individual learning accounts.  By 
supporting our youth employment programs we will help our young 
people make the transition from school to work where they can 
apply their creative talents.  By working with our partners we 
will assist persons with disabilities who face barriers to full 
participation in our economy and society.  We will invest 
aggressively in the skills and talents of Canadians to ensure 
that no one is left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a skilled workforce also requires attracting skilled 
labour from abroad.  I am pleased the government intends to 
reintroduce changes to the immigration legislation.  It wants to 
facilitate the entry of temporary workers to allow for the 
immediate needs of employers to be met very quickly.  It also 
wants to modernize the system to attract the world's best and 
brightest to Canada. Canada is a nation of immigrants.  It is a 
country that was built by immigrants, and everyone knows that 
diversity has made Canada strong and will continue to make us 
strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong communities are the goal of the Liberal government and 
continued work to make our communities strong is the goal the 
Liberal government will attempt to achieve over its mandate. The 
throne speech makes it clear that every Canadian should have the 
opportunity to share in the prosperity of the country.  We will 
do our best to make sure that happens for every Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are talking about agriculture. 
There is one sentence in the throne speech about agriculture and 
it referred to moving beyond crisis management.  What is meant by 
the phrase moving beyond crisis management?  No one from the 
Prime Minister downward has specified exactly what that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member explain what he thinks it means?  Also, would 
he be specific on what steps the government is taking to move 
beyond the income crisis that we are in today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when we look at Canada's 
safety nets we look at the programs that have been developed and 
the programs that have evolved over the last many years.  The 
programs have been focused on crisis management, the management 
of time when there is a great deal of problem.  We have not 
really taken the lead in moving beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must take steps with our international partners to make 
sure that rules for fair trade, rules for access to products of 
other countries and rules of subsidies need to be challenged and 
need to be met.  There is no question that we need to set 
agreements that will ensure our farm community has the right and 
the opportunity to compete on an equal footing and on an equal 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the kinds of strategies that are needed, the 
Prime Minister had the opportunity to talk quickly with the new 
President of the United States this week to bring forward some of 
the issues that have to do with trading in softwood lumber, 
industry or agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Canada has farmers who are technically well 
advanced in production, who have a tremendous ability to produce 
food, and who are under the gun in unfair trade subsidies at this 
point in time.  We have always arrived at situations where our 
farm community or others have run into those kinds of pressures 
and problems. 
I believe going beyond crisis management means that we manage a 
program that puts them on a fair footing with everybody else in 
the world, and that is most important.  I have not met one farmer 
who does not want the opportunity to farm and compete on an equal 
square footing base with everyone else.  That is what our farm 
community is demanding.  That is what our Liberal government must 
deliver.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the reality is that 22,000 prairie 
farm families left the farm just last year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does the member think the future farmers of the country will 
be?  Will it be the children of those farmers who have left or 
will it be the corporate farms that are coming on stream very 
quickly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I obviously cannot 
identify exactly who will be farming what areas in the country. I 
can say that there has been a major problem in the oilseeds 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that grains and oilseeds have taken the 
brunt of difficult times.  First, the prices have been low. 
Second, the competition has been difficult and American and 
European subsidies have distorted the markets and the farmers' 
abilities to get a proper price out of the commodities they sell. 
Third, Canadian food prices are lower than anywhere else in the 
world.  However, it is very clear and important to realize that 
we have to negotiate agreements in agriculture that will put our 
Canadian farmers back on track in a fair, competitive face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think for one minute that anyone is ignoring this 
issue.  It is a matter of bringing people to the table.  In the 
past it has always been a competition where larger countries such 
as the United States—

hon. member for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to take part in this historic throne speech 
debate as we set a course for the new millennium.  I first want 
to express my appreciation to the constituents of 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex for their continued support on my third 
consecutive election.  They can rest assured that I will continue 
to put their views and concerns first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this, my maiden speech in the 37th parliament, I want express 
my sincere thanks to my family, Terry, Sandy, Michelle, Paul and 
my husband Louis for their dedication and support.  Without them 
I could not do this job.  To my friends, my staff, my campaign 
team and to the many volunteers who believe in me and continue to 
believe in me and support me, I certainly appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This throne speech proposes an action plan to move Canada 
forward as a nation that creates opportunity, rewards excellence 
and ensures all citizens are full participants.  We will focus on 
our efforts of ensuring that all share in the benefits of a 
strong economy and to create a workforce that is ready to meet 
the challenges of the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is the current state of agriculture and its future 
that is most notably on the minds of many of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex harvesting more crops 
than all the maritime provinces combined, agriculture is without 
a doubt the economic backbone of southern Ontario, indeed Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As agriculture goes, so goes our rural areas. If rural Canada 
has a future, we must work to ensure a positive future for 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in perspective for everyone, I will present some 
numbers to summarize the vital importance of agriculture.  For 
example, of Lambton county's nearly 600,000 acres, 491,000 acres 
are devoted to growing crops, representing 14% of the total jobs 
in that county.  this results in over $773 million in annual 
sales.  That is nearly a billion dollars of positive economic 
activity in one county. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment and sale expenditure multipliers indicate that 
for every job in agriculture there are an additional 1.28 jobs 
outside agriculture, and for each dollar in sales in agriculture 
there are $1.57 in agriculture related businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kent county produces 25%, one-quarter of Ontario's total corn 
crop.  In Middlesex county in just one month over 20 million eggs 
will be produced.  There is enough wool produced from sheep each 
year to knit 19,000 sweaters.  The swimming pool at the London 
Aquatic Centre holds nearly one million gallons of water.  There 
is enough milk produced in the county of Middlesex each year to 
fill 22 pools that size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost 4,500 acres of land are used to grow fruit such as 
peaches, pears, cherries, grapes and strawberries.  Most of us 
enjoy a good steak.  There are 13,500 beef cattle in Middlesex, 
producing not only meat and milk but car polish, medicine, 
leather, camera film, crayons, candles and sports equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feather industry in one county of my riding has nearly two 
million chickens and turkeys.  In all counties of my riding of 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, wheat, oats, barley, mixed grains, 
corn, alfalfa, soybean, tobacco and potatoes are the cash crops 
which are grown.  Bike tires, suntan lotion, toothpaste, fuel, 
makeup, ink and bread can be made from these crops.   Tomatoes, 
mushrooms, asparagus and cauliflower are grown as well. 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex is truly a diversified riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk of a growing economy it means many things. 
Agriculture is not just food but value added products that we all 
use in our daily lives whether we live in downtown Vancouver or 
Toronto or in the villages of Alvinston, Eberts or Melbourne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some individuals may be indifferent to the farming crisis. 
However everyone must recognize the three necessities of life: 
clean air, clean water, and a safe and abundant food supply. 
Agriculture is the third largest employer in Canada, generating 
about $95 billion in domestic retail and food services sales each 
year.  That is why I was pleased to see that agriculture was 
mentioned in the throne speech last week.  It was a recognition 
of the essential place agriculture has in the economic success of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister state that we must 
address the subsidy problem.  There are problems on the farm. Low 
commodity prices, coupled with bad weather, high input costs and 
overproduction due to high subsidies in the U.S. and the European 
Union, are putting our farmers in a financial vice, wounding the 
industry by cutting off its circulation as the lifeblood of our 
rural and urban economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current three year $5.5 billion national safety net 
agreement is a positive factor in support of our farmers.  Our 
agriculture minister worked very hard with the provinces to 
finalize this agreement, but we as Liberals know that more must 
be done.  Unless and until the U.S. and EU drop their subsidies, 
all industries must be treated fairly in the face of 
international subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National and provincial farm groups are suggesting that an 
additional $300 million to the farm safety net for Ontario would 
be reasonable, with 50% from the federal government.  I stress 
that what is happening today in agriculture has nothing to do 
with bad farm management decisions.  It is out of the farmer's 
hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to point out that the Ontario government 
has a role to play here as well.  Quebec farm support, for 
example, is 2.35 times greater than similar funding for income 
support and stabilization in Ontario.  Over the past three years 
Quebec has spent $457.3 million on farm support.  Ontario spent 
just $194.8 million, and that is going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 federal support has increased by 85%.  We are moving 
in the right direction.  While the current Ontario government 
spends less than one-half of one per cent of its budget on 
agriculture, it is eight per cent of Ontario's gross domestic 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, February 6, is Food Freedom Day.  It is a day of 
celebration for those who eat at least once a day, but it is not 
as happy for those who produce our food.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canadians have earned enough money to pay for their entire 
year's food supply.  It takes just 37 days out of the whole year 
for the average Canadian consumer to pay for his or her 
groceries.  In 1999 Canadians spent 10% of their personal 
disposable income on food.  That compares to 13% in France, 15% 
in Germany and 33% in Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are earning just a fraction of the average food dollar. 
While Food Freedom Day is February 6, January 9 is the day on 
which we have paid for the farmers' amount.  That is right.  It 
takes only nine days to pay the farmers for a year's worth of 
food.  Nine cents of a $1.50 loaf of bread is returned to the 
farmer.  Sixteen cents goes to the dairy farmer on a $1.50 glass 
of milk.  A waiter or waitress in a restaurant earns more on tips 
for serving the food than the farmer who produces it in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech of this new session is an important document. 
While it outlines the goals and proposals of the government on 
many fronts, it is agriculture that needs our immediate 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our nation is a success, with a strong and viable agriculture 
industry.  Ontario has always been a leader in agricultural 
production and agribusiness in Canada, and our nation's farmers 
are the most efficient in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government recognizes agriculture's value, not only 
to the Canadian economy but also to the quality of life in rural 
communities.  I support the action we have taken to support 
agriculture through research and development, the Canadian 
adaptation and rural development fund, enhanced farm income 
programs and support for rural communities through such excellent 
programs as community futures, but we can and we must do more.
