</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this will only take a minute or 
so of the time of the House, and I apologize for taking up any 
time of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand a question of privilege is the only device by which 
I can raise this issue.  At page 388 of <I>Hansard</I> of 
Thursday, February 8, 2001, stated in English, and I made the 
speech in English: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the government we are accountable to a Prime Minister 
who is personally accountable to the House and to Canadians generally. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, ministers are accountable to a Prime Minister. 
Of course, that is the way it is constitutionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not have raised this issue other than the fact that 
members of the media have utilized the French text, which stated 
almost the opposite. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French text reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>En tant que députés, nous sommes responsables devant le premier 
ministre, qui est lui-même personnellement responsable devant la 
Chambre des communes et les Canadiens en général. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French text stated that all members of the House are 
personally accountable to the Prime Minister.  Although 
colleagues across the way would perhaps want to make a political 
point about it, it is factually inaccurate.  It is not what was 
said.  Unfortunately this has led the media to utilize the French 
text as being that which I said when <I>Hansard</I> indicated that 
I was speaking in the English language at the time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think it is clear that the minister 
has raised a question of privilege which is in the nature of a 
grievance.  I think he has made his point and we will leave the 
matter there.

thank the people of the riding of Joliette for the trust they 
put in me last November 27.  I can assure them today, as I did 
during the election campaign, that I will defend the interests 
of Quebec and of my fellow citizens of Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introducing this motion today offers me the first opportunity to 
ensure that their interests are defended.  The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government bring any draft 
agreement on the Free Trade Zone of the Americas before the 
House so that it may be debated and put to a vote before 
ratification by the Government of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From April 20 to 22, the 34 heads of state and of government of 
the Americas, with the exception of Cuba, will be holding the 
third summit of the Americas in Quebec City.  This will be an 
extremely important event as far as the process of creating a 
free trade area of the Americas is concerned.  The related 
agreement is slated for around 2005.  Creation of a free trade 
area of the Americas is both an extraordinary challenge for all 
the states and peoples of the Americas and an extraordinary 
opportunity.  It can, however, involve considerable risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of a free trade area is far from being a guarantee, a 
cure-all, for all our woes, whether economic or social. This we 
have seen, moreover, with the creation of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and the NAFTA area encompassing Canada, 
Quebec, the United States and Mexico.  For example, its creation 
did not prevent the crisis of the peso and the widening of the 
social gap.  In our societies—and this applies to Canada, the 
United States and Mexico— more and more people are living not 
only in poverty but in abject poverty.  We must therefore be 
extremely vigilant in negotiating or creating these free trade 
areas, while still remaining open to the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process must be the result of democratic debate.  That is 
why the Bloc Quebecois, through me, is today introducing this 
motion, because we have concerns. 
We are concerned for Quebec's rights first, because obviously it 
is always troubling to see the federal government negotiate on 
behalf of Quebecers on the economic, social and cultural front. 
But we are also concerned for all Canadians and Quebecers as far 
as respect of social and environmental rights is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past our governments, and this is true for the federal 
government, but also for the U.S. and Mexican governments, were 
not vigilant or, I would say, were not overly concerned about 
the social, environmental, political and cultural consequences 
of these trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an unionist, I was able to follow these debates from the 
start, in the mid-eighties. 
I recall very well that in 1989—and the federal Liberals were by 
the way in agreement with us on that— we were not taking into 
account the fact that the negotiation of free trade agreements 
with the United States was going to have social and 
environmental implications. We can now see that. For example, 
Bill C-2 on employment insurance is a direct consequence, and this 
is not the only reason, of the free trade agreement with the 
United States and Mexico. We now know that our employment 
insurance plan reflects more or less what exists in most of the 
states in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, during the negotiation of the free trade agreement with 
the United States, we did not want to recognize that there were 
social, environmental and cultural implications. 
In 1994, because of public pressure in Canada, Quebec, the 
United States and Mexico, governments were forced to adopt, at 
the same time as the North American Free Trade Agreement, side 
accords on environmental and labour standards. These accords 
were signed because of public pressure and pressure from 
parliamentarians, particularly in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, in 2001, the Prime Minister made a speech in which he 
alluded to the possibility of introducing social clauses in the 
agreement. This is a step in the right direction, in my opinion. 
However, we must not give up. The public and parliamentarians 
must continue to exert pressure to ensure that the free trade 
agreement of the Americas will include clauses that protect our 
social and environmental rights and also Quebec's interests.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and Quebec have open economies. We have a vested interest 
in trade liberalization. These agreements are also extraordinary 
opportunities for co-operation with countries from the south and 
even within our societies. However, this integration of the 
economies and of the markets must be controlled by introducing 
social clauses, particularly to protect labour rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear. When we talk about protecting labour rights, we 
are not talking about standards. 
We are talking about fundamental rights that are recognized by 
the International Labour Organization, rights such as the 
banning of child labour, forced labour and discrimination, and 
the recognition of the freedom of association and of the right 
to collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will each country in the Americas implement these rights? It 
will be up to them, based on their respective histories and 
cultures. I often give the example—and I will do it again here in 
the House—that in Canada, the United States and Quebec we 
recognize the freedom of association through very specific forms 
of union certification. In Mexico and in Latin American 
countries, this may be done in a different way. It is also done 
differently in Europe. 
The important thing is for governments to pledge to respect 
those fundamental rights in the way that will better suit these 
societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise, the approach that we favour is not a punitive one. In 
this respect, Latin-American countries need not fear the 
emergence of a new form of social protectionism. It is rather by 
co-operation that we want to help those countries, as well as our 
own North-American countries, respect those rights. Let us not 
forget that we are in no position to lecture anyone. We 
sometimes have things to learn from others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a co-operative approach that we favour, not one 
of sanctions. The same applies for the environment. We have to 
ensure that the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas will 
clearly indicate the common desire of all the populations of the 
Americas to promote a sound and sustainable environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, civil societies and parliamentarians have to play 
an active role in the negotiation process. The texts on which 
negotiations are based should be made available so that 
Quebecers and Canadians, as well as the members of the House, 
will be able to evaluate the validity and accuracy of the 
Canadian government's positions regarding what is being done in 
the free trade area of the Americas negotiation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we should have learned from what happened 
with the multilateral agreement on investment that was secretly 
negotiated for two years at the OECD. Sooner or later the basic 
texts will be made public. A citizen group is sure to release 
them. This will give rise to a negative reaction against the 
whole process, even though the process could have been well 
defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transparency is therefore very important. 
So there is reason for concern, particularly with statements 
like the one made by the Minister for International Trade in the 
House on February 1. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the negotiating documents, obviously there are 34 parties 
to it. It is not up to Canada to share it if other countries do 
not want to share it. Canada would support sharing it at this 
stage. However our partners do not wish that. We will respect 
them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are extremely concerned that, even though we are only at the 
negotiating stage, already the Canadian government is not 
assuming a leadership role with respect to this minimum 
requirement of transparency. 
As for contradictory statements, we could add this one by 
Mr. Lortie, the Prime Minister's personal representative 
throughout the preparations for the summit of the Americas: 
“Too much transparency would be chaotic at this stage in the 
preparations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to be too transparent?  Is it possible to be too 
democratic?  I do not think so.  Parliamentarians must be able 
to debate these issues.  That is why the Bloc Quebecois tabled 
this motion.  We must ensure that the free trade area of the 
Americas agreement is discussed in the House.  I urge the 
members of all political parties to ensure that we have some way 
of being able to evaluate the negotiations that will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Mr. Chrétien stated— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> I remind members that they are 
not to refer to members, ministers or the Prime Minister by name 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> I apologize, this is due to my 
inexperience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada believes that it is through openness and transparency 
that we will convince the public of the legitimacy of the 
agreement.  As host of the first summit of the Americas in this 
millennium, Canada will do everything in its power to promote 
openness and transparency.  It is time to put our money where 
our mouth is and pass the motion I have introduced.

transparency that the Canadian government has been pushing in 
these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question what he said about there not being transparency. The 
websites contain the Canadian documentation and position papers. 
All Canadians and groups who are interested can read the 
information or take it off the websites. There are a few left to 
do and they are still under negotiations and consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out to the hon. member that Canada's position was 
not made somewhere in the back halls of the bureaucracy.  All the 
provinces, premiers and Canadians were consulted first before the 
government came forward with its position.  Canadians, interest 
groups and the provinces were consulted and then Canada put 
together a package of consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to ask a question on the motion which demands that 
parliament first vote on this issue before ratification.  As the 
hon. member knows, generally we will agree on the issues and then 
there will be a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that is the American system that the hon. member is 
putting forward.  Right now the Americans have a fast track way 
in which to get around that because no government will come to an 
agreement on an issue where it can all of a sudden be changed at 
the last minute by one group.  We cannot negotiate that way. Does 
the hon. member not agree that this is not the right way to go 
and that this would only stall negotiations? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, since the beginning, the Bloc 
Quebecois has been trying to initiate this debate on the free 
trade area of the Americas, but government members pretend they 
do not understand our questions or views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a problem with the Canadian position, even though 
the texts to which we have access seem particularly generous but 
also vague on the specific contents of the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said in my speech, and I repeat it, is that we are not 
able to assess the validity and appropriateness of the Canadian 
government's position if we do not have access to the basic 
texts on the issues that are being negotiated by the 34 
governments at the nine sectoral tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, there is a lack of transparency. Quebecers and 
Canadians are suspicious of the process and, as long as the 
government does not do something about it, that process will be 
flawed. Every day, various public groups express their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just today we were told that a people's summit would be held. 
This does not go only for Canada. The whole process must be 
reviewed and our country must be a leader in that exercise. 
The Prime Minister said so, and I think that we must put words 
into action by making sure that this House plays an active role 
in the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have access to the basic texts on which the 
negotiations will be based, so as to be able to assess Canada's 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and I am pleased that the hon. member mentioned 
it, parliamentarians in the United States have the privilege of 
debating the issue first and demanding a number of things before 
allowing the president to fast track the process. Democrat 
senators and representatives have made it clear to President 
Bush that there will be no fast tracking if the agreement does 
not include clauses on labour and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we, in this House, do not have that possibility. 
If they have these guarantees, they will allow the American 
president to effectively use a fast track procedure, which will 
allow members of Congress to vote without amending the treaty, 
something which does not exist here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking for the equivalent of what exists in the U.S. 
Congress. In fact, any democracy should have these same rules.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning I 
am proud to speak to the motion put forward by the promising and 
bright new member for Joliette. I knew him in another life when 
we were both younger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is useless to hide from the fact that the population is 
worried about the effects of globalization. Now, the free trade 
area that is in preparation is one of the major components of 
this globalization process that is developing and going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that the World Trade Organization 
negotiations failed and that in the end this free trade area of 
the Americas will be somewhat a first. 
For the first time in a free trade area there will be highly 
developed countries like the United States, the richest country 
in the world, as well as countries of Central America and the 
southern hemisphere of the Americas which are, in some cases, 
very poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is normal that the populations of Quebec, Canada, the United 
States and the countries of Central and South America are 
worried. We are not the only ones asking for more transparency. 
I would say that as a whole the population feels that there are 
opportunities to be found in globalization, but they know that 
these could be opportunities only for the rich and 
multinationals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure that the riches that could result from 
globalization benefit the majority, we must look at what is 
being negotiated. It is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping the process secret will not make the concerns disappear. 
We will not make the concerns go away by telling people: “Go 
see what is on the Internet. 
Our positions are known”. We know the free trade area of the 
Americas is a negotiating process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, such a negotiation has been prepared for a long time by 
officials from all the countries. These officials most certainly 
have their opinion on the place where they think it should be 
held. We need more information to know where this place is, to 
ensure that this process, I say again, does not lead to some 
people getting richer and others getting poorer, and does not 
put pressure on social and labour conditions in general. Because 
globalization can be this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, if the European Union is being built, it is 
because Europeans do not want the market to be concerned only 
with the economy. They also want to protect social rights and 
legitimate long fought gains made by workers. 
And this is done by paying attention, not by saying: “We will 
reduce everything to the lowest common denominator, we will say 
no to unionization by putting downward pressure on salaries and 
on working conditions for everyone in the future.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know investments will be discussed and are being discussed. 
Is what is on the table what had been prepared at the OECD? 
France put a stop to the MAI, the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment, which gave unacceptable powers to investors. What is 
being prepared on this? We need to know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of services will be on the table, but we do not know 
which services are going to be included. The United States is 
pushing hard. We have been talking for a while about the 
environment, and social rights, or the lack thereof. We have 
been discussing what rules on competition would be acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need to know the content of the basic negotiating 
documents. We need and have the right to know, so that we can 
have a public debate over the issues, meet with groups from the 
southern hemisphere countries who will explain their 
restrictions. To do that, we need to know where we are heading. 
With the present process, we cannot know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the Government of Quebec and other provincial 
governments be involved? Because they will be very directly 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it good enough to say, as the secretary of state just did, 
that the government had consultations two years ago? No, because 
the discussions that have taken place in the meantime affect us. 
We want to know what is at stake, and we have the right to know. 
It is not a matter of negotiating in public, but of knowing what 
the issues are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament also needs to get ready to be able to make a decision 
on the agreement before it is ratified. Let me remind the House 
that when we signed the first free trade agreement, which was 
our first leap of faith, the present Prime Minister, who was 
then in the opposition, was incensed over this agreement. An 
election was called on the issue. We had the text of the 
agreement then. 
We had the opportunity to examine it. Moreover, we all remember 
that the Prime Minister said he would not sign it unless 
important changes were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will that party, which worked itself into a state over free 
trade at the time and then became its biggest supporter, tell us 
that consulting parliament is good for Americans, but not for 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to members sitting on both sides of the House. They 
must realize that, if FTA was a leap in the dark and NAFTA was 
put through without as much discussion, this one is quite 
another matter. With this, we are going global, we are entering 
a larger free trade zone with poor countries dealing with other 
constraints. 
It is crucial for us to know what is at stake in order to have 
the proper discussions and to be able to protect the people in 
the southern hemisphere, in South America and Central America, 
as well as here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only the beginning of the debate I hope, but I am 
thankful that my party was the one to initiate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK27">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks of the member 
for Mercier, whom I respect a great deal as an active member in 
the area of foreign affairs.  I think, however, that she is 
misleading the House and the motion misleads the House, or at 
least the discussion so far is misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two issues with which we have to concern ourselves. 
The first one is the issue to which she and the previous speaker 
referred, transparency in the negotiations.  The House must bear 
in mind that there is not one text available. There are 42 texts. 
There are as many texts as there are governments sitting around 
the table.  many of the governments do not intend to share those 
texts until the negotiations are complete.  That is the way 
international negotiations are completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has been unlike any government before in history 
in terms of its open consultation, open discussion, and the 
availability of our negotiating positions on the Internet where 
they have been fixed.  There is  recognition that areas such as 
services and investment, to which the member referred, are not 
available, but they will be available when they are ready.  There 
are open discussions.  Our committees are consulted and there is 
broad consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's motion does not direct itself to the issue she has 
been discussing today.  Her motion is in fact a constitutional 
amendment.  The motion that the Bloc proposes today is that the 
House be required to debate an international agreement before it 
is ratified by the Government of Canada.  This has never been the 
practice.  It is not the practice of the country and it should 
not be introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that she respond to my question.  Why 
would we introduce a profound constitutional change and an 
amendment in the way in which we proceed in international affairs 
under the guise of the transparency of this negotiation? We all 
agree on all the issues and that it is most important for all of 
us.  We all intend to be engaged and have been engaged in a 
meaningful way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am told that the word 
“misleading” used by my hon. colleague, a man I greatly respect, 
is apparently unparliamentary.  It is your call, but I would 
like to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B> I withdraw my words. I used the word strictly 
in a straightforward manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I expected no less of the 
person who is again going to chair the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to respond to my colleague's two arguments.  The first is 
that there is no such thing as the negotiating text to which we 
are referring. 
I regret to have to inform him that, should this be the case, 
people might as well be prepared for the free trade area of the 
Americas never to be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also state that I have seen the document prepared for 
the WTO negotiations.  The state it was in just before they were 
to be held explains why an agreement was never forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be misinforming this House to pretend that a 
process of seeking a consensus between the holders of the most 
extreme positions is not already under way.  There is most 
certainly a basic text.  That is one thing. 
There are most certainly clearly identified issues. 
That is the other thing.

well, in connection with my hon. colleague's constitutional 
argument that the Constitution would have to be changed to allow 
such a debate, I will investigate that in the Constitution.  If 
that is the case, we would have to move rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that Brian Mulroney submitted to the public for 
consultation and to parliament a free trade agreement that was 
later ratified?  Think of the dramatic change represented by the 
free trade area of the Americas.  Something would have to be 
done.  But we know that Canada is in a constitutional 
straitjacket which makes any change impossible.

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take this first 
opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment to the chair. 
I thank the people of my riding of London—Fanshawe.  I also 
thank my wife, my children, and all my very dedicated campaign 
workers who have made my election for the third time to this 
place possible.  I am deeply honoured and I thank them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to address the House today on the very 
important issue raised by the opposition, the free trade area of 
the Americas.  The past decade has been one in which the 
hemisphere has made remarkable progress and in which Canada's 
relations with its closest friends and neighbours have developed 
in new and exciting ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will celebrate this progress and the spirit of co-operation 
that has transformed our community when the Prime Minister 
welcomes the leaders of the democratically elected governments of 
the region to the third summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 
April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americas is one of the world's most dynamic regions. 
Although its 800 million people are not even one-sixth of the 
world population, they account for more than one-third of the 
world's economic activity.  At about $11 trillion U.S. the 
combined gross domestic product of the Americas is greater than 
that of the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Miami summit of the Americas in 1994, leaders endorsed a 
declaration and plan of action that expressed their common 
commitment to strengthening democracy and creating greater 
prosperity.  They also committed themselves to practical measures 
to improve health care, increase access to quality education and 
protect biodiversity, to name but a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second summit in Santiago in 1998, leaders endorsed 
action to support the development of democratic institutions, 
protect human rights, and enhance transparency and respect for 
the rule of law.  They also gave specific instructions to begin 
the process of negotiating the free trade area of the Americas. 
Once it is complete, the FTAA will be the world's largest free 
trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout today's debate, my colleagues and I on this side of 
the House will discuss in some depth the issues of access, 
services, investment and the need for coherence.  I certainly 
hope hon. members across the aisle will join us in this important 
debate. 
However, I must admit that I suspect some members of the 
opposition will simply cast aspersions on the FTAA rather than 
offer constructive and realistic ideas.  I would love to be 
proven wrong on that.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the opposition can simply say that everything the 
government does or proposes is fundamentally contrary to the 
interests of Canadians.  The reality of governing is that we must 
assist Canadians in fulfilling their hopes and achieving their 
aspirations while providing real, meaningful assistance to the 
people of the Americas.  The FTAA offers Canadians many more 
benefits that would clearly compel us to support these 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking too of the vast hemispheric dialogue on issues 
such as labour rights and environmental protection that have been 
fostered and promoted within the broader hemispheric movement. We 
all expect a free trade area of the Americas to create the 
conditions for greater prosperity.  Without the chance to improve 
their economic situations through trade and investment, just how 
could poor countries of the hemisphere begin to address their 
real problems of poverty, of crime, of environmental degradation, 
and of threats to democracy and human rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that there are vulnerable and excluded elements of 
our societies.  There are challenges to our culture and to our 
values.  There are indeed risks to some parts of our economies, 
risks that trade alone does not create and that the FTAA alone 
cannot resolve, but risks that concern our citizens nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do?  We cannot stand still and accept matters as they 
currently stand in Canada or anywhere else in the hemisphere if 
there is a chance to make them better.  The facts are clear. 
Canada has done very well from its openness to trade and 
investment and has acquired the strength and experience to do 
even better in the future under even better rules.  Therefore we 
must go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key objective in the FTAA negotiations is to achieve open and 
secure market access for goods produced within the free trade 
area. The elimination of tariffs is key to this objective.  Some 
Canadian exporters face significant tariffs in key markets for 
important Canadian exports.  Canada therefore supports an 
approach that will allow for early tariff elimination for some 
products in order to provide exporters the opportunity to expand 
trade quickly and reduce costs for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time all countries have domestic industries that may 
require time to adjust to increased import competition. 
Consequently we expect that a transition period which allows for 
the phased elimination of some tariffs will also be negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with the approach taken in other negotiations, Canada 
will push for the elimination of tariffs on all non-agricultural 
products over a period not to exceed 10 years.  Canada is also 
examining a transitional safeguard mechanism to protect producers 
from unforeseen difficulties associated with hemispheric trade 
liberalization.  To ensure that only goods produced in the 
hemisphere benefit from preferential tariff treatment, a Canadian 
objective will be to negotiate appropriate rules of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one sector where new access could lead to 
significant benefits for Canada and for Canadian businesses, it 
is in the area of services.  The service sector is a key engine 
of the Canadian economy.  It is responsible for more than 
two-thirds of Canada's GDP, almost three-quarters of employment, 
some 10.5 million jobs, and nearly 90% of new job creation in 
Canada.  It is leading the transformation of the Canadian economy 
into a knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the 12th largest exporter of services in the world, 
exporting some $51.8 billion worth in 1999 alone.  The argument 
for supporting Canada's services exports is particularly eloquent 
when it comes to the Americas.  Canada's commercial services 
exports to FTAA countries, excluding the United States and 
Mexico, were worth $1.9 billion in 1998, up from $787 million in 
1993.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian telecommunications sector is enjoying tremendous 
success, exporting services valued at over $2 billion per year 
and employing some 104, 000 people.  As a consequence, since 1993 
the sector has been growing at a rate of just over 9% each and 
every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, Canadian exporters of telecommunications services face 
market access and regulatory restrictions in many countries of 
the hemisphere, in part due to the presence of telecommunications 
monopolies in several central and Latin American countries, 
the lack of transparency, predictability and timeliness in the 
process for awarding operating permits and licences or 
prohibitive fees for licensing or interconnection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years Canada's financial institutions have been very 
active in central and Latin America.  One leading example is 
Scotiabank which is active in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Costa 
Rica, Belize, El Salvador, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and 
Venezuela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example is the National Bank which recently teamed 
up with three U.S. venture capital companies and a local Chilean 
partner to form the Corp Banca consortium in order to purchase 
banking institutions in South American countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true for the insurance sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another sector where Canadian expertise is renowned around the 
world, of course, is engineering and other related services. 
Canada is currently the world's third largest exporter of 
engineering services, and the high calibre of Canadian engineers 
is internationally recognized.  That is why Canada is actively 
participating in the services negotiations under the free trade 
area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has much to gain from the establishment of a 
comprehensive set of rules on trade and services under the FTAA. 
Canada's general objective in the services negotiations is to 
seek improved market access for Canadian service providers under 
a transparent and predictable rules based regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the elaboration of FTAA rules on services, Canada will be 
guided by its existing rights and obligations in the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, the Canada-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement and the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, 
more commonly known at GATS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the link between trade, economic growth and jobs is well 
understood, the same is not true for the flip side of trade 
investment.  Foreign investment has played a central role in 
Canada's development as a nation and remains essential to 
securing Canada's continued development and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's efforts toward a strong rules based system at the 
regional and multilateral levels are aimed at creating a solid 
basis for long term economic expansion and continued social 
progress.  Investment rules provide for transparent, predictable 
and fair rules for Canadian investors, large and small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade and investment rules give a medium sized economy like ours 
a great deal of leverage against the political pressure sometimes 
exerted by larger economies.  Conversely, inward investment in 
Canada coming from the non-NAFTA countries of the Americas 
totalled only $3 billion in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, Canada has a strong outward investment orientation in 
the Americas beyond the United States and Mexico.  In this 
context, Canada has a strong interest in seeking a rules based, 
secure and predictable environment for investors and their 
investments in the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the elaboration of FTAA investment rules, Canada will be 
guided and take into account past experiences with trade 
negotiations and the implementation of investment rules with 
other countries, including those of Latin America and the 
Caribbean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's main objective is to ensure a clear delineation of 
investment obligations that will serve our national interests. As 
is the case for other trade agreements, the FTAA investment 
chapter will allow countries to file exceptions for those 
measures they wish to maintain and what would otherwise not be 
allowed under the FTAA.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canada will ensure that it preserves its ability to 
adopt or maintain regulations, administrative practices and other 
measures in sectors of key policy interest.  I am specifically 
referring to our most treasured public health care system and our 
public education system.  These are not open for debate or 
discussion by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit process ensures that economic growth through 
liberalized trade is linked to social development.  Hemispheric 
co-operation on democracy, human rights, labour, employment and 
environmental issues, justice, health and other major issues 
proceeds within the same framework as the FTAA.  The FTAA is 
complemented and reinforced by the efforts of many other 
ministers of the hemisphere, not just trade ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, ministers of energy will meet in Mexico at the 
beginning of March.  Ministers of the environment will meet in 
Montreal at the end of March.  Finance ministers will meet in 
Toronto in early April.  Ministers of labour will meet in Ottawa 
next October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These collective and co-operative hemispheric efforts on 
specific issues such as labour, employment and the environment 
reflect an integrated approach to meeting summit commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome the opportunity to talk about the FTAA and we will 
never be shy to do so on any occasion.  However the Bloc's motion 
is irrelevant, unfortunately, simply because the government has 
been at the forefront of the hemisphere in consulting openly with 
Canadians and with parliament.  The kind of leadership my 
colleagues from the Bloc have called for today is something the 
government has demonstrated very clearly and repeatedly, and it 
will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee studied and published a report.  Then the 
minister tabled the government's response to the report, which 
set the tone for our proposals for the FTAA at this stage.  Had 
the Bloc consulted with all parties on their motion perhaps we 
might have been able to agree with it.  Nonetheless, we on this 
side welcome the opportunity to debate it.  I am convinced the 
FTAA process will benefit significantly from this parliamentary 
exchange on such a very important issue to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to what the parliamentary 
secretary had to say, to what the former parliamentary secretary 
had to say, and to what the former chairman of the foreign 
affairs committee had to say.  In all their summations they have 
been talking about an open and transparent system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members also talked about the standing committee looking at 
the issue.  I would tell them that the Canadian Alliance, the 
official opposition, put out its minority report at that time. 
One of the points we brought forward was exactly what the Bloc 
motion is today.  We want parliament to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has just said what the government 
has been doing, which is fine, but the fact remains that exactly 
what he is doing in parliament is what the Bloc and the Alliance 
want: to discuss it in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member on his re-election. He thanked 
his constituents and I would like to say that they sent him here 
to talk on their behalf.  He should be speaking on their behalf 
on the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an American style of system.  We want to discuss it in 
parliament where the elected officials are.  I remind him that 
this is precisely what Australians included in their 
constitution, that all international agreements should be brought 
into parliament to be discussed by the elected representatives. 
What the problem is with that issue?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his congratulations.  First I want to assure him that in my 20 
year career in elected public office at the municipal level and 
now at the federal level, if there is one thing that my 
constituents have been very clear about it is that they know with 
great certainty that I will be heard from in whatever forum in 
which I represent them and that certainly includes the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's question gives me the opportunity to do a little 
commercial on a trade day that we will hold in London, Ontario, 
on March 6, with my colleagues.  Indeed, the Minister for 
International Trade and trade officials will be there.  I will 
certainly be there with my other colleagues to take all the 
questions that people have on how they can export and take 
advantage of the opportunities that exist in the export markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear something of a contradiction in what my colleague from 
the Alliance and, indeed, colleagues from the Bloc have said here 
today.  First and foremost they call for greater transparency and 
consultation, but then they demand to see the Canadian position 
in the House right now.  That is simply a contradiction.  We have 
filed our position on five of the nine negotiating groups.  It is 
on the website.  We are getting responses every day to them. 
However, we have not finalized our position on the other four 
groups because the consultation that the hon. member calls for is 
ongoing right now.  With whom?  It is ongoing with NGOs, with 
individual Canadians, with stakeholders.  When the full position 
is developed that will be the appropriate time to engage in a 
national debate.  The consultation being called for is simply not 
complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again, and I am proud to say it, that the government is 
the leader in these negotiations on openness and transparency and 
it will continue to be that.

<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
comment briefly on something that was said about the 
relationship between trade, economic development and jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After World War II and until quite recently, it was true that 
trade, economic development and jobs went hand in hand. 
Usually, when people had jobs, poverty receded and social rights 
improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, this is no longer the case.  Trade, economic 
development and jobs can all be on the increase, and poverty can 
still continue to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While growth has been exceptional in the United States over the 
past 10 years, the number of poor remains the same.  Poverty 
rates in the United States stand at 21%, compared to an OECD 
average of 12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we must do more than merely rely on economic growth and 
globalization.  There is a need for mechanisms to ensure that 
each society, each country, each jurisdiction, has the means to 
ensure that social rights are respected.  In this regard, 
Canadians and Quebecers should be worried, as should all the 
Americas.  We must ensure that social rights are part of these 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's opinion on the following statement 
made at the second general conference of parliamentarians of the 
Americas held in Puerto Rico in July 2000: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the process of continental integration is 
strengthened by the participation of parliamentarians from all 
jurisdictions on the continent, by the transparency of debate on 
the creation of a free trade area of the Americas, and by the 
regular dissemination of the results of ongoing negotiations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, all parliamentarians of the Americas want the process 
to be more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all allow me to 
congratulate my colleague from the Bloc on his very good maiden 
speech in the House and also on his appointment as trade critic. 
I look forward to constructively working with him and the other 
critics over the next couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made a very good point and one that we certainly know 
is valid, that is, in the midst of economic prosperity in any 
country, including Canada, we still have those who unfortunately 
are being left behind.  There exists a dichotomy that none of us 
are happy with and it needs to be addressed.  I fully agree with 
him on that matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the need for more liberalized trade, I will 
quote from a UN report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now widespread acceptance that, in the long run, the 
expansion of international trade and integration into the world 
economy are necessary instruments for promoting economic growth 
and reducing and eradicating poverty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those words come from the United Nations.  They are fully 
endorsed by the secretary general of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi 
Annan, who has said that the best thing we can do for the poor in 
our own nation or the poor around the world is to liberalize 
trade.  That is the best way we can address the problem of world 
poverty.  Those words come from people far more expert than I, 
and I endorse them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, congratulations on your new position. 
This is the first time you have been in the chair when I have had 
an opportunity to speak. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I congratulate the Bloc Quebecois member on his motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important and huge issue. 
I would like to ask my friend from the government two 
questions on two separate issues.  The first deals with the 
opponents to free trade who we have seen in Seattle and other 
areas.  I wonder if the hon. member would address the House and 
tell us what the government is going to do to address this issue, 
because a lot of those people actually are opposing issues and 
solutions that are going to help the poorest of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great misnomers is that the people who oppose free 
trade think their actions are going to help the poorest of the 
poor, but in the erection of the barriers to trade that they want 
to actually implement, they are doing the worst possible thing 
for developing countries.  The best thing we can do for a 
developing country is lessen the barriers to trade so that 
country can become more economically sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to address that and also address how the 
government can better engage these people.  They do have some 
important concerns in terms of freer trade and how we can deal 
with issues such as labour laws, labour regulations and job and 
working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point deals with addressing the issue of the movement of 
short term capital that has been so destabilizing in 
international markets.  We have seen that the movement of large 
amounts of capital in the short term destabilized international 
markets.  I ask the hon. member what his government is going to 
do to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to hear my 
colleague from the Canadian Alliance address the concern that 
many of us on this side of the House share as well.  Very 
well-meaning people, some of them personal friends of mine in 
London, Ontario, just simply do not seem to understand the point 
the member has made:  that the best way to address poverty here 
in Canada and around the world is to do what the UN is calling 
for and continue to liberalize trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who he said that 
tariffs must go.  In his new report he says that rich countries 
should remove all barriers to goods and services from poor 
countries.  That would put at least $100 billion a year into the 
pockets of the world's poor, more than double what they now get 
in foreign aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully endorse the member's comments on the need for 
liberalizing trade.  The Minister for International Trade 
certainly does and so does everyone on this side of the House.  I 
am pleased to agree with the member on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the opportunities for consultation, there have been 
many and there will continue to be many, both through our 
position on the website and with groups that can come to the 
standing committee.  We welcome all consultation possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of 
privilege.  This morning, as you may recall, at approximately 
10.15 a.m. you tabled a report in the House from the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission.  As you may also have noticed, the 
contents of the report were reported in the Toronto <I>Star</I> 
and in the <I>Sun</I>, and I heard it on the CBC radio news this 
morning as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was able to acquire only one copy of the report from the 
distribution people of the House of Commons.  I feel that our 
privileges as members of parliament are being breached in the 
fact that the Canadian Human Rights Commission is obviously 
putting its spin on this document before it is tabled in the 
House and before it is available to members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can members read the report if copies are not available? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the Minister of Justice take up this issue with 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission and let the commission know 
that it is time it respected parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member.  That is not really a question of privilege, but 
if you wanted to pass on a message, it has been done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and join in the debate today, 
but first of all let me offer my congratulations to you on 
assuming your new position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to remind the House and people who are watching today, the 
motion that we are discussing is as follows:  that the government 
be required to subject any project or accord on a free trade 
agreement with the Americas to a debate and a vote before it is 
ratified by the government.  It sounds eminently sensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that our party, both as the Alliance and as 
the Reform Party, has for a number of years supported the idea of 
bringing major treaties and major free trade agreements to the 
House of Commons for ratification.  This is entirely consistent 
with our current policy as well.  In fact, one of my colleagues, 
the current House leader of the Canadian Alliance, has brought 
forward motions in the past recommending something very similar 
to what we see in today's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in saying that I also have to point out that the other 
side of the House has been much less consistent in its respect 
for democracy when it comes to ratifying these sorts of 
agreements via debate and a vote in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take members back through a bit of the history, as I 
recall it, of some of the things that have occurred here over the 
last seven years while I have been a member of parliament and 
that run completely contrary not only to the letter of the motion 
that I just read, but also to the spirit of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one that comes to mind is the MAI, the multilateral 
agreement on investment.  Many of my colleagues will remember 
just how interested the public was in that particular negotiation 
that was going on with Canada, the United States and several 
European countries.  To refresh people's memories, that was a 
negotiation to establish some kind of protocol for investment 
among these 20 or so countries.  The idea was that it would 
really encourage free trade in investment and some rules to 
protect companies that had invested in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into the merits of it at this point, but I do 
want to point out that at the time there were a number of 
meetings held around the country.  People were very concerned 
about this.  We all received mail.  They were not concerned about 
it based on what was in the agreement, because they had no idea 
of what was being negotiated.  They were concerned because they 
had no information.   Some groups, very irresponsible groups to 
my mind, were spreading disinformation about what this would mean 
to Canada.  They were scaring people.  They were suggesting that 
the world as we knew it would come to an end if we approved the 
MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government unfortunately thought that the way to 
handle this was to hide it from the public.  The result was that 
the government got exactly the opposite result it had hoped for. 
The government wanted the public to support it, I suppose, 
because at that time the trade minister spoke very much in favour 
of it, but of course when people do not have access to 
information, they tend to be afraid of an issue and concerned 
about it.  Those irresponsible groups spread all kinds of 
disinformation that fed upon that fear.  As a result, we received 
hundreds of letters from people saying they could not support the 
MAI because it would effectively give away Canada's sovereignty 
in all kinds of areas, which to my mind was complete nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it does not diminish at all the concerns of a 
lot of people, because they simply did not have the information. 
What it ultimately took to bring this issue to the House was the 
Reform Party actually proposing a supply day motion on the 
subject of the MAI so that for the first time it was debated in 
the House of Commons.  It took an opposition party to do it, and 
afterward the international trade minister said the government 
had debated it in the House of Commons so the government had been 
up front with people.  However, it took a motion from the Reform 
Party to do it. 
This government does not have a very good history when it comes 
to ensuring that people know about these sort of things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even more important, I think it betrays a philosophy of 
the government.  The philosophy of this government is to hide as 
much as it can from the public and to go about its business.  We 
see this over and over again.  The debate and vote the other 
night on the issue of the ethics watchdog is a perfect example of 
what I am talking about.  The government does not like democracy 
because it undermines its power.  It would much rather proceed 
about its business without the scrutiny of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members here to remember that we are elected by the 
people to be their watchdogs as to what is going on.  What 
happens when we do not have the chance to scrutinize these things 
in parliament, we lose our ability to be those watchdogs.  We 
cannot do our job as representatives of the people if the big 
issues that profoundly affect people's lives, such as free trade 
agreements and other international treaties like the 
international criminal court and others, are not discussed in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we get the information?  How do we have the benefit of 
hearing the debate if these things are not discussed in this 
place?  This place is supposed to be the home of democracy in 
Canada, the home of free speech, but the government does just 
about everything it can to avoid bringing these big issues here. 
That is unfortunate.  I think it is an affront to free speech and 
democracy.  It betrays an attitude that the government seems to 
work by that I think most people would find to be irresponsible. 
It would suggest that too many times that the government goes out 
of its way to purposely ignore the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other example, one of which is the Kyoto accord. 
Just to remind people, Kyoto was an agreement, that many 
countries were prepared to enter into, which would restrict 
emissions that supposedly contribute to the greenhouse effect and 
cause a raising of temperatures around the word, that sort of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we never got a chance to discuss it in this place.  In 
fact the government, to its credit, went and discussed it with 
the provinces.  Then, when its members went to Kyoto, they turned 
around and effectively stabbed the provinces in the back and 
agreed to something completely different from what they told the 
provinces they were willing to do.  They completely changed the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in a situation where the government ignored 
parliament completely.  It never even suggested for a moment that 
this agreement would come back to this place for a vote.  It also 
stabbed the provinces in the back and, in its inimitable way, 
managed to drive a wedge again between the federal and provincial 
governments and create some of that nastiness between the two 
that contributes to the unity problems that seem to be a 
perpetual state in Canada.  We now see it rearing its head in the 
west again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that, contrary to the benefit of Canadians, the 
government has ignored this place when it comes to discussing 
these sort of treaties and agreements.  The result is that people 
do not get the information they need, members of parliament are 
not allowed to do their jobs and, ultimately, I think the 
government enters into agreements that very often do not reflect 
the values and wishes of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members a third example, the example of the 
international criminal court.  The international criminal court 
is an agreement that Canada has signed on to that would really, 
to some degree, and I know this is in dispute, give up our 
sovereignty when it comes to our ability to set our own laws. 
Many people are concerned about multinational corporations which 
come and, they believe, erode our sovereignty. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the situation where Canada was prepared to sign away 
our ability to ensure that Canadian citizens were not protected 
under Canadian law, but in fact are now subject to a new 
international law? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is especially important for a country like Canada which is 
often engaged in peacekeeping operations.  What it effectively 
does is allow Canadian peacekeepers or, in cases of war, Canadian 
soldiers, to be subject to decisions by international courts that 
could completely strip away our ability to protect the people and 
have them tried by laws with which we agree, understand and which 
are a part of our tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern, which has also been raised by other countries, is 
what would happen if we entered into another conflict like Kosovo 
where we had Canadian soldiers fighting in that conflict or 
pilots flying CF-18s who may have bombed, even by accident, a 
civilian site.  We might lose our ability to protect them and 
ensure that they did not all of a sudden become subject to an 
accusation of a war crime.  That is the sort of thing that I 
think Canadians would be interested in having debated and 
discussed in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into the merits of the international criminal 
court.  I will simply make the point that the issues are serious 
enough that they should be debated in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean to be a democracy if issues that profoundly 
affect people's lives are not discussed in the forum where their 
elected representatives are supposed to discuss these things? 
When did we decide as a country that huge issues, like the ones I 
have just discussed, should be determined solely by a few people 
in the priorities and planning committee of cabinet on the 
government side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not democracy.  That is certainly not what the founders 
of our country envisioned when they set up the system that we 
have today.  I think a lot of people who have no interest in 
international treaties will agree that this place no longer is 
the type of democratic forum that was envisioned 133 years ago. 
It is no longer the type of place that people have confidence in 
when it comes to ensuring that their views and values are 
reflected through their members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons for that but certainly one of them 
is that governments do not bring big decisions to this place. 
That should end.  All the debate on the other side that we have 
heard so far has been a justification for the sorry position that 
we are in today.  What they have said so far is completely 
without merit.  No one can argue that the House of Commons should 
not be engaged in these sorts of serious issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having tried my best to make a case that we need to be engaged 
in these things and that these things have to come here for a 
vote, let me now make the case for the importance of free trade, 
which is the other element in this whole discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming up very quickly is the summit of the Americas meetings in 
Quebec City, which Canada will host and chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports in principle the concept of free 
trade.  We believe very much that free trade does leave people 
better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is even a more fundamental argument for 
supporting the idea of free trade.  In this day and age, when we 
hear much heady talk about the need for the respect of universal 
human rights, we too often ignore a very basic human right: the 
right to own, use and sell property.  It is a basic right.  I 
would argue that it is almost impossible to practice the other 
rights that we typically think of, such as the right to free 
speech, for instance, without that other basic right, the right 
to own, use and sell property.  Without that right there is no 
economic freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  If we have freedom of speech but the 
government owns all the printing presses or all the telephones 
and it is the one that decides who gets the printing presses and 
the telephones, then our right to free speech is severely 
limited. 
It is the same with many other freedoms:  the right to labour and 
the right to move around the country as we see fit.  Those are 
all completely abridged if we do not have that right to acquire 
and use property.  Too often we forget about that.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the argument that from a philosophical standpoint free 
trade makes sense.  It is a universal human right or the 
consequence of a universal human right, and that right is the 
right to own, use and enjoy property.  Remember the call of the 
glorious revolution of 1688 and John Locke:  the right to life, 
liberty and property.  I believe in it fundamentally and I think 
we should recognize it and respect it around the world.  I 
believe that is what is implied when we agree to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a moment about the evidence that supports the 
contention that free trade basically leaves people better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not bore the House by going into the details of how the 
Liberals opposed NAFTA, how they said that they would make big 
changes when they were elected, and, of course, never did, but I 
will point out one of the concerns raised on the other side 
during the NAFTA discussions.  The concern was that countries 
with cheaper labour costs would, on the one hand, undermine our 
ability to compete because they had cheap labour and, on the 
other hand, exploit us when it came to labour standards and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what members will find is that the record does not bear 
that out.  As we look at Mexico today under NAFTA, it is becoming 
more and more prosperous.  It has a larger middle class than 
Canada, believe it or not.  One reason for that is the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and the free exchange of 
goods and services, the efficiencies that it creates and the 
ability of people who have been desperately poor in the past to 
finally climb out of the trap of poverty created by barriers to 
trade.  We have to start to remove those barriers.  That is why 
free trade makes so much sense.  We see more and more evidence of 
it all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from across the way pointed out that the UN said that 
we must start to liberalize trade around the world.  The poorest 
countries in the world are the ones with the most trade barriers. 
If we look at Africa, which is so desperately poor and those 
people need our help, it has the highest barriers to trade.  It 
is a country that rejects free markets.  It rejects the 
fundamental freedom to use property and trade as one sees fit as 
long as the equal rights of others to do the same are not 
impeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is very clear that we have to start to lower the 
barriers.  When we do we will all be better off.  Initially, we 
see a situation where labour standards are very low and the 
environment is in trouble.  However, what we find is that when 
countries get better off they put more and more money into those 
things and the environment improves, labour standards rise, 
people make more money and employers have an interest in ensuring 
that their people are safe because they do not want to pay 
workers' compensation.  Those are all the things that we take for 
granted in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that we need to have free trade because it makes sense. 
It helps people everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is that Canada has to practise what it preaches. 
In Canada today we still have trade barriers that make it 
impossible for third world countries to trade into Canada.  That 
is a huge hypocrisy.  Tariffs are very high for instance on 
textiles, something that third world countries could produce.  If 
we allowed that to happen we would be helping them far more than 
by just giving them aid like we so often do.  We would give them 
the basis for an economy that would leave their people much 
better off.  There are many examples of tariffs that are 
currently in place in Canada that impede the ability of these 
third world countries to trade into Canada but also for us to go 
and establish markets there and leave our people better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would argue that this House needs to be the 
place where these things are discussed first and foremost.  It 
would probably to some degree end this end run around democracy 
that we have now, where these unelected, unaccountable NGOs run 
to the government to have their voices heard. 
However, if they knew they could have their voices heard here 
they would do it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, free trade is a good thing.  It leaves people better off 
and it is the compassionate thing to do.  For that reason, I urge 
the government to support this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague, the 
critic for foreign affairs, for an eloquent speech on a number of 
issues.  He brought up many pressing points and I hope the 
government was listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of areas that I would like his advice on as 
the previous finance critic for the party.  The first one 
concerns barriers to trade.  I would like him to address the 
issue of Canada's foreign policy with respect to how we should be 
more aggressive at removing the barriers to trade with developing 
countries and that we should remove double taxation issues with 
respect to our country and developing countries.  Double taxation 
is actually something that restricts the ability of companies to 
be more aggressive in terms of their dealings and bilateral trade 
between two nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is barriers to trade within Canada.  We have 
more barriers to trade east-west than we have north-south.  I am 
sure the public would find it absolutely appalling that it is 
more difficult for my province of British Columbia to trade with 
Quebec or Ontario than it is for us to trade with the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, I ask the previous finance critic to comment on a question 
I posed to the government on the issue of how we can deal with 
short term capital flows which are so destabilizing to the 
international community.  It is something we have been unable to 
deal with.  There has been a proposal by the NDP to apply the 
Tobin tax to this issue.  While it is an utterly imperfect 
solution to the problem, at least it is a move to bring this to 
the forefront.  We absolutely have to deal with the way we deal 
with short term capital flows in this globalized market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague would have any thoughts on how we can 
help to limit that so we allow capital flows to occur without 
making them a destabilizing factor in our growing globalized 
economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, let me deal with 
the last issue he raised.  I may have to disagree with him a 
little bit on this.  He raised the issue of short term capital 
flows and suggested that they were very destabilizing, especially 
when they occurred I expect during the Asian economic crisis 
couple of years ago.  That bears some discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I would make about that is really what those 
short term capital flows reflected was a fundamental problem in 
that country.  It may have been in some cases a situation where 
banks were out on a limb when it came to holding the paper of, 
for instance, a lot of banks that simply could not be supported. 
At some point investors become very nervous and they see it as a 
disaster in the making and pull their capital out of that 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is that we know that some of these countries 
are willing to put barriers in place to stop that from happening. 
Very often investors will want to get their money out of there 
before those barriers are put in place to stop them from getting 
their money out.  In some ways I would argue that the ability of 
countries to put these barriers up act as a catalyst and actually 
make the problem worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would make is that this is only a symptom of 
the real problem.  The real problem is what needs to be 
addressed.  The short term capital flows are the symptom.  The 
real problem is poor financial management in these countries. 
Very often it is crony capitalism where government and private 
institutions or private companies become completely integrated 
and decisions are not made on the basis of market signals.  They 
are made on the basis of decisions that involve concerns of the 
government.  They have political concerns and they are not always 
interested in the interests of their people.  Sometimes they make 
decisions that simply benefit their political interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that those are the first problems that need to be 
resolved.  If those sorts of problems are resolved, the issue of 
short term capital flows will become I think less critical.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I would make is if people are investors and they 
invest in that country, does it make sense that those people 
should have to have their investments locked into that country, 
knowing that the currency will probably devalue terribly and 
their investment may be completely wiped out.  That is the other 
side of the coin.  The situation the investors are in is that 
they could see their investments completely wiped out.  Remember 
that we all now have the ability to invest in other countries 
through merging market funds and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a second point with respect to barriers to trade. 
Canada is engaged in a gross hypocrisy right now.  On the one 
hand, we say that we care and that is why we want to give all 
kinds of aid to other countries.  It is necessary that we give 
that aid.  I understand that.  We believe in humanitarian and 
developmental aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we should not say that we care very much on the one 
hand by offering aid and on the other hand say that we are going 
to block the ability of these countries to develop their own 
economies by putting in place barriers that prohibit the export 
of textiles from whatever developing country it is into Canada. 
This is a perfect example because textiles are something that are 
easy for those developing countries to produce.  However, we make 
it impossible for them to get on their feet by putting these 
barriers in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we say on the one hand we care, but on the other hand 
make it impossible for them to sell into our market?  That is 
hypocrisy and that kind of thing should end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I know Mr. Speaker is new in the chair, but the tradition 
in the House, when people are rising on questions and 
comments from a party other than the person who has given the 
main speech, is to recognize members from other 
parties.  If members from other parties do not stand, then it is 
fair ball to recognize members from the same party as the 
speaker.  However, that is not the case in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  What happened a while 
ago was when I asked for questions or comments only two members 
from the Canadian Alliance stood up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I just stood now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Yes, but that was before 
your intervention.  Now that you stood up I should have 
recognized you instead of the other hon. member.  However, now 
that the mistake has been made I still have to honour my word and 
give the floor to the member for Calgary East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure we will be hearing a speech from my NDP colleague 
and his points of view, which I know very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague over here this question.  Today's 
motion talks about transparency regarding the elected officials 
looking at international agreements.  At no time have we talked 
about consultation with the provinces or the provinces having a 
right to look at international agreements and making it part of 
where they give their own approvals because it impacts them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, Australia has a joint session where it consults 
the provinces and then it puts its stamp on international 
agreements.  I would appreciate his thoughts on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try and be brief 
to accommodate my friend from the NDP.  Simply, in Canada's 
constitution the provinces are responsible for all kinds of 
things, including natural resources, which can be profoundly 
impacted by free trade agreements.  It makes sense, it would be a 
courtesy and it would help unity if the federal government would 
come down off its high horse once in a while and honestly engage 
in some kind of discussion with the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am sorry I did not get to ask the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
a question but that is the way it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak on behalf of the NDP caucus to this Bloc 
Quebecois motion.  We welcome the motion and support it.  We are 
somewhat surprised by the apparent reluctance of the government 
to support the motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the motion calls for is really no less and no more than 
what the Conservative government did in 1988 when it put before 
the House the elements of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement 
which had been negotiated.  The negotiations were over.  The 
elements of the agreement were put to the House of Commons for a 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the Liberal government at this point would refuse to 
indicate a willingness to do the same with any FTAA agreement is 
quite beyond me.  It is not just a question of transparency 
leading up to the negotiations or how many papers are on the 
website.  At the moment there are only four papers out of nine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to indicate, Mr. Speaker, that I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, it is not just a question of what happens leading 
up to negotiations, it is also a question of what happens, God 
forbid from our point of view, that these negotiations should 
actually ever be completed and we should have a free trade area 
of the Americas agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Liberal government really saying in its response to the 
Bloc motion that it would not put such an agreement to the House 
of Commons for debate and a vote?  Is that really the position of 
the Liberals on this?  They have not made it clear. They have 
done a lot of talking about what they are doing now and have 
tried to give an air of adequacy to what really has so far been a 
quite inadequate process.  Perhaps we could have some clarity on 
that.  We know the Liberals are always interested in clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could get some clarity from the Liberals on what 
their position would be should there ever be an FTAA agreement 
and whether or not it would come before the House.  If they are 
prepared to make that commitment, then why would they not vote 
for the Bloc motion and we could establish once and for all that 
this would be the process should there ever be an agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is that in this country, and I think it has 
been pointed out by a previous speaker, the treaty making power 
lies with the crown rather than with parliament.  We have far too 
many examples of Canadian governments being able to enter into 
treaties and to renegotiate and amend treaties without ever 
having to come to parliament, not just with respect to free 
trade, but also for instance with respect to NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only country of all the NATO countries that did not 
have a motion put in its national parliament to debate and ratify 
for instance the expansion of NATO.  All other 14 countries of 
the then 15 NATO countries had a debate and a vote.  Even in the 
U.K. where it has the same system as us and it does not actually 
have to have a vote and a debate, had one.  It is only in Canada 
where the government and the Prime Minister presume make these 
kinds of agreements on behalf of the whole country without 
involving parliamentarians in any meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to what the Bloc members had to say about 
their own motion.  I must say I think this does reflect an 
evolution in the Bloc Quebecois' position with respect to free 
trade.  We know for a fact that free trade was very popular in 
Quebec in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in 1992 and 1993 leading up to the NAFTA, I recall an 
occasion in the House where the NDP moved a motion critical of 
NAFTA, calling on the House not to sign a North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the Bloc members at that time voted with the 
government against the NDP.  They even voted against a Liberal 
amendment at that time which said such an agreement might be okay 
if it included provisions for the protection of workers and the 
environment.  Still the Bloc voted with the Conservative 
government against that amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the position of the various leaders within the Quebec 
sovereignty movement.  Jacques Parizeau is a very big fan of free 
trade and the free trade agreements.  As Mr. Parizeau is want to 
do, sometimes he boasted about the effect free trade would have 
on Canada and the fact that it would break down east-west ties 
and erode the strength of Canada as a country and therefore make 
it easier for sovereignty to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the backdrop for the Bloc motion today.  I think what is 
happening within the Bloc, if I might be permitted this analysis, 
is that it is finally dawning on sovereignists in Quebec what the 
NDP and others outside of parliament have been saying about the 
effect of free trade agreements on the sovereignty of all 
legislatures, whether they be national parliaments or they be 
subnational legislatures.  The insight about the effect of free 
trade agreements on the sovereignty of such bodies is finally 
beginning to get through to sovereignists in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They see that there is not much point in debating sovereignty in 
a federal-provincial context if at the same time one is 
complacent or even complicit in the development of these 
supernational institutions, these free trade agreements and world 
trade agreements that in the end render the sovereignty of Canada 
or the potential sovereignty of Quebec almost meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect I would call the attention of the House to a 
letter written only a week or two ago by the California state 
legislature to United States trade representative, Mr. Zoellick. 
It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the legislative representatives of the world's sixth largest 
economy, we write to express our concern about the impact of 
certain trade policies on the institution in which we serve and 
on important democratic norms.  We recognize that the United 
States constitution grants the federal government power to 
conduct foreign relations.  We also recognize the economic 
importance of trade to California and the role that trade can 
play in fostering positive relationships between nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned, however, that as presently administered the 
North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade 
Organization agreements diminish the sovereignty of states such 
as California, and in so doing, shift decision making power from 
elected officials to unelected international trade officials.  In 
the paragraphs that follow we detail the reasons for our concern. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this is the critical issue with respect to 
these free trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Bloc speeches and there was appropriate 
criticism of free trade agreements as having created polarization 
between the rich and the poor, not ensuring that the so-called 
benefits of free trade are evenly or justly distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis that is not the main complaint against 
free trade.  We could debate the so-called economic benefits. 
There are winners and losers.  I happen to think that there are 
more losers than winners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real loser in all these free trade agreements is democracy. 
That is why I would have felt better if members of the Bloc would 
have made it clear that they were against these agreements in 
principle.  The real loser in these agreements is the ability of 
all governments, whether they be federal or provincial, to act in 
the public interest, whether that be acting in the public 
interest with respect to the environment, food safety, labour 
standards, protection of water exports, protection of cultural 
diversity, or whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real loser when it comes to these agreements is democracy 
and the sovereignty of democratic states and democratic 
subnational states such as Quebec or other Canadian provinces, as 
well as states in other countries.  This is something that I 
simply cannot get through the thick, right wing skulls of my 
Alliance colleagues.  They are concerned about the power of 
parliament.  They are always going on and on about the power of 
parliament.  Parliament is being gutted every day by these 
agreements, and no one over there seems to care.

government, so I would like to ask him a question and seek to 
provide some clarity on the process as we understand it on this 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government negotiates trade agreements to promote Canadian 
trade interests based on extensive consultations with Canadians, 
NGOs, parliamentary committee and business organizations, et

interests of the country would that agreement be signed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process in all these agreements to which the member has 
referred is that parliament was asked to approve the agreement 
after a careful review and debate of the implementing 
legislation.  That is the normal process that has been followed 
in the House of Commons throughout Canadian history.  It is a 
process that will be followed in this very important negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the member's confusion.  I hope that the 
reiteration of what has been our policy since Confederation 
clarifies matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question.  Does he not see the 
Bloc motion as written as rather vague, as wanting to create a 
situation that was referred to earlier by the chair of the 
standing committee?  It would seek to change the Canadian 
constitution in effect and create something that has never 
existed in the House throughout our entire history.  Does he not 
see that as the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not think that 
arguments about change were sort of prima facie inadmissible on 
the floor of the House of Commons.  If nothing can be changed, 
why does anyone run for office?  Why not just freeze the status 
quo in some kind of political suspended animation?  Of course 
they are making an argument for change, but I also think that it 
is not that radical a change.  It is not that different from the 
way I remember it in 1988, where we had an opportunity to debate 
and vote on the elements of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, it had been signed by Simon Reisman, but whether or not 
it was ratified until after parliament had its say probably bears 
some checking by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, if I am wrong on the facts with respect to 1988, I 
do not think I am wrong, in my opinion or in the Bloc's opinion, 
on the principle of the matter, that before anything is finally 
ratified it should in fact come before the House of Commons.  If 
that is a difference between what the Canadian practice has been 
and what the motion calls for, so be it. Perhaps we should change 
the way we do things around here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before asking 
my question, I would like to point out a number of facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Bloc stands up for the consensus in the Quebec 
civil society, and among parliamentarians. I have had the 
opportunity to address this issue. The institutions committee of 
the National Assembly published a report with which we totally 
agree and which I commend to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is not to be against economic integration or market 
openness, since developing countries in the south are as much 
entitled to development as developed countries in the north. 
However, this economic integration must follow some rules, and 
we want those rules to be included in the agreement and access 
to the benefits of the agreement to be given in the respect of 
those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before asking my question, I will conclude by saying that 
Mr. Parizeau has been one of the fiercest opponents to the 
multilateral investment agreement. He even wrote a small book on 
the subject, which I would gladly offer to the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to return to the issue of social and labour 
rights. I am wondering what the position of the New Democratic 
Party is on the inclusion of those rights in the current 
negotiation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our position with respect 
to social rights is that they ought to be part and parcel of any 
trade agreement the government enters into.  We sometimes wonder 
whether or not agreements which have as their basic assumption 
the whole notion of free trade or any such clauses, even if they 
are inserted into such agreements, could be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member that when the WTO implementing 
legislation was before the House it was the NDP in 1994, not the 
Bloc, that moved amendments to that legislation which called on 
the government to work toward a social clause in the WTO and to 
report progress back to the House, although I would say that the 
Bloc supported our motion with respect to the social clause at 
that time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the question is still open as to whether or not simply 
inserting these social clauses into these agreements is enough. 
From the point of view of the NDP the basic philosophy of these 
agreements is simply wrong.  They are designed by and for 
multinational corporations to inhibit the power of government not 
just with respect to social policy or labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we were to adopt either the side agreements or social 
clauses these agreements would still be objectionable to us 
because the very principle of them is to enshrine the power of 
the marketplace over against the power of governments to act in 
the public interest.  Creating a few exceptions and a few fancy 
clauses here and there will just not do the trick as far as we 
are concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to follow the member for Winnipeg—Transcona and 
speak today in support of this important motion. A very basic 
principle is being established in the motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government bring any draft 
agreement on the Free Trade Zone of the Americas before the House 
so that it may be debated and put to a vote before ratification 
by the Government of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat surprising that a motion that deals with such a 
fundamental principle of debate within the House of Commons is 
something that has to be brought forward by an opposition party. 
It begs the question and highlights for us the gravity of the 
situation we are facing as the Government of Canada enters into 
these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade area of the Americas, or the FTAA as it is known, 
equals NAFTA, the WTO, GATT and the MAI all rolled into one very 
powerful piece of trade legislation that has nothing to do with 
freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has everything to do with a transfer of massive powers from 
democratically elected governments to transnational corporations 
and a globalized corporate agenda which is about the suppression 
of democracy.  That is the fundamental point that needs to be 
made.  That is why any document or agreement on the FTAA must be 
brought to the House to be debated by members of the House and by 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental purpose of these agreements is to constrain all 
levels of government.  We are not just talking about a national 
government or provincial governments, but even at the municipal 
level.  Their purpose is to restrain all governments in their 
delivery of services and to allow transnational corporations 
access to public services, whether it be health care, hospitals, 
home care, dental care, child care, elder care, education, social 
assistance, environmental protection programs, transportation or 
culture.  Those are the programs very much at threat as a result 
of the proposed FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to quote the chair of the Council of Canadians who 
recently produced a very excellent report consisting of 40 pages 
entitled “The Free Trade Area of the Americas and the Threat to 
Social Programs, Environmental Sustainability and Social Justice 
in Canada and the Americas”. Ms. Barlow is well known for her 
work in providing education and awareness of the threat posed by 
these agreements.  In the section outlining what impact there 
will be from the FTAA on Canadians she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expanded powers proposed for the FTAA in combination with 
Chapter 11 of NAFTA and the introduction of “universal coverage 
of all service sectors” pose a grave threat to Canada's social 
programs.  Universal health care, public education, child care, 
pensions, social assistance and many other social services are 
now delivered by governments on a not-for-profit basis. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the recent GATS negotiations, and now the FTAA 
negotiations, Canada has always maintained that these social 
programs were a fundamental right of citizenship for all 
Canadians, and have exempted them from trade agreements. However, 
with these two agreements, the Canadian government is opening up 
itself, and every other level of government, to trade-sanctioned 
threats by transnational service corporations keen to break down 
the existing government monopolies in the hemisphere. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That lays out very clearly what we are facing in this round of 
negotiations.  Of particular concern to us in the NDP, outlined 
by my colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona, are the investor state 
provisions that again are included in what is being proposed in 
this FTAA round of negotiations.  This is something similar to 
what we have seen in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, in the NDP minority report produced in October 1999 we 
laid out very clearly what the impact is of investor state 
provisions and what has already happened in Canada as a result of 
those provisions being included in chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from my colleague's minority report in which he 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have already seen how such a mechanism can be used by 
foreign investors to intimidate and sue their elected 
governments.  Last year, U.S. based Ethyl Corporation 
successfully used the NAFTA investor-state procedure to extract 
$19 million from Canadian taxpayers, and to force the Canadian 
government to rescind its ban on the potentially toxic gasoline 
additive MMT. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what has already taken place under chapter 11.  There 
are now other challenges underway, including one from Sun Belt 
Water Inc. in California that is looking to leave Canadians on 
the hook for as much as $10.5 billion U.S.  That again brings us 
back to the issue of what is threatened under the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I am very concerned about is the impact on 
municipalities.  Right now in Vancouver, where I am from, a case 
taking place before the B.C. supreme court is a challenge by the 
Mexican government as a result of an earlier decision made by a 
NAFTA dispute panel in August 2000 in favour of the U.S. based 
Metalclad Corporation, which was seeking to locate a toxic waste 
plant in a town in Mexico.  The local community and the national 
government opposed it.  This is now again being challenged under 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of these trade agreements on local communities and 
their ability to control their own environment and health and the 
well-being of their own citizens is something that is very 
seriously undermined and would be completely violated if these 
particular agreements go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend my remaining minutes talking about the 
democratic process.  It seems to me that one of the real signs of 
hope as we take on this struggle of trying to defeat these 
agreements has been the rise in the level of activism, 
particularly among young people.  As we know, already there are 
incredible plans and campaigns underway to demonstrate, to rally, 
to educate and to build public awareness about just what is at 
stake in April in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we have is that while on the one hand we have the 
Prime Minister in China finally raising the issue of human rights 
in that country, what are the Prime Minister and the government 
prepared to do to defend people's human rights here in Canada? 
All indications are that we are now in the process of setting up 
a police state, a state of security around this international 
conference, to prevent citizens from being heard, from being 
seen, from being able to assemble and from having the right to 
free speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we have seen before in Canada with APEC and 
the people's summit and the pepper spraying that took place.  We 
are again seeing the those kinds of preparations being made to 
prevent people from exercising their democratic rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is important, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. 
We have to stop these agreements, we have to defeat them and we 
have to defend the rights of citizens to organize, to mobilize 
and to speak out against these agreements.  In supporting this 
motion, I hope all members of the House will go further and 
ensure that people who come from across Canada and want to take 
up this issue in Quebec City will not be denied their democratic 
rights to express their opinions about what these agreements are 
about and what kinds of threats they pose to our democratic 
system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to the comments of our colleague from the New 
Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, like her and like most of the members here, I 
know very little about these negotiations.  Everything is 
secret.  The discussions are kept incommunicado and we do not 
know what the talks are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides all the concerns expressed earlier by my colleagues on 
this side of the House, one issue worries me especially. 
Maybe it is no longer the case, but the member made a brief 
reference to that situation earlier. I wonder what a country 
like  Canada will gain from such negotiations, when we know what 
is going on in some countries which, out of courtesy, I will not 
name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a few years ago, in the copper mines of a certain 
South American country, children, young girls, worked in water 
and mud up to their waist, carrying pails of the clay soil from 
which copper is extracted. These six, seven or eight year old 
children suffer from arthritis just like old people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague worries about that.  Why should we 
negotiate a free trade agreement with countries where citizens 
are treated that way? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's thoughtful 
question gets to the point of another major concern around the 
negotiation of these agreements, that is, they have been so often 
characterized as a race to the bottom.  Environmental standards, 
labour standards, and standards that protect the health and 
well-being of a community and ensure that children are not 
exploited for their labour go out the window.  All of these very 
important fundamental principles of human dignity and human 
respect are basically abandoned as a result of these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not empty words.  There is mounting global evidence 
about the impact on local communities of other agreements that 
have been negotiated, particularly on communities in developing 
countries that become beholden to these multinational 
corporations that go in and destroy the environment and local 
culture and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question certainly highlights this very destructive 
aspect of these agreements and I share his concern.  It is 
another reason why the motion should be approved:  so that we can 
have a full debate in the House on the impact of the FTAA, not 
just in Canada but in all of the Americas and indeed globally. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to the Bloc member who is saying all of this is secret, I would 
be happy to give him the address of the website which he 
obviously does not know exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to my colleague from the NDP is simply this:  what 
is her response to the following statement? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now widespread acceptance that, in the long run, the 
expansion of international trade and integration into the world 
economy are necessary instruments for promoting economic growth 
and reducing and eradicating poverty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quote comes from a recently released UN report.  How can the 
member tell us that international trade is not important in 
addressing the problem of poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to respond 
to that question because I do not believe that I or any of my 
colleagues in the NDP have said that this debate is about 
stopping international trade. 
International trade is very important to our global community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before the House and before the government on behalf 
of the Canadian people is what rules will be established for that 
international trade.  As the hon. member knows, our concern, 
which should be his concern as well, is that these agreements 
basically transfer authority and power from democratically 
elected governments to multinational corporations that are 
completely undemocratic.  Therefore, the realm of trade and 
decisions around the programs we have are completely outside of 
any elected body.  That is our concern, and I think the hon. 
member knows that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly a pleasure to play a role in this debate.  I must 
tell the House that it takes me back to 1988, when I was elected 
after a very controversial election that was totally based on 
free trade.  The Progressive Conservative Party totally supported 
free trade.  We in our party advocated it and proposed it and the 
Liberal candidates were all opposed to it.  There were all those 
terrible stories about what was going to happen to our 
sovereignty, our water, our resources and all the gloom and doom 
that was going to fall on Canada because of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are 12 years later and the Liberals are proposing to 
enhance free trade.  Members will have to excuse me if I find 
this ironic.  In December 1988 we came to the House day and night 
to argue the pros and cons of free trade.  Into the middle of the 
night we argued, with the Liberals saying that free trade was 
going to kill Canada, that it was going to take away our 
sovereignty, our water, all our assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that time I remember a then new member of parliament in the 
Liberal Party, a member who is now their federal minister of 
agriculture and who used to stay in the same apartment I did.  We 
walked home at one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning.  As we 
were walking home one night, I said I wondered what would happen 
if our parties switched positions on free trade.  In a very 
prophetic manner, the now minister of agriculture said that they 
would just stand up and argue the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the Liberals are doing.  We have not 
changed our position but the Liberals have certainly changed 
theirs.   I do not think these flip-flops help our case as a 
country but we should not be surprised, because in that campaign 
the Liberals also promised to do away with the GST, the horrible 
tax.  Suddenly when they were in power they said that perhaps it 
was not so bad and doubled it.  In Atlantic Canada the GST went 
from 7% to 15% and the Liberals now call it the HST.  This is the 
tax that they were going to tear up, that they were going to do 
away with.  However, that is a flip-flop and that is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course there was the flip-flop on the ethics counsellor. 
The Liberals promised, in writing, to make the counsellor 
independent, and just two days ago all but two Liberal members 
voted against their own motion, against their promise to 
Canadians to establish an independent ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amazing reversals hurt the image of parliamentarians and 
are part of the reason why people do not hold parliamentarians or 
politicians in general in high esteem.  In fact, if people in the 
private sector made promises and commitments like this and did 
not honour them they would not survive.  Somehow this party does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of flip-flops, the Reform Party also made some pretty 
strong promises in their former campaigns.  One of those promises 
was that Reform members were going to bring new decorum to the 
House of Commons.  Of course we know what they brought to the 
House, and that was mariachi bands.  They were going to do away 
with Stornoway and maybe turn it into a bingo hall, but I suggest 
that we check and see who the inhabitant is at Stornoway now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate flip-flop is one which I felt personally in 1993. I 
was defeated in 1993 because the Conservative vote was split. The 
big argument then was the gold plated pension plan.  Of course we 
know they have now flip-flopped on that and have adopted the gold 
plated pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday their only appointed senator moved a motion that he 
take over the Senate opposition party and be the official 
opposition.  This is from an Alliance Party that is totally 
opposed to the Senate and especially to appointed senators.  Now 
their only appointed senator wants to take it over.  It is 
incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people talk about Brian Mulroney, what he did and what 
his track record was, but I want to point out that Brian Mulroney 
and the Conservatives said that if Canadians voted for them they 
would bring them free trade.  Whether Canadians liked it or not 
is not the issue. 
He made a commitment and he followed through on the commitment. 
He said that if Canadians voted Conservative he would bring in 
free trade, and he did.  He said that if people voted for the 
Conservatives he would change the manufacturers' sales tax, and 
he did that.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in contrast to the Liberals who said that if Canadians 
voted for them they would tear up free trade.  They did not tear 
it up; they enhanced it.  They also told Canadians to vote for 
them and they would do away with the GST.  They did not do away 
with it; they doubled it.  Those flip-flops and reversals of 
position are very harmful to all of us, and the government should 
try to be more consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to the opposition motion, which we as a party 
agree with.  Perhaps we should not need the motion. Under normal 
terms and former times we would not need the motion. However this 
all falls into line with the many calls for parliamentary reform. 
If we could go back to former days when parliamentarians 
actually had a say on issues, when we had input in committees and 
in the House of Commons and a say on policy, then we would not 
need to have opposition days and probably would not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the motion because we have no other input into 
bills.  We are not against free trade at all.  The Conservative 
Party brought free trade to the country and to the government. We 
do not want to stop it.  We do not want to tie the hands of 
officials.  However every member here has different challenges, 
different cultures and different situations.  Every member of 
parliament should have a say in an agreement as important as the 
free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is simple things like committees.  In former 
times committees were made of up members of parliament who 
actually had a say and had input.  We could influence policy and 
direction.  However, in all the committees with which I was 
involved in the last parliament they were totally an arm of the 
minister.  The chair was decided by the minister.  The subjects 
for discussion were determined by the minister.  The votes were 
controlled by the ministers.  The parliamentary secretary was 
always there to tell the Liberals how to vote and they always did 
exactly what they were told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Liberal members who was a former teacher said that 
the committee system reminded him of kindergarten, where teachers 
create busy work to keep the students busy.  That was his vision 
of a committee: busy work, something to keep members of 
parliament busy.  If members had the power to choose our chair, 
choose our own subjects and have free votes in committees, we 
could actually do a lot of good work and would not have to have 
opposition days like today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no confidence in the Liberal Party to negotiate the free 
trade agreement of the Americas.  First, the Liberal Party was 
totally against free trade.  How can a party that is totally 
against free trade establish a concept that is viable and 
workable?  If the party is against it, how can it do that?  It 
creates all kinds of questions when members of a party, who were 
totally against the trade policy in a former life, turn around 
and say that everyone should stay out if it, that it should be 
left up to them because they will do it and do it right.  This 
creates a lot of problems for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have not been very successful at trade agreements 
lately.  I want to bring up a couple of examples.  Certainly the 
ban on Brazilian beef and the way that was handled will turn out 
to be a major embarrassment to our country and our government. 
For two years officials at Health Canada said that they thought 
there might be a problem but that they could not get information. 
They did not do anything about it, even though for two years 
they thought there might be a problem with mad cow disease 
potentially coming to Canada through Brazilian beef. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough, the day after the Canadian government learned 
that the Brazilian government was taking the issue of the 
aviation industry to the WTO, it imposed a ban on Brazilian beef. 
For two years the Liberal government did nothing about the beef 
issue, but when something happened at the WTO that it did not 
like it brought in the ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again there was no consultation with the House or with the 
committees.  The government just brought in the very significant 
ban on Brazilian beef which will impact on all Canadian trade to 
Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now demonstrations all through Brazil.  Ships are tied 
up.  Ships that are on the ocean cannot unload because of the 
Brazilian beef ban, which was not handled properly.  Proper 
notice was not given.  Parliament was not consulted.  No 
committees were advised.  The government just did it and no 
questions were asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There either was a health risk for two years that the government 
did nothing about, or the ban on Brazilian beef is strictly a 
trade issue.  However, it is an example of how not to handle a 
trade issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example, which has not yet happened but which is in 
incubation, is the softwood lumber issue.  This is incredibly 
important for Canada.  There are 337 communities where 50% of the 
economy, the lifeblood of the community, depends on the forestry 
industry.  It is a critical issue yet right now the government is 
in limbo on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know whether it will ask the government of the United 
States to renew the softwood agreement, whether it will let it go 
to free trade or whether the memorandum of understanding for the 
Atlantic provinces will be renewed, continued or what.  We are in 
total limbo.  There have been no consultations and no 
information. We do not know which way the government is going. 
Again, there has been no consultation or involvement of MPs on 
such a critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a tremendous effort by the American industry to 
put countervail charges and tariffs on Canadian lumber on March 
31 when the softwood lumber agreement ends, yet we have no idea 
what will take its place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few questions on the softwood lumber issue for the 
parliamentary secretary if he has the opportunity to answer them. 
I would like to know what the government's position is on the 
memorandum of understanding for Atlantic Canada.  I would like to 
know if we are as a government trying to renew the softwood 
lumber agreement.  I would like to know if the government will 
include all the parties involved, like the Maritime Lumber 
Bureau, in every step of the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some examples of what I call failed trade 
negotiations.  It does not give me a lot of confidence in that 
group over there to negotiate a new free trade agreement of the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives are fundamentally in favour of free trade.  It 
was our concept in the first place.  We brought it to Canada, 
against strong opposition at the time.  We are in favour of it. 
However we also know that every province and every industrial 
sector has to be involved with the negotiations all the way 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, after all, a major trading nation.  Forty-six per cent 
of our GDP comes from exports, as opposed to countries like the 
United States that are at 11%.  Our export trade amounts to $2.2 
billion every single day. Exports affect our standard of living, 
our culture and our position of influence in the world.  It has 
to be done right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World trading blocks are changing as well.  We have to keep up 
to date with other parts of the world like the European community 
which is now trading as a bloc and not country to country.  It 
does not trade as Germany, France or Italy but as a bloc, a 
continent, a uniform group.   We must adapt to that. That is why 
we support the principle of the free trade agreement of the 
Americas but we must be consultation with MPs, and the committee 
has to have information available to it and be able to influence 
the decision and direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only about money and it is not only about business. 
The free trade agreement of the Americas will be of great concern 
to a lot of Canadians in a lot of areas.  Many Canadians are 
concerned about our water, about human rights in other countries, 
about environmental standards and rules in other countries and 
about health standards.  All these issues can be discussed as 
part of the free trade of the Americas if it is done right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make sure that is part of it.  We want to make sure 
the committee is open to these subjects and is able to bring in 
witnesses that have strong opinions on all aspects of the free 
trade agreement.  We will be pushing for that in committee. We 
want all subjects on the table.  We want all the MPs involved 
with the debate as well as members of the provincial legislatures 
and each industrial sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the agreement is signed it cannot be changed.  There are 34 
countries involved.  We can hardly get a decision by one 
government here to change, much less by 34 governments. Therefore 
it must be done in advance.  That is why the opposition day is so 
valuable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do support free trade and we support the motion to bring the 
debate to the House prior to ratification.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me take the 
opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment to the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with some interest to my colleague's comments and, 
indeed, he is right.  I confess to be one of those who in 1988 
was extremely dubious about free trade and whether it would be 
good for Canada.  Clearly it has been.  That is very evident.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government, most Canadians and most 
parliamentarians support free trade, with the exception of 
members of the NDP whose position everybody knows before they 
even speak on it.  They support it because they know it is good 
for the Canadian economy.  They know it will help eradicate 
poverty, as the United Nations has recently pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that he and his party agree with the Bloc 
motion.  However, in citing the example of 1988, how can he now 
support a process which is not what the Mulroney government of 
the day followed? Our proposed process is the same as the one 
used by that government of the day.  It includes a full review of 
the enabling legislation open to debate and open to opportunities 
for amendment.  That is how change would come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the member support a process which is so radically 
different from that which his own government followed in 1988? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his excellent questions and for the comment that he 
did listen with some interest to my words.  I also acknowledge 
that I appreciate him saying now that he agrees with Brian 
Mulroney's policy.  It is good for Liberal members to say they 
agree with Brian Mulroney's policy, that they were wrong and 
Brian Mulroney was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the very distinguished Minister of Industry, who is 
very influential, said the same.  He now agrees with Brian 
Mulroney, that Brian Mulroney was right and they were wrong.  It 
was refreshing to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary listened to my speech he will 
know that I asked questions about the government and its support 
for the memorandum of understanding on the softwood lumber 
agreement for Atlantic Canada.  I wonder if he supports that.  If 
he gets another chance to stand I would like him to answer that 
and to state exactly what is the position of the government on 
the softwood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his question, we had the ultimate consultation.  The 
parliamentary secretary challenged me to suggest that we would 
follow the same process.  I challenge him to follow the same 
process and hold an election entirely on free trade like we did 
in 1988.  If he follows the process I will be right there with 
him and will run against him, and we will see how it works out. 
That was our process, the ultimate consultation.  We consulted 
with every Canadian who could vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, I congratulate my 
colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party on his 
re-election to the House and on his appointment as trade critic 
for his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If memory serves, on November 27 the government was resoundingly 
re-elected by Canadians.  The Canadian public knows full well 
what our position is on free trade and what it has been since we 
have been in office.  I submit to my colleague that he had his 
answer very clearly from the Canadian people, that they support 
the initiatives of the government vis-à-vis free trade and many 
other initiatives we have undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to his question on softwood lumber, I have 
addressed it a couple of times in the House but am happy to 
reiterate it for him now.  The government is very clear that 
nobody in Canada wants to see the current deal extended or 
another deal such as the current one struck again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ultimate goal of the Canadian government on softwood lumber 
is very clear: free trade in lumber with the United States.  Why? 
It is the surest way to achieve fairness for all the provinces 
and for all Canadians involved in the lumber business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
question.  As to why the Liberals were re-elected, I cannot 
answer that question.  I do not understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that everyone in Canada knows our position on free 
trade.  I do not think that is right.  I do not think they know. 
I do not think they know the government's position on a lot of 
things, like the softwood lumber issue or the national missile 
defence system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why they were re-elected.  It is a puzzle to me 
and certainly I do not think Canadians know where the government 
stands on hardly anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to jump in at this point having 
listened to the exchange between the Conservatives and the 
Liberals, both of whom I think bear a great deal of culpability 
for the dire consequences and side effects of the free trade 
approach by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about the Conservatives, who really 
pioneered NAFTA, or the Liberals, who were quick to break their 
campaign promise and proceed holus-bolus with adherence to NAFTA, 
the fact of the matter is that we have been left with a serious 
threat to our sovereignty and to our ability to control our own 
destiny insofar as we are dealing with the critical issues of 
universal public health care, education and other social 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that in all cases, whether we are talking about 
FTA, NAFTA or now the free trade areas of the Americas agreement, 
and also whether we are concluding MAI and all the discussions at 
the WTO level, the bottom line seems to be to open up an area 
that is very lucrative in terms of trade, that being the health 
care sector of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can my hon. Conservative colleague continue to defend this 
general direction in terms of trade knowing full well that our 
ability to protect our public health care system is threatened 
and knowing full well that as we sit and talk about the FTAA 
there are discussions proceeding around GATS and a very 
deliberate effort to include all social services in the area of 
globalization, free trade and the trading of public health for 
private wealth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my colleague from the Liberal Party, the parliamentary 
secretary, shaking his head.  There is no shortage of 
documentation to verify this threat and certainly no shortage of 
legal opinion to recognize the precarious position for health 
care as a result of these trade deals and all of these trade 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at the FTAA we have to be very wary about the real 
agenda behind it all and address it accordingly.  This is not 
just from people in the NDP, people on the left or people on the 
Council of Canadians, we are also talking about reputable 
journals like the <I>The Lancet</I>, a medical journal which came 
out in December with an editorial entitled “Trading public 
health for private wealth”.  It gave a very significant analysis 
of discussions at the WTO level around how our ability as a 
country to preserve publicly administered universal accessible 
health care is threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my question to the member.  If I could get an answer 
from the parliamentary secretary I would love it, but I will wait 
my turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have better answers 
anyway.  I appreciate the NDP member's position but I want to 
make it really clear that the restoration and protection of 
health care is the number one priority of this party. There is 
not one member of parliament here who does not deal with people 
in need every day.  We understand and are concerned about the 
social services that are necessary to help people who really need 
help.  Every one of us is involved in that every day and that is 
a very important issue for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bottom line is that if we did not have those 46% of 
our gross domestic product as exports or trade agreements that 
allowed us to have 46% of our gross domestic product shipped and 
sold to other countries, we would have no health care system and 
no money for social services.  There has to be a balance between 
the two.  I believe that with free trade agreements around the 
world we can protect our health care and social services more 
than in any other way.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government bring any draft

House so that it may be debated and put to a vote before

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed this motion for several reasons, but I believe 
the main one is the lack of real trust between the government 
and the civil society, the government and opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as I have often said in my speeches, once bitten, 
twice shy. We must judge this government on its behaviour. 
I recall that during our second mandate, only a few days before 
we had a situation created by the MAI, the famous multilateral 
agreement on investment, we were gathered in a room on the first 
floor, on the Senate side. There, we had the great honour of 
receiving the secretary general of the OECD, Mr. Johnston, a 
Liberal who has served the government here and who was rewarded 
by being appointed to the highly prestigious position of 
secretary general of the OECD. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was with us to talk about this famous agreement. I recall a 
sentence which struck me and which most of all shocked me. He 
said “It is up to us, the officials, to negotiate. You do not 
have to negotiate. Once the agreement is completely negotiated 
and signed, we will come back to explain it to you. It will then 
be up to you to sell it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These may not be the exact words used by the secretary general 
but it is, in substance, what he told us. He said to us “Do not 
bother with this. It is not up to you. Your role is to sell it 
after”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What became of the MAI? Without the courage of the French 
government, and without Internet, which the members across the 
aisle have been praising since this morning, the agreement would 
probably have been signed. Most fortunately it was not. I recall 
some statements, like this one from the former president of the 
Foreign Affairs Commission of the French National Assembly, Mr. 
Jack Lang, who said about the MAI negotiations “I do not know who 
is negotiating what and on whose behalf”. 
This is what he said about the MAI, which had already been under 
negotiation for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I do not know who is negotiating what and on whose behalf”. 
We are probably in the same situation at the moment.  Who is 
negotiating what and on behalf of whom to create the free trade 
area of the Americas?  We know nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told to look on the Internet, where we would find 
everything.  I went on the Internet.  I found all sorts of 
things on NAFTA, but nothing about what is going on at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, when the Minister for International Trade, our 
government's homing pigeon, attended the October 1, 1999 meeting 
of the WTO, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada proposes that ministers, in Seattle, commit themselves to 
enhancing the transparency of the WTO, so that secretariat 
working papers, formal contributions from members, draft meeting 
agendas and minutes will be circulated, with very limited 
exceptions, as unrestricted documents as soon as available in 
all three WTO languages. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government minister said greater transparency was required. 
We have been calling for this since this morning.  We want more 
transparency from this government.  We want to be able to debate 
the agreement in this House, before it is ratified.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to be informed about all sorts of details that 
will be discussed at every meeting, subgroup, committee or 
subcommittee. We are asking the government to do its job. It has 
a mandate. We support the creation of the free trade area of the 
Americas, but the government has to do its job properly. At one 
point, it will have to report to us and to explain what it has 
done, before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney government, as was pointed out several times this 
morning, showed much courage when it had to face the stubbornness 
of the opposition of the day, which is now the government. It 
called a general election, even though, at that point, it only 
had the support of 19% of the voters, according to the polls. 
Everyone predicted that the Mulroney government would be soundly 
defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they began talking about free trade. They organized 
forums. They held real debates. We had a taste of what democracy 
was like in Canada, instead of having to face the hypocrisy and 
the pretence of democracy that have existed since 1993. The government 
does everything behind our backs and always presents us with a 
fait accompli. We never get an answer to any question asked in 
the House. The government always evades the issue. It always 
says that the opposition does not understand, or know anything 
or know how to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, all of a sudden, has all the brains. It refuses 
to answer. Democracy is not doing well in this country. It is 
very important that we all agree on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happened with MAI. 
We must look at another point—raised by my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party—the events relating to mad cow 
disease and Brazil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we pay close attention to what the minister is saying, one 
would be tempted to stand up and say “Excuse us, Mr. Minister, 
we should congratulate you on the fine job you are doing”.  That 
is not the reality, however.  If the situation is looked at more 
closely, we see that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has 
just been given a “blast”, forgive my English, by the auditor 
general, which is a clear illustration of the terrible mess that 
agency is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agency has received a knockout blow.  The auditor general 
has said it is incompetent, is understaffed, is not doing its work. 
He also said it was in league with the industry.  The industry 
had reached the stage of checking its own food production. 
Not the agency, which lacked both funds and staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was not too pleased at this situation.  He wondered 
what he could do to improve the image of the agency. So he calls 
them up to inquire “Could you maybe turn up a mad cow or two 
somewhere?”  He is told “Well yes, one in Brazil.  Maybe”. 
Brazil is a long way from here and is the only country in 
America in which Portuguese is spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The languages of the WTO are French, English and Spanish, 
whereas the language of Brazil is Portuguese.  They refused to 
reply to our questionnaire.  We have no information.  Brazil, 
poor Brazil, has a population of 160 million.  It is the second 
largest country in America in terms of population, and third 
largest in terms of area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as our economy is concerned, Brazil is an important 
trading partner.  So what do they do?  We announced that 
Brazilian beef was banned.  Finally the agency has an improved 
image, it is doing its job at last.  I could continue for a very 
long time, but you have just indicated to me that I have only 
seconds left.  I must state in closing that we have grounds for 
concern about the lack of transparency of this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
“I do not know who is negotiating what and on whose behalf”, 
said Mr. Lang when the MAI was discussed; that is a good quote. 
Does it apply to the present situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, so to speak, the answer to the question. This is the 
responsibility of the government, which was recently elected by 
a vast majority of Canadians and which is negotiating on the 
basis of the principles circulated on the Internet for everyone 
to see. It is negotiating with the help of the civil society 
here in Canada and elsewhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is negotiating on behalf of all the people of Canada, who 
will benefit from an extension of markets and the creation of 
prosperity throughout all the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member for Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis tell me 
whether Quebecers agree with her and whether they are against 
free trade? Or am I wrong when I say to her that, in my opinion, 
the people of Quebec favour free trade, profit from it, and want 
to participate and not be hemmed in by an attitude like the hon. 
member's? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, first, I did not say that 
I was opposed to free trade. In fact, if Mr. Mulroney won the 
election in 1988 it is thanks, among others, to Quebecers, 
because we supported free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not like the Liberals who said “We are opposed to free 
trade”. They said it again in 1993. I clearly remember the Prime 
Minister saying “I will never sign this agreement unless major 
changes are made”. The Prime Minister later took off, almost in 
secret, and travelled to western Canada, thought things over and 
said “Perhaps I should sign that agreement. It will cause a lot 
less problems”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, all of a sudden, he called back the same negotiator and told 
him “Explain the agreement to me again. I did not clearly 
understand what you meant the first time”. Once the Prime 
Minister clearly understood the agreement, he signed it with 
very minor changes. 
I am not even sure those changes made the headlines, because the 
changes requested by the Prime Minister were so minor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support free trade. But who is negotiating right now? Members 
should not 
come and tell me it is the Minister for International Trade who 
is at the table negotiating. There are people negotiating. Where 
is the list of negotiators? What issues is the government 
negotiating? Where is the agenda? Where are the documents used 
as a basis for negotiating? What is Canada's position in these 
negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know the government's position and it is not true that 
it can be found on the Internet. This morning, my assistant 
surfed the net and we could not find anything on Canada's 
position. If a negotiation session were to take place here right 
now, what would the government say? The government is keeping 
its position secret and wants to put before members of parliament 
a fait accompli. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is civil society complaining about the fact that it was not 
consulted? Once again, the government consulted its own groups, 
namely those who contributed to its campaign coffers. They will 
say what it wants to hear. We are fed up with the government's 
lack of democracy and lack of transparency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, considering 
the importance of the issue, could we ask ourselves certain 
questions without being labelled anti-free trade? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am for free trade but, as a citizen and consumer, 
I have the right to ask questions and to get answers. In what 
kind of system are we living? Is it a democracy or not? Why is it 
that every time we stand up to ask questions, the people across 
the way say that we are against whatever the subject of the 
debate is, when all we want is some clarification? We want to 
know what is going on. These are questions that our fellow 
citizens ask us in our riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my distinguished colleague has some experience in the 
House of Commons, I would ask her what we can do to get the 
answers to the questions and concerns our constituents raise? It 
is healthy to have concerns. It is not that these people are 
against free trade, but they want to know what we are getting 
into. With her experience, could my colleague tell me how we 
could get the answers we need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, my answer will be short. 
We could follow the example of the government and go get these 
answers on the Internet. The problem is that three quarters of 
the population do not have access to Internet at the moment.

with the lack of democracy, the lack of access to information and 
the absence of answers to our questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Joliette on his very timely motion 
in the House today calling for debate and a vote before any 
agreement on the free trade area of the Americas is ratified. 
The riding of Québec will be hosting the summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind members that politicians in Quebec, 
sovereignist and federalist alike, have always supported free 
trade, unlike the Liberal Party of Canada, which earlier opposed 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 148.6% increase in Quebec's exports to the United States 
between 1991 and 1998 are testimony to the wisdom of opening up 
trade. 
But we must look beyond the apparent success of these figures, 
and take the time to analyse the real impact these agreements 
will have on workers, and particularly on their quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These gains must be kept in perspective.  Some workers continue 
to lose ground.  More and more people are earning the minimum 
wage, without benefits.  There is also an increase in the number 
of jobs without security and atypical jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois is calling for some form of 
social protection, and is concerned about what is being 
negotiated behind the scenes.  It wants the gulf between rich 
and poor to stop growing, and it wants to see the growth in 
exports accompanied by a decrease in poverty and benefits for 
all classes of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are particularly concerned when we know that the minister who 
will be at the negotiating table, the current Minister for 
International Trade, once said that social rights have nothing 
to do with trade.  That is why the Bloc Quebecois is worried. 
It cannot do the work of all the ministers.  We have reason to 
be worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois is keenly interested in 
globalization and is in fact favourable to a liberalization of 
trade, it also shares the worries and the hopes of the public. 
The Bloc Quebecois considers that this liberalization must not 
come at the expense of cultural diversity or social rights, 
whether through the WTO or the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have talked and will talk abundantly about the 
importance of addressing social rights and other concerns with 
respect to the FTAA negotiations. Those are legitimate concerns 
that are very important to me, but in the few minutes I have I 
will stick to one aspect, which relates specifically to my 
responsibilities as heritage critic, and that is how culture 
ought to be treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can talk about international trade agreements without 
thinking about cultural issues. The recent defeat of Canada on 
the magazine issue is a harsh reminder in that regard. We have great 
confidence in the ability of our cultural artisans to carve for 
themselves a place in Quebec as well as in the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the conclusion of a trade agreement for the 
Americas will result in even more extensive cultural exchanges 
between Quebec and Latin American countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, why worry, some would say. Because Quebec culture did not 
develop all on its own. The Government of Quebec used its 
response authority to support its development and growth. That 
approach was taken by every Quebec government regardless of its 
political stripe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be recalled that Quebec interventions have been 
conceived and implemented in order to offset deficiencies in the 
market environment and to allow for the development of a domestic 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are recommending that any trade agreement 
preserve any present or future response capability of the Quebec 
government. The right of governments to adopt policies of support 
for creators, creation and also distribution must be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more important, cultural diversity is an international 
asset that should be recognized and protected by an international 
charter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our culture is not totally isolated.  The summary report on 
multi-stakeholder consultations on the General Agreement on Trade 
in Services, released last week by the Minister for International 
Trade, provides, under the heading “Autonomy for Self-Governing 
Bodies”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participants feared that policies favouring local hiring, or 
encouraging cultural sensitivity in the delivery of services, 
might be compromised. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fear is all the more justified since, despite the fact that 
the federal government is stating loud and clear that it supports 
cultural protection, Cabinet cannot agree on the stand to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister of Canada is saying that the question of 
cultural diversity is a matter for the WTO, and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage would prefer that the matter be debated at 
UNESCO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article in the <I>National Post</I> on November 20 entitled 
“The Conversion of Sergio Marchi”, journalist Murray Dobbie 
passes on the disturbing words of Canada's representative to the 
WTO. According to this journalist, the former minister said that 
education and teaching could be covered by the next agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, another summary report on multi-stakeholder 
consultations with respect to the General Agreement on Trade in 
Services provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will not make any commitment that 
restricts our ability to achieve our cultural policy objectives 
until a new international instrument can be established designed 
specifically to safeguard the right of countries to promote and 
preserve their cultural diversity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so, what is this government's true position on culture?  Is 
it that of the Prime Minister or that of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage?  What is the real intent of the government? The words 
reported by Mr. Marchi or the summary report released last week 
by the Minister for International Trade?  Could someone in 
government set the record straight? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Culture means words.  It involves the choices we make to express 
who we are, what we experience, how we feel and what we want to 
become.  These words are conveyed by language, painting, song, 
film, radio, television, clay modelling and marble polishing. 
They are conveyed by pictures, etchings, theatre, in a word, by 
the passion and genius of our artisans, who sketch in broad 
strokes our daily lives, as witnesses to and tireless 
participants in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is so important for us to jealously protect and 
parsimoniously share the culture of a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Gilles Vigneault put it in his song: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our words, our games, our work and our dance, our joys and 
our sorrows too, four hundred years of faith, love and hope with 
those who lived here, our mirrors and our differences, we have 
become this people and this country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of all these emotions and this wealth of day to 
day experience that we do not want culture reduced to a consumer 
good like the others.  We must not forget that it gives life to a 
people as they are and that we are here to speak in our own way, 
in the manner of each people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Québec 
on the quality of her speech and particularly on what she said 
about the impact the free trade agreement presently being 
negotiated by all countries in the three Americas will have on 
the cultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me and for the other members from the Quebec City area, 
Lévis being situated just on the other side of the river from 
Quebec City, the fact that the summit will be held in Quebec 
City raises a number of concerns as far as security and the 
potential for demonstrations are concerned. I imagine that those 
concerns are raised in her riding more than anywhere else, since 
this is where the summit will be held. I would like her to tell 
us about it, if she wishes to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since she too is from the Quebec City area, I would like to take 
the opportunity to emphasize that the shipbuilding sector has 
been overlooked or excluded from the free trade agreement. This 
sector was also overlooked in the amendments that were made when 
Mexico joined in. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Residents of Quebec City and the north shore who work at the 
shipyard in Lévis are now wondering why this exception was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that, during the last negotiations, for the auto 
pact, it was taken into consideration in order to protect the 
interests of southern Ontario, and of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are taking things to the next level, the Americas. I know 
that several countries, Brazil and South America in particular, 
want to get ships and oil drilling rigs built by Canadian 
shipyards among others. So, that does have an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know where the hon. member stands on this issue. 
As the member for Québec, is she prepared to support me so that 
shipbuilding and maritime transport are included in the future 
free trade agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find unacceptable that Quebec City will be footing the 
bill if demonstrations are held during the summit of the 
Americas. As of today, we still do not know for sure if the 
premier of Quebec will take part in the summit of the Americas. 
As far as I know, and I could be wrong, he was only invited to a 
cocktail party. That is rather odd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the hon. member for Québec thinks 
about all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, indeed, the summit of 
the Americas will be held in the riding of Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the Government of Canada will respond to the 
financial expectations relating to the holding of the summit in 
order to allay the concerns of the Government of Quebec and the 
municipality of Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that requests have been made for the funds necessary to 
ensure that all the infrastructure required to provide a proper 
welcome for the leaders of others countries is in place.  We 
trust that there will be a follow up and that the requests for 
assistance from the Government of Quebec and the municipality of 
Québec will be met with a suitable response.  At the present 
time, we do not know if there has been any follow up to the 
requests made by the two levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other matter of the shipyard, this was an election 
issue in the riding of Lévis and the reason the hon. member for 
Lévis was re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still await a proper shipbuilding development policy here in 
Canada.  This would have a positive impact on Quebec, particularly 
Lévis.  Any protection afforded the industry would have a 
positive impact on the economic development of Quebec and a 
regional ripple effect extending beyond Lévis, because a number 
of workers reside in the various ridings in the Quebec City area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only regret the slowness with which the federal 
government is handling this matter.  They claim to be very 
concerned about the economy, yet it is important to provide 
assistance and support to the economic levers and the various 
infrastructures already in place in order to be able to compete 
the global marketplace in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas is very important.  It is important 
to know how much protection there will be for the social rights 
of our workers in a number of precarious sectors of economic 
activity in Canada and in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the 
debate.  I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Toronto Centre—Rosedale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americas is one of the most dynamic regions in the world. 
With its 800 million people, even though we are not but one-sixth 
of the world's population, we account for more than one-third of 
the world's total economic activity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At about $11 trillion U.S., the combined gross domestic product 
of the Americas is greater than that of the European Union.  No 
wonder then that leaders of the western hemisphere believed in 
the potential of the Americas.  They knew that their countries 
could work together more effectively on every front, social, 
political and economic, to promote democracy, development and 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Miami summit of the Americas in 1994, leaders endorsed a 
declaration and a plan of action that expressed their common 
commitment to strengthening democracy and creating even greater 
prosperity.  They also committed themselves to practical measures 
to improve health care, increase access to quality education, 
protect biodiversity, collective action against such scourges as 
drugs and corruption, and expanding and deepening dialogue with 
civil society on regional priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second summit in Santiago in 1998, this co-operation was 
carried forward in detail.  Once again leaders endorsed action to 
support the development of democratic institutions, protection of 
human rights, and enhanced transparency and respect for the rule 
of law.  They gave specific instructions to begin the process of 
negotiating the free trade areas of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once it is completed, the FTAA will be the world's largest free 
trade area. In short, the summit of the Americas process offers 
numerous opportunities to further enhance Canada's openness to 
the world and to the western hemisphere in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTAA is one of the tangible opportunities on the economic 
front, with its potential for enhanced market access for Canadian 
exports.  If there is one sector where new access could lead to 
significant benefits for Canada and Canadian businesses, it is in 
the service sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The service sector is a key engine of Canada's economy.  It is 
responsible for more than two-thirds of Canada's GDP, almost 
three-quarters of our employment with 10.5 million people and 
nearly 90% of new job creation in Canada. It is leading the 
transformation of the Canadian economy into a knowledge based 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many employees in the service sector are highly educated and 
enjoy well above average earnings.  Services are at the heart of 
Canada's innovation.  For example, communications, financial 
services and technical business services are among the most 
innovative industries in Canada.  We are a world leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a trading nation Canada counts on its service exports to 
strengthen our prosperity.  Not counting Canada's direct 
investment abroad in service companies, Canada is the 12th 
largest exporter of services in the world, exporting $51.8 
billion in 1999 alone.  Canadian companies like SNC-Lavallin, 
Teleglobe, Enbridge and Hydro Quebec are among world leaders in 
their field and their expertise is sought across the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service exports only account for 12% of total Canadian exports. 
Canada's trade in services is increasing at a much faster pace 
than our trade in goods and shows tremendous potential.  Given 
the importance of trade in our economy, we could say without fear 
of exaggeration that improving market access for our service 
providers abroad is vital to sustaining our prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument for supporting Canada's service exports is 
particularly eloquent when it comes to the Americas.  Canada's 
commercial service exports to the FTAA countries, including the 
U.S. and Mexico, were worth about $1.9 billion in 1998, up from 
under $800 million in 1993, growing at an average annual rate of 
19% during that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries such as Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Venezuela, 
Columbia and Brazil are all key existing or potential export 
markets for Canadian service providers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the House to three sectors in 
particular: telecommunications, financial services and 
engineering services, all of which are found in the greater 
Toronto area, some in my riding of Thornhill, and right across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian telecommunications sector is enjoying tremendous 
success exporting services valued at over $2 billion each year 
and employing some 104,000 Canadians.  As a consequence, since 
1993 the sector has been growing at a rate of just over 9% per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian exporters of telecommunication services still face 
market access and regulatory restrictions in many countries of 
the hemisphere, in part due to the presence of telecommunication 
monopolies in several Central and Latin American countries; the 
lack of transparency, predictability and timeliness in the 
process of awarding operating permits and licences; or 
prohibitive fees for licences and interconnection.  This hurts 
our businesses.  Reducing such barriers would significantly 
increase export opportunities for Canada's growing 
telecommunication companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years Canada's financial institutions have been very 
active in Central and Latin America.  We have a number of 
examples.  Scotiabank is active in Argentina and Chile.  In fact 
in Chile it is the seventh largest bank.  In El Salvador, 
Scotiabank has 33 branches in that country alone, but it is also 
active in Brazil, Costa Rica, Belize, Guyana, Panama, Peru, 
Uruguay and Venezuela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example is the National Bank which recently teamed 
up with three U.S. venture capital companies and a local Chilean 
partner to form the CorpBanca consortium to purchase banking 
institutions in South American countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true for our insurance sector.  Our life and health 
insurance companies have identified Latin America as a growth 
market for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another sector where Canadian expertise is renowned is in the 
world of engineering and other related services.  Canada is 
currently the third largest exporter of engineering services. The 
high calibre of Canadian engineers is internationally recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business opportunities are significant especially in Central and 
Latin America where the expertise of Canadian engineers in 
resource based and energy related as well as infrastructure 
projects is in high demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard Hydro-Quebec's recent acquisition of Chile's 
Transelec, which owns 50% of the Chilean power transmission 
lines, is a good example of the type of business opportunities in 
the countries the western hemisphere have to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Canada is pursuing and actively participating in the 
service negotiations under the free trade area of the Americas. 
Canada has much to gain from the establishment of a comprehensive 
set of rules in trade and services under FTAA.  Canada's general 
objective in the service negotiations is to seek improved market 
access for Canadian service providers under a transparent and 
predictable rules based regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the elaboration of FTAA rules on services Canada will be 
guided by its existing rights and obligations under NAFTA, the 
Canada-Chile free trade agreement and the WTO general agreement 
on trade and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what some critics have said, these objectives could 
be achieved without putting at risk those things which all 
Canadians value and cherish.  As is now the case in other trade 
agreements, the FTAA services chapter will allow countries to 
file exceptions for those measures they wish to maintain 
irrespective of some of the FTAA obligations.  In addition, and 
this is extremely important, nothing in these negotiations will 
jeopardize our public health and our public education systems. 
They are simply not negotiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have shown in my remarks how world competitive Canadian 
telecommunications, financial services and engineering services 
are, and that is only to name three sectors.  I could go on and 
on, but I do want to share my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the countries of the western hemisphere could 
prosper as they learn to work together and be good economic 
partners with Canada and with each other.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister made a very fine speech but she did not address the key 
message in the opposition day motion of the Bloc Quebecois which 
was demanding to see the actual text that is being negotiated on 
our behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of the matter is that negotiations are taking place 
behind closed doors.  We have some assurances that certain things 
are not being negotiated but, frankly, we do not have a very good 
record to draw from in previous negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example.  Most Canadians are reeling with shock 
and horror over spiralling home heating costs right now.  When 
they go to their government and ask for some kind of relief, some 
kind of preferential pricing, the government tells them that it 
is sorry but it cannot do anything because it traded everything 
away in the last round of bargaining in the NAFTA agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We traded away our economic sovereignty, which is what Canadians 
are afraid will happen again.  What are we trading away this 
time?  What is going on behind closed doors?  Why can we not see 
the text of the document so that we could put people's minds at 
ease? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact what the minister said is absolutely true, that 
Canada would never trade away certain things because we just 
would not do that, why did we willingly trade away our economic 
sovereignty in the area of energy pricing?  There is a recent 
tangible experience that is still very bitter in the mouths of 
Canadians, especially now as they are opening their energy bills 
for their home heating oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. minister explain the reluctance on her 
government's part to release the actual text of the negotiations 
so that the minds of Canadians can be put at ease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would say to the 
member and to those to whom I have listened carefully that it is 
important to tell Canadians that they can access all of the 
information regarding Canada's position during these negotiations 
on the website.  It is open, clear and there for all to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there has ever been a process that has been as 
open to encourage Canadians to participate and to be informed. 
The fearmongering and the rhetoric I have heard does a disservice 
to the important work that is being done to negotiate agreements 
that will benefit Canadian businesses and industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has an interest can plug into the website, get the 
information and then let us know what they think about the 
position that the Government of Canada is taking.  That is good 
government, that is openness, that is transparency and that is in 
the interests of all Canadians, particularly Canadians who want 
to prosper and have jobs for themselves, their children and 
future generations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I commend the minister for putting forward her 
position on the trade issues.  I know she is very well-versed on 
those as well as on several other issues in the House.  As 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, she has a fair amount of 
authority and has used her authority to appoint several judges in 
the country, which is how it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know she is also very capable of rooting out bigots, racists 
and extremists.  She made it very clear in the last election that 
she has those capabilities.  It is always a very touchy subject 
when other people mention that topic but the minister does not 
seem to hold back when it comes to those particular issues when 
she is directing them across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made a recent appointment of Mr. Sekora who was 
quoted in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> on December 13 as blaming his 
loss specifically on members of B.C.— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is with reluctance that I interject and interrupt my 
colleague, but as the parliamentary secretary charged with 
organizing the debate, or trying to make sure that we have a full 
debate at least on this side, I am straining to understand any 
relevance whatsoever of the member's comments to the motion that 
is on the floor.

ask the hon. member to get to the question because we have run 
out of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will get to the question 
right now.  The issues are Mr. Sekora and the appointment process 
and what is deemed acceptable and not acceptable when accusations 
are hurled from the particular minister and in the way she makes 
her decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Sekora said that his defeat was assured by 8,000 angry leaky

put the question to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, is this the kind of 
person, I ask the minister, that she wants in her cabinet or in 
her arrangement of citizenship judges? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I tell viewers who are 
watching the debate on the hemispheric free trade agreement that 
the question asked bears no relation to the debate whatever. 
However, I should like to say that the former member to whom the 
member opposite refers served as a member of his community for 28 
years as a city councillor, school trustee and mayor, and 
honourably in this House.  With that kind of community service, 
he is exactly the kind of individual to whom we are looking to 
serve our community in other capacities as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam

have made some appointment in my riding that the member opposite 
will choose to attack me on.  I lack such power so I am sure I 
will be safe from any slings and arrows from the opposite side. I 
admit that I am culpable.  I too have done things in life which I 
ought not to have done.  There is no helping me, just like in the 
Anglican prayer book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are passing to the subject matter of debate which I 
think members are interested in, I should like to address four 
issues we have been talking about in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the consultation issue.  The second is the merits 
of the FTAA.  The third is one raised by the NDP regularly, which 
is the loss of sovereignty, and then I should like to talk about 
the merits of the particular motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the consultation issue, we have heard a great deal this 
morning about the problems of consultation and the lack of it. 
Other members have addressed it, but I should like to speak to it 
from a different dimension.  I should like to speak to it as 
someone who has sat on the foreign affairs committee and has been 
involved in international trade matters now for seven years of my 
parliamentary career.  I frankly could say to the House, and I 
think most open-minded members would agree with me, that never 
before has there been a history of open consultation as much as 
there has been with the government on all these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us cast our minds back to the time when the MAI was a hot 
debate.  What did we do?  The government asked the international 
trade committee of the House to examine it, to report back to the 
House and to discuss it before the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this issue we hear:  we do not know what we are seeing; this 
is all opaque; it is a big secret; and nobody knows what is going 
on.  What did we have in the WTO report that the committee worked 
on last year?  We had discussions about FTAA.  Witnesses came 
from all over the country and discussed it with us.  Members of 
the House discussed it.  The subcommittee prepared a report on 
the FTAA, discussed it with members of the opposition and heard 
the public.  The public has been engaged in consultations with 
the department for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out, the negotiating positions are on the 
website.  People can exchange points of view.  There will be a 
parallel summit.  I suggest to members in all honesty that there 
has never been as open a process.  Members opposite that they be 
given the text of the agreement.  They know that is not possible. 
They are experienced people.  They have all been in business. 
They have all been in labour negotiations.  They are all 
intelligent people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know and the public of Canada knows that when we go into a 
negotiation with 30 other countries, the 30 other countries have 
something to say as well. If they say that the agreement should 
not be released, we cannot release it against the will of our 
trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government has shown a willingness to share the 
text of the agreement, but other governments have said no.  Until 
the agreement is final we are not in a position to do so.  I am 
confident that once the agreement is final, it will be open in 
Canada and open for discussion and review by members and others 
in the normal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process domestically has been extraordinary. In 
addition, internationally the Government of Canada has been at 
the forefront of bringing together an interparliamentary forum of 
the Americas.  I am proud to say that it will be sitting in this 
Chamber when we break in the month of March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this very room we will have representatives, not governmental 
representatives but parliamentarians from all across the 
Americas: South America, Central America and the Caribbean 
countries.  They will be sitting in this room discussing the 
issues we are discussing today:  Will free trade in the Americas 
contribute to our prosperity; how do we preserve our environment, 
how do we preserve the diversity of our culture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of the House and all parties will be 
participating in this important debate launched by the Government 
of Canada as a recognition that these issues touch deeply our 
social programs.  The issues of free trade and economic 
integration touch us.  They touch our daily lives and they touch 
the daily lives of other citizens throughout the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we wish to run away from them, as would be suggested by the 
NDP?  Or, do we wish to embrace them in a positive way which will 
bring prosperity for all of the Americas, not just for ourselves 
but for everyone, and in a way which allows us to consult with 
everyone?  That is what is happening in the area of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members opposite who are interested in this issue to 
speak to their whips and get involved.  They should find out 
about the interparliamentary forum which will sit here and 
participate in these discussions, not just with us but with 
democratically elected representatives from all of the Americas, 
all of whom share our preoccupations and our concerns about this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's point is excellent.  The agreement is bringing 
prosperity. If we did not have international trade, we would not 
have the city of Toronto of today.  It is entirely dependent upon 
it.  It is dependent upon it in the financial services sector, in 
the mining industry and in practically every area of economic 
life of the city I am very proud to represent in a riding I 
treasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know that 40% of our GDP is dependent on exports.  Some 
25% or 30% is dependent on imports.  I can say to every one of my 
citizens, as I walk down the streets of my riding, that about 60 
cents of every dollar in their pockets are somehow related to the 
trade in which the country is engaged.  They know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to craft the best agreement we can.  We are doing 
that and we are trying to bring in other foreign countries to 
enable them to share in our prosperity.  I suggest that is a 
generous thing we ought to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could focus on other issues.  Our colleagues in the NDP, the 
Bloc and the Alliance are no different from the colleagues on our 
side of the House.  We are all concerned about the environment, 
human rights, labour standards, diversity of culture, the 
distribution of wealth and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we do.  We are politicians.  We are in the business 
of trying to make sure that society is an harmonious operating 
system.  That is what will be done at the level of the Americas. 
That is what this engagement is all about.  It is an exciting, 
dynamic and wonderful opportunity.  One of the great 
opportunities is the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will recall we did a study of the WTO, a great 
institution, in committee on it last year before going into the 
famous negotiations in Seattle and found that it is grappling 
with these problems on a global scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTAA allows us to grapple with these problems on the scale 
of the Americas.  We will be able to deal with human rights, for 
example, with our colleagues in the Americas because the FTAA is 
only one part of the negotiations that will take place at the 
summit of the Americas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will not only be speaking to trade agreements 
with the other leaders of the Americas.  He will be speaking to 
strengthening democracy and to good governance in all our 
countries.  He will be speaking to issues of social justice and 
equity in our countries.  He will be speaking to issues of human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not pretend that because the FTAA is there we do not have 
a framework for human rights in the Americas.  In this hemisphere 
there are dozens of forums for discussing human rights.  There is 
the OAS general assembly, the Inter-American Human Rights 
Commission, the inter-American court, and working groups on human 
rights.  Canada is engaged in all of these groups. We actively 
participate in them.  The FTAA will enable us to get a better 
handle on these groups and to work with our trading partners in 
the Americas to advance those causes.  Why would we stand in its 
way if we believe in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I had the opportunity to meet with a very 
interesting group called the sustainable cities initiative.  This 
group of Canadians is bringing cities together with private 
industry to go to developing countries and work with them on 
environmental concerns in their cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the contracts they are doing at the moment?  They are 
in Salvador, Brazil; San José, Costa Rica; Cordoba, Argentina; 
and Valparaiso, Chile.  Why?  It is because these are countries 
of the Americas.  They are logical places that small and medium 
size businesses can work with and link with, as we create a 
matrix throughout the Americas that deals with human rights, 
culture and economics on a mutually advantageous system.  That is 
what this is all about.  That is what the debate should be about, 
instead of what I hear from the NDP over and over again about our 
loss of sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How have we lost our sovereignty?  These agreements are entered 
into by freely elected democratic governments.  The sovereign 
will of the Government of Canada, elected by the people of 
Canada, chooses to go into the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, would members of the NDP rip up the Kyoto agreement 
because we lost our sovereignty by entering into it?  No.  They 
like the Kyoto agreement.  We must do that if it is something 
they are in favour of.  Would they rip up the ILO?  I have heard 
from Bob White and the NDP over and over again that the ILO is a 
wonderful and important institution.  The ILO interferes with 
sovereignty.  It tells states what do.  It says that there must 
be certain labour standards and that they cannot do this or that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every country that enters into any international agreement loses 
some degree of its sovereignty, but it pools its sovereignty in 
an international way to benefit overall.  That is what free trade 
of the Americas is about.  That is what the summit of the 
Americas is about.  That is why I think the resolution at this 
time is misinformed and ill-advised.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have had the pleasure of working with my hon. 
colleague on the foreign affairs committee when it studied the 
FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most government speakers are stating the benefits of FTAA: what 
it will do for Canada and how it will proceed.  I agree there are 
potential benefits out there.  I do not agree with the position 
the NDP takes.  We agree with the government that there are 
advantages to the FTAA, but the question is:  Why cannot the 
agreement be debated in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about its website with all the information 
regarding the negotiations.  We are saying that when the 
agreement is finalized it should be brought to the House.  The 
House should be allowed to debate it because we as elected 
representatives want the ability to speak to that agreement in 
the House.  Statements should be made on that agreement and, as a 
matter of fact, on all international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is my colleague opposed to bringing that international 
agreement into the House for debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question because that is the part of my speech I did not 
actually get to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised earlier with one of our colleagues in the Bloc that I 
respect the ongoing debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the system works in our country at this time is that the 
government negotiates and ratifies international agreements, and 
when they require implementation in the House, they are brought 
to the House for the legislation to be passed.  At that time we 
have an opportunity to discuss it, as we did with the WTO and 
with all other international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being asked here is that before ratification the 
government should involve the House or have a debate in the 
House.  This suggests, if I may, with all humility and respect 
for the opposition member's position, that we are, as the U.S. 
congress is, directing the government as to how to conduct 
international affairs, which does represent a substantial change 
in our practice today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a change that is happening.  As I said, in the case of the 
MAI we had a committee that examined the MAI before it had even 
been negotiated.   There are opportunities for the members to be 
engaged.  I do not think that this resolution is necessary to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate will go on.  It will be in our committees.  We will 
have an opportunity to discuss this on all sides of the House. 
When the time comes and the agreement has been put in place, the 
government will bring it forward to the House with the necessary 
implementing legislation and we will then have an opportunity to 
deal with it.   That is my position and has always been the 
position of the government.  I think the way in which we have 
done it in the House is the way in which it is in the best 
interests of the Canadian public. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
tell the hon. member that the MAI was referred to the foreign 
affairs commission long after the texts were released on the 
Internet by a group of American citizens, thus creating an 
uproar, particularly among western countries, but also 
worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of actions taken by civil society that we were 
able to have that debate here. What would the hon. member think 
of a union that would not ask its members to ratify the 
collective agreement negotiated for them? Would he not say that 
this sort of thing would not fly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our motion, we are simply asking that a basic principle of 
democracy be respected. I am taking this opportunity to ask the 
hon. member to clarify a statement made by the Prime Minister of 
Canada to the General Assembly of the Organization of American 
States on February 5: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the same token, we understand that it cannot be about trade 
alone. It is not just a contract among corporations and 
governments. First and foremost, it is an agreement among—and 
about—people. It must be holistic in nature. It must include— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress the word “include”. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—improving the efficiency of financial markets, protecting labour 
rights and the environment, and having better development 
cooperation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on that statement from the Prime Minister of Canada, am I 
to understand that the Canadian government supports an agreement 
on the free trade zone of the Americas that would include 
provisions to protect workers and the environment in particular? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham:</B> Madam Speaker, if I understood them correctly, 
these are two excellent questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member that the text of the MAI was made 
public, which is why the civil society got involved. But the 
civil society is also involved in the debate on free trade in 
the Americas without having seen the texts beforehand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the MAI is that the text that was made public 
was not the official text. It was a series of proposals put 
forward by a number of governments. It is always the same 
problem with this kind of negotiations. There is always someone 
who says “Here is the text”, but it is not the real text. It is 
only a proposal brought forward by a government. It is better to 
see the text before we get involved. That is my answer to the 
first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the second question, I think we should address the 
issues of the environment, human rights and the protection of 
workers as part of our negotiations with all the Americas. These 
issues are not addressed only in the free trade agreement, but 
in all our negotiations with the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the summit of the Americas is so important. It deals 
not only with international trade, but also with integration and 
the welfare of all the citizens of our hemisphere. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the debate launched today by my hon. colleague from 
Joliette is crucial to the future of the people of Quebec and 
the people of Canada as well as all the inhabitants of the 
western hemisphere, the three Americas.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When everything we look at, read, listen to, eat and perhaps 
what will matter for us tomorrow is determined around 
international tables, it is fairly easy to understand why Quebec 
must become a sovereign state.  Without sovereignty, Quebec will 
never, under the present system, have a place at these 
international tables, and that is regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we have sovereignty—which will come, I am positive—the Bloc 
Quebecois has taken a fairly clear and innovative position, 
which I will reveal now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the provinces have to be directly involved in the 
negotiations at the summit of the Americas in Quebec City, 
because the issues to be discussed there—including cultural 
diversity—are too important, too fundamental, to the very 
existence of the  people of Quebec to be simply left in the 
hands of the federal government alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, and this is somewhat predictable given the closed 
minds of our colleagues opposite, the government is obstinately 
refusing to give what, to a growing number of Canadians and 
Quebecers, is perfectly natural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find an original way to involve the provinces in the 
negotiations, which, in many cases, will be on issues that are 
fundamentally and exclusively provincial matters according to 
the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now, the premiers have been unanimous in their 
demand to be included in the negotiation of international 
treaties concerning their spheres of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggest the following.  The team of Canadian negotiators, who 
will be in attendance at the summit of the Americas, should 
naturally report to the Minister for International Trade, but 
also to the provincial ministers for international trade, in the 
case of the provinces that have such a minister, so that they 
can  keep an eye on the negotiators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, a joint federal-provincial committee could be set up to 
ensure that the negotiators respected the priorities set not 
only by the federal government, but by the provincial 
governments as well. 
To me, it seems inconceivable that federal negotiators, who 
answer to the federal Minister for International Trade only, 
could make commitments on behalf of Canada as a whole, including 
its territorial divisions, in areas over which this House has no 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first suggestion is that we establish a federal-provincial 
committee responsible for supervising the work of federal 
negotiators. The second is that we should allow those provinces 
that are interested to appoint a member of the negotiating team 
so they can be directly involved in these negotiations which, I 
repeat, are crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once an agreement is reached, it will be important to get the 
approval of this House, to obtain our approval as elected 
representatives of the people. Not only will this parliament, 
this House, have to be involved in the ratification process, but 
so will the various provincial legislative assemblies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be absolutely essential to ensure that agreements are 
tabled and debated in parliament and approved by resolution 
before ratification of the treaty by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to go back to the issue of approval by 
the provinces and perhaps look at what is being done elsewhere. 
In the few minutes we have left, I suggest we look at the model 
so often mentioned by the Minister for International Trade, 
namely the European model.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His colleague, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, is 
also trying to talk about Europe.  So we will.  If that is what 
they want to talk about, fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe, the economic commission for Europe, which negotiates 
for the 15 member countries of the European union, must obtain a 
clearly defined mandate from those countries before undertaking 
any negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before actual negotiations begin, there is a debate.  There must 
be agreement on the mandate that will be given to the economic 
commission for Europe in negotiating trade agreements. 
Once negotiators have arrived at an agreement, the commission 
must go back to the principals, the member countries of the 
European economic union. The member countries must decide 
whether or not to approve that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore make the following suggestion: could we not consider 
the team of Canadian negotiators to be agents not just of the federal 
government but of the governments of the 10 other provinces, 
and have a system in which the provinces, which are the 
principals, as well as the provincial legislatures and the 
federal parliament ratify the results obtained by their agents, 
in this case the team of Canadian trade negotiators? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This direct involvement of the provinces is vital because it 
will facilitate the implementation of agreements which, I remind 
the House, will impact on a number of areas of exclusively 
provincial jurisdiction.  The provinces, which will have been 
full participants in the process from the outset, will more 
easily be able to join forces and ensure that the ratification 
process goes ahead even more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most frequently heard criticisms of globalization 
concerns the lack, too often expressed, of control by members of the 
public over a phenomenon which is increasingly having an impact 
on us. 
When a youngster clicks on a mouse and surfs on the Internet, 
when a retired man checks the return on his retirement funds, 
when a farmer milks his cows and plans the sale of his products 
on the international markets, we can say that they are all 
affected by globalization. This is not just pure imagination. 
There are very down to earth applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the procedures I have mentioned, we would not only avoid 
the discussion of trade agreements behind closed doors by heads 
of state and heads of government or their ministers, but we would 
also involve the main representatives of the civil society, and I 
am referring to the members of the House of Commons and of the 
various provincial legislatures in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude. Through the creation of a committee to 
supervise the Canadian negotiators, the involvement of interested 
provinces in the appointment of Canadian negotiators, the 
approval of these agreements by the Canadian parliament and 
legislatures, and a close involvement of the states through 
parliament and the various legislatures, we will succeed not only 
in restoring public confidence in the politicians, but also in 
making sure the Canadian constitution and provincial 
jurisdictions are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the best procedure possible, short of Quebec becoming a 
sovereign state. When that day comes, Quebec's interests will be 
really well protected by our representatives in these 
negotiations where decisions are made that affect us in our daily 
life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is what he and I share.  We both find it quite 
galling that the players at the table of the FTAA do not want 
freely elected governments involved at this stage.  They clearly 
will not allow it.  They are barring it.  In fact it goes further 
than that.  The former head of the WTO, Ruggiero, made this 
startling comment.  He said “There is a surplus of democracy in 
the world which is interfering with the free movement of capital 
and investment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people out there in the world who actually believe 
there is a surplus of democracy, and that freely elected 
governments and freely elected representatives like those of us 
in this room have no business at a high level table where they 
are bargaining trade deals.  That is offensive to all Canadians. 
Surely, all people in Quebec and everywhere in the country should 
be offended by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to talk a bit about this.  We are 
facing a home heating fuel crisis in this country as we speak. 
When Canadians came to their government to ask for some relief 
and begging their elected representatives to do something to 
provide some relief for them, they were told “Gee, sorry we 
cannot help you”.  We traded away any ability to influence 
pricing in the last trade agreement with NAFTA.  Some idiot on 
our behalf gave it away, sold the farm and sold away our economic 
sovereignty and our ability to dictate a domestic market pricing 
for home heating fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to expand on the impact that that may have 
in the province of Quebec and elsewhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those who believe that states, governments, elected 
houses of representatives still have an important role to play in 
terms of globalization, provided they are willing to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the best system of checks and balances against 
uncontrolled globalization is more democracy, more power, not 
only for civil society in general but also for assemblies elected 
by the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the more specific issue of heating oil, I believe 
that the error was made by this government, which decided to 
improvise, because an election was coming. In order to avoid any 
discussion of the issue during the election campaign, it decided

Agreement, but from this government's lack of determination to 
deal with the problems of concentration and lack of competition 
in the oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of acting, the government decided to let the Conference 
Board of Canada review the situation, knowing very well that large oil 
companies are major contributors to the conference board. This 
was the same as asking the industry to self-regulate. In any 
industry that self-regulates, there is a risk of monopolistic or 
anti-competitive practices.

with regard to the protection of our public health care system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many organizations, including The Council of Canadians, have 
made preliminary investigations based on material available and 
have concluded that the trade negotiations committee of the FTAA, 
led by Canada, is proposing an expanded services agreement in 
this hemispheric pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern has been raised that these powers being proposed 
under this agreement, in conjunction with discussions at the WTO 
pursuant to GATS, will give unequalled new rights to the 
transnational corporations of the hemisphere to compete for and 
even challenge every publicly funded service of its government, 
including health care, education, social security, culture and 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a legitimate concern.  I would like to hear the 
position of the Bloc on that matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> I will be brief, Madam Speaker. First, I 
would like to know the sources used by the Council of Canadians, 
because I have not seen the texts. This is one of the reasons we 
brought forward this motion today. We have asked the government 
on several occasions if we could have access not only to Canada's 
initial negotiating position, but also to the working texts of 
the nine sectoral groups on which the free trade area of the 
Americas will be built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member on the importance of having this 
information right now. I hope, Madam Speaker, that you will tell 
that to your caucus and to your colleague, the Minister for 
International Trade. We need your support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in this debate initiated by my 
eminent colleague, the hon. member for Joliette, whom I have 
known for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to work with him in the past on the 
progress of trade negotiations, including the GATT, which has now 
become the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first part of my presentation, I want to briefly discuss 
the issue of trust. I am stating the obvious when I say that 
nowadays, whenever an international meeting takes place, whether 
in Seattle, Geneva or elsewhere—and Quebec City will be no 
exception—incredibly huge rallies are held. One has to wonder 
about these large protests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have always been protests, but they used to be smaller and 
less frequent than they have been in the past three or four 
years. Why are so many people now marching in the streets? We 
have to realize that these people are not all anarchists. Some 
groups represent the poor in our society, while others take an 
interest in issues such as education and health. Protesters come 
from various backgrounds, but most are ordinary citizens who are 
concerned about what is being negotiated behind closed doors, on 
their behalf, but in their absence and without any warning to 
them about what is coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One also has to wonder about the voter participation rate. 
People, and these people are probably the same ones who wonder 
about international negotiations, cannot see why they should 
bother to vote for a representative who ought to be speaking on 
their behalf, discussing fundamental issues affecting their 
future and informing them of the outcome of these debates, but 
who, because of the lack of transparency of the negotiation 
process at the international, bilateral, trilateral or 
multilateral level with 38 countries in the case of the Americas, 
does not inform them of what is being discussed, even though it 
concerns their future and issues as important as education, 
health, the environment and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people do not have anyone speaking on their behalf, even 
if they vote for a representative in a democratic fashion. Civil 
society does not have a direct spokesperson on whom it can rely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have at least seven minutes 
left after oral question period, when we resume debate.

unable to save himself.

separated him from the young victim.  When the ice began to 
crack, he crawled along the thin surface until he neared the

and he too fell into the freezing water.

the federal government remained silent in the face of Alberta's 
decision to allow the first for profit, private, degree granting

municipalities are expected to contribute half the cost of hiring 
students and are treated the same way as the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this will do is eliminate the opportunity for many students 
to be employed, since many municipalities, especially those in 
the smaller areas that are now taking out street lights in order 
to meet their budgets, cannot afford to pay to hire summer 
students. 
Consequently, the opportunity is lost for a great contribution to 
be made to the municipality and a great opportunity for students 
to receive good, solid, supervised employment.

situation of the Ucluelet district of the riding of 
Nanaimo—Alberni. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many regions of the country are enjoying current positive 
economic dividends, the collapse of the hake fishery has wreaked 
havoc on this small and fragile community.  Three fish plants 
remain closed due to lack of fish.  Hundreds of workers have had 
no work and therefore do not qualify under present EI 
regulations.  The suffering in this coastal community is as great 
as anything that has been seen on the east coast of Canada.

representatives took place to examine what could be done to help. 
Concerned community leaders have assembled an advisory committee 
asking the federal government to come to the table and help 
resolve this crisis.  To date this has not happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

responsibilities of the official opposition to give credit where 
credit is due when the government appears to be doing something 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that there is at least one person over there who is 
concerned about the mismanagement of hundreds of millions of

Board is now saying that she will be hiring and assigning 150 new 
auditors.  We give credit for that.  That is good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have been asking questions for two years about the

assigned to the Shawinigan file?

Speaker, if the Leader of the Opposition really wants to give 
credit to the government, why does he not also give credit for 
our work on health care, for our work on tax cuts, for our work 
on the economy, for our work on the environment and for our work 
for children and justice?  We deserve equal credit for these 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Leader of the Opposition has not mentioned any of 
these things for days, and his lead critics have not mentioned 
anything on these for days, it means that he agrees with us and 
with Canadians that we are doing a good job.  Thank you Mr. 
Leader for this strong endorsement of our programs.

accountability, which is what health care funding, education 
funding and all the other areas are about, if there will be more 
referees on the ice, it is important that there is a system of 
monitoring.  That system has to require at least three things. 
It has to very clearly set out the goals of the program.  It has 
to have a system in place to monitor the progress of the goals 
and then something to show whether the goals were achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the President of the Treasury Board has 
consulted with any of the provinces that have these award winning 
systems in place to monitor a similar program because the auditor 
general says that they do not have this program.  Or, is she just 
concerned with accountability as far as it goes and ends where

good advice wherever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition is 
seeking the advice of the people who took part in the recent poll 
in Alberta which passed quite a judgment on him.  It is causing 
him to hang his head today I am sure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep asking these questions.  For the last couple of years

on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Prime Minister was arm-twisting some $600,000 out of 
the president of the Business Development Bank, a federally

$200,000 for the Auberge Grand-Mère.  That brings the total of 
the bailout to $3.4 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  The hon. 
member is again misquoting and misstating the position of the 
ethics counsellor.  The ethics counsellor had made some 
speculative hypothetical comments.  When it came to his ruling on 
the basis of his careful investigation, not once but twice he 
said that the Prime Minister had not breached any rules and did 
not own the shares in question after 1993.  He has not, I submit, 
been in control of any investor funds.  They came under the 
Quebec provincial government program which is administered by 
that Quebec provincial government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

something positive about the Prime Minister, then it is accurate. 
If he says something that is not positive, then it is 
speculative.  That is very interesting.

starting to cry uncle as we continued on this particular file. It 
does not want us to ask questions.  I need to ask questions on

added that the government was undertaking to pay down a minimum

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,

to use 50% of the surpluses to reduce the debt and lower taxes, 
and the other 50% to fund social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his mini budget, the Minister of Finance proposed to allocate 
only 20% of the surpluses to social programs. Now, he is about to 
invest only 10% in transfers to the provinces and in social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to know the government's position. Is it the one 
stated in the Prime Minister's speeches, or the one presented in 
the Minister of Finance's figures? Which one determines 
government policy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial

balanced fiscal policy, that is we will continue to pay off the 
debt, to reduce taxes and, at the same time, to invest in social 
programs and in the economy of the future. This is the Liberal 
program and it is a very responsible program, in our opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the surplus is far higher than predicted and the Minister of 
Finance could apply up to $16 billion to the debt instead of the 
$10 billion forecast last October.  We have nothing against 
paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at a time when there are such crying needs in health 
and in education, does the Minister of Finance not admit that it 
is high time for him to adopt a balanced approach and to not only 
pay part of the debt but also transfer funds to Quebec and the 
provinces for health and education? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial

social transfer for health and social programs.  This is what 
federal co-operation is all about and we will continue to act in 
this way with all of the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleagues and I are so anxious to be sovereign and to 
administer on our own the $33 billion in taxes we hand over to 
these people, instead of having to listen to ridiculous answers 
like that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am merely asking this: will the minister admit that there are 
crying needs in health and education and that it is time this 
government, which refused any and all debate during the election 
campaign, transferred money to finance health and education?

applied to the debt, while these people are being denied

are being rejected when they apply for employment insurance 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, while it is swimming in surpluses, would this government

were in 1993.  She is forgetting that the unemployment rate for 
women in Canada is at its lowest rate in 25 years.  She is 
forgetting that the unemployment rate for young people in Canada 
has continuously come down.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the minister of public works 
about the status of a complaint filed by two Canada Post 
employees and the former president of Alliance Quebec, alleging 
that Canada Post in Montreal violates the language of work 
provisions of the Official Languages Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada Post must respect the law, and this 
includes the Official Languages Act adopted by parliament over 30

French speaking employees outside Quebec and its English speaking 
employees inside Quebec?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say that 
Canada Post has reduced its number of complaints by 70%.  Canada 
Post is working with the Commissioner of Official Languages 
concerning the specific complaints and other complaints from 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a plan in place that the Commissioner of Official 
Languages has accepted, is pleased with and continues to work 
with.  The objective is to make sure that there are no complaints 
and that all citizens have its services in their official

</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we will continue with the Bloc opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, tomorrow that is, we will debate second reading of 
Bill C-3 respecting Petro-Canada.  Should that item conclude, I 
do not foresee calling any other business for tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Monday we will debate Bill C-4 respecting the sustainable 
development foundation.  This will be followed by Bill C-5, the 
species at risk bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Tuesday will be an allotted day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Wednesday we will return to the species at risk bill that 
is to be started on Monday, or commence it if it was not begun at

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with respect to the Thursday question and the 
government House leader's intention of calling the bill on 
endangered species, could he inform the House if he will be 
sending it to committee before second reading? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Brazilian mad cow fiasco, the government 
should be willing to tell Canadians whether it will follow 
science or politics.  The committee could only engage in the 
question before second reading.  Is the government willing to do 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there were a variety of 
topics in the same question.  My understanding is that the issue 
of mad cow disease is a decision of the agriculture department, 
and the species at risk legislation would hardly deal with that. 
As far as I know, cows are not yet an endangered species in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Bill C-5 and the status of it, I understand on one 
occasion in the past it was dealt with at committee before second 
reading.  I am still verifying whether it should be reintroduced 
in that manner.  The present intention, unless I get additional 
information, is to proceed in the usual manner with committee 
meetings following second reading because the other process has 
been utilized in reference to essentially the same bill once 
already.

trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before question period I was talking about the lack of public 
confidence. Every time an international summit is held, there are 
huge demonstrations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people take to the streets, not only professional 
demonstrators, but also representatives of ordinary citizens who 
are fed up with negotiations being carried out behind closed 
doors and taking the country down the wrong road without the 
public's knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example. We happened to find out recently that, 
for the last two years, the OECD countries have been negotiating 
behind closed doors an agreement promoting freer investments 
throughout the world.  We talk about the multilateral agreement 
on investment, but no one in this House, not to mention the 
public, knew that, for the last two years, the OECD countries had 
been negotiating a multilateral agreement on investment 
liberalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a leak on the Internet to find out about the content of 
these negotiations, to find out what was being negotiated on our 
behalf. What was included in the agreement was very ugly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, an international agreement would have given 
transnational corporations the power to do whatever they wanted 
all over the world, and it would also have given them all the 
benefits, while all the costs would have been supported by 
populations all over the world. That did not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such an agreement, most of Quebec's strategic crown 
corporations, for example, would have been deemed illegal. 
Governments would have had their hands tied and would not have 
been able to implement, in compliance with major international 
agreements, economic policies like they do now. Luckily, there 
was that leak. But is it normal to have to rely on such leaks to 
know what is going on in the negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it hard to understand the Liberals' reaction in speaking 
against the motion before us, considering that precedents exist 
regarding what we are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement with the 
United States and then the North American Free Trade Agreement 
between the United States, Canada and Mexico, debates took place, 
then the agreement or the “Act to implement” was introduced here. 
Debates took place in this House and amendments were proposed. 
Some of these amendments were even adopted by the House. I am 
thinking, among others, of the amendment made to NAFTA in 1993 to 
exclude water exports from the agreement. That amendment was 
proposed in the House. It was adopted and included in the act to 
implement the free trade agreement between Canada, the United 
States and Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this reluctance? Do they want to do what was done with the 
MAI? Do they want to negotiate behind closed doors, prevent us 
from knowing the outcome of these negotiations and then present 
the agreement to us as a fait accompli, without any debate, 
without ratification by this House? This does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders what is going through the Liberals' minds. 
Do they want to ignore the precedents of the Free Trade Agreement 
with the United States, the precedents of debate and ratification 
by this House, and the precedents of approval, even of the 
amendments introduced here, which was allowed when NAFTA was 
signed?  Do they want to change the rules?  Do they want to do as 
the former Minister for International Trade did when he kept the 
negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment under 
wraps for two years?  He kept the House in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the Liberals have in mind for the free trade area 
of the Americas agreement?  Is that what the Liberals have in 
mind for the next World Trade Organization agreement?  We will 
not stand for it.  We cannot.  And that is the purpose of our 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that the government respects the precedents of 
the FTA and NAFTA, that it allows debate on the final agreement 
and on the implementing legislation, and that it allows 
amendments to be made if there is anything amiss in these 
agreements.  We are here to represent the public; we are not here 
to kowtow to the powers that be in this government, the people 
negotiating on our behalf behind closed doors.  Those days are 
gone.  We want transparency here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want the basic texts to be made public, and we do not 
mean posted on the government's darn web site.  Government 
propaganda is not what we want.  We want the basic text on which 
the discussions are based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this sort of problem had not arisen in the past, the Prime 
Minister would not have said himself on October 11, 1999, with 
reference to the negotiations in Seattle: 
<UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left>If transparency was not a problem, the Prime Minister would not 
have raised the issue on October 11, 1999. Again I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With very limited exception, working papers, formal contribution 
from members, draft meeting agendas and minutes will be 
circulated as unrestricted documents— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means the documents will be made available to the public. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—as soon as available in all three WTO languages. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If transparency had not been a problem, the Prime Minister would 
not have said that. Canadian officials would not have said that 
either. Why then, when we ask for more transparency,  are we told 
that everything is hunky-dory and that we just have to go on the 
web site? Whom are they kidding? I hope the Liberals will support 
our motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do not, it will mean that, unlike the Conservatives with 
the FTA and NAFTA, they are going to bypass parliament with 
regard to the implementation act. They will say no to any 
sensible amendments we might introduce. It would be an extremely 
serious attack on democracy. This would send the message that the 
MAI process would apply to the FTAA. This means there is a total 
lack of transparency; it is hypocrisy behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the nine discussion tables, we see that they are 
dealing with issues such as culture, education, and intellectual 
property. In Quebec, we will not let the government pull the wool

that there is nothing on it.  However the member who just spoke 
makes direct reference to the website.  Which is it?  Is the Bloc

Canadians on a day to day basis?  Is the Bloc aware of that?  Is 
the member not aware that he seems to contradict himself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One the one hand he calls for more consultation with Canadians 
and for transparency.  On the other hand he seeks to circumvent 
that and wants to see the government's final positions right now. 
He cannot have it both ways.  Which is it? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not stupid. Between what 
can be found on a web site, which is government propaganda on 
general public policies, and what is discussed at the negotiation 
tables based on official position statements, there is a world of 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a look at these official statements, not the government 
propaganda. We have always had access to government propaganda. 
We do not believe in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what I am talking about because I was at the eighth round 
of negotiations at the GATT now known as the WTO. Between what we 
were told by government officials and what was written in the 
public documents—there were no web site at the time, it happened 
too long ago—and what was actually negotiated and the statements 
that were made, there was a lot of difference and even some 
contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out one of them. With regard to agriculture, we 
were supposed to stand for supply management and the control of 
the volume of milk product imports at the Canadian border. At the 
same time, Canada was part of the group trying to eliminate the 
supply management system in the milk industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. What we want 
to know is what is really being negotiated. We do not want to see 
the propaganda. What we also want, and I hope the government has 
not changed its mind and will not act differently than the 
Conservatives did, is for the implementation bill to be 
introduced in the House before the agreement is ratified and for 
us to be able to amend the legislation. Mistakes are bound to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot claim to have a monopoly on truth. We should also 
have our say on this issue. We represent the civil society. 
We have just been elected to represent people. We are not 
greenery. That accounts for the erosion of trust in the 
population. People show up to vote, but for whom? For people who 
will fight for them and will inform them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supranational organizations account for roughly 50% of public 
affairs. Our future is determined by those organizations, and we 
do not have a say. It is determined by people like Mr. Johnston, 
from OECD, who is abysmally arrogant. He told us that he would 
force the MAI down our throats and that we would have no choice 
but to accept it. It was negotiated, it was a done deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But we have news for them. With the MAI, we have shown that the 
civil society and the population are able to make unacceptable 
agreements fail. We will do the same with the other agreements, 
but we must be given the opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot always count on leaks on the Internet. The members on 
the other side of the House have to be transparent and honest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I simply cannot 
resist this.  Having lived through two referendums on the future 
of this country in the province of Quebec, to hear the member 
repeatedly use the word propaganda, I am sorry, but it is pretty 
tough for most Canadians to sit here and listen to that kind of 
nonsense without reacting to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know exactly what the member wants.  His colleagues have made 
it clear all day.  They seek to change the constitution of Canada 
on the fly.  They want something done which has never been done 
in the history of this country.  That is all they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want us to table the legislation in its draft form.  That 
has never been done in the history of this country.  The 
government will continue to follow the established process.  It 
will continue to consult widely with Canadians in every province, 
including the province of Quebec, but it will not accede to this 
request because this request is totally out of line. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, what he is saying makes no 
sense.  It is totally stupid to claim that the constitution has 
to be changed if a bill is to be introduced on the implementation 
of a free trade agreement within the Americas.  That was 
negotiated under the Progressive Conservatives with the Free 
Trade Agreement with the United States, and with the free trade 
agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.  The 
agreements were debated in the House and amendments were 
accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote one of these, if I may, from May 25, 1993.  Mr. 
Barrett, seconded by Mr. Angus, proposed the following amendment: 
“Notwithstanding subsection (1), nothing in this Act or the 
Agreement applies to any water transported by a pipeline or 
diverted by reason of the diversion of a river”.  This was moved 
and adopted in the House. We amended the free trade agreement 
Implementation Act with the United States and Mexico.  We did not 
amend the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are completely off the rails.  I have never seen such a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the motion.  Let 
me at the outset tell you that I am very strongly opposed to the 
motion for one fundamental, basic reason, that is, there is a 
hidden agenda behind it that frankly is not so hidden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all know, in fact, that the Bloc believes Quebec 
should in an official capacity be sitting at the table whenever 
Canada is negotiating international contracts of any nature.  We 
all understand that the men and women in that party are devoted 
to a sovereign Quebec, devoted to separating, even though the 
people of the province of Quebec have clearly indicated that they 
do not support that view, on a number of occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, all of the polling data that could be made available to 
the members opposite, which they choose to ignore, shows that the 
people of Quebec are much more interested in the same issues that 
affect the people of Ontario, British Columbia, Newfoundland, 
Alberta and wherever you want to go in this country.  Those 
issues are jobs, the future of the country for their young 
people, education, and the number one issue of vast majority of 
Canadians, health care and what is happening in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about these international trade negotiations it is 
important to understand that the motion before us today in fact 
refers to a draft agreement.  It does not refer to a final 
agreement that has been hammered out and that perhaps before it 
is signed should come here, but to a draft agreement, which would 
mean that every amendment, every piece of negotiating material, 
every change, every bargaining chip, in fact the entire 
negotiation process, should be subjected to a debate and a vote 
in this place.

free trade agreement, or with any other country, Canadians might 
ask why, as a national politician elected to protect the views of 
all Canadians, I would not want the opportunity to vote on 
whether or not we should sign that document.  On the surface some 
people might say that is a reasonable position, but in practical 
terms let us visit what might happen in that particular scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 members in this place, 172 of which were elected 
to form the government.  In fact the actual government is the 
Governor in Council.  It is the Prime Minister and the cabinet. 
Everyone understands that.  A member of the Liberal backbench is 
in fact a member usually in support of the government.  A member 
from one of the other four parties in this place would be defined 
as a member opposed to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the duty and obligation of Her Majesty's loyal opposition 
to hold the government accountable, all the opposition, even the 
Bloc, which might not recognize the authority that comes 
originally from Westminster and now from the constitution of the 
country.  However, is it their obligation, their duty, to simply 
create gridlock either in the House of Commons or in the ability 
of our trade negotiators to negotiate when working around the 
world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I think the opposite is true.  It is the duty and the 
obligation of all elected members in this place, regardless of 
where they are from in the country, regardless of what political 
philosophy they have, to ensure that we do indeed wind up with 
the best possible negotiated trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean that we can somehow, in some arrogant, 
flamboyant way, say to the people in the Americas that they are 
going to do it our way or the highway.  As we can imagine, since 
there are 301 members in this place there could be 301 different 
opinions on any given day on any given subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustrating part is that much of it is driven by 
misinformation.  Much of it is driven because the opposition 
indeed sees its role to be more than just opposing the 
government.  The opposition parties see their role as that of 
taking any opportunity they can to embarrass the government, 
hence all of the personal attacks against the Prime Minister. 
Instead of dealing with the nation's business, what do we hear in 
question period?  We do not hear the Leader of the Opposition 
standing in his place asking the government about help for 
farmers or about a housing policy, things that we in this caucus 
ask our leadership about all the time.  We do not hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nation's business is taking a back seat in the House of 
Commons in this particular session.  It is being replaced by 
mudslinging and the lowest form of politics that exists in this 
great democracy, which is personality attacks and personal 
attempts to assassinate a member of the House who happens to be 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It is true.  Members can disagree, but 
that is the strategy.  I do not necessarily include the Bloc in 
that strategy because it seems to be an unholy alliance between 
the Canadian Alliance and the Conservative Party.  It is 
interesting to hear their comments when they say that not only 
must justice be done, it must be seen to be done, and not only 
must a government be above the law, it must be seen to be above 
the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  That means they have no proof there is 
anything going on here that is against the law, so what they want 
to do is create some kind of an atmosphere, some kind of an 
insinuation, some kind of an attack.  It is a fishing expedition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hate to tell my colleague on the other side, but he is 
totally off track on what the subject is of today's debate over 
here.  He is not discussing the motion.  I wish to bring that to 
your attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My recollection is that the hon. member is 
talking about something to do with bringing bills before the 
House which deal with international trade matters.  It seems to 
me that has some relevance to the issue before the House, perhaps 
not as direct as some might like, but it has something to do with 
the issue before the House.  I know the hon. member for 
Mississauga West always like to tie his remarks together and I am 
sure he will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your 
ruling.  What is interesting is that the relevance to using the 
example of what the opposition is doing—at least the official 
opposition—is that they are distracting from the issues we 
should be dealing with.  In fact, I will say that at least the 
Bloc has put on the table today an issue that deals with some 
free trade negotiations and agreements and that is not 
necessarily the mudslinging we have seen from the Leader of the 
Opposition and members of the Canadian Alliance and the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevance is about one simple fact, the point that I made 
earlier, that is, it is the duty and the obligation of the 
opposition to hold the government accountable, not to climb into 
the gutter, not to wallow in the political malaise that we see in 
this place, but rather to put forward ideas that can be debated, 
even though I believe the Bloc has a hidden agenda, which is 
always tied around the sovereignty of Quebec.  It always comes 
back to its ability to somehow control the agenda on behalf of 
one province.  Instead of dealing with nationhood, instead of 
dealing with nation building, instead of dealing with 
international responsibilities, it is always and only their focus 
to bring it right back to la belle province.  Frankly, I think 
that in regard to the people of the province of Quebec the Bloc 
misreads what those people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that is before us is more constructive, at least, 
than the nonsense we have been hearing from the official 
opposition and others in this place, but it is terribly 
misguided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just think about trade.  In my riding of Mississauga West 
I cannot imagine what would happen in our economy if we did not 
have a free trade agreement and an ability to do business with 
the United States, with Mexico and with all parts of the world. 
My riding is the head office capital for Japanese head offices in 
Canada.  I think we have over 85 of them in the city of 
Mississauga, not just in my riding, but in the entire city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we have some kind of a trade relationship and, if so, are 
we then going to bring it into this place instead of allowing the 
professional negotiators to do the job?  There are 34 countries 
negotiating an international trade agreement involving Canada and 
the Americas.  There are 34 countries.  Imagine the meeting. 
There would already be two or three negotiators from each 
country, I am sure, perhaps more.  There would be a bevy of staff 
and advisers sitting behind them trying to help them on various 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have obligations.  This is not just about Canada. Certainly 
our role is to defend the interests of this country, but is it 
not in the interests of Canadians and everyone in this country to 
ensure that prosperity, good quality education, good quality 
health care and a good standard of living are made available to 
these other countries?   I think it is a benefit to us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If they will not accept that it may be a global social 
responsibility to share our tremendous wealth, ideas and 
capabilities, then they should look at it from a purely selfish 
point of view, a business point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Prime Minister, as we all know, is in China.  The headlines 
indicate he is talking pretty tough about human rights 
violations.  However there are people who would say, particularly 
on the left of the political spectrum, that he is not tough 
enough and that he should stand up and tell the 1.2 billion 
Chinese they had better do it our way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead there have been constructive attempts to share some of 
the benefits that have come out of what is frankly the greatest 
democracy in the world: Canada.  Let us think about how tolerant 
we are. Let us think about the Council of Canadians and Maude 
Barlow, who once unsuccessfully ran for a Liberal nomination and 
who might have wound up in this place.  I am sure she is a 
talented individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow that group has deemed to take it upon itself to tear 
down every trade agreement and to march in the streets arm in arm 
with the New Democrats to say that it is awful.  That group says 
we are giving away our water, giving away our culture and giving 
away our sovereignty.  It says we are giving and giving and 
giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not doing any of that.  In fact we are sharing our 
technology.  We are sharing our abilities.  Yes, we will share 
from time to time some of our resources in return for sharing 
some of theirs.  It is quid pro quo.  It is not rocket science. 
If we negotiate trade agreements with countries in the Americas 
that can improve their standard of living, then we should just 
follow that bouncing ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we improve the standard of living in Guatemala, for example, 
what are we doing?  We wind up putting more money in the pockets 
of people in that nation.  We wind up creating jobs in that 
nation.  Then what happens?  They buy Canadian products.  They 
buy Canadian technology.  They buy Canadian expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we think that in the year 2001 we could somehow build a wall? 
In Alberta they call it a firewall. Alberta would like to put up 
a firewall, whatever that means, so it can somehow stop the 
chuckwagons from coming from eastern Canada and ramming things. 
It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw members of the official opposition attending the founding 
meeting of some western separation party.  I forget their 
ridings, but to see Bert and Ernie, or Homer and Bart Simpson, or 
whoever they were, going to that meeting was absolutely shameful. 
They should have gone to the meeting and said that it was 
silly, that they were Canadians first, because that is what 
Albertans believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all seen the latest polling data.  Some of the 
separatists involved continue to flex their muscles in spite of 
the fact that Albertans have ranked the Leader of the Opposition 
lower than just about anyone else in the country last, in fact, 
in approval ratings.  They cannot take western Canada cannot of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member for Mississauga West 
is doing his best, but the motion does deal with NAFTA and trade. 
I think perhaps he is straying just a little far off topic.  I 
invite him to return to the subject of his remarks that he was 
giving earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I liked your former 
ruling better than that one.  I appreciate your direction.  I get 
a little excited from time to time when I go down the path of 
some of the irresponsible behaviour I have seen in this place. I 
am pleased to come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With due respect, Sir, I do not think I strayed too far. The 
issue is how we negotiate agreements with other countries and put 
the best interests of Canadians forward.  We have heard from 
members of the Bloc today that it is some secretive process that 
never sees the light of day. 
I guess they do not have computers.  I am sure that as members of 
parliament they have a budget, as we do, which would allow them 
to have computers.  They could probably afford, in their members' 
operating budget, to tap into that new scary thing called the 
web.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to know what is going on, all the data is on the 
web for all to see.  It is there for all Canadians and not just 
for members of parliament.  If the members want to create 
gridlock they can ignore that.  If they want to know what is 
happening with questions they have in the House, they have an 
opportunity in question period to stand and ask the Minister for 
International Trade what is going on with the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members of parliament have opportunities to seek out 
meetings with members of the government.  I am quite sure 
government members would be more than prepared to meet with the 
critic or a group from the opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a parliamentary secretary who is second to none in this 
place.  He is the member for London—Fanshawe, and he would be 
more than delighted to sit and explain what is going on in 
relation to the negotiations.  All they have to do is ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members do not have to put forward a motion stating 
that somehow, sitting at the centre table in here, we will do all 
the negotiating in this place.  We all know what would happen. 
Everything would be blown out of proportion.  There would be 
grandstanding beyond belief.  People would play to the cameras 
instead of trying to resolve a deal that would be best for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost trite, inconsequential and unbelievable to have to 
say that we live in a global economy, but obviously we do.  We 
must be prepared to trade in the world, to trade aggressively and 
to put our best foot forward.  We must give our negotiating team 
the ability to do that.  We must not create gridlock by 
suggesting that somehow we will magically become experts in the 
areas of free trade and in negotiating international trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people perhaps have a swollen opinion of themselves when it 
comes to their understanding and their capabilities.  I trust the 
negotiators to come forward with a plan that will be in the best 
interests of the country.  Our government has a very solid track 
record in that regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are not here to try to polish our image. That is very clear. 
We are here to have intelligent debates in which we must respect 
other people's intelligence. It is very important to do that, 
because we are here to represent people who are also intelligent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be seen as stupid nor, indirectly, should those we 
represent be seen as stupid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion does not require any change to the constitution nor 
any major upheaval. We want a debate like the ones we had under 
the Conservative government on the free trade agreement with the 
United States and under the Liberals on the ratification of 
NAFTA. It was the Conservatives who negotiated the agreement, but 
it was the Liberals who, after spending years tearing their hair 
out and opposing free trade, ratified that agreement. They 
swallowed their pride and they passed the act implementing the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that process, implementation bills were introduced in both 
cases and were debated. Could someone tell us whether a 
parliament is still a place to hold debates and not a place to 
have spineless members who say “We are backbenchers, we cannot 
say anything”? It is unbelievable to hear such things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member has no talent in international trade, as he 
has said himself, but he has a responsibility of properly 
representing those who elected him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we just ask him whether he would agree, as happened with 
the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the free trade agreement with 
the United States and Mexico, to a debate here, so amendments 
could be tabled and we could debate them in order to improve the 
agreement, if need be, before ratification? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did it in the case of NAFTA.  Why do things differently 
with the free trade area of the Americas?  Why do things 
differently with the upcoming WTO agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no pretensions. We just want to honour our 
responsibilities, to not have any tricks played on us, like the 
people of the industrialized world could have been with the 
multilateral agreement on investment, with their great friend Mr. 
Johnston, a man of incredible arrogance.  He, with his nose in 
the air, almost right to the ceiling, said that it was already a 
fait accompli, that the people had simply to note the great 
negotiations held in order to look after the interests of the 
world's multinational companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things do not work like that in real world. We are here to 
represent and defend the interests of people and to ensure that 
everything that is negotiated is good for them.

not hear the part of my speech where I said that at least the 
Bloc is putting forward an issue for debate that is important to 
all Canadians.  I did not insult the intelligence of the members 
opposite.  I think it is a legitimate issue to be put on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said, however, that I fear the old hidden agenda of 
Quebec's place at the table for international trade agreements. 
Sovereignty for the province of Quebec is always the motive 
behind everything that group of parliamentarians does.  I find it 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every agreement that has been signed, whether NAFTA, WTO, 
Canada-Chile or Canada-Israel, went through the exact process 
where negotiations were done by professional negotiators.  That 
is not to say that I or others do not have expertise or interest. 
It is the old saying about a horse built by a committee becomes a 
camel.  Let us imagine an agreement negotiated by 301 people in a 
public place like this.  What in God's name would we wind up 
with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is that it will be negotiated.  It will be brought 
into this place where our responsibility will be to debate it, to 
ratify it on behalf of the Canadian people and to ensure it is in 
the best interest of all Canadians.

Speaker, I listened to my colleague from the other side and as 
usual he got too excited and brought forward issues that had no 
relevance to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to confirm something he just said.  If I am 
not mistaken I just heard him say that the treaty will come back 
to the House and be debated here before it is ratified.  Is that 
what I heard the member say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not excited at all. 
It may just be my normal glowing personality the member is 
referring to.  I was saying that the standard process is that 
there is a negotiating team.  In this case 34 countries are 
involved in the negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point in relationship to the motion is that hon. members 
opposite would have us bring draft agreements and amendments into 
the House to debate them before there is any agreement between 
the chief negotiators of the 34 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a recipe for gridlock.  It is an impossible situation in 
which to put together a quality agreement.  It would simply allow 
those who would to grandstand on issues.  It would not work to 
the betterment of all Canadians in the international trade 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will follow the normal process that has been followed in the 
past and negotiate agreements in the best interests of the 
country.

mistaken, the member is saying that in future all our problems 
will be solved by experts. What are we doing here then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that we should not be asking questions, but that we 
should accept what the experts come up with. He says “What would 
301 members of parliament at the negotiating table accomplish?” 
We are not asking for every one of us to take part in the 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a riding, and Quebecers who want to know what is 
going on. The member says that we want to talk about health, 
education, labour. But what does he think is on the table when 
free trade agreements are negotiated? This will affect the future 
of all Quebecers and all Canadians. We have the right to ask 
questions. We have the right to know what we are getting 
ourselves into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that almost no one but those who voted for the 
Liberals deserve to run this beautiful country, Canada—or 
something like that, at the beginning of his speech—and that the 
opposition does not carry much weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think we are doing here in this House, if 
not representing a segment of the population that has questions 
to ask? It is not the people on your side who will have to field 
questions, but the members on our side.

said I had no difficulty with the fact that the Bloc put forward 
this kind of a motion.  It is much more constructive than many of 
the others that we have seen.  However, let us be clear what the 
motion says.  It says that the House demand that the government 
bring any draft agreement on the free trade zone area of the 
Americas before the House.  They want us to bring to the House a 
draft agreement, an amendment, a change or a negotiation point.

colleague.  I distinctly heard the member say that this agreement 
would come to the House of Commons, would be debated in the House 
of Commons and would be ratified here.  Would he go back over 
that statement and say whether or not that was accurate because I 
do not believe it is accurate.  I believe it is completely wrong. 
It would make this motion redundant if in fact it were accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member understands 
the process.  There is a negotiating team, in this case, with 34 
countries.  They will enter into an agreement.  There is no 
question about that.  Canada will be part of it.  Before any 
implementation of that agreement, it will come back to this 
place, as every other agreement has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not try to twist my words or anything that is going on in the 
process.  It is standard with the FTA, or the WTO, or Chile or 
with Israel.  This agreement will be done in exactly the same 
way.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating a topic which is of paramount 
importance to me since the summit of the Americas on the free 
trade area of the Americas will be held in Quebec City next April 
20 and 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By an absolutely incredible coincidence, as far as I am 
concerned, this will also be a very important anniversary: on 
April 20 three years ago I attempted to initiate a crucially 
important debate on the social impacts of globalization. As you 
will recall, I attempted to raise the issue by walking out of the 
House with my seat, which I brought to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I wanted to raise was this: in the context of 
globalization, what is happening to political power? The 
statistics show clearly that, in spite of the economic growth of 
the past few years, there is an increase in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate meant a lot to me then and still does. Whether we 
talk about globalization or “continentalization”, most of the 
issues are very similar. I have worked very hard for our role to 
be taken seriously, as well as for an in-depth debate on the 
revolution we are experiencing today. Who is in charge? Who is in 
charge of the political agenda? Is it the elected 
representatives, international bodies or the marketplace? These 
are very important questions.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced I am not the only parliamentarian who is 
wondering who is in charge of the world economic agenda. The mere 
fact that we are asking the question indicates that somewhere 
there is a lack of transparency or a lack of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of concerns regarding the future. As the 
youngest parliamentarian in this House, I did something very 
daring and I asked myself a number of questions. I believe there 
is now somebody younger than I am in this House. 
But I can still wonder about the kind of society I will be living 
in, 20 or 30 years from now, as the gap between rich and poor is 
getting wider and wider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the term free trade area too much. Economic trade 
area of the Americas would be more to my liking. I am in no way 
against international trade. It is a very good thing. For one 
thing, I want to be able to have bananas, and I hope people in 
other countries will be able to continue to buy maple syrup. My 
example is somewhat trivial, but it shows how important 
international trade is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do not like is the word free. Does it mean there are no 
rules? Certainly not. We need a trade framework and what I would 
call rules of the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we have rules of the game? Because the economy cannot 
be set apart from the social issues. We cannot say that trade 
agreements do no concern people, that they are purely a 
commercial matter, while the social impact is something else. 
That is not true. Everything is connected, and that is why we 
need more extensive debates. Hence, the importance of this 
opposition day and, at the same time, the tragedy that we are 
having a single day of debate on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have more extensive discussions. We should have a 
debate on social values. We do not need to ask why people took to 
the streets in Seattle, in Prague, in Nice, or in Washington, and 
why they will do the same in Quebec City in April. It is because 
they are concerned. They are wondering, and they do not like the 
kind of society that seems to be emerging. I share their 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what will happen if the economy is left to its own 
devices, if we have free trade everywhere. 
I think a free market system will only lead to increased 
competition. The question I ask myself is what the consequences 
of this increased competition will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out some of the possible consequences. To be 
competitive, a business will probably try to hire the brightest 
people, which is very commendable. In this knowledge based 
economy, we all have that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To lower its production costs, will this same business have a 
tendency to overexploit natural resources, to pay no attention to 
the environment, to lower salaries or to simply lay off workers? 
Another thing would be to try not to pay taxes. These are all 
things to be expected when a business wants to remain 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against competition, but I think there has to be 
a framework. In a free trade area of the Americas, we have to set 
rules, including social rules. In an economy which has a growing 
tendency to overheat and to skid, we must build safety rails to 
make sure we have a social safety net. We have to talk about 
health care, access to education, income security and 
environmental protection. These are all absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this must be done through an open debate where both the 
public and parliamentarians have the opportunity to express their 
views.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues talked earlier about the multilateral agreement on 
investment. I hope we all got our lesson from what happened with 
this agreement that was negotiated behind closed doors and which 
parliamentarians were certainly not aware of. Fortunately, there 
was a leak. Things like that should remind us that it should not 
happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, three years after this agreement failed, what are we 
doing? We are asking to see the documents, we are asking for 
parliamentarians to play their role and vote on the ratification 
of such an agreement. I find it almost absurd that we need to 
have this kind of debate, because it seems quite obvious to me. 
It is abundantly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel there is still a long way to go. I think that we, as 
parliamentarians, have many questions to ask ourselves about the 
role we want to play in the globalization and continentalization 
of economies. As a member of parliament who was elected in a 
national forum, if I might say—every member of parliament in the 
world is elected to sit in a country's parliament—I think 
reflection is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the issue of parliamentary reform has been raised 
regularly. I believe a reform of parliament is absolutely 
necessary. 
However, a true reform would mean pondering the issues and 
developing measures in order to redefine the role of members of 
parliament in a context of globalization and continentalization. 
I would like to talk to parliamentarians from Chile, Argentina 
and Guatemala.  I would like to know about their own reality and 
their own difficulties.  I am convinced that most of them have 
the same troubles and the same concerns as all of us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter this new millennium, this is how we should review 
the role of parliamentarians. It is not sufficient to meet with 
members of other parliaments over a drink once in a while. We 
should meet regularly.  How will we deal with issues that go 
beyond our borders?  When I say this, naturally I am thinking 
about international democracy, the democracy of the International 
Monetary Fund, of the World Bank and of the World Trade 
Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also thinking about the regularization of capital markets 
and issues such as the Tobin tax for example, issues that have to 
be submitted to scrutiny by many countries and parliamentarians. 
There is the Internet, the environment, the incessant expansion 
of international crime, the anticompetitive rules and those 
transnational giants emerging more and more to become worrisome 
monopolies; there are ethics issues like genetically engineered 
organisms and biosafety.  There are numerous questions that go 
beyond the boundaries of this parliament and that will have to be 
examined in a much broader context since we cannot escape 
globalization or continentalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the time I had, but I will gladly answer questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me take this 
opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment to the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the comments of the member from the Bloc with some 
interest.  I support his call for meetings of parliamentarians 
other than in this House of Commons.  Is the hon. member aware 
that when the House is recessed in the month of March, there will 
be in this very Chamber a meeting of elected members of 
parliament from throughout the Americas?  As a member of 
parliament in this House he is certainly more than welcome to 
participate and I hope he will have the chance to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I am aware of it. I 
also know that there are some tensions between parliamentary 
groups, between COPA, FIPA and others, and it is unfortunate. 
Yes, I will certainly attend the meeting. We should also think 
about how tough it is to hold these kinds of meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to attend two meetings of international 
parliamentarians, the first one when the agreement on the 
prohibition of anti-personnel landmines was ratified in 
Mozambique and the second one at the Forum of Federations at 
Mont-Tremblant.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say though that in such meetings it is hard to have 
in-depth ongoing discussions like the ones we have in committee 
where we meet once a week, on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still obstacles to be overcome but I will definitely 
take part in such events. In fact, I promote them. I said earlier 
that it was not just about having a few cocktails, but that it 
was important to be able to address major issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we one day have an assembly sitting not just a few days but 
several weeks? Are we moving toward some kind of continental 
parliament? I am not talking about a continental government, but 
rather a continental parliament or even a world parliament where 
we could debate these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not pretend to have the answers to all these questions, but 
I think we should look to the future and find forward looking 
solutions to some of today's problems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not take the member's 
question as rhetorical so I will respond by saying that given the 
number of bilateral groups that exist in various countries around 
the world, I cannot think of a nation that is more connected to 
the world scene than Canada.  As a member of parliament, I feel 
that I have a tremendous myriad number of opportunities, as does 
my colleague, to have tremendous regular input with people from 
virtually every country in the world that we interact with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about a lack of consultation and things being 
done in secret.  It boggles my mind to hear those kind of 
comments coming from the Bloc today.  Indeed there were questions 
posed in question period that followed that misperception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware that there is a government website and that 
the government receives comments daily from Canadians, including 
from the province of Quebec?  Is the member aware that the 
government continues to receive written submissions from NGOs and 
stakeholders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware that 10 days ago there was a meeting with 
the Minister for International Trade and the trade ministers of 
all the provinces, including the important province of Quebec, 
where all these issues were discussed at great length?  Is the 
member aware that the Minister for International Trade met in 
Quebec with NGOs such as Oxfam-Quebec.  Is he aware of this 
extensive consultation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that this kind of 
consultation is, unfortunately, not necessary.  I will give an 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall, there was a meeting of the ministers of finance and 
the governors of the central banks of the G20.  At that time, 
the Minister of Finance, who defined the G20 as a kind of board 
of governors of the world economy, met with a number of NGOs, or 
non-governmental organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to take part, but what was I told?  “No, it is for 
NGOs only”.  So there was no open debate.  The media was 
excluded. There is still a long way to go before there is any 
real transparency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today on the Bloc Quebecois motion calling 
upon the government to bring any draft agreement on the free 
trade area of the Americas before the House so that it may be 
debated and put to a vote before ratification by the Government 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to begin by reacting to the comments by the parliamentary 
secretary informing us today in the House that there is an 
Internet site which provides a method of consultation with the 
public and the NGOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, I thank the Canadian government for making this 
available to Canadians and Quebecers.  If it wants to be really 
transparent in its consultation mechanisms, however, let it make 
the Canadian position public before the negotiations.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, of course, a consultation mechanism.  What we have 
been trying to find out for weeks in this House, however, is the 
real position of the Canadian government only a few months or 
weeks away from the summit of the Americas, to be held in Quebec 
City in April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not opposed to free trade, let me point out, far from it. I 
am one of the supporters of more open trade with the world. 
Today, I want to share some concerns about social and labour 
rights. Later on, the hon. member for Laurentides will elaborate 
on these issues. I would like to focus my comments on my 
concerns about the protection of environmental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the summit of the Americas just months away, in light of 
how the texts of the multilateral agreement on investment were 
negotiated, in light of the fact that we found out about the content of 
the negotiations on the Internet, and in light of the secrecy surrounding 
the talks on NAFTA's environmental clauses, I have every reason 
to be concerned about the upcoming negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is asking the federal government to negotiate 
environmental clauses within the trade agreements. This is 
critical. Since it is important to know where we are headed, let 
us look at what was done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the free trade agreement with the United States, 
we will recall that the environmental issue was raised as early 
as in 1991. Thanks to the effectiveness and involvement of all 
these organizations, these NGOs, especially those from Canada 
and the United States, which were allowed to speak to some 
extent, a final text including several environmental clauses was 
ready by 1992, so much so in fact that, at the time, the free trade agreement 
was dubbed the green agreement. Some were concerned that there 
would be a grey agreement. 
Quite the contrary. The so-called green agreement allowed a 
certain number of environmental provisions to be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply recall the preamble of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which states that the implementation of this 
agreement must be undertaken in a manner consistent with 
environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall article 104 of the Free Trade Agreement, which 
provides for the principle of primacy in the implementation and 
application of international agreements dealing with the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention two agreements, the Basel convention on the 
control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste and the 
international agreement on the environment. That is the Montreal 
protocol on the ozone layer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 104.1 of the agreement provides for the upholding of 
these international agreements in the implementation of the Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can therefore be said that the North American Free Trade 
Agreement is open, that it contains environmental standards, and 
that it goes further as far as the environment protection 
standards are concerned. Further than the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement, and further than the GATT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, people would like to see an open debate take place. There 
is certainly room for improvement. I will come back to the Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People would like to see a stronger article 114 in NAFTA. This 
article deals precisely with sanctions, the possibility of 
recourses in the whole issue of pollution havens, by 
discouraging polluters when they come to pollute an environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we think that, in future negotiations, there should be 
a strengthening of what has been created in the Free Trade 
Agreement with the United States, the commission for 
environmental co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want that commission to be strengthened and given a clearer 
mandate, so that it can offset the power of large industries and 
big corporations on the international stage. The commission must 
be strengthened and given the ability to set up inquiries and 
table reports more regularly. Important meetings must be held 
between trade and environment officials on the implementation of 
free trade agreements in order to integrate environmental 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want, in the summit of the Americas negotiations, the 
relation between investors and governments to be taken into 
account. We are concerned. When we consider the legal situation, 
when we consider the current challenges under the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, particularly in relation to chapter 11 on 
the relations between investors and governments, we see that a 
number of environmental regulations, in all three countries, have 
been challenged by investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some investors and some corporations feel the environmental 
legislation in all three NAFTA member countries is too 
restrictive and have decided to challenge it. We must be 
vigilant. An expert on free trade agreements said he was deeply 
concerned about this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, there are two trends in the negotiations of the 
agreements for the free trade area of the Americas.  One is to 
isolate environmental questions by redirecting them to other 
forums, such as the WTO or the OAS. But a new approach is being 
developed in which the aim is to consolidate the whole 
environmental aspect of free trade agreements.  We support this 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want as well, is to renegotiate the clauses of NAFTA in 
order to exclude the whole issue of water as a natural resource. 
I understand that water is not currently a commodity, it is not 
considered to be such, but basically we want water, as a natural 
resource, not to be considered a commodity and not to become an 
item for export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will quote a former Premier of Quebec, now an 
expert on free trade, Pierre-Marc Johnson, who said recently: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to the next summit of the Americas in 2001 in Quebec 
City is therefore unclear, and many obstacles to the inclusion of 
environmental issues in NAFTA must be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, NAFTA was 
greeted as the greenest agreement in history. It remains to be 
seen whether history will repeat itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment the Bloc on bringing 
this important issue to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of very important 
questions on the issue of globalization.  We heard earlier today, 
and the government would agree, that much of the opposition to 
globalization and to the World Trade Organization, like we saw in 
Seattle, has to do with actual misnomers. 
Many of these organizations and groups are in fact opposing that 
which they claim they want to support, such as the poor, 
environmental rules and regulations, job protection, minimum 
wages and many other issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the hon. member is prepared to work with 
members from across the party line in developing a movement 
within the House so that we can get the truth out about free 
trade, and ensure that the WTO and other forums that are engaging 
in freer trade ensure that they have an open discussion on the 
issues of environmental protection, labour laws, rules and 
regulations, worker protection and many of these other issues? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is taking 
words out of my mouth. This is the essence of the motion.  I hope 
that if the parliamentary secretary wants to intervene during the 
time I am allotted, he will not repeat that there is already an 
Internet site.  We all know as parliamentarians that the site 
exists.  However, I would like this government after it has 
consulted NGOs and the public to make public the documents Canada 
will use in its negotiations at the summit in April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that, in the principles to be set forth and as part of 
Canada's position in the negotiations, which, unfortunately, 
seems to have been given over to professional negotiators, as the 
parliamentary secretary told us, we will find protection of 
social rights, of the rights of workers and of the environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague made 
reference to NGOs and to the process of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he feel that it is necessary for the government to hear 
from NGOs and from civil society in the FTAA consultative 
process?  Does he feel that that is a wise thing to do?  If he 
does would he speak to his colleague in the Bloc who preceded him 
who, if I heard him correctly and I am sure I did, felt that it 
was not necessary to consult with NGOs?  Is there a common voice 
from the Bloc today or am I hearing a contradiction? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras: </B>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the 
parliamentary secretary is distorting what my colleagues and the 
hon. member have said. He is probably referring to my colleague 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His government took part in preliminary meetings, among others, 
for the 1994 Miami summit. His government probably took part in 
four ministerial meetings, between 1995 and 1998, where some 
Latin American countries asked that NGOs be excluded from the 
negotiations, saying that environmental NGOs had no business 
being involved in international agreement negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the Canadian government responded to this demand, 
that NGOs not be involved in those negotiations, a demand made 
repeatedly by some countries that are now negotiating. What was 
the outcome? In Santiago, 800 NGOs from 34 countries expressed 
their concern that environmental and labour provisions would be 
excluded from negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the members on this side of the House who opposed the 
participation of NGOs, it is the government, which did nothing to 
counter some countries' demand that NGOs not be involved in the 
negotiations. The hon. member will have an opportunity to answer 
my question, since this debate is not over yet. What was the 
Canadian position when some Latin American countries asked that 
the NGOs not be involved in the negotiation?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade has made excellent points 
in regard to our involvement in the free trade area of the 
Americas.  Let me just reiterate that in the case of agriculture 
and agrifood, the FTAA offers opportunity to promote economic 
growth and prosperity in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From beginning to end our agriculture and agrifood system 
produces about 8.4% of the national gross domestic product, and 
accounts for about one in seven of all Canadian jobs.  Canada's 
agriculture and agrifood sector provides more than $120 billion 
in food products, both domestically and internationally.  The 
agriculture and agrifood sector is a major player in contributing 
to Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important part of that equation is trade.  Trade has been and 
continues to be vitally important to the Canadian agriculture and 
agrifood industry.  In fact, it accounts for a good half of all 
farm sales.  Each year we export about $20 billion in agriculture 
and agrifood products.  With those sales, Canada's share of 
overall world agriculture and agrifood trade is edging closer to 
the ambitious goal set by the industry of capturing 4% of the 
world's agrifood trade by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our relatively small population and our incredible capacity 
for agriculture production, it is only natural that Canada is a 
food exporter.  This commitment to trade with nations around the 
world has put Canada at the forefront of the movement to 
strengthen the international trading system in agriculture and 
agrifood products.  The new export opportunities trade agreements 
have provided for agriculture and agrifood products have created 
jobs and boosted economic stability, both in rural communities 
and urban centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is working on several fronts to increase trade in 
the agriculture and agrifood sector.  The FTAA is one of those. 
The FTAA is an historic opportunity to unite 34 countries of the 
Americas in a vast new free trade area.  It is a market with a 
combined population of more than $800 million and GDP of $17 
trillion, and it is right in our neighbourhood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only logical that we would negotiate an agreement that 
would enhance our trade and investment opportunities with our 
neighbours in the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has truly become a nation of the Americas.  As the Prime 
Minister once said “Geography has made Canada a country of the 
Americas.  History, and especially recent history, has seen a 
steady growing sense among Canadians that our future is closely 
linked to that of our neighbours in the hemisphere”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By its very nature, the FTAA will achieve for exports of our 
agrifood products greater improvements in market access to the 
countries of the hemisphere where currently they face relatively 
high tariffs.  At the same time, in the WTO negotiations we will 
actively seek to achieve a more level playing field through the 
elimination of export subsidies and the substantial reduction or 
elimination of trade distorting domestic support.  We will 
continue to ensure that the ability of Canadians to operate the 
orderly marketing systems necessary for stability and 
profitability is preserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By participating in the FTAA, our overall objective is to deepen 
and broaden our relationship with the Americas.  We just have to 
look at the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, which became NAFTA 
in 1994 when Mexico joined, to see how Canada has benefited from 
previous trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, the year the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement came into 
effect, Canadian agrifood exports to the U.S. were about $3.6 
billion.  Ten years later they had more than tripled to $13.2 
billion.  I should also point out that in 1989 we imported more 
agrifood products from the United States than we exported to 
them.  Today we have a net agrifood trade surplus with the U.S. 
of more than $3 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the FTAA may not produce the same magnitude of agrifood 
trade expansion as that which we experienced with the U.S., there 
is good reason to believe that the FTAA offers significant growth 
opportunities for our agrifood exports to the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These closer ties with other countries of the Americas are 
already paying off.  Our two-way trade with Latin America and the 
Caribbean has more than doubled what it was five years ago.  In 
total, Canadian investment in this region has reached $15 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade is crucial to Canada.  It has created millions of jobs for 
Canadians and it will create millions more in the next century. 
With the negotiation of free trade spanning the Americas this 
prosperity will be shared throughout the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As host of the summit of the Americas in Quebec City this April, 
Canada is taking a leadership role in ensuring that the FTAA 
negotiations will succeed to the benefit of all countries in the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our efforts over the next few years will pay off in 
spades down the road, as people of every country in this 
hemisphere reap the benefits of increased prosperity through 
trade and investments.  I look forward, as I know the Canadian 
agriculture and agrifood sector does, to continue to work and 
trade closely with our neighbours across the Americas.  The fact 
is that establishing freer and fairer global agricultural trade 
is critical to the long term viability of our farms and the 
prosperity of our rural communities and indeed the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agreed with many of the comments 
the hon. member made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agriculture and agrifood sector will benefit from lowering 
trade barriers.  That is why the official opposition is generally 
supportive of liberalizing trade barriers which will allow for 
the freer flow of goods, services and capital.  However, food 
producers and food manufacturers are interested in accountability 
and transparency in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion, which seems reasonable to me, is about not 
renegotiating the agreement but bringing it before the House. 
This would allow parliamentarians, the representatives of the 
people of Canada, to debate it, deliberate on it and either 
ratify it or not.  Is that not our proper role?  Could my hon. 
colleague address that question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we certainly must work 
to lower the trade barriers because our producers and farmers 
deserve the very best opportunities that are available.  They 
produce the finest products, the safest and the best food in the 
world.  I can testify to that.  The opportunities are there and 
they deserve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers have faced a real challenge in the last couple of 
years.  Mother nature produced a lot of bad conditions for crops 
and the unfair subsidies from the EU and the United States have 
not helped either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that we all work together on the FTAA situation so 
that we can benefit the producers and the people in the rural 
areas.  Agriculture is very important to all people in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member opposite mentioned in his response to the member from the 
Alliance the unfair subsidies from the United States.  I am 
interested in that comment linked with his earlier comment during 
his speech wherein he said that trade with the United States had 
tripled over the last 10 years.  I believe his figures were $3.6 
billion to something like $13.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot help but wonder whether or not there is a 
relationship between the explosion in trade between the two 
countries and the fact that the Canadian government, because of 
that $13.2 billion, does not want to get into any serious 
argument or challenge to the United States about unfair trade 
subsidies, which the member and the parliamentary secretary 
referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to comment on that development and see if he 
agrees that it is unfair.  If it is unfair, why is Canada not 
doing something directly about it?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. 
colleague, who was a very valuable member of our agricultural 
standing committee in the last session, as I hope he will be this 
session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether any one of us could do more about the 
unfair subsidies and the situation today than our Prime Minister 
has done.  Our Prime Minister spoke first to President Bush about 
the situation facing our farmers in regard to the subsidies.  Of 
course President Bush went on to talk about other things, such as 
what he wanted and what he wanted from us.  Our Prime Minister 
told the president we could work on those things but that he 
first needed a commitment that we would work to make a more level 
playing field for our producers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member talk about the movement of goods and 
services between countries.  How does he rationalize his 
government's stand on the movement of hydro power from Labrador 
to the markets when the government has always opposed a power 
corridor through Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question and I also would support any agreements of any kind with 
our provinces that would benefit the great province that the 
member represents, Newfoundland.  I know we have barriers between 
provinces that are sometimes more excessive than those we have 
across the international borders, and I think it is something I 
would certainly support and work with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to say what a great 
honour it is to follow the eloquence of the hon. member from 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington, and I will tell the 
House why.  It is that not only does he know what is in the best 
interests of his constituents in Ontario, but he also knows a 
great deal as parliamentary secretary about matters relating to 
agriculture, so I listen to him with great interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I was hoping to ask him a question, but of course other 
members preceded me.  He certainly knows a great deal when it 
comes to agriculture so I was very interested in his comments. 
This is a very important issue in terms of the free trade 
agreement area of the Americas and the kinds of things that 
Canada needs to do with its neighbours in the western hemisphere. 
It is a dynamic region.  It is something we need to ensure we in 
Canada do in the best interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out, the area itself has eight hundred 
million people. That is not even one-sixth of the world's 
population, yet they account for one-third of the world's 
economic activity.  That is a great deal, and that is something 
we in Canada and we as Canadians need to tap into.  It 
represents, as the hon. member preceding me indicated, $11 
trillion.  The combined gross domestic product of the Americas, 
then, is greater than that of the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder, then, that given all these facts the leaders of 
the western hemisphere believe in the potential here.  What we 
want to do as Canadians and what we want to do as a country is 
ensure that we tap into this very important area and that we do 
so effectively on the social, the political and the economic 
fronts to ensure that we promote democracy, development and 
growth for all of us, in a manner consistent with what I believe 
are the values of Canada and ultimately the values that all of us 
can share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Miami summit in 1994, the leaders ensured and endorsed a 
declaration and a plan of action that expressed a common 
commitment to strengthening democracy and creating greater 
prosperity for everyone.  They also committed themselves at that 
time to practical measures to improve health care, to increase 
access to quality education and to protect biodiversity.  They 
committed themselves to taking collective action against the 
scourge of drugs and corruption and to expanding and deepening 
dialogue with civil society on regional priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second summit in Santiago in 1998, this was furthered. 
The co-operation that had existed in 1994 in Miami was developed 
even further, more in an incremental fashion but also in a manner 
consistent with the movement forward that we anticipated would in 
fact be in place.  At that conference in Santiago, leaders once 
again endorsed action to support development of democratic 
institutions.  Human rights, again a very topical issue, was at 
the top of the agenda.  Also included was enhanced transparency. 
Of course with that, there was the respect for the rule of law. 
They gave specific instructions to begin the process of 
negotiating the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once it is complete the FTAA will be the world's largest free 
trade area. 
That is something I believe that we in Canada need to keep in 
focus and keep in mind, because that is huge in terms of social, 
political and economic realities.  We need to remember that.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, then, the summit of the Americas process offers 
numerous opportunities, not only for Canada but for the countries 
in the western hemisphere.  I believe that in the process we will 
enhance the reputation of Canada and its ability to conduct 
business and do the kinds of things that are required.  It is a 
huge tangible opportunity for all of us in this area.  I think it 
underscores the commitment of the government, our Prime Minister, 
the cabinet and indeed all caucus members, to ensure that we 
export and do the kinds of things that are in the best interests 
of business and the people who work with business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one sector that I want to identify today during my 
time in the House, it is the service sector, and not only what it 
means for Canada but what it can do in terms of Canada exporting 
into that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind you, Mr. Speaker, and all members in the House 
that the service sector is a key engine of Canada's economy.  It 
is responsible for more than two-thirds of Canada's GDP.  We have 
to think about that for a minute.  That is huge in terms of what 
it represents.  Almost three-quarters of employment, 10,500,000 
jobs and nearly 90% of all new job creation in Canada, is now 
directly related to the service sector.  Why?  It is clear.  That 
is the kind of economy we are in.  That is the kind of economy we 
stand to benefit by and indeed export to that part of the world. 
It is leading the transformation of the Canadian economy into a 
knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More employees in the service sector are highly educated and 
enjoy high weekly salaries, for example, much beyond the average. 
Again that is something that underpins our economic security and 
stability.  Services are at the heart of Canada's innovation 
system.  For example, communications, financial services and 
technical business services are among the most innovative 
industries in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a trading nation, Canada counts on service exports to other 
countries.  In so doing, it strengthens the prosperity for all of 
us here in Canada.  Not counting Canada's direct investment 
abroad in service companies, Canada is the twelfth largest 
exporter of services in the world.  That is phenomenal if we 
really think about it.  Canada exported $51.8 billion worth of 
services in 1999 alone.  Canadian companies such as SNC-Lavalin, 
Teleglobe, Enbridge and Hydro-Québec are among the world's 
leaders in their fields.  Their expertise is sought around the 
world, and rightfully so, because they have so much to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though service exports only account for 12% of total Canadian 
exports, Canada's trade in services is increasing at a much 
greater pace than is its trade in other areas.  Given the 
importance of trade for our country, we can say without fear of 
exaggeration, I believe, that improving market access for our 
service providers abroad is vital for our economy here at home 
and for the prosperity we enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument for supporting Canada's service exports is 
particularly eloquent when it comes to the Americas.  Canada's 
commercial services exports to FTAA countries, excluding the U.S. 
and Mexico, were worth $1.9 billion in 1998, up from $787 million 
in 1993, which shows an increase of 19% in terms of what 
potential exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To wrap up, all I am saying by way of a quick conclusion is 
this.  Countries like Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Venezuela, 
Columbia and Brazil are all key existing or potential export 
markets for Canada.  This is something that all of us should be 
supporting.  I hope that all of us in the House do, because it 
stands to underpin the very foundation of Canada's economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that at the end of the day people from wherever they are 
in Canada expect us as a government to ensure the prosperity and 
sustainability of the economy here in Canada.  One of the best 
ways to do it is to open up the borders for trade and to export 
these kinds of things, and especially, as I pointed out, 
services, into the FTAA.  As a result, all of us will prosper and 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us join, then, with the hemisphere's leaders in having 
confidence in ourselves and our region.  We now have the 
stability, the transparency and the economic growth record that 
will allow trade to increase and thrive.  The countries of the 
region are good economic partners for Canada and for each other. 
At the end of the day not only they but we too in Canada will 
benefit.  What does that mean?  It is good news for Canada as a 
country and good news for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get behind Canada.  Let us support Canada in this all 
important effort and let us do the right thing.  The right thing 
is to support the FTAA and to trade accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the parliamentary 
secretary two separate questions.  The first one is easy.  Will 
he pursue with his colleagues an aggressive removal of the double 
taxation that compromises the ability of our exporters to export 
our products internationally and impedes the ability of other 
countries to invest in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we want free trade as well as fair trade.  With the 
explosion of globalization we have had an explosion of 
international organized crime.  Half the crime in our country 
today is attributed to organized crime.  Will the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada ask his minister to 
work with the Minister of Foreign Affairs to take an aggressive 
approach, with other countries, and to start to take a leadership 
and international approach to deal with measures on organized 
crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half the crime in our country is rooted in organized crime. This 
is not only a domestic problem but an international problem, 
which deals not only with money laundering but with narcotics, 
endangered species and weapons.  We need to take a leadership 
role with our partners.  Will the hon. member take this to his 
minister so we can take a leadership role with other countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for those 
two questions.  First, on taxation, we as a trading nation have 
consistently put in place the mechanisms that allow us to trade 
in an effective and efficient manner and we will continue to do 
so.  After all, that is who we are as a country and what we are 
all about:  to trade and do it well.  We stand to benefit so much 
by it.  As a result of making sure that we have the kinds of 
vehicles in place to ensure that happens, we can do it and we can 
do it well.  We have shown that time and again by way of trade 
and we will continue to work effectively in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to organized crime, we have taken and will continue 
to take the kinds of measures necessary to ensure that we do the 
right thing in this area.  The member is right on in terms of it 
being a pervasive problem that goes to the very corruption that 
is often seen in a variety of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked with our American counterparts and we are working 
with others in this hemisphere and elsewhere around the world, 
for that matter, with Interpol and others, when it comes to 
putting in place the kinds of mechanisms and policing enhancement 
and requirements that underscore Canada's commitment to ensure 
that we do everything possibly we can with respect to ensuring 
that it comes to an end, at least as much as we can given the 
resources at hand and the partners we have.  That is a commitment 
the government has given and it is one that we continue to stand 
by.  I think it is important that we do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say while I have the chance that I am a little 
disappointed in the Alliance Party for having zero position on 
this FTAA position.  It is all very well for their members to get 
up and question members while they are speaking and such, but I 
looked through the party platform, for example.  Does the party 
have anything on FTAA?  Not a thing.  Zero.  It is a little hard 
to take in the sense that one would think that of all people in 
the House their members would have a consistent position when it 
comes to trading, business, capitalism, prosperity, economy and 
profit making. 
No, they just do not have it.  I was scrounging around trying to 
find it but it just does not exist.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to 
speak to the Bloc motion introduced by the member for Joliette, 
whom I thank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard about the draft motion asking “that this House 
demand that, in order to ensure openness, the government bring 
any draft agreement on the Free Trade Zone of the Americas before 
the House so that it may be debated and put to a vote before 
ratification by the Government of Canada”, a few images came to 
my mind which in my view should set the stage for our 
reflection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This free trade agreement will have a significant impact for 
decades. As the father of three children aged 17, 15 and 10, I 
wonder about the environment in which our children will be 
living. Finally, this agreement will define the framework for the 
new economic reality, free trade across the three Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time comes to decide on the framework within which this 
agreement will operate for several years to come, I want to 
ensure that the decision will be made by the elected 
representatives of the people, those who have the mandate not 
only to carry on trade, but also to see to the distribution of 
wealth in a continent-wide society, which is indeed quite 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second image that came to my mind when I read the draft 
motion was the member for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay when, three 
years ago, he walked out of the House carrying his seat on his 
head to bring it to his constituents. His action created quite an 
uproar; it did not go unnoticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, it was a strong, profound and important 
symbolic gesture aimed at condemning the way globalization is 
currently working, and the fact that elected representatives do 
not have enough of a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say that, a few months after the MAI negotiations, we had 
a narrow escape thanks to the action of the French prime 
minister, Mr. Jospin, that followed a more public action. The 
draft agreement had been posted on the Internet and people realized 
then that the agreement would have a significant impact on the 
sovereignty of states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not like us to realize 10, 15 or 20 years later that we 
had rubber stamped something that would put the people of the 
Americas at a disadvantage, or that we had agreed to it after the 
fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit surprised at the Liberal government's attitude today, 
because it is already Canada's practice to examine this sort of 
issue in advance.  The sort of examination that the Bloc 
Quebecois is seeking today was conducted before the FTA and NAFTA 
were signed.  It was done in the House.  Now, the Liberals seem 
to be opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true, however, that the two other agreements were not 
negotiated by the Liberals.  They inherited these agreements, 
and, once in power, were obliged to sing a different tune in 
order to implement them, since they were already signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, I am a bit surprised at the Liberal government's 
attitude. It is important that we be able to express our views 
before the agreement is ratified, and that we be able to hold a 
full debate.  A number of questions were raised here, and I would 
like to pick up on a few that strike me as important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, there was the whole issue of the working 
conditions of people within this free trade area.  Will that be

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the speech he gave in Vancouver on February 9, 2001, the 
Minister for International Trade said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a globalized, increasingly interdependent world, each 
country's well-being will depend upon the health and vitality of 
markets abroad. Those conditions are best achieved in an 
environment of good governance and in stable, prosperous and open 
societies— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about governance and stable societies. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—conditions fostered by freer trade. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the speech by the Minister for International Trade 
concerning Canada as a backer of the FTAA are there any concerns 
of a social or environmental nature.  These are the areas in 
which my constituents want to know the content of the agreement. 
Are there things that will affect us personally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile heeding past examples.  For instance, we have 
NAFTA with the United States, but were required to sign a 
separate agreement on lumber which forced four provinces to raise 
their royalty fees and their compensation payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are in a situation where everyone in Canada wishes we 
could return to free trade per se.  If we had negotiated a free 
trade agreement that did not give in so much to the Americans in 
this area, perhaps we would not have had to submit to this 
agreement on lumber.  That is one concrete example. This means 
that the FTAA agreement will have an impact down the line on 
Rivière-du-Loup, La Pocatière, and everywhere else in Quebec and 
Canada.  These are not sterile debates, but concrete things we 
are discussing, important matters that will make it possible, or 
impossible, for our families to have the proper social or 
economic conditions to develop their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What applies to our families applies also to those in other 
countries.  This type of agreement is not entered into merely to 
increase Canada's market capacity.  In my opinion, looking at it 
in this way does not augur well for sustainable development, a 
worthwhile and satisfactory future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have given the lumber example, but there are others.  We have 
just been through the business about Brazilian beef. How will 
quality control of food products work within the big market of 
all the Americas?  We need to know how the clauses have been 
negotiated in order to avoid sacrificing for market advantage the 
health of peoples in the various countries.  Care must be taken 
to ensure that there is control, that a certain level of quality 
is respected, as we have tried to do within our sovereign states. 
There must be sufficient protection for the aspects we will have 
in common.  Parliaments have a watchdog role to play in this, a 
role of representing the public.  That is what the Bloc Quebecois 
motion is drawing attention to today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked earlier about organized crime.  Indeed when trade is 
liberalized, it is clear that illegal things are permitted more 
easily because there are fewer bureaucratic constraints or basic 
ones like customs.  That does not mean there must not be a free 
trade area of the Americas, but it must happen under reasonable 
conditions regarding justice and the environment as well as 
working conditions and there must be sufficient protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the position of the Minister for International Trade 
rather paradoxical.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that increased trade is synonymous with more jobs for 
Canadians.  We will create a unique occasion to unify the 
hemisphere as never before. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to know what the Government of Canada thinks of 
the proposal of a common currency.  Would this be negotiated, not 
necessarily for inclusion in the agreement itself, but in order 
to see how it might be managed in the future?  It would transform 
economic relations between countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all entitled to ask these questions.  People want to know 
that these issues are being defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of this, I think the Bloc motion is very justified, 
because it will ensure that the position of Quebec and Canada in 
the negotiations will be that of the public as a whole and that 
we do not end up with something that was negotiated on the sly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might avoid a few blunders and the positions involving trade 
taken by a department such as international trade. It would be 
tempered by social and environmental considerations, which will 
mean that, in the end FTAA will permit the sustainable 
development of the three Americas, will not be a tool just to 
promote trade solely for the benefit of certain businesses but 
will benefit all of the people of the Americas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member 
asked a question about common currency.  I would simply recall 
for him the words said earlier today during question period, if I 
heard them correctly, by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, which 
were that this was not something that was of any interest to 
Canada now or in the foreseeable future.  I think the Prime 
Minister made similar statements not too long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the member has his own riding and indeed the 
province of Quebec where I suppose he is aiming message.  However 
I have to take him up on the issue and ask him a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply incorrect to say this deal is being negotiated in a 
back room.  There has never been a wider consultation with 
Canadians on a proposed trade deal.  The member knows full well 
that members of the Bloc had ample opportunity at SCFAIT, the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, to share 
their views, and they did so very aggressively and eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member deny that input was provided?  There have 
been wide and extensive consultations with people in Quebec, with 
NGOs and with ministers, including the minister of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not understand that the process proposed in the 
Bloc motion is in direct contravention to the way all other trade 
deals between Canada and any other country have been negotiated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process that the government would seek to follow, in 
bringing a signed deal to the House of Commons for full review 
and possible amendment and then voting on enabling legislation, 
is the exact process that has been followed for NAFTA, the WTO, 
the Canada-Chile agreement and the Canada-Israel agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on that?  Does he not see that it is 
the Bloc's motion, specifically the words “draft legislation” in 
the motion, that seeks to make a major change in the way Canada 
has done trade deals in the past? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am not impressed by 
the hon. member's answer on a common currency. A few years ago, 
his whole party was against free trade, and then it completely 
reversed its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just like the antimissile shield. A couple of weeks ago, 
when he met with the prime minister of Russia, the Prime 
Minister said that he was against that policy. When he met the 
American president, he was in favour. Now that he is in China, 
we do not know where he stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Liberal Party can change their minds 
quite fast. 
He will soon realize, concerning the common currency, the 
proposal put forward by the Bloc Quebecois a few months ago, 
that the American and Mexican presidents are now discussing it. 
Before long, the Prime Minister of Canada and the hon. member 
will have to apologize for what they are saying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the free trade agreement, the hon. member 
misunderstood my remarks. I never said it was negotiated behind 
closed doors. I said that the agreement that was negotiated did 
not include the right provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to take advantage of our past experience, we had better 
make sure the next agreement does not rely on the same type of 
relations with the Americans. Even if the United States is a 
major player, Canada and other sovereign countries must have a 
chance to be adequately involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, if Quebec had been a sovereign country, we would not 
have acted like we did. We would have seen to it that we played 
a role that reflected our reality, in particular on the softwood 
lumber issue. We would not have had to deal with what Canada 
eventually imposed on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the Bloc Quebecois is not seeking to blame the government 
for everything it has done in the past. We are only saying that 
our constituents, our fellow citizens, want to know what these 
agreements are all about.

by them from time to time. They do not want this to happen 
again. They expect members of parliament to do more than 
rubber-stamp the government's decisions. We should be able to 
exert some kind of influence to ensure that these agreements 
have human impact. We should act as responsible elected

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise today in the House and speak to the motion 
introduced by the member for Joliette.  This is a motion 
demanding that the government bring any draft agreement on the 
free trade area of the Americas before the House before 
ratification by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of years now, there has been much talk about 
integrating the American continent.  The free trade area of the 
Americas project is a very ambitious one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is to bring the various countries of the Americas 
together within one economic group and to implement a regional 
system based on the principles of rules of law, free trade and 
democracy, in order to raise the standard of living and improve 
working conditions so as to ensure sustainable development and 
respect for the various cultural entities.  The free trade area 
of the Americas comprises the 34 democratically elected 
governments on the continent, representing a market of 800 
million consumers, with a combined GDP of some $10 trillion U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new economic entity could, without a doubt, cause major 
social and economic upheaval in the societies involved in this 
bold plan.  But, despite the extreme importance of the 
undertaking, there is a breathtaking democratic oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again yesterday in the House, the member for Joliette asked the 
government to make public the basic texts of the free trade area 
of the Americas negotiations.  Even the institutions committee of 
the Quebec National Assembly, a non-partisan committee it should 
be pointed out, tabled a report in June 2000 entitled “Quebec 
and the Free Trade Area of the Americas:  Political and 
Socioeconomic Effects”.  Unanimously, the committee asked “That 
the final accord of the free trade area of the Americas be 
submitted to the elected bodies of Canada before being ratified 
by the federal government”.  The government, as it so often 
does, gave us a nonsensical answer.  But the question called for 
a very serious reply, because this is a very serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a responsible political party, the Bloc Quebecois demands 
total openness from the federal government in the negotiation of 
international agreements such as the free trade area of the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We democratically elected Canadian parliamentarians and 
representatives of the public, and civil society, have the 
fundamental right to know what is being negotiated on our behalf 
and on behalf of those who elected us and whom we represent here 
in the House of Commons. The participation of civil society in 
the planning and decision making processes is no longer merely 
something to be considered. It must be an integral component of 
world governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this government took office in 1993, the ratification 
process of international treaties and the democratic debates on 
the content of these treaties have been significantly shortened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to put an end to these undemocratic practices, the Bloc 
Quebecois tried to make the ratification process of international 
treaties by parliament more open and democratic by introducing, 
last spring, a bill to that effect, Bill C-214. Members can well 
imagine that the Liberals defeated this bill. Yet it 
provided—and this is only normal—that Canada could not 
negotiate or sign a treaty without first having consulted 
provincial governments, if that treaty dealt with a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, before being ratified, treaties would have had to be 
the object of a resolution in the House of Commons and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs would have had an obligation to 
submit all the documents necessary for an informed debate by 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that the Bloc Quebecois was asking, and is still asking, was 
for the Liberals to respect provincial jurisdictions, as 
stipulated under the constitution. This is a brief outline of the 
issue of openness, as perceived by my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is another issue in which I take a great interest 
concerning the negotiations on the free trade area that will take 
place at the summit of the Americas that will be held in Quebec 
City, from April 20 to 22. I am referring to anything that has to 
do with workers' rights. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make one thing very clear right from the beginning. The 
Bloc Quebecois demands that globalization and free trade be put 
in human terms. We want international treaties to include 
provisions to protect social rights and workers' rights, and 
direct reference to the obligation for nations to comply with the 
regulations contained in the ILO's seven basic labour 
conventions. These conventions have to be included in every 
commercial agreement that Canada signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what these conventions say. Conventions 29 and 105 deal 
with the abolition of forced labour. Conventions 86 and 98 deal 
with the union rights pertaining to collective bargaining and 
employee organization, including the right to elect union 
representatives without any interference from the employer or the 
government, and the right to strike. Conventions 100 and 111 
provide for equal pay for equal work and for the elimination of 
discrimination in the workplace. Convention 138 deals with the 
minimum age for admission to employment, or the abolition of 
child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we would propose to include the ILO's seven 
conventions on the fundamental rights of workers listed above in 
a continental agreement, thereby forcing employers and 
governments to comply with these conventions before they are 
allowed access to any benefits from the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today, on the issue of basic labour standards, there is 
still no link between international trade and the protection of 
the rights of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though these seven ILO conventions have to be honoured 
regardless of a country's level of development, few countries are 
actually willing to allow the use of trade sanctions to enforce 
these standards. Moreover, the ILO has no power to force 
countries to endorse or to apply these standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more troubling is the fact that we still do not know if the 
Canadian government is willing to make the necessary efforts to 
ensure that social rights are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, last June, when he appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
the Minister for International Trade stated that social rights 
had nothing to do with trade, adding that he could not do 
everyone else's job. Not only are these words troubling, but they 
are totally unacceptable and irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I simply want to remind the House that, for the 
Bloc Quebecois, there is a precondition attached to the 
ratification of any trade agreement Canada might sign, such as 
the one regarding the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such agreements must include provisions of a social nature 
referring directly to the obligation of the states to abide by 
the rules contained in the seven fundamental conventions of the 
ILO. It is simply a matter of basic human rights and we just 
cannot let it get away from us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of 
my colleague, who is the Bloc Quebecois labour critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, in this sector of activity, it is obvious that, in their 
original version, the free trade agreements that we have had in 
the past did not include a provision, a specification or a 
chapter that defined these conditions in an acceptable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke on an issue relating to fair trade, among other things, 
to ensure that, in our trade with other countries, the people 
with whom we do business will hire the employees, provide them 
with reasonable labour conditions and have them work in an 
acceptable environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to tell the House if, indeed, it would 
be important to have all the relevant information to be able, not 
only to judge the value of the free trade agreement, but also to 
know the labour conditions of the people and the kind of 
protection they will have, since there are in the three Americas 
some economies that are at very different stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. I believe that, on the issue of labour and of children 
working in some countries where development is in full progress 
and where some children are being abused, a North American 
agreement should not allow this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we can move towards a level playing field and bring 
fairness for all workers. Children should go to school. They 
should not have to provide for their family. I understand that 
we are not all at the same level. I understand full well that 
adjustments will have to be made. We are not kidding ourselves. 
However, we all have to go in the same direction. I believe it 
is the most important thing. It is the basis for creating a 
North American economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have other concerns. We already talked about water 
exports. I used to be critic for the environment and, as such, 
this issue is of great concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government were to sign some kind of agreement 
with the rest of North America, suddenly agreeing to exporting 
bulk water, how would the provinces respond? Water belongs to 
the provinces, it belongs to provincial governments. How will 
such an agreement be ratified? Will the provinces have their say 
in the matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these factors must be taken into account. Also, we have to 
listen to our NGOs, our non-governmental organizations. They have 
to have their say in these negotiations. These negotiations are 
not only about economic issues. Sure it is important to trade 
internationally, and we cannot deny this is the way we are 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also sincerely believe that we are going toward a common 
currency. There are examples of this across the world. All we 
have to do is take note and look at how it is being done 
elsewhere and improve on it at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it should happen at any cost. I believe it must 
be done while hanging on to our main social policies, by 
improving further our quality of life so that everyone in this 
world, our children, ourselves, and the elderly, can have a 
better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not let trade destroy the quality of life it took us 
years to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us reach agreements in harmony with the provinces. They 
should not be forgotten. They are there, they have laws and they 
have things to protect. Things must be done in harmony, by 
consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that within a few years, if the federal 
government is open-minded enough to bring in all those who have 
something to say and who have a stake in all this, we might be 
an example for the world by reaching a North American agreement.

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate 
of course.  I will begin by saying that I applaud the Bloc 
Quebecois for bringing forth a motion like this in the sense that 
it is certainly a motion very worthy of debate.  Too often 
opposition motions are merely designed to try to discredit the 
government or to gain cheap political points, but in this case 
this genuinely is a motion that deserves the kind of debate it 
has been getting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say it is hard to mix one's own work and to try to 
follow a debate like this because each member who has spoken has 
had much to contribute and unfortunately I have not been able to 
follow every speech.  I will say, however, that when it comes to 
deciding how I will vote on this issue I will, before I finally 
cast my ballot, look at the full <I>Hansard</I> and consider every 
argument that was put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface, however, from where I sit now, from what I have 
heard and from what I have read of this particular issue, I find 
myself half supporting the motion rather than supporting it 
fully.  I certainly do believe that there is a great deal to be 
said in having a debate on this kind of subject before a treaty 
is finally ratified.  Where I have difficulty is the part of the 
motion that says, and I should read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House demand that the government bring any draft 
agreement on the Free Trade Zone of the Americas before the House 
so that it may be debated and put to a vote before ratification— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the government has a majority in this House 
and if this were put to this House after debate for ratification, 
what would happen is that the government would simply use its 
majority and it would go through. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense it is a waste of the House's time, although I use 
that term very advisedly because in fact no debate in this House 
is a waste of the House's time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better way, it seems to me, to approach this is to do what 
happened just a few nights ago and have an emergency debate.  We 
had, I guess, six hours of debate on the farm crisis the other 
night, and this was initiated in fact by the opposition I do 
believe.  Well, both sides, actually.  From the backbenches in 
one sense.  That was an excellent debate.  It touched on many, 
many aspects of the farm crisis and I think people watching 
probably gained much from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole question of a free trade zone for the Americas, which 
is coming up as a topic of conversation or a topic of 
negotiation, I should say, at the summit of the Americas in 
Quebec City in April, is an issue that has broad ramifications 
for the country.  I would suggest that it goes even further than 
that.  It has international ramifications and I think a debate 
would be very much in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to give you a little bit of history, Mr. Speaker, the 
summit that is coming up in April is part of a progress of 
summits that actually goes back to 1956.  There was the first 
summit involving the Organization of American States.  That was 
followed by a larger summit in 1967 which was initiated, I 
believe, if memory serves me right, by President Kennedy. That 
led to an attempt to bring Latin America under a free trade zone 
to the exclusion of the United States and the exclusion of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not work out in the long run, but the idea remained. 
The idea just sort of went into limbo for a long time.  It was 
restarted by President Clinton in 1994 primarily because the 
world had changed dramatically.  What had happened, the Soviet 
Union had collapsed; the east-west confrontation had ended; and 
the world suddenly became a patchwork of states, each trying to 
gain political advantage and, even more important, economic 
advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, Mr. Speaker, you saw this progress starting in the very 
early nineties toward a World Trade Organization, toward global 
free trade in the broadest sense.  We have gone very far in that 
direction, far in that direction in the sense that global free 
trade now involves countries that can trade with Canada, and the 
United States for that matter, and trade to their advantage and 
to our advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in passing, I believe I am splitting my time with someone. 
I believe it is the secretary of state for international 
development.  I certainly am sure that she will be listening to 
what I have to say and building on it when her turn comes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, to carry on with the story, and I had better carry on 
fairly rapidly, the summit arises out of global free trade, the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and initiative by President Clinton. 
Initial talks were held in Miami in 1994 and one of the things 
that came out of those talks was the concept of a free trade zone 
of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, Mr. Speaker, these talks are not just about economics. 
I think as a result of the change in geo-politics, if you will, 
and geo-economics, it was recognized that it was in the 
Americans' interest, in the interest of the United States, to 
form closer alliances politically, economically and even 
militarily, and all of these issues are on the table when we come 
to a summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the other aspect to the Bloc's motion that interested me was 
this concept of a North American free trade zone because I think 
something more is going on there than what has been the subject 
of the debates even in the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get the sense that what is happening here is that the 
Americans are perceiving a need to build a kind of firewall 
around the rest of the world: put this wall around North and 
South America in a sense to look after the possibility that 
someday they may have to shut out some of the rest of the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual colleagues made observations about human rights.  I 
remember the member for Medicine Hat was commenting on the 
contradiction that we have when a country like Canada or the 
United States supports a third world country, only to deny access 
to their goods and put tariffs on their goods because of human 
rights problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take the example of some countries in the far east that 
have now just about entirely taken over the manufacture of 
textiles, or rugs for that matter, where these goods are 
manufactured in labour conditions that would be unacceptable in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We face a dilemma there because if we shut off those goods, and 
I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, the shirt that I am wearing 
right now was probably manufactured at very, very low cost in a 
third world country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my impression that the United States and Canada perceive 
that we cannot carry on global free trade indefinitely under such 
circumstances when we are indeed encouraging even child labour in 
these third world countries, which want to do it because they 
want to sell the product here, but we get into this terrible 
contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the answer would appear to be something like a global free 
trade zone where standards can be set for human rights for the 
way labour is utilized to produce product, and at the same time 
preserve a market that will be sufficiently large for the United 
States to benefit primarily and the rest of us to benefit 
secondarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term I have a great deal of sympathy for those 
protesters that appeared at Seattle and some of these other 
summits because I think we have to be very careful when we look 
at global free trade, or even the free trade of the Americas, 
that what we may be doing is creating dependencies that may put 
off a crisis among human beings, a crisis in terms of being able 
to produce product and feed ourselves that we may have to face in 
the years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my hon. friend from the 
other side a simple question that relates to a comment made by 
the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor general.  He said 
that the government had done everything in its power to pursue 
free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that is fantasy and not fact.  The government has 
pursued free trade on the one hand but has tied the hands of our 
exporters and companies by keeping very high taxes.  That creates 
an uneven playing field for exporters.  It has also imposed, and 
continues to fail to act to remove, the interprovincial barriers 
to trade that compromise our exporters and companies from 
competing on a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simply this.  Will the member ask his ministers 
to pursue, with the same zeal that they do internationally, the 
removal of interprovincial barriers to trade and the reduction of 
taxes in the country that choke off the ability of our private 
sector to compete? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, well oddly enough sometimes 
it is harder for the federal government to negotiate with the 
provinces than it is with other states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we want to get as free an exchange of skills and 
products as we can in this country.  However, it is a two way 
street on that.  Sometimes it is very difficult to get the 
agreements that we would like from the provinces.  I suggest that 
the province of Quebec is a perfect example, when there were 
barriers to the free exchange of skilled labour and jobs and 
employment across the border that is merely the Ottawa River. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
remind my colleague of the approach suggested by the hon. member 
for Laurentides. We are not asking for sanctions or standards. We 
want these agreements to uphold fundamental rights while 
respecting the culture and the heritage of each of the nations 
concerned. We favour a collaborative approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, although child labour is unacceptable, it cannot 
be eliminated overnight. As one of the wealthier countries in the 
world, we have a duty to help the poorer countries to solve their 
problems within a deadline. What we need to do so is a strong 
political will that the government seems unable to express except 
in its empty rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks like the government is ignoring what everyone in 
Canada, in Quebec and in most parts of the western world is 
decrying. There are some democratic shortcomings to this free 
trade area of the Americas proposal but also to globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more and more talk of executive democracy.  It will no 
longer be parliaments that make decisions but executives.  What 
is being proposed to us with rejection of the Bloc Quebecois 
motion is to sanction or institutionalize the fact that 
democracy is now being exercised through the executives around 
the PMO, with parliament no longer having a role to play.  I do 
not accept that view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that by rejecting the motion, the government is going to 
send the signal that our concerns, needs and demands are no 
longer to be channelled through parliamentarians, and that we 
now have to find the means of being heard out in the street. 
This is irresponsible, in my opinion.  Thus, passing our motion 
is a gesture of responsibility, one that adds value to the role 
of parliamentarians and one that I would call the democratic way 
of resolving problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member admit that democracy is getting short 
shrift in the creation of the free trade area of the Americas? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say that if that was 
a question or comment I look forward with eager anticipation for 
the speech that is to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the member opposite listened to me very carefully 
because I did assure him that the whole question of child labour 
is something that should be debated, and that there should be a 
debate in the House on the question of a free trade zone.  There 
is no doubt in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the member has simply ignored the fact that if we put it to 
a vote, the government would simply pass it because it would use 
its majority.  We can have the debate and we should have the 
debate, but it does not have to be through legislation.  It can 
be done through a simple resolution of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if the member's questions are that long, we could 
have a 12 hour or a 15 hour debate in which he could speak for 40 
minutes and he could get all these things onto the record. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, these trade talks open a political space. 
They deal with a host of issues we need to pay attention to.  One 
is the economic issue, but we also are discussing social issues 
plus governance and human rights.  These are very important things 
that must be discussed at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is therefore working to place development at the centre 
of the Quebec City summit declaration.  Canada's goal is an 
agenda that balances economic and social issues.  Social and 
economic issues are one and the same.  They go together.  That 
helps poor countries in Latin America harness and manage 
globalization to reduce their poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Healthy people make globalization work for them.  Educated 
people make globalization work for them.  Effective governments 
that respect human rights make globalization work for their 
citizens as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Efficient markets create prosperity, but we must remember that 
prosperity must be shared and equitable.  It must be shared by 
all sectors of society, otherwise it is not efficient or good for 
prosperity and the markets will not work efficiently for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember when we talk about trade that at the 
summit the Government of Canada will also be talking about 
democracy, good governance, human rights, social issues and an 
equitable sharing of prosperity.  Those are very important issues. 
They are issues Canada has put on the table, and they will be the 
themes discussed at the summit of the Americas, which we are 
proud to host. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, through my department, is committed to 
working with Central and South America.  Our goal is a 
prosperous, stable hemisphere characterized by healthy and 
educated citizens:  in sum, Mr. Speaker, a better world for all of 
the Americas, north and south.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that our whole hemisphere, which is one of the 
hemispheres with the biggest disparity between rich and poor, is 
in fact assisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that trade is important and that is one of 
the themes.  However, Canada has been extremely strong at the 
summits to make sure that we include social issues, human rights, 
governance and democracy as part of the themes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I did when I travelled in the Americas.  That was 
my discussion with my counterparts and ministers of other 
governments to ensure that these themes are strong and that they 
are an integral part of the discussion at the summit of the 
Americas.  The outcome is people based and focuses on the benefit 
of human development. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the minister and her plan 
for development of the Latin American part of the summit of the 
free trade zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we have any problems with what she said.  We 
understand the goals she is talking about.  We understand Canada 
extending a helping hand for good governance, for democracy and 
for all those issues that will have a major impact on Latin 
America and which will help it come into free trade with America. 
We must see that they are also prosperous.  We cannot live alone 
on an island of prosperity.  We agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why can parliamentarians not debate and ratify 
international agreements that the government signs.  The FTAA is 
one of the examples which can be done over here.  Our main point 
is that we want the ability, as elected representatives, to have 
those agreements come here so we can discuss them.  We may be 
sharing the same goals which she outlined.  However, at least 
parliamentarians and everybody would have an open forum, not just 
this website that they keep talking about.  Her comments on that 
one would be appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the Minister for 
International Trade has said many times, Canada's position is 
public.  I know my colleague has asked the other participants to 
agree to make their positions public as well in order that not 
only all Canadians but the members of all of those countries can 
participate in the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is broad and must be discussed by society at large. 
Our position has been made public and the minister has made that 
clear.  Certainly our colleagues in parliament can discuss 
Canada's position.  We are discussing it with NGOs, civil society 
and with any Canadian citizen who wants to participate.  It is 
not a secret.  It is not being kept in abeyance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has made Canada's position public and in fact has 
asked other countries to also agree to make their positions 
public.  Nothing is being hidden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be proud of the fact that not only is Canada hosting 
the summit of the Americas, which is a north-south dialogue, but 
at the same time we are leading the way and insisting on putting 
on the agenda issues which are fundamental to the equilibrium and 
balance of our hemisphere with respect to social infrastructure, 
democracy and human rights and to make sure that we have a stable 
hemisphere, in terms of economic, social and democratic issues. 
There is no hidden agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we hear some 
rather surprising things here.  This is a democratic parliament, 
and the minister has just told us that everything is public and 
we can discuss it here, no problem.  We are also told to go and 
look on the Internet for our answers.  Why are we elected and who 
do we represent, we might ask.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker said “There is no point having a debate 
here, because we form a majority, in any case, and it will 
pass”.  I would like you or someone to enlighten me.  They say 
democracy wears out if it is not used.  If we lose it one day, we 
will be sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still live in a democratic country, I hope.  We call for a 
debate on a fundamental project that will affect the future, one 
my grandchildren will live with.  We ask to debate it.  We are 
not being arrogant.  We are saying “It should be debated”.  We 
get “We do not have the time” on one side.  And we get “We 
form a majority, so it will pass anyway” on another. The 
minister says “Everything is open, we can debate it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should we proceed in order to get satisfaction, I ask her? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously there is a 
debate today but there are also the standing committees.  It does 
not minimize the members.  There is a set membership of the 
committees but members of the House are ex-officio and can 
participate at committee.  They can also make a representation as 
a witnesses, if they wish.  The committee process is open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be debates and discussions at the committee level. 
That is where intensive discussion does take place.  That is part 
of the parliamentary system.  There is nothing hidden here at all 
and that is why they are elected.  The fact is members may wish 
to appear as witnesses and I am sure all members will want to do 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have two questions for the 
minister.  First, 400,000 Canadians every year travel to Cuba, 
yet Cuba has not been invited to the summit of the Americas.  In 
the post-Castro era which will come in the not too distant 
future, the exclusion of Cuba from a free trade agreement with 
the Americas will only contribute to the continued poverty that 
exists in that country.  Why has Cuba been excluded from the 
summit in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, will the minister present to her counterparts in cabinet 
that all free trade agreements and international treaties be put 
in front of the relevant standing committee before they are 
ratified by the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said, Canada's 
position in the free trade discussions has been made public.  The 
committee will have hearings.  The committee will be discussing 
Canada's position.  All members of the House are free to 
participate, both as witnesses or as participants around the 
table to intervene and ask questions of the witnesses.  This is 
the parliamentary system.  We have a committee process especially 
for that reason, so we can get into issues in a more in-depth 
sort of way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that the Minister for International Trade has made 
Canada's position public, which is why it is being discussed 
widely, not only in the standing committee and in the House, but 
also across the country.  At the same time he has asked his 
counterparts to agree to make all of their positions public as 
well.  That has not happened yet and may not happen.  However, 
with respect that is not something we have control over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we as Canadians ensure that we protect the 
kinds of issues that we care about.  This is why it is happening 
at committee, in the House and in the public forum as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I ask the minister a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madame Minister, I do not understand what you just said.  I 
listened to the interpretation, I listened to what you said in 
English, but I think that what you are telling us now is that 
there will be committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the government says “No, we cannot say what our 
positions are because that is a secret and must remain so, 
because our partners do not want us to put that on the table”. 
On the other hand, you tell us to look on the site— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I simply wish to remind the

I would like to put a question to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She continually contradicted herself in everything she said in 
response to both speakers. I believe she is not aware of what is 
happening currently with respect to the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members keep on referring to the Internet site, but 
we know what is on an Internet site. All of a sudden, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade 
tells us we cannot talk about this because our partners do not 
want us to talk about it. Then the other one tells us 
parliamentary committees will review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were elected. We represent the people and we want to be part 
of something that will have an impact on the life and the future 
of our children and grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister how we, who are parliamentarians just as she 
is, should go about it? She was democratically elected, just as 
we were, so that our voices and those of the people we represent 
could be heard. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna:</B>  Mr. Speaker, even before the last 
election the committee met and discussed publicly Canada's 
position.  It is being discussed publicly across the line. Anyone 
who wishes to participate can.  The information is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, parliamentarians from the hemisphere will be in 
this very room the week in March when the House is not sitting to 
debate exactly that.  What better opportunity to discuss not only 
among ourselves, but with other parliamentarians in the 
hemisphere, the issue that we are debating today.  It seems to me 
there is a great deal of opportunity to get into the details and 
to share the issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague for 
Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start on the topic today, I would like to thank the 
people who put on the flag ceremony in Lethbridge today at the 
legion.  I was supposed to be there but I was unable to attend. 
I want to acknowledge the fact that they did that.  They do it 
every year and I really appreciate them that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the other day some of the members in the House had the 
opportunity to be briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade.  I want to thank the parliamentary 
secretary, the member for London—Fanshawe and the staff for the 
tremendous job they did.  We have already used some of the things 
we learned and we will certainly take up their offer to come back 
anytime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the Bloc motion today to have the House, 
this elected body, ratify agreements, particularly dealing with 
the FTAA conference which is coming up in March.  That is 
something we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that these agreements should come here to be ratified. 
It is done elsewhere in the world.   I cannot quite understand 
the government's hesitancy to not do that.  Certainly there is a 
lot of information available.  We know that.  However, when going 
into negotiations on an agreement, not only should our position 
be known, but what we agree to in those negotiations should be 
available for Canadians to peruse before it is put into effect. 
Therefore, we will be supporting the motion that the Bloc has put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the government has signed 470 different treaties and 
ratified 295 of them.  This is something that goes on at a pretty 
aggressive rate.  All kinds of treaties are signed to deal with 
all aspects of our lives and our society.  It is important that 
we be aware of what the government is working on, what it is 
dealing in and the positions that it is taking when it goes 
through these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now it only needs the approval and the construction by 
bureaucrats and the approval of cabinet.  We feel Canadians 
should have a last look at what has been agreed to and what the 
final position is because what we go in with is not always what 
we come back out with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been instances in the past where I would have liked 
to have known what went on at the WTO meetings and the GATT 
meetings on agriculture.  I would liked to have known who was 
traded off against whom and what the position of the government 
was going into the meeting as to who was dispensable and who was 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sugar beet growers in my area are the only group of 
producers in Canada left that grow sugar in Canada and their 
future looks a little dim.  There has been a concern for years 
about some of the things that happened at some of those 
negotiations and how they might have been traded off against 
other sectors of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leaves a little bit too much power, we feel, in the hands 
of a few and takes it away from the people of Canada through the 
representation that they have given us in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NGOs, witnesses and people who the government brings 
together to put these positions and to do the negotiating are 
certainly experts in their field.  We do not disagree with that. 
It brings together the people who have the knowledge in their 
respective areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, who selects them?  Is there a public process to 
make sure that the people who are selected are the people we want 
representing us as a country?  It is important to bring back to 
the House what has been negotiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any trade has to be rules based and fair.  We feel that in the 
agricultural community this has not always been the case.  The 
situation in which we find the grain and oilseed primary 
producers in agriculture is deplorable.  It has to do with unfair 
subsidies in both the United States and the European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to have some support for our farmers, such as the Crow 
rate and others.  When the deal was struck that we would get rid 
of this subsidy and these supports, as the other countries did, 
Canada went ahead and cut the support to our primary producers 
putting them in the situation they are in now.  We did that but 
the other countries did not follow suit.  In some cases, 
particularly in Europe, there have been instances where they have 
increased the support while we have decreased it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put our primary producers in a spot that is almost 
unbearable.  Farms are going under on a daily basis.  It is due 
to the agreement that was struck and what the government did to a 
particular sector.  Those types of agreements could have been 
brought back here.  I am sure the agreement that the government 
took into those negotiations was not the one it came out with. 
What it agreed to should have come to the House for all of us to 
look at, and certainly for the people who it was going to affect, 
which were the primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government indicated that it was something it could not do. 
It could not bring an agreement back to the House.  However, it 
is done in the United States.  Treaties have to be ratified by a 
two-thirds majority of the elected upper house.  That is fair. 
It gives everybody another chance to look at what is going on. 
It gives the Americans who are affected a chance for more input. 
That is what we would like as a country and for the citizens in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was given some information concerning France.  It states: 
“Peace treaties, trade treaties, treaties of agreements 
concerning an international organization, those involving state 
finances, those amending rules of a legislative nature, those 
concerning individual states and those calling for the transfer, 
exchange or annexation of territory, may be ratified or approved 
only by an act of parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is being done elsewhere so to say that it cannot be done here 
does not quite cut it.  We have some suggestions that we would 
like to offer the government on ways it could improve the 
process.  Consultation in this elected Chamber would be one way 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first things I mentioned was parliamentary 
ratification.  It is a simple process.  It should be brought to 
the House after it has been negotiated.  We could then look at it 
and either agree with it or offer some changes or amendments to 
make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also suggest a requirement for an assessment.  This is what 
we have agreed to do on these trade issues but let us look at the 
impact that that will have on Canadians in general.  Let us look 
at the impact it will have on industry.  Let us look at what it 
will do to families.  Let us look at what it will do to services. 
Let us look at how it will affect other parts.  Have we asked the 
provinces how it will affect their situations?  Including the 
provinces would strengthen the whole idea of federalism.  We have 
talked about the alienation of parts of Canada.  This would give 
the provinces and different regions a feeling that they are a 
bigger part of some of the decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should ensure that the people who put us in this elected 
Chamber are aware of what is going and that they have an 
opportunity to look at what these treaties will do and how they 
will affect their lives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last aspect is that it would increase the accountability of 
government.  Knowing that anything that is agreed to would have 
to come back to the House to be ratified, it would put a new 
focus on what is being agreed to and what is being done.  It 
would give a bit more accountability to the whole process.  It 
would add some credibility to what has been negotiated.  It would 
add some confidence to what is being done.  It would allow 
Canadians one last chance to look at something that could affect 
their lives.

International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take this 
opportunity to congratulate my colleague on his appointment as 
trade critic.  In reference to the briefing the other day, I 
appreciate those remarks and I look forward to working with him 
and the other critics in the spirit of co-operation to advance 
the agenda of trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague cited the United States and France and how things 
were done differently in those two countries.  I remind him that 
both of those countries are republics and that Canada is not.  We 
have a parliamentary system.  The government negotiates trade 
agreements to promote Canadian trade interests.  It signs those 
agreements only when it is convinced that those agreements are in 
the best interest of the country.  Parliament is then asked to 
review the agreement and debate the implementing legislation. 
Amendments are possible at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  Does he not see the Bloc 
motion for what it is?  It is a radical departure from a process 
that has been followed by governments of different political 
stripes in every trade agreement we have had, a process that has 
served the country very well.  It is more of a radical departure 
than perhaps how my colleague sees it.  What would be his 
reaction to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
the question.  He says that the government only agrees to 
agreements that are good for the country.  I remind the 
parliamentary secretary about the Kyoto agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through that scenario in the House a couple of years 
ago.  We asked the government day after day through question 
period what its stance would be when it got to Japan, what it 
would have on the table and how it would affect Canadians.  We 
asked that question almost everyday for months and we never did 
get an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government went to the meeting to establish guidelines 
that would affect absolutely all Canadians and how they lived 
their lives and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the amount 
agreed to, it did not know the position of Canadians. It agreed 
while it was there and came back with the agreement. It told 
Canadians what it had agreed to.  It did not have any idea how it 
would get there, but it was to start a process of consultation 
with the round tables to decide how it would be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the parliamentary secretary when he says that 
the government only agrees to things that will benefit Canada, 
when it goes to a negotiation and does not know what its position 
is and does not have the degree of effort it will take from 
Canadians to reach those goals.  I use that as one instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is something that we have been working on in 
western Canada for a year and a half.  Our cattle producers were 
challenged by a group in the United States called R-Calf. Our 
live cattle going south across the border were being unfairly 
subsidized.  There was a long process.  A tariff was placed 
against our cattle.  Bonds had to be placed at the border and a 
tariff had to be paid on every head of cattle that went across 
the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole process ended up costing the industry $5 million.  In 
the end it was found that we were not subsidizing our cattle. The 
tariff was taken off and the money was refunded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agitations go on.  North Dakotans are constantly 
challenging and looking at the wheat board.  There are agitations 
and irritants within the agreements that we presently have. There 
is a process in place that we can go through, as countries, for 
grievances and challenges to get them worked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the agreements that have been struck have really hurt 
different sectors of our country, such as the grain and oilseed 
sector which had its support reduced here when it was not backed 
up by the same kind of reduced support elsewhere.  I do not know 
if what we have done is reparable.  It will take a lot of effort. 
We keep asking the government when that help and those funds will 
come through but we have heard nothing yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the process, I believe I just gave a couple 
of instances where the process did not worked.  If the government 
had agreed to an agreement and had brought it back to the House 
to be fully debated, perhaps some amendments and changes could 
have been put forward that would have helped.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
member not find something slightly paradoxical in the fact that 
one of the three themes for the upcoming summit of the Americas 
is the strengthening of democracy, when the government refuses 
to bet on democracy with regard to the free trade area of the 
Americas negotiations? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of that 
detail but parliamentary reform is something that we have talked 
an awful lot about since the last election.  We are also trying 
to get more democracy in the House and in our committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary mentioned that the United States and 
France are republics but democratically elected people should be 
responsible to the people who elect them.  I believe a process of 
consultation and open review is the way we should be doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Calgary East to speak on today's motion, which would require the 
government to subject any project or accord on a free trade 
agreement with the Americas to a debate and vote before it is 
ratified by the government.  It is a very simple question and a 
very simple motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the government's position all day and 
what I have heard is an attempt by the government to bring in the 
ministers and other players to tell us what is happening with 
free trade in the Americas and how good free trade will be in the 
Americas.  It has been attempting to point out the issues that it 
is trying to bring to the table of free trade with the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite interesting that the government is telling us all 
these things now that the Bloc has brought forward this motion. 
If the Bloc had not brought forward the motion, in all 
probability we would not have known all these details that are 
now coming out point by point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said, and the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary have kept repeating it, that it has a website, that it 
is an open consultation process and that everyone is invited to 
come to the committees and talk.   That is not the question.  It 
is a matter of principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that in the last parliament the foreign affairs 
committee did a study on FTAA.  I was part of that committee and 
we listened.  However, I have to say that the study was done 
prior to going into consultation.  I thought it was a good idea. 
We, the official opposition, put in a minority report on that 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minority report that we submitted asked exactly for the same 
thing that is being asked for by the Bloc.  We recommended that 
treaties be brought into parliament to be ratified by elected 
officials.  If the government looks up the Canadian Alliance's 
minority report it will see that is exactly what we were 
recommending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could go ahead and do the consultation.  When 
negotiations are done and a final draft is available, the draft 
should be brought to the elected officials who could discuss the 
issues in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all probability, most of us, who believe in free trade, in 
human rights and in democracy, would probably agree with the 
government's position.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there could be some areas in which it needs attention. 
We could hear from our own constituents, but where and how will 
our constituents talk?  They can only talk through elected 
representatives.  That is what we have been telling them.  We 
have been telling them for years and years that we are their 
elected representatives, that we are their voice in Ottawa, their 
voice in government affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now what is happening?  The minister and everyone said that we 
go through the committees.  We have sat in committees.  This is 
my second term.  I have sat in committees and committees are not 
the voice of debate.  Committees will hear witnesses, but they 
are not a point of debate.  Debate should be done by members of 
parliament in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example:  NAFTA.  The NAFTA agreement was done by 
the bureaucrats, by the mandarins behind the scenes, was brought 
in and of course it was signed.  One area that turned out to be 
of concern after NAFTA was signed was the issue of bulk water 
exports.  That became an issue when Canadians got concerned about 
the bulk water export issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party said in one of its red book promises that it 
would open up the negotiations on NAFTA so it could exclude 
water.  Of course NAFTA had already been signed and of course 
could not be opened up.  The Liberals have not opened it up so 
far, and so far we still have this problem of water.  That is why 
the government has been running to the provincial governments 
asking them not to give licences for the sale of water.  The 
government knows what will happen under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of principle it is necessary to bring treaties that 
affect the lives of Canadians into the Chamber that is supposed 
to be their voice.  We cannot exclude that.  This business of 
saying that there are committees and websites and all these 
things is all a minor attempt to open up things.  At the end of 
the day, it is important for elected officials, not only for 
NGOs.  NGOs are accountable to nobody.  They have their own 
agendas, and sure, they will write their own agendas.  It is the 
elected officials who are responsible to their constituents, and 
constituents should be having their voices heard over there, not 
just a couple of those other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a good example.  When my colleague was talking about 
France and the U.S.A., the parliamentary secretary said that 
model should not apply to Canada because the U.S.A. and France 
are republics. I want to tell him that in Australia, which is a 
federation like Canada, the Australian parliament changed its 
system to ensure that treaties over there would be debated. 
Treaties would come into parliament and would have the approval 
of provincial legislatures before they would come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have found out is that the federal government signs all 
these international treaties that fall under the jurisdiction of 
the provinces and then forces the provinces to do something in 
which they are not interested.  The Kyoto protocol is an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day the Australians said that was not the way 
a pure democracy should be working, so they changed it and now 
their parliament and their provinces have input into 
international treaties before they are ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem in Canada?  We have heard from the 
parliamentary secretary, who said that this is how we have been 
doing business in the past year, that this is how we have been 
signing treaties and so on.  Fine.  That is how they have been 
doing it in the past.  Now Canadians are demanding 
accountability.  Canadians are asking for change.  They are 
asking that their voices be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary reform that everybody is talking about is 
another example of where Canadians want change, so I do not 
understand why the government is afraid to bring it forward for 
debate.  Why do they not want to change so that Canadians' 
elected representatives can talk about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the treaty is good, which I think it will be at the end of 
the day, nobody will oppose it.  We may have somebody opposing 
it, but if it is good for the country, why should we oppose it? 
We believe in free trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day my appeal to the government is this.  Yes, 
we do have certain systems like committees and all these things, 
but they are not sufficient to bring transparency to 
international agreements.  The FTAA agreement in the motion is 
just one example.  As a principle, treaties and agreements should 
be coming in front of parliament to be ratified by elected 
officials. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
remain here and not comment on three items that came up this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Canadian Alliance Party talked once again about 
reforms of agricultural subsidies.  This is so inconsistent with 
its general platform.  The Alliance went through the election 
talking about the elimination of subsidies, especially regional 
development subsidies that would help my constituency.  I wish 
Alliance members would be consistent.  If they are going to push 
for one type of subsidy, I ask them to not eliminate the ones 
that will help my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to commend the Alliance member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for talking about the benefits to the 
poor of free trade, in response to a Bloc intervention.  That 
allows us to remind people that free trade agreements often allow 
for the reduction of tariffs and, therefore, lower priced 
products for poor people in many nations.  That will help the 
poor.  It has a second effect on the poor, of course, in that the 
less developed nations can then export their products with more 
ease and have more jobs for their people, who may not have an 
income otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the third and last point I want to make is in regard to 
another intervention by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca. 
He said that the government was putting the exporters at a 
terrible disadvantage and suggested a whole major revamping of 
the tax system, which was really not appropriate here.  I will 
tell you, however, that is not what would put our exporters at a 
disadvantage.  What would put our exporters at a disadvantage is 
following the advice of the Leader of the Opposition who, in his 
response to the throne speech, talked of eliminating the export 
programs that have made Canada second to none in this world at 
export efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
bringing forward his three points.  The first point was on 
subsidies.  We know what a distortion of the market has taken 
place in the agricultural sector because of subsidies by the 
European Union as well as the U.S.A.  They have created an 
unlevel playing field, which is why we need to discuss this with 
them.  At the end of the day, the Canadian Alliance feels it is 
not the responsible use of tax dollars.  We would like to see 
that going away, but we would like to see it taking place in 
negotiations to get rid of the subsidies so that there is a level 
playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the rules based system of trade, which is the 
government's position.  I agree with that.  We have said we agree 
with the rules based system.  A rules based system will help 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the tax issues my colleague talked 
about.  That is about competitiveness.  If the member would read 
what the business leaders in Canada are saying, he would see they 
are saying that high taxes are a disadvantage to competitiveness 
for Canada, a disadvantage to taking advantage of globalization 
or of all the free trade of the Americas.  That is absolutely not 
a contradiction.  That is coming out loud and clear.  All the 
member has to do is listen to the business people.  The Canadian 
Alliance policy on that is quite distinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said the Leader of the Opposition was talking 
about export subsidies. 
Export subsidies distort the market.  That is why we have the 
ongoing war with Brazil.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about a rules based system, and all of a sudden that is 
thrown away by Captain Canada when he comes along and gives a 
subsidy to Bombardier, a company that is doing extremely well. It 
is consistent with what I have heard.  The government has been 
talking about a rules based system.  It is quite surprising what 
the industry minister said, which is not what I have been hearing 
for many years from the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the speech my colleague just gave.  I have a 
fairly straightforward question.  Sometimes in negotiations it is 
good to be able to go in without having laid all the cards on the 
table.  Therefore for us to debate and come to a conclusion on 
our opening position in some of these negotiations could put 
Canada at a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member see the necessity of parliament debating in 
broad generalities the position going in or actually getting 
specific? Does he advocate that parliament should ratify the 
final agreement after it has been negotiated by the various 
officials who do the negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
asking that question.  That is the essence of the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard representations and had consultations on 
what would be our position going into this agreement, which is 
fine.  That is the way it should be.  We should open it up to 
Canadians before talking about it at committee level.  We should 
take the views of Canadians and use them as a position, not leave 
it to the bureaucrats or mandarins of the department.  After 
having done that, what would be the final outcome?  We do not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The draft agreement is not the final outcome.  That has not been 
signed.  That is what we are talking about today and that is what 
my colleague is worried about.  It is the final version that 
requires approval by parliament before the Government of Canada 
signs it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, does my colleague 
not understand that what he is calling for is unprecedented in 
Canada?  That practice that has never been followed with any 
major trade agreement in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not understand that there will be full opportunity to 
debate and review the agreement in the House of Commons?  We are 
open to constructive criticisms on the deal, and amendments would 
be possible.  Does he not understand that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if my friend on the other 
side had heard my speech, that is exactly what I said.  We can 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in the past?  We know from the MAI agreement and 
other agreements on globalization that if we do not discuss and 
have a transparent system then we have trouble.  Let us change 
the system.  We do not want to sit with the old system. It is 
time to move into the 21st century.
