	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition signed by numerous 
residents of my constituency of Kingston and the Islands calling on 
Parliament to enact Bill C-205 introduced by my distinguished and 
learned colleague, the hon. member for Scarborough West. This 
bill is an attempt to ensure that in Canadian law no criminal may 
profit from the commission of a crime by the publication of 
memoirs or other details of criminal activities.

rise to present another set of petitions with well over 100 signatures 
from concerned parents and constituents across the country who 
support the effort to create a national pedophile registry.
<P>
	The petitioners I represent are concerned about making our 
streets safer for our children and they are opposed to the current 
status quo in the screening of pedophiles in the community.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that a federally implemented pedophile 
registry be established in order to help better protect our children.

the honour today to present a petition .
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The petition calls on the Parliament of Canada to enact 
legislation along the lines of Bill C-267 which would require major 
oil companies to disclose and to provide a period of notification of 
no less than 30 days for any increase over and above the current 
price of oil at the retail pumps.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have two petitions to present. The first comes from Orillia, 
Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
choose to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> The second 
petition, Madam Speaker, comes from Kingston, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health 
problems or impair one's ability and, specifically, that fetal alcohol 
syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

two petitions signed by the residents of York North.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4592"> 4592 </A></B>
<P>
	The first petition concerns job creation. The petitioners draw 
to the attention of the House that in the past year alone short term 
interest rates have declined three percentage points, that for the 
last two and half years inflation has averaged less than 2 per cent, 
and that by 1997-98 the federal deficit will have been reduced by 
$25 billion.
<P>
	The petitioners further draw to the attention of the House that 
since the Liberal government took office over 600,000 jobs have 
been created.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to continue to work 
diligently to create a healthy environment for jobs and economic 
growth.

	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> The second 
petition, Madam Speaker, draws to the attention of the House the 
government's red book commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 per 
cent of GDP and the fact that we have surpassed that goal.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to continue to keep its 
commitment to Canadians and pursue its deficit action so that the 
government will reach its deficit target of 2 per cent of GDP by 
1997-98.

province of Saskatchewan.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GOVERNMENT ORDERS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed from September 23 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-45, an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial 
review of parole ineligibility) and another act, be read the third 
time and passed; and on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, just before closing time in debate on Bill C-45, a point of 
order was raised. In fact, after the point of order was stated by my 
colleague from Wild Rose, the Speaker, which was you, Madam 
Speaker, did not rule on that point of order. In fact, you went back 
to the government whip who was asking a question at that time and 
asked the government whip to resume questioning.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the point of order that my colleague from Wild 
Rose was talking about related to a statement by the government 
whip who said: ``Instilling that kind of hatred in Canadians is not 
going to work''.
<P>
	My colleague from Wild Rose was referring to the rules of 
debate in section 481(c), imputing bad motives, different from 
those acknowledged by a member.
<P>
	All we asked yesterday, Madam Speaker, was that you rule on 
that point of order which you did not. Therefore, I ask today 
whether or not you would be prepared to rule on the point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I did rule 
yesterday on that point of order and I ruled it out of order. We are 
now resuming debate on Bill C-45.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have another point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to draw attention to <I>Hansard</I> for yesterday when the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell stated: ``Instilling that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4593"> 4593 </A></B>
<P>
kind of hatred in Canadians is  not going to work'' as a response to 
the previous member's statements.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	The member for Wild Rose rose on a point of order. It is quite 
clear at page 4589 of <I>Hansard</I> the member for Wild Rose said: 
``Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is improper and 
unparliamentary to start referring to us as hate pushers of any 
nature. I would ask this member to retract it''.
<P>
	My hon. colleague made the Beauchesne's reference to 
substantiate the request by the hon. member for Wild Rose. There 
is absolutely no record in <I>Hansard</I> of your acknowledging the point 
of order, addressing the point of order, dealing with the point of 
order or asking the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to 
withdraw the remark.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I remember 
fairly well the words that were spoken yesterday. They were not 
unparliamentary. I must admit that they were a little borderline, but 
not unparliamentary. So I say it again, this is not a point of order. I 
have ruled on this issue. We are now resuming debate on Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on another point of order. 
After you refused to rule on the point of order brought up by the 
member for Wild Rose, several of us called very loudly for another 
point of order and were ignored and not recognized.
<P>
	I want to find out whether this will be a standard practice in this 
House, where our points of order are not recognized.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Hon. member, 
points of order are always recognized in this House, but you must 
admit that points of order are not to be abused. We are now 
resuming debate on Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is indeed a 
pleasure to be back here in the House. I was off doing some 
business with international trade last week but I am sure that all of 
my colleagues conducted the affairs of the House in a manner 
which would add to the respect of this place.
<P>
	The bill we are discussing today certainly adds to the respect this 
place has garnered from the Canadian public. It is a bill that has 
been very carefully crafted in response to the concerns not just of 
government members but of members from both sides of this 
House and clearly of many Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
They want to ensure that the Canadian justice system is responsive 
to the Canadian public at this time in our history.
<P>
	It is very important when we talk about issues of law and justice 
that we do not take extreme positions at either end of the spectrum. 
It is important as we try to gauge what is right for the Canadian 
judicial system to understand that the vast majority of Canadians, 
no matter which aspect of criminal justice we are looking at, are 
reasonable individuals who wish to see the laws we pass in this 
place not only be laws that are enforceable but laws that are 
supportable by them. That is very very clear.
<P>
	One might argue that a law that is not supported by the public is 
not truly a law. As law makers we are elected by the people to make 
laws for the people which must be supported by the people.
<P>
	This bill has come to the floor of the House with a considerable 
degree of controversy. A private member's bill was presented by 
one of our members in the last session and it was debated. It caused 
a lot of very important public debate. We saw a polarization in 
some cases of those who thought the bill that was debated in the 
last session which sought to repeal section 745 should have been 
passed and that the entire section should have been repealed. Very 
good arguments were made and they were worth listening to.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The bill now before the House seeks to change the application of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. Again it has caused considerable 
debate in this place as well as in the Canadian public.
<P>
	It is a difficult piece of legislation. As I said earlier, most 
Canadians are somewhere in the middle of the extremes. We are 
dealing with parole eligibility for people who have been convicted 
of the most heinous crimes in our society.
<P>
	Indeed, after a particularly horrific crime has been committed 
the Canadian public seems to swing very much to the right. They 
say that the perpetrators of these crimes should be prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law and that there should be no consideration 
given to the ability of the system to rehabilitate those individuals.
<P>
	We have all done it; I have done it myself. When we read about a 
child being murdered or some of the other horrific crimes which 
human beings can perpetrate on other human beings, the initial 
reaction is to put the criminal in jail and throw away the key. 
However, on sober second thought we have to sit back and ask: Is 
each case exactly the same? Is each case so unindividual in its 
circumstances that laws should be passed which effectively 
indicate that anybody who is convicted of any of the crimes 
covered by section 745 should be automatically treated the same 
way? Should the key be thrown away? Should there be no 
possibility even for an application for a reduction in the length of 
time which has to be served before parole eligibility is attained?
<P>
	It is a difficult bill. If we had to deal with each case, nearly every 
member would see that all cases are not the same. There are 
different circumstances. We are dealing with individuals who have 
been convicted of the most heinous crimes: first degree murder; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4594"> 4594 </A></B>
<P>
multiple murders; serial murders; second degree murder; treason. 
These are the most serious crimes one can commit in our society.
<P>
	This bill probably sets the balance where it should be. The bill as 
proposed and as presented after report stage seeks to rebalance the 
system from where it had been under section 745 eligibility to 
where the Canadian public wants to see it and where our 
government thinks it should be in the interests of the successful 
application of justice in our society.
<P>
	This bill responds to the absolute gut wrenching aversion which 
each and every Canadian must feel when they see those in our 
society who have been murdered in cold blood and when they see 
the horrible crimes which have been committed against our 
children. It says that those who commit the most serious crimes 
against Canadians and against humanity will no longer be able to 
make an application under section 745.
<P>
	The bill also sets important new parameters. It tries to resolve 
the undue hardship which the families of victims suffer as a result 
of some criminals making frivolous applications under section 745. 
The bill adds a new layer to the application.
<P>
	Those who are applying under section 745, if they have been 
convicted of first degree murder, must wait 15 years before the 
application can be filed. Before the application receives a full 
hearing, it must go to a superior court justice in the province in 
which the sentencing occurred. Based on the written evidence only, 
that justice will now make a decision as to whether or not there is a 
reasonable likelihood that an application for reduced parole 
eligibility has a chance of success before a jury.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The current way the system operates is that anybody who 
reaches that 15-year threshold has a right to make an application 
which must be heard by a judge and a jury. In many cases, we 
understand that individuals who have no chance under the rules to 
have a shortened period before parole eligibility take it to the court 
to add more public attention to themselves. At the same time they 
drag the victims' families through the court system who relive the 
memories of the atrocious crimes that were committed.
<P>
	This bill addresses that. This bill makes sure that those frivolous 
cases as they are put forward will be vetted by a superior court 
judge. If that judge believes there is at least the possibility that the 
application for parole eligibility reduction might succeed, then it 
will be referred to a jury.
<P>
	The other significant change is that in the past, when it was a 
judge and a jury, and the way it is done under the current system is 
that only eight out of twelve or two-thirds of the jurors could agree 
that there should be a reduction in the parole eligibility period. 
Under the new  system it must be unanimous. Twelve out of twelve 
jurors must agree that the period before parole eligibility comes up 
should be shortened. Again, this seeks to rebalance the rights of the 
convicted as well as the rights of the community and the victims' 
families. It is a very progressive step in the right direction.
<P>
	There are other important things in this bill. We have to 
understand that the Canadian public seeks to put law and order on 
the front burner again. This is one of a series of bills that have come 
forward in the term of this government to try to address and to 
rebalance the justice system in Canada.
<P>
	This bill understands that perhaps some who are on the right 
wing would say to completely repeal section 745 and treat 
everybody the same no matter who they are, that somehow that will 
right the wrongs of those who have been the victims of these 
crimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> First degree murderers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Murderers, I agree. Maybe the members 
opposite would contain themselves a bit. We have had plenty of 
time to hear them in debate. Perhaps I could address some of their 
concerns.
<P>
	The Reform Party members opposite say to repeal it and they go 
to the victims of crime. They go to the very victims, the people who 
have suffered the most and say that if this is repealed, according to 
the Reform Party's representations during the processing of this 
bill through Parliament, suddenly everybody who is behind bars 
will have to come under the new regulations. My understanding of 
the law is that simply is not the case. It is a fundamental principle 
of justice that when dealing with substantive issues, they cannot be 
retrospective in their application.
<P>
	We have many lawyers. I am not a lawyer. I am just a poor soul 
from Cape Breton who is representing the good people of 
Dartmouth in the Parliament of Canada and lucky enough to do it. I 
talk to lawyers. They tell me that even if we wanted to, if we 
repealed this bill so that some of those criminals, the bottom 
dwellers who have perpetrated the most heinous of crimes in 
society, never get out, we could not do it. A fundamental tenet of 
justice not only here but in any country that has responsive systems 
of justice would be violated. As much as some in this place, maybe 
on our side as well, would like to see that done, it does not have the 
same impact as some of the amendments would propose.
<P>
	Nobody on this side of the House is saying that individuals who 
are convicted of murder should be treated with kid gloves; it is 
exactly the opposite. What we have to say, as legislators, and what 
we have to understand is that not every case is the same.
<P>
	Yes, what we have to do when we craft our laws is to ensure that 
we do not craft our laws based on a gut reaction as to where it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4595"> 4595 </A></B>
<P>
should be. We must do it on a  careful examination as legislators 
regarding what is workable and what is fair for Canadians.
<P>
	I have come a long way since I was first elected to Parliament in 
1988. When I was elected in 1988, I was one of the people who 
perhaps was more on the left side of the administration of justice.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	I have been here for eight years and have listened a lot to the 
people of our communities and I have seen the impact of some 
violent crimes. Members opposite may laugh, but I have seen some 
victims of crime, young girls of 13, 14 and 15 years of age who had 
been viciously raped by pimps. They were taken from their 
communities and became addicted to drugs and prostituted on the 
streets of Toronto, New York and Niagara Falls. I was one of the 
people who stood up in my caucus in government and in this place 
and said that the laws we had dealing with those types of criminals 
had to be revised and reformed because the sentences simply did 
not fit the crime or the aversion of the Canadian public to the 
perpetrators of those crimes.
<P>
	I will continue to speak up in Parliament for what I believe are 
necessary reforms to the criminal justice system. But I will not fall 
off the edge of the world into the right wing abyss which says that 
everybody who commits any type of crime should be dealt with in a 
very harsh and uncaring manner by the court system in Canada.
<P>
	This bill is a step in the right direction. It stops short of lumping 
all individuals into the same category. It ensures that those people 
in future who are convicted of multiple or mass murders will not 
have access to section 745 of the Criminal Code. It makes sure that 
does not happen. It puts firm rules in place which will stop the 
frivolous application by criminals of section 745 to gain earlier 
parole. In many cases it is not to get the earlier parole, because 
there is no chance for it, but simply to draw more attention to the 
crimes they have committed.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support the direction this bill is taking. I fully 
understand that maybe in one, two or even four years the bill and 
the entire issue of the application of section 745 must be reviewed. 
Indeed, when the bill passes this place the Minister of Justice and 
the officials of the Department of Justice, I would counsel, should 
keep close watch on its application and implication in the criminal 
justice system. They should also take into account how this has 
impacted and what are the responses from the victims of these 
heinous crimes.
<P>
	To have a criminal justice system in Canada supported by the 
Canadian public it must be responsive to the Canadian public as a 
whole, not just people on one side or the other side of an issue, but 
for the Canadian public in general.
<P>
	I applaud the Minister of Justice for this bill. I know he has very 
strong personal views on this which may or  may not be reflected in 
the legislation. However, I think the Minister of Justice 
understands how the criminal justice system in Canada must be 
responsive to the needs, aspirations and the demands of Canadians 
for a safe and secure society and that those people who break the 
rules are treated effectively under the law, that people can be 
rehabilitated, that the resources will be there to do it; but that those 
people who commit the most heinous of crimes do not have access 
to provisions for application under the law for early parole.
<P>
	I think this bill does it and I applaud the minister for it. I look 
forward to its speedy passage in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened quite attentively to the member for Dartmouth 
and I take exception to some of the things he said. He suggested the 
Canadian public is fickle, that it reacts and then thinks. I take 
exception to the minister's put down of Canadians and their ability 
to assess the happenings of the time.
<P>
	Canadians get on with their lives. That is not to say they do not 
carry the seriousness of what they read in the paper the previous 
day or what they heard. They do care very much and they feel very 
strongly when they hear of these vicious crimes.
<P>
	I point out to the member for Dartmouth that in my riding I took 
a survey, not at the time when there was a vicious crime. The 
survey did not reflect any particular event that took place in society 
at the time. It was a survey asking my constituents what they 
thought about capital punishment if they could be assured that 
capital punishment would affect only heinous crimes, mass 
murders, after all appeals had been exhausted.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I had 45,000 households in my riding at that time and had a 
return of 2,680 replies, 4.6 per cent. That proves what the member 
has said is not true, or is not always the case, because these 
Canadians feel so strongly even though they did not have a paper 
reaction right in front of them. Under those terms 87 per cent said 
we should look at capital punishment. The hon. member for 
Dartmouth can be assured that if we are talking about getting rid of 
parole, life is life for those kinds of crimes, they would certainly 
definitely say repeal section 745.
<P>
	The member speaks in contradictions. He said he has been in this 
House a long time. That when young girls were raped he 
immediately came to their defence and tried to change the laws. 
That is exactly what Reformers are doing. Why put down 
Reformers and Canadians who are responding to the needs of this 
society, and yet say he has done the same thing himself? I am 
interested in his response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Speaker, I certainly do not need a 
lecture from the member opposite on how to read the mood of the 
Canadian public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4596"> 4596 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as the Canadian public being fickle, I would caution the 
member to look at the results from the last election with respect 
to the Reform Party and see where the Reform Party currently sits 
in the polls.
<P>
	She says the Canadian public sticks to the topic. I will stick to it 
as much as she did when she talked abut capital punishment which, 
by the way, is not covered in this bill.
<P>
	The member opposite said that 4.6 per cent of households 
responded, and 87 per cent agreed that capital punishment should 
be reinstated. I think we have to be very careful here. I remember 
when the gun legislation was forwarded. I know what the numbers 
were in my riding and I would like for each of the Reformers to tell 
me what the numbers were in their ridings.
<P>
	In my riding 87 per cent indicated they felt very strongly that the 
gun control legislation put forward in this Parliament by my 
government should be passed. There was a very small percentage 
that believed we should not put gun control and the rest did not 
have an opinion.
<P>
	The member opposite says I read it wrong. I did not read it 
wrong at all. If I had just gauged it from the letters that came in 
from organized lobby I would have thought that everybody in my 
riding of Dartmouth wanted no part of gun control legislation. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. We cannot govern by polls, 
which is what the member opposite is telling us we should do.
<P>
	When you are elected to this place, to the highest court in the 
land, you take your responsibilities seriously and understand when 
you stand in your place in this House that it is not just your opinion 
that you carry but the opinion of the people in your riding. I can tell 
the hon. member opposite that I do not need polls to tell me what is 
the right thing to do.
<P>
	I talk to the people in my riding and I understand that the people 
in my riding have the same type of aversion to horrible crimes as I 
have. I do not need to be misquoted by the member opposite. What 
I indicated was that after there is a particularly horrible crime the 
Canadian public immediately will probably come up with opinions 
as to how best deal with it, which are not the opinions in the light of 
day they would have three, four or five days later.
<P>
	Rather than having knee-jerk reactions to the administration of 
justice my government has made a decision to go about this in a 
very methodical manner to ensure the individuals, the victims, 
people in the judicial administration are consulted and that we hear 
from Canadians. Where appropriate, laws are introduced into the 
Parliament of Canada to adjust those elements of our criminal 
justice system that need adjusting.
<P>
	What we will not do, and I hope it will never be done, is that we 
will become so controlled by extreme knee-jerk reactions, no 
matter how appropriate at the time, in response to a horrible crime 
that we start introducing legislation in this place which I believe 
would do a disservice to the evolution of the criminal justice 
system in Canada. I will continue to stand in this place on behalf of 
the good people of the city of Dartmouth and represent them to the 
best of my abilities.
<P>
	I think the Reform Party opposite, rather than constantly taking 
positions for the minority, should think about governing 
responsibly in opposition, playing a responsible role and start 
speaking for the majority. The poll numbers lately would certainly 
tell Reformers they have not been doing that.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We will see who wins in Dartmouth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> The last thing I wish to say to the member 
opposite who is yelling we will see who wins in Dartmouth, is I 
have a better shot of walking back into this Chamber than almost 
anybody because I have not fallen victim to extremists in my riding 
or across the country.
<P>
	This country deals with issues such as the criminal justice 
system, such as social policy, such as maintaining the social fabric 
of this country, such as ensuring that things like equalization and 
the concept that the Government of Canada has a role to play in 
ensuring that programs of national standards go from one end of 
this country to the other are part of the fabric, something the 
Reform Party knows nothing about.
<P>
	Ultimately the electorate will be the judge when the next election 
comes around and I will tell the members opposite that I do not fear 
that judgement, whatever it will be. I know the job I have done and 
my party has done is in the best interest of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
couple items and I will try not to get wound up the way the previous 
member did and try not to be quite so partisan.
<P>
	In my riding over 12,000 names came into my office about Bill 
C-68. Seventeen names came in saying I should vote for that bill. 
Twelve thousand to seventeen is an interesting figure when talking 
about listening to people.
<P>
	I could say more about the good people of my riding who are 
equally as good as the hon. member's constituents. What we are 
talking about here is first degree murder. What troubled me most 
about what the member had to say was how he never said that. He 
kept saying criminals, someone who commits a crime, and talked 
about dealing with them in this way.
<P>
	We are talking about first degree planned murders, and that is all 
we should be talking about in this bill. Is 15 years the time for the 
life of a victim? When someone has killed should that person serve 
15 years? Is that the price of that life? I would like to ask the 
member that. This is premeditated, first degree murder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Speaker, the member raises a very 
good point. An individual convicted of first degree  murder will 
serve a life sentence, no matter whether they do get a reduced 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4597"> 4597 </A></B>
<P>
period of time before parole because they served that sentence. 
That sentence is still applied even though they may be on parole.
<P>
	This bill states that anybody who is convicted of first degree, 
premeditated murder will get the minimum of a 25 year sentence 
but after 15 years may make an application through a new process, 
an application that does not automatically get heard. It is an 
application that can be made but not necessarily automatically 
heard, which is the current case. The hon. member knows that.
<P>
	Currently anybody who is convicted of first degree murder has a 
mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. They can 
now make an application after 15 years and that application must 
be heard. It means that a judge and jury must be convened and the 
judge and jury must make a ruling as to whether or not-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry to 
have to interrupt you, but we are resuming debate.
<P>
	I wish to point out that the next speaker will be the last to take 
advantage of the period of 20 minutes for speeches followed by ten 
minutes of questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to again speak on Bill C-45, which deals with changes to 
the Criminal Code, section 745 in particular.
<P>
	According to the present section 745 of the Criminal Code, a 
person convicted of first degree murder who has served 15 years of 
his sentence may apply to a judge and jury in order to become 
eligible for parole.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The effect of this bill would, in my opinion, be to make the 
conditions for eligibility for a reduced sentence more difficult, 
frankly, too difficult.
<P>
	According to this bill, first of all, a person has to submit a 
written document to convince a judge of the justification for the 
request. He cannot go before the judge to present his arguments 
verbally as to why he is eligible for having his sentence reduced to 
15 years on the basis of good conduct or certain other factors. This 
must be done by written representation, which does not work in the 
inmate's favour.
<P>
	Second, once this judge has been convinced, the jury which will 
hear the inmate's representations must be also convinced, this time 
unanimously according to the bill. Once the jury is convinced 
unanimously-not an easy thing to do-that the inmate might 
eventually be entitled to a reduced sentence, he then has to go 
before the Parole Board, which acts as the final decision-making 
authority and will probably allow a reduced sentence. If it does not 
allow it, the initial sentence will be retained as it was.
<P>
	This is the process proposed to us in the new Bill C-45.
<P>
	I have just been listening to the Reform and the Liberals 
squabbling over this matter of reduced sentences. As I see it, the 
two of them are not talking about exactly the same thing.
<P>
	In fact, the Reform Party's main grievance is that sentences for 
first or second degree murder are often reduced as a result of plea 
bargaining between the counsel and the court. In other words, 
agreement is reached on a lesser charge that carries a shorter 
sentence. In the case of first degree murder, counsel will often 
negotiate with the Crown, and finally the parties agree to a charge 
of second degree murder, thus avoiding a life sentence. This means, 
according to rules that are beyond me and beyond most people, that 
in the final instance, we have people who get 12 years and are 
released after serving only two and a half years. Those who get ten 
years are walking around scot free after only three years, often 
repeating the same offence. That is not the problem here.
<P>
	The problem we are concerned with here is people who are 
sentenced to 25 years without parole, what we call a life sentence, 
and who are not eligible for review till they have served 15 years of 
their sentence. The statistics show that, among individuals who 
served 15 years, and very few saw their period of ineligibility 
reduced after 15 years, only a few cases since section 745 came 
into effect-I may be wrong, but I doubt it-and I think that fewer 
than one per cent repeated. There are practically no repeat 
offenders. Fifteen years is a long time in a person's life.
<P>
	When Parliament abolished capital punishment, and capital 
punishment is certainly very much on the minds of Reform 
members as we listen to their message, when Parliament abolished 
capital punishment, it knew what it was doing. Sociologists 
prepared studies on the subject and submitted reports to the justice 
committee. They said: Sentencing someone to 25 years without 
parole, without any hope of having his sentence reduced for good 
behaviour or other factors, is asking for trouble.
<P>
	So it made sense to assume that providing opportunities for a 
reduced sentence would make it easier to keep the prison 
population within bounds, while at the same time ensuring the 
public safety.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	However, some people had harsh words for this bill. They said it 
would raise false hopes among the prison population in maximum 
security prisons because of the length of their sentence. It was a 
way to tell them that if they kept their noses clean for a certain 
time, they had a chance, with good behaviour, to have their 
sentence reduced from 25 years to 15 years, which in some cases, 
was acceptable.
<P>
	We have a Canadian-and this is a true story-we have a 
Canadian, Mr. Trân Trieu Quân, a Canadian of  Vietnamese origin 
who has just been sentenced to life imprisonment in Vietnam. He 
asked to be shot. He said he would rather be shot than be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4598"> 4598 </A></B>
<P>
imprisoned for life or sentenced to 25 years hard labour. In one way 
or another, he knows he will not get out alive so he would rather be 
shot right away.
<P>
	This is consistent with what I said last week: some people would 
rather be executed right away than be sentenced to 25 years in 
prison without parole. Mr. Trân Trieu Quân, whose release we as 
members of Parliament are fighting for, asked to be shot rather than 
having to put up with such outrage for 25 years.
<P>
	The same goes for Canadian inmates. I think it is wrong to say 
that a convicted criminal must serve 25 years without parole. We 
must give inmates some real hope, not only on paper, not just a 
semblance of hope as the Liberals are trying to do with this bill and 
know very well they are.
<P>
	This is nothing but partisan politics. The Liberals do not want the 
Reformers to be too gutsy, as my grandfather used to say. So they 
introduced a bill to make western Canadians feel like the Liberal 
government understands them, not completely but a little.
<P>
	The Liberals do not want to go too far either, because if they do, 
if they give the Reform Party full satisfaction, it is Quebec that will 
object. As we say in hockey, ``they will get it''. I hope it will not be 
for too much longer, but Quebecers, too, are currently subject to the 
Criminal Code and Canadian justice, and their mentality is not 
exactly the same as that of western Canadians.
<P>
	Quebecers, who also experience all manner of crimes and acts of 
violence, of extreme violence-as we recently saw in the Isabelle 
Bolduc case-but who believe more strongly in social 
reintegration, in the possibility of rehabilitation, are not fooled by 
the requirement for a unanimous jury.
<P>
	In the end, it is nothing but a smoke screen. This bill is basically 
hypocritical. It is obvious that if an inmate has to apply to a judge, 
secure a unanimous jury decision and then have a majority on the 
Parole Board rule in his favour after completing a 15-year 
sentence, chances are that he will have served his full sentence 
before the Parole Board has to make a decision.
<P>
	This is what we object to in this bill. We feel that the bill is 
hypocritical, and that is why the hon. member for Bellechasse has 
put forward an amendment. We are not proud to see the rules in 
section 745 become more stringent for inmates, not out of 
compassion for them, but because the safety of our prisons is at 
stake.
<P>
	It would already be an improvement if the decisions did not have 
to be unanimous. An inmate who behaved during his years in 
prison and who had an opportunity to show remorse for his crime 
might benefit from a reduction of up to a maximum of ten years in 
the number of years. This person could be rehabilitated and perhaps 
become a productive citizen.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	There are costs involved in keeping people locked up. A study 
conducted about 18 months or two years ago showed that each 
inmate costs the state something like $50,000 per year, if not more. 
There are also social costs related to keeping people in jail when 
they should no longer be detained.
<P>
	Statistics show that very few of those who applied for a judicial 
review under section 745 relapsed into crime. Those who did 
relapse were the ones who were the subject of some wheeling and 
dealing at the time the complaint was lodged and who were 
sentenced to 12 years but did three, or 10 years and did 2, or five 
years but spent six months in jail, etc. They are the ones who 
relapsed, because they felt the justice system had no backbone. But 
those who actually spent 15 years in jail think otherwise, because 
15 years is a long time.
<P>
	Fifteen years ago, most of us here, including myself, had hair on 
our head. During those 15 years, some people, including myself, 
gained 25 pounds. Things change over a period of 15 years. 
Reformers should realize that 15 years is a long time and that the 
possibility of being paroled is a glimmer of hope that we give to 
inmates during that period.
<P>
	People have come to my office to make representations. Chiefs 
of police have told me truly shocking stories. They expressed their 
views. I respect them and I understand them. This was evidenced 
recently, just a few days ago, when the Minister of Justice tabled 
his bill on the wearing of a bracelet by criminals who are 
potentially dangerous but may not in fact be dangerous, who have 
not been convicted but could eventually be. The chiefs of police 
applauded to this measure.
<P>
	If police chiefs were authorized to put everybody on file, to have 
a record on everybody and to restrict people's movements to a very 
limited area, their work would be made that much easier. I cannot 
blame them for that. But human rights may not be police chiefs' 
primary concern.
<P>
	In the headlines in Quebec these days, you can read about 
officers in charge of investigating other officers being openly 
threatened by fellow officers, and this is apparently not unusual in 
the police community. Human rights may be relegated to the 
fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh place in the police community, but 
politicians must give them a higher priority. We do not represent 
only police officers. We represent people from all walks of life, 
including the victims of often heinous crimes.
<P>
	I do not think we should come here to demand an eye for an eye. 
Society should not seek revenge. The purpose of the justice system 
is not to avenge, to repay those who do violence to someone else in 
kind. Society must protect  itself against criminals, and that it why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4599"> 4599 </A></B>
<P>
we have criminal legislation: not to avenge heinous crimes, but to 
provide public protection. That is what we are here for.
<P>
	I guess my friend opposite, the hon. member who has rejoined 
the Liberal caucus, agrees with me on this, because he normally 
objects immediately when he does not. I congratulate him and I 
congratulate him on his return as well, but I am sure that, like me, 
he understands that society, the government, justice, must not go 
after individuals. Justice transcends everything represented by 
hate, outrage, bitterness. Justice must be there to be applied.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	And if I had any recommendations to make, one would be to 
begin by putting a stop to the well known practice of plea 
bargaining: someone who has committed a murder would be liable 
to a sentence of murder in the first degree, that should be the 
charge. But in the guise of speeding up the process, of saving the 
taxpayer money, we will reduce his sentence by just a bit, instead 
of sticking him with the offence he actually committed. If he 
co-operates, a little more is shaved off, if his behaviour is good, a 
little more again, and if he is an employer providing jobs, another 
little bit. In the end, we have ridiculous situations where 10 year 
sentences have been whittled down to 2, 9 years to 3, and so forth. 
Every day we read in the papers about repeat offenders. Often it is 
because they have not been through the deprivation and frustration 
of 15 years behind bars. But those who have, and the statistics 
prove it, do not reoffend.
<P>
	I think that, ideally, section 45 should have been left alone, but 
they wanted to quiet the agitated rumblings of people with an axe to 
grind. They wanted to satisfy people who are applying political 
pressure and who have political clout, in order to keep everyone 
happy. The result is something that is neither fish nor fowl. It is just 
like all the wonderful Liberal bills we have seen for the past three 
years. That is Bill C-45 for you.
<P>
	Bring us a bill that would state in black and white that, in the 
case of such a charge, lawyers may not plea bargain, because this is 
where the sentence is actually decided, and then I might listen with 
more interest. But I totally disagree with Reform's attempt to bring 
in capital punishment through the back door for an upcoming 
debate. This is Reform's hidden agenda.
<P>
	If Reform's main concern is to protect society from dangerous 
criminals, there is the new legislation on dangerous offenders, a 
very interesting bill I urge them to read.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am never really sure at times where some of the folks from the 
Bloc are coming from, and whether the hon. member supports or 
does not support the bill.
<P>
	The member made a very interesting statement a moment ago. 
He said, with regard to first degree murderers, that 15 years is a 
long time, people are suffering. I really find that incredible 
statement, considering that first degree murderers have 
pre-planned the execution they have undertaken. They have 
usually, if not always, little or no regard for the victims.
<P>
	I wonder how my colleague across the way can rationalize the 
plight of the victim with that of a first degree murderer for whom 
he says 15 years is a long time, people are suffering. If he believes 
for a minute that the families of the victims of these first degree 
murderers are not suffering for their whole lives then he is truly 
mistaken.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member how he rationalizes a statement 
like that in view of the fact that all of the victims in our society 
suffer even more?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I fail to understand how the 
victim's pain and suffering will be reduced if the convicted 
criminal is sentenced to 20 rather than 25 years in prison. I do not 
understand.
<P>
	My learned colleague, whom I salute and for whom I have 
enormous respect, tells me that 15 years is not long. He should go 
ask Brian Tobin, the current premier of Newfoundland, whether or 
not 15 years is a long time. He should go ask him. Fifteen years is a 
long time in an active person's life. It is probably the maximum 
sentence that can be given so a convicted criminal has a real chance 
to rehabilitate himself and reintegrate into society. After 15 years, 
the inmate is often too old to start over on the right foot.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It is the kind of balance we try to achieve when drafting a bill 
like this one: giving a criminal a real chance to return to society 
while limiting the possibilities that he will reoffend. We are trying 
to find the right balance between the two, something the Reform 
Party does not seem willing to acknowledge. This is unfortunate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a quick question. The member seems to eliminate the word 
justice in his speech.
<P>
	I would like to remind the member that the victims of this land 
are calling for justice, not revenge. That is the only thing that could 
happen that would ease the pain of a victim to the slightest degree. 
If they believe that at least justice prevailed in their case, they 
would feel better. It has not.
<P>
	Would the member explain to me, if he can, why there are tens of 
thousands of Canadians who belong to all kinds of victims' groups 
across this land, calling not for revenge but for justice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4600"> 4600 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know why these members have such a hard time with 
that word. I know how the member would respond if I said: 
``Would capital punishment be a deterrent?'' We would get into 
a long debate about no, it does not deter, et cetera.
<P>
	Does the member believe that serving 15 years for first degree 
murder is a deterrent to crime in this country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, we must not confuse justice and 
vengeance, as reformers seem to do. I do not think they are acting 
in bad faith, but I do believe they confuse the notions of justice and 
vengeance.
<P>
	An uncle of mine got killed. It was an accident. There was no 
malicious intent. He was killed in a car accident and it was not clear 
whether the driver involved was under the influence or not. This 
was in 1952. In those days, a driver who had had just one beer 
would automatically have been sentenced to life in prison. It was 
considered a very serious offence. Finally, a pardon was granted, 
and the driver involved spent three years in prison. Our family saw 
him again, because he was a friend. This person never relapsed. He 
led a perfectly normal life. He was much more a victim of 
circumstances than anything else.
<P>
	Had we let our frustration get the better of us, this person would 
probably have spent 10, 15 or 20 years in prison, at an enormous 
cost to society. This person would not have made a contribution to 
the community, while today he is rehabilitated. He is the father of 
several children who work and who make a contribution to our 
society. This is an example of rehabilitation and this is why I 
believe in it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I could not let the last 
little bit of meandering go by.
<P>
	We are talking about first degree murder. What does that have to 
do with a traffic accident, for heaven's sake? We are talking about 
the lower rung of human society going out and obliterating people 
for whatever reason. It has nothing to with traffic accidents. It is 
terrible that the member should even entertain that type of 
argument because it is specious.
<P>
	The other thing that he mentioned-he mentioned it twice in his 
long and rambling speech-was that it costs money to keep these 
people in jail. It costs $50,000 a year. If $50,000 a year is too much, 
what value does the hon. member put on human life?
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not at all sure that we can put a 
price tag on human life, as does the Reform Party. When a person 
dies in a freak accident, it also causes grief to the family. If we try 
to establish a link between one's grief, the prejudice that is caused 
and the person responsible for this grief, we are bound to make 
miscalculations or mistakes. It goes without saying that everyone is 
sad, particularly when we are the victims of a heinous crime. Our 
purpose is not to protect those who commit heinous crimes.
<P>
	Earlier, I referred to the current dangerous offender legislation. 
A few days ago, we kept hearing about the Bernardo case and the 
case of the serial killer in western Canada who was eligible after 15 
years, whose name escapes me for the moment. Reform Party 
members lump it all together and this is where they are wrong. 
Justice that is just, the word says it all, and unbending, yes, up to a 
point, must not allow itself to be flouted and ridiculed, which is 
very often the case in criminal trials when lawyers get to plea 
bargaining. But once the sentence and the rules of the game are 
clearly set out, justice itself must abide by the rules. That is what 
we are saying.
<P>
	In our view, 15 years is not automatic. Reform Party members 
think that, on the morning of the fifteenth anniversary of someone's 
sentence, the prison warden brings the keys, opens the cell door and 
says to the inmate: ``Off you go, now''. That is what they would 
have Canadians think in the current debate. This is quite simply not 
what happens. Inmates already have to go through an involved 
process, which will be even more involved with the new bill, and 
Reform Party members paint a picture of prison walls coming 
down. I do not agree.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before I get into a couple of the points I want to make during this 
speech, I want to cover some comments that have been made.
<P>
	Yesterday, for instance, the government whip read some 
statistics about crime. He said crime was going down. Maybe it is 
well-meaning to try and win an argument on that basis, but by and 
large where there are murderers and where there is crime one has to 
deal with it.
<P>
	It is pretty difficult in my riding to talk about crime going down 
because crime is not going down. In Vernon, not too far from my 
home, about three or four hours' drive, in April 10 people were 
shot. A week and a half ago five people were murdered in my 
riding.
<P>
	This week, starting this morning, many members may know that 
the trial of the individual charged with murdering young Tanya 
Smith is taking place. That happened very close to my home. It is 
difficult to listen to people on the other side downplay the 
importance of what this debate is all about.
<P>
	Members have talked about all kinds of crimes in this debate. We 
just heard a little bit of rambling from one of  the separatist 
individuals, again downplaying the issue of first degree murder. 
First degree murder is premeditated murder. It is deliberate. It is a 
pre-planned action by people with no conscience, by people who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4601"> 4601 </A></B>
<P>
deliberately obliterate a life or lives and who are not worried about 
the consequences.
<P>
	I think we have to consider when these people are getting out and 
why. I heard the member for Dartmouth a while a go talking about 
knee-jerk reactions from the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	It is rather interesting that now the Liberals are taking credit for 
the amendment to section 745 of the Criminal Code when in fact it 
was one of their own members who brought up in a private 
member's bill the repeal of section 745, which they dislike so 
much. For that reason and for voting against the budget, that 
member is no longer a Liberal. And they are taking credit for the 
amendments to section 745. I find it incredible. The next thing we 
know they will be bragging about it.
<P>
	It was not this government at all. It was due to the efforts of an 
individual who had the courage of his own convictions to fight and 
ride it through, to work with victims all over the country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> His government was the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is right. The Liberal 
government was actually the government that was standing in the 
way. It was the government that delivered this section 745 to us in 
the seventies.
<P>
	I have been at a parole hearing, and I may be the only one in this 
House who has, of an individual who went up for the first time for a 
section 745 federal review. That person and another individual took 
the life of a young policeman in Cloverdale, British Columbia in 
the seventies. They encouraged him to chase them down the street. 
When the 19-year old RCMP officer stopped them and came over 
to the car they killed him with a shotgun. It was premeditated first 
degree murder.
<P>
	They were both sentenced to hang. Did they hang? No, they got 
life. They got Liberal life, 25 years. Did they do 25 years? One of 
them is attending college today very close to my home, much to the 
disappointment of the sister and the brother of the young policeman 
who was killed.
<P>
	The brother attended the parole board hearing. The sister lives in 
Montreal and could not get there. They were in complete disgust. 
They had been saying: ``There he was, out of our lives. This person 
had life''. But this year they had to relive it all over again. What is 
wrong? Why do we have to put victims through this time and time 
again? It is appalling the way this government thinks.
<P>
	Another comment by the member for Dartmouth is Reformers 
are extremists. This is the most insulting tactic of the Liberal 
government and all of its hacks sitting over there. If you think that 
section 745 should be repealed, to those folks you are an extremist. 
If you did not agree with Bill C-33, special rights for homosexuals, 
you are a homophobic. In this country, if you fight immigration 
cases and try to get people deported, as I have-criminals, a killer, 
a rapist-you are a racist.
<P>
	This government and its members are getting our society to think 
that if we do not agree with the Liberal point of view, we are 
racists, bigots, homophobics or extremists. It is terribly insulting.
<P>
	Let us see what the Liberals think about victims. On April 29 we 
brought in a victims bill of rights. They said they agreed with it and 
would deal with it in the fall. Is it on the agenda of the Liberal 
government at the justice committee for the fall? Absolutely not. 
The victims bill of rights is not on the agenda, but we will spend a 
whole bunch of time in this House talking about a faint hope clause 
for first degree murderers. Look after the first degree murderers. A 
separatist colleague said fifteen years is a long time, people are 
suffering. That is too damn bad. I will tell members who is 
suffering in this country: millions-not hundreds of thousands-of 
victims.
<P>
	We brought nonsense which came from the lips of a Liberal 
member here. I said guess who is suffering? The victims are 
suffering. He says ``nonsense''. There you go.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I wonder what the people in Kingston think of 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> No victims in Kingston 
perhaps. That is nonsense that they are suffering. They are saying 
those who are really suffering are the poor individuals who got 15 
years for first degree murder.
<P>
	Let us talk about victim rights. We brought a victims bill of 
rights in the House. Is it going to be talked about by this 
government? Absolutely not. What did we ask for? We asked for 
victims to have the right to be informed of their rights at every 
stage of the process. Has the government mentioned that in this 
discussion? Absolutely not.
<P>
	We asked that victims have the right to be informed of the 
offender's status throughout the process, including where the 
offender is, when he is getting out and where he is going when he 
gets out. Has that been discussed here? No, we have discussed first 
degree murderers and the faint hope that they get out in 15 years.
<P>
	We asked that victims have the right to choose between giving 
oral and a written victim impact statement before sentencing, at 
parole hearings and judicial reviews. Has that been discussed? No, 
it has not been discussed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4602"> 4602 </A></B>
<P>
	What about being informed in a timely fashion of the details 
of the crown's intention to offer a plea bargain or to know why 
charges are not laid if that is a decision of the crown or police? 
Or the protection of anyone who intimidates, harasses or interferes 
with the rights of a victim, or to know if a person convicted of 
a sexual offence has a sexually transmittable disease? Does it care 
about that? Did it vote on it? Did it take it to the justice 
committee? No. What it takes is a faint hope clause for first degree 
murderers. That says everything about this government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I always think it is disgraceful that an 
institution such as the Parliament of Canada-I am unable to begin 
for the noise. I was saying that I always think it is disgraceful to 
hear insults, comments on both sides of the House, and I think it is 
one of the reasons the Canadian public has lost confidence in 
Parliament as an institution and in politicians.
<P>
	When we hear comments such as those we have just heard, when 
insults are hurled back and forth, this affects Parliament's 
credibility. We should be able to respect our differences. That is all 
I wanted to say, that it bothers me. When I was elected in 1993, I 
had a great deal of respect for the institution, and I still do. I believe 
in it, and I do not feel that comments such as those we have just 
heard will do anything to increase its prestige.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to Bill C-45, which deals with changes to 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. First of all, I think it would be 
appropriate to tell this House and our viewers just what section 745 
contains.
<P>
	Sometimes we tend to speak a sort of insider's jargon. We speak 
of ``745, paragraph 1, paragraph 2'' and so on, and therein perhaps 
lies the problem of legal language. These are discussions between 
people in the know, and the ordinary people listening to us need to 
know what this section is all about.
<P>
	Before I read the section, just to put us in context, people need to 
know that the government tabled Bill C-45 right at the end of the 
session, June 11 to be precise. One of the reasons for so doing was 
to prevent British Columbia serial killer Clifford Olson from 
making an application under section 745 of the Criminal Code 
during the summer of 1996. As the section stood, he became 
eligible to apply for parole on August 12, 1996.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I must make it clear immediately that this bill, pushed through at 
full speed by the Liberal government, by the federal Minister of 
Justice, is somewhat reactionary, along the lines of the right wing 
approach of the Reform Party. By adopting a Reform-style program 
with all possible haste, the Liberal government wished to show that 
it was looking out for victims and for victims' rights, that criminals 
ought to remain in prison, and so forth. I must point out, right from 
the start, that the party to which I belong feels, as has been stated 
already in prior speeches by my hon. colleague from Bellechasse, 
that the interests of victims must come first.
<P>
	However, in Canada there are certain principles of natural justice 
that must be respected, which is what I intend to demonstrate in the 
next few minutes. I may point out that the first paragraph of section 
745 of the Criminal Code provides, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Where a person has served at least fifteen years of his sentence</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) in the case of a person who has been convicted of high treason or first degree 
murder, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) in the case of a person convicted of second degree murder [-]he may apply to 
the appropriate Chief Justice in the province in which the conviction took place 
for a reduction in his number of years of imprisonment without eligibility for 
parole.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The same section also says that on receipt of an application 
under subsection (1), the appropriate Chief Justice shall designate a 
judge of the superior court to empanel a competent jury that will 
determine, and this is the important part of paragraph (2) of section 
745, ``whether the applicant's number of years of imprisonment 
without eligibility for parole ought to be reduced having regard to 
the character of the applicant, his conduct while serving his 
sentence, the nature of the offence for which he was convicted and 
such other matters as the judge deems relevant in the 
circumstances.''
<P>
	So, very briefly, this section provides, as also specified in 
paragraph (4), that the jury, in full possession of the facts, may 
reduce or eliminate altogether the number of years. So it does have 
certain powers.
<P>
	It should be clear before we go any further that, if we take the 
Clifford Olson case, a jury in full possession of the facts would 
never authorize the release of Clifford Olson, and that should the 
National Parole Board receive an application, its reply would be 
negative.
<P>
	We must see this section in context. The section was introduced 
in 1976 by the Trudeau government, when capital punishment was 
abolished. This measure was introduced at the very end of the 
debate to ensure a majority in Parliament for the abolition of 
capital punishment. Twenty years ago, this section represented a 
kind of security for supporters of capital punishment. The 
government could say: ``This does not mean that after a certain 
time, we will automatically release dangerous criminals or serial 
killers, and so forth''.
<P>
	Again, I agree with the comments made by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Chambly, who said earlier that this was not a 
question of mathematics, with different sets of criteria depending 
on whether two, four or ten murders were committed. These are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4603"> 4603 </A></B>
<P>
totally subjective criteria. Still there must be a common thread, 
some uniformity in dealing with this or that type of murder, 
whether it is murder in the first degree or murder in the second 
degree.
<P>
	As far as the Bloc Quebecois' position is concerned, we must 
point out that our party is not against reviewing section 745. After 
20 years, I think this section needs to be updated. Legislative 
review is normal process in the Quebec and Canadian society. We 
do not do things in 1996 as we did in 1976. Our values, as a society, 
may have changed. In saying this I am trying not to pass judgment 
on today's values, but the fact remains that we do not have today 
the same values as we did in 1976 or in the 1950s.
<P>
	Again, I am not passing a qualitative judgment on today's 
values. We know that, as a society, we still have a some way to go 
in terms of values. It was therefore normal to review section 745.
<P>
	On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, just days before the 
summer recess, the Minister of Justice brought in what we consider 
an important amendment to the Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	It is our party's opinion that Bill C-45 would have deserved, and 
still deserves, thorough and careful consideration, instead of being 
rushed through for emotional reasons in reaction to a Reform Party 
agenda item and that the Liberal government should act differently.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice maintains that section 745 should not be 
repealed, as requested by the Reform Party, because he believes in 
the rehabilitation potential of inmates. But the proposed 
amendments restrict the judicial review process to such an extent 
that, while it still exists in theory, the provision is all but 
inoperative.
<P>
	So, he is not prepared to repeal the section, as requested by the 
Reform Party, but he makes its application so difficult that it does 
not mean anything any more. That is what the people on Ile 
d'Orléans, around Beaupré, call talking out of both sides of one's 
mouth.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you have indicated to me that I have only a 
minute and a half left, so I will have to skip certain parts of my 
presentation.
<P>
	I do wish to state, however, that we consider this amendment to 
section 745 to have been badly presented, badly managed by the 
Liberal government. As a party, we are well aware of the pain and 
suffering experienced by victims' families in seeing the person 
who murdered their loved one resurfacing in the court process. For 
this reason, as a party, we feel that the Criminal Code ought to 
contain clauses to ensure that the families of victims are not 
forgotten.
<P>
	This is the problem with our legal system, we are strong on 
inmate rights, and so forth, but often tend to forget victims and 
victims' families. If the victim has had the misfortune to lose his 
life, his survivors must bear the burden of their suffering for years. 
We ought to keep victims' families firmly in mind.
<P>
	We ought therefore to make sure that victims' families are given 
a hearing, if they wish one, during the review process. Another bill, 
Bill C-41, requires judges to consider victims' or victims' families' 
testimony as part of the evidence, and this is a very good thing.
<P>
	In conclusion, we feel that section 745 ought to be examined far 
more thoroughly, possibly with public consultation. Statistics on 
the use of judiciary review and the very low percentage of repeat 
offenders among released criminals warrant far more extensive and 
far more serious attention.
<P>
	An important section of our Criminal Code cannot be modified 
in a rush, at the end of a parliamentary session, by getting around 
the usual rules of parliamentary debate. The Minister of Justice 
cannot change the basic principles of criminal law in Canada 
because he is carried away by emotion, or for political expediency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have prepared a 20-minute speech so I hope I do not run 
over my time. I know you will let me know.
<P>
	First, I would like to thank you, Madam Speaker, for recognizing 
me in the debate. I did speak last Tuesday on second reading debate 
of Bill C-45. I am speaking today for a very special reason. Why? 
Because it is rush, rush, rush with this government trying to put this 
bill through, the same as it did with Bill C-68 and C-41 when it 
invoked closure and Bill C-33. It seems whenever we have a real 
contentious issue, whenever we have something that really affects 
Canadians this government just pushes it through with total 
disregard.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> I hear the member for Kingston and the Islands 
in his usual form, continually talking when others are talking, 
continually being rude. I have come to expect that from him so I 
will just continue.
<P>
	Since last Tuesday I did look over the justice committee meeting 
minutes. I noticed that where the witnesses spoke in the justice 
committee every one of them seemed to be concerned with time.
<P>
	Mr. Jessop is a police staff sergeant and his concern, apart from 
the fact that he mentioned dangerous offenders, is why is the 
Liberal government not doing something about dangerous 
offenders. He said: ``I am told we are not introducing dangerous 
offenders 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4604"> 4604 </A></B>
<P>
at this particular point because it is not politically expedient to do 
so. I would suggest that this is not the way we should  be thinking. 
We should be dealing with dangerous offender legislation''. That 
was from a police sergeant.
<P>
	He also goes on to say that the RCMP are really displeased with 
the justice agenda of the Liberal government. He said: ``The 
government should be considering repealing section 745 if they 
want to restore some integrity to the criminal justice system''. He 
continues: ``Section 745 contradicts fundamentally not only public 
confidence but the entire philosophy of how our criminal justice 
legal system has grown''. That is a staff sergeant speaking.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	What about time? Are we rushing it through? He looks right at 
the committee and says: ``You have the opportunity in the three 
days left-and I address this specifically to the Liberal members of 
this committee-to actually do the right thing. I would urge you to 
repeal section 745''.
<P>
	Mr. Scott Newark, executive director of the Canadian Police 
Association, also spoke. He was concerned about clause 5 of Bill 
C-45 which deals with victims' information. He said: ``It 
potentially excludes victim information from section 745 screening 
hearings or judicial reviews, other than for new offences''. He is 
right to be concerned on that.
<P>
	He also pointed out that having notification on Monday, when he 
was out of Alberta, that the bill was going to be introduced on 
Wednesday, is terrible. Shame on the justice committee when they 
had ample opportunity, over a year of preparation on C-45 and on 
private member's Bill C-226 since it was introduced in December 
1994. They have known about it since that time. He was correct 
when he stated: ``It has been the case that parliamentary 
committees were supposed to have the time and the ability to 
analyse legislation''. That is a very important statement. Indeed, 
that is what parliamentary committees are supposed to do.
<P>
	He finishes with: ``I share not only what I would call your 
frustrations''-he is talking to members of the committee-``but 
frankly as a citizen, the outrage at the process that is being foisted 
on people when the opportunity to do a proper job was present for 
over a year. And that is not only true on this bill; that was the case 
last year on the DNA search warrants that resulted in another 
sloppy piece of legislation without a DNA data bank attached to 
it''. Those words are straight from the mouth of this expert. ``The 
right thing here'', he said, ``is to repeal 745''.
<P>
	He was questioned on cost. As a matter of fact it was Reform's 
justice critic from Crowfoot who questioned him on the costs of 
these hearings and whether they were costly to the Canadian 
public. He said that he could not be definite but it was between 
$50,000 and $100,000 a hearing and that the more sensational 
hearings are  probably up to millions for the taxpayers. Of course 
they take a lot longer than the original trial.
<P>
	I look at this and say to myself: Debt, deficit and accountability. 
This government has us so far in debt and deficit, there is no 
accountability and let us just keep on having hearings even if they 
should not be allowed and are not necessary and to heck with 
worrying about the taxpayers and the dollars.
<P>
	Witness Sharon Rosenfeldt from Victims of Violence 
International, who everyone I think is aware of the tragic loss in her 
family, said: ``This is such an important issue it has to be talked 
about and addressed in a much broader context than is being done 
at this time by just a few days in a quick rush in front of the justice 
committee. I just cannot accept the new amendments the justice 
minister has put forward. I still have to stay with the total repeal of 
section 745''.
<P>
	What about Darlene Boyd, another person who has had a tragic 
loss in her family? She said: ``Murder is all too readily said. 
Another word I frequently hear is rehabilitation. I truly believe that 
the man who took our daughter's life and that of the young girl 
from High River is not and never will be rehabilitation material, 
especially after serving only 15 years in his confined environment. 
To rehabilitate there has to be some spark of remorse and James 
Peters did not demonstrate any of this. The chance of filtering men 
like James Peters back into society after 15 years through the 
system we now have is too great a risk. We will be digging more 
graves for innocent people''.
<P>
	I think the member for Kingston and the Islands again misses the 
point, the chance is there and that is what is so frightening and 
scary.
<P>
	There is witness Debbie Mahaffy. We all know about Debbie's 
loss. She said: ``We found out about the various committee 
hearings by accident and I am very glad that we scrambled our way 
to Ottawa and got here on time''. What is this rush? ``Is life in 
prison with no eligibility for parole up to 25 years enough for 
taking the life of one person? No. Is it enough for taking the life of 
more than one person? No. Is 25 years a waste of a life? Yes. But 
the killers who decided to murder my daughter made that choice. 
By doing so they decided their own fate and are now wasting their 
lives in comfort. Our laws should reflect our evolving society and 
everyone in society should be protected by our laws''.
<P>
	These witnesses are people who are experienced. They are not 
removed from the situation. Debbie finishes with: ``It is 
irresponsible of this government to allow time that much power 
and control over its decisions. Less time for communication, less 
time for discussion, less time for murderers to serve is a sad 
commentary on the quality of life we are now leaning toward in 
Canada''.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The presentation by Priscilla de Villiers, president of CAVEAT, 
is very interesting. She said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am appalled at the way this has been presented to the people of this country. I am 
appalled not just because of section 745 or any other section of the Criminal Code. 
This is a travesty of the parliamentary system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have had a bill asking for discussion of this on the books for 18 months. We 
got an official communique on Thursday, I think. I first read this bill on the airplane 
to Saskatchewan and Steve Sullivan and I had to come back in the middle of last 
night to beg for five minutes of time to make our little statement because we are the 
few people here who do not benefit from the system. Shame.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Shame on this reluctant concession to what is becoming very quickly a serious 
election issue. Shame on you that you have not taken into account the words of 
ordinary Canadians who say: We are bothered by this; we are concerned. Give it the 
consideration it deserves. If you then, in your wisdom as a governing party decide 
not to support it, fine, that is your right. But to have this ramshackle excuse for an 
appearance just to say that we actually appeared here, it is a shame on the entire 
process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have to agree with her. Why has this country deteriorated so far 
from people facing responsibilities for their actions? It began in 
1971 with the Liberals and Solicitor General Goyer who summed 
up the government agenda when he told Parliament: ``We have 
decided to stress the rehabilitation of individuals rather than the 
protection of society''. Therein says it all. They stressed the belief 
that society and not the criminal was responsible for the crime. 
From that time on the whole system existed to serve the criminal. 
And in 1976 when the Liberal government abolished capital 
punishment, Canada replaced it with a life sentence of 25 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Rubbish. Rubbish
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> But that is not good enough. Now we are still 
talking about section 745 which was brought in in 1976. I am really 
concerned that members on the opposite side who are busy right 
now constantly harassing me when I am speaking do not 
understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> How about extremism?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> We are talking about first degree murderers 
here. We are talking about mass murderers. For goodness sake let 
us have some common sense in the remarks coming from that side.
<P>
	I must comment on what the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said yesterday because according to 
him the crime rate is going down. I guess it depends on what poll 
we read or what political group we listen to.
<P>
	I have in my hand the poll from the <I>Readers Digest</I> which I think 
is pretty non-partisan. It says that between the 1960s and the 1990s 
the total Criminal Code violations reported to police nearly 
quadrupled from over 2,000 to over 10,000 for every 100,000 
people. Property crime soared from almost 2,000 to over 6,000 
during the  same period. Violent crime exploded. Whereas there 
were 221 violent crimes per 100,000 people back in the 1960s, the 
figures in the 1990s are now astounding at over 1,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to stand in support of the motion to 
hoist the bill. Fortunately from my point of view I will speak from 
a different perspective of why the bill should be hoisted than the 
member who introduced it.
<P>
	It is a piece of legislation that I have to oppose for two main 
reasons. The first is that it totally ignores the wishes of the majority 
of the Canadian people. The second is that it tramples on the will of 
this Parliament whose members voted in favour of a private 
member's bill which would have repealed section 745 of the 
Criminal Code, and not just tinker with it as the justice minister is 
doing with Bill C-45.
<P>
	Regarding my first point, I wish to emphasize the terrible impact 
on the families of murder victims when their loved one's killer is 
eligible for parole after only a 15-year sentence. When this 
legislation was introduced in June, Debbie Mahaffy whose 
daughter Leslie was one of Paul Bernardo's victims, made a 
passionate plea to the justice committee to simply repeal section 
745. She said how disappointed she was with the half measure 
proposed by the justice minister.
<P>
	Sharon Rosenfeldt, the mother of a Clifford Olson victim spoke 
on behalf of the national group Victims of Violence saying: ``I have 
fought for 15 years for the rights of victims and I think we are all in 
this together''. Unfortunately, not the case according to this 
government.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Another mother, Darlene Boyd, whose daughter Laurie was 
raped and murdered south of Calgary, spearheaded a 35,000-name 
Calgary <I>Sun</I> petition to repeal section 745.
<P>
	These people are not speaking just for themselves. It has been 
proven with the names on the petitions and the groups that they 
represent. They speak for many of the families that have suffered 
the murders. They suffer for life, not for 15 years.
<P>
	From personal experience, this bothers me a great deal. Outside 
the House we have a plaque. That plaque is in memory and honour 
of officers who gave their lives in service to their communities.
<P>
	My cousin was married to one of the officers whose name is on 
the plaque. His name was Lenard Shakespeare. He was an officer in 
Toronto who in the line of duty happened to stumble upon an 
attempted bank robbery.
<P>
	Lenard was the kind of officer who did not believe someone had 
to use firearms in order to rectify a  situation. When this was taking 
place, he happened to spot a taxicab in front of the bank that was in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4606"> 4606 </A></B>
<P>
the process of being robbed. He thought it was his duty to warn the 
people in the cab that they were in danger.
<P>
	When Lenard walked up to the cab and put his head in the cab to 
warn the people that they had to move, the man in the back seat 
shot him. He not only shot him then, but he stepped out of the cab 
and pumped five more bullets into Lenard as he laid there without 
his gun drawn.
<P>
	Lenard's wife happened to be at our place. I was there when the 
officers knocked on the door. Members have not been through hell 
until they have to sit with the wife or the children of the victim of a 
premeditated murder.
<P>
	We try to honour these people through different organizations, 
through plaques on the Hill. However, we have a government that 
says we must look after the predator in these cases. The man who 
shot Lenard is now out in Vancouver as a businessman. Is this fair?
<P>
	For any member on the other side of the House who would like 
to know the name of my cousin, I am quite willing to give it. She 
lives in Atikokan, Ontario. They can phone her family members 
and see what they think about this joke on society that members 
call 745.
<P>
	Premeditated murder was an automatic hanging or execution at 
one time. The government of the day decided it had some hope for 
these murderers and would only make it 25 years. It was sold to the 
public as 25 years without parole. That sounded not too bad. It gave 
everybody a chance to get over the healing, if they could, and get 
on with their lives.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Now we look at 15 years. I hear that 15 years is hard on these 
people. From death to 15 years. We heard the outcry that this might 
be too much, so we passed section 745. Five years down the road, 
mark my words, if we have a Liberal or a Conservative government 
we will be looking at 10 years for premeditated murder.
<P>
	The government likes to throw out fancy numbers. It forgets to 
tell the people what the population is in the country, what the 
unemployment rate is and what the actual crime statistics are. It 
does not bother to bring forward those statistics. According to 
Statistics Canada violent crime increased 782 per cent from 1971 to 
1994. Argue that one. From 1986 to 1994 violent crime by youth 
increased 124 per cent. Many of those crimes were murders.
<P>
	We have a system which I hope people understand. Our courts 
are so overworked that we have a bargaining system. We have a 
bargaining system in which the charge will be reduced for a guilty 
plea. If we want to know why the statistics are starting to show on 
the other end, it is because we have lawyers and judges who are 
agreeing to bargain. They are not representing the people; they are  
representing themselves and their own self-interests, the same as 
the government.
<P>
	I wish everyone involved in this debate would go back to their 
constituents to get their opinions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise on 
behalf of my constituents of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to 
express our opposition to the Liberal plan to amend section 745 of 
the Criminal Code. We are talking about Bill C-45 which is the 
Liberal government's thinly veiled support of the so-called faint 
hope clause which nullifies the Criminal Code's penalty of life 
imprisonment for first degree murder.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians, including my constituents, believe that 
section 745 of the Criminal Code should be abolished because it 
serves no purpose. It is no deterrent for people who go out and 
ruthlessly take the life of another or others.
<P>
	At best, Bill C-45 introduces a few cosmetic changes to the law, 
but it does not repeal the faint hope clause. The Liberal justice 
minister is adamant in refusing to do what Canadians are asking the 
government to do.
<P>
	Canadians want to take away the right of a convicted murderer to 
have their sentence reduced. Canadians do not want convicted 
murderers to serve anything less than the sentence they have been 
given. Victims of Violence, the Canadian Police Association and 
millions of Canadians want section 745 to be repealed. However, 
the Minister of Justice, just like the separatist Bloc members, has 
ignored their pleas and are pushing Bill C-45 through the House.
<P>
	The bill makes a few amendments to section 745. First, the right 
of multiple murderers to apply for a judicial review for early parole 
will be removed. However, instead of making this provision 
retroactive so that it would apply to serial killers such as Clifford 
Olson and Paul Bernardo, who are already incarcerated, it will 
apply only to those convicted of multiple murders after the bill 
comes into effect. If a person kills people before the bill comes into 
effect they still have a chance, a faint hope, to avoid serving the full 
sentence which our Criminal Code sets out as the penalty for their 
crime. These convicted murderers can still apply for parole. They 
are exempt from the bill.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Canadians do not support giving Paul Bernardo hope. The people 
I represent want to have a binding national referendum on the 
return of capital punishment. The case of Paul Bernardo gives 
Canadians a very real reason to want a national vote on returning to 
our statute books the penalty of death. The Liberals want to give 
people like Paul Bernardo hope.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4607"> 4607 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals are giving serial killers who are already 
incarcerated a better chance to get out of their sentence than those 
who will commit multiple murders in the future. Canadians are 
finding it very difficult to believe that the Liberals think they can 
sell this as some kind of deterrent.
<P>
	This Liberal government should be giving Canadians hope. The 
Liberals should have the courage to give Canadians what we want 
and that is a binding national referendum on capital punishment. 
The Liberals would rather do nothing. That is what the Liberals do, 
nothing.
<P>
	The Liberal's campaigned on a platform featuring political 
change and promises, promises, promises, just like their promise of 
jobs, jobs, jobs. Then they say they will scrap the GST, but once 
they are elected the Liberals do nothing.
<P>
	The defence minister tackles what the Prime Minister says will 
be a difficult job of cleaning up the top echelons at national defence 
in the wake of the Somalia crisis. The Liberal defence minister 
does nothing. He hides behind the Somalia inquiry and says he can 
do nothing.
<P>
	The justice minister has done nothing to prevent serial killers 
who are already in jail from getting a chance of a reduced parole. 
The Liberal justice minister has done nothing about this.
<P>
	This bill is a sham. It is not what Canadians are asking for. The 
bill would ensure that a murderer will have to convince a superior 
court judge that their application has a reasonable chance of 
success before they would be allowed to proceed before a jury. This 
sounds like a good measure. However, considering that applicants 
have a 72 per cent success rate since May 1994 in having their 
parole ineligibility reduced, it is unlikely that a judge will find fault 
with the majority of applications and dismiss them.
<P>
	In short, the new hurdle the Minister of Justice so proudly stands 
up to defend, which the Bloc so quickly supports, is really no 
hurdle at all. We will continue to see far too many section 745 
hearings.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-45 stipulates that a section 745 jury will have to 
reach a unanimous decision before the applicant's parole 
ineligibility is reduced. At present only two-thirds of the jury need 
to find in the applicants favour. What kind of change is this? This is 
typical Liberal do nothing tinkering with our criminal justice 
system. I am sure the Liberals will be shaking each other's hands 
and patting each other on the back in an orgy of self-congratulation, 
but Canadians will not be congratulating the Liberals.
<P>
	Canadians feel that section 745 should not exist at all. What the 
Liberals are doing is absolute nonsense. This bill is nonsense. The 
Liberals are most concerned about the rights and privileges of 
criminals and they have ignored the rights of victims of crime. If 
the Liberals had  any basic simple understanding of victims' rights, 
and they do not, they would have abolished section 745.
<P>
	Canadians can see clearly that the Liberals are actually creating 
categories of good and bad murderers. If a person kills another 
person the killer will be entitled to a section 745 hearing. These are 
good murderers, according to the Minister of Justice's 
understanding. However, serial killers are not entitled to a section 
745 review because according to the justice minister's 
understanding, these are bad murderers.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	It is truly unbelievable that the minister has actually quantified 
human life in this legislation. He actually sets himself up as the one 
who can quantify whether one killing is worse than two killings. It 
is unbelievable.
<P>
	According to this bill, a murderer should be given a glimmer of 
hope if they kill only one person, but killing more than one person 
prevents a murderer from getting a review and serving something 
less than the 25 year imprisonment.
<P>
	The minister has set the quota at one life. It is reprehensible that 
this Liberal minister would sit down and draft his very own 
category of murderers, some deserving of leniency and some not. I 
submit that one life is as important as two, three or four. If the 
minister wanted to differentiate between murderers he should have 
introduced consecutive sentencing. That is the way to deal with this 
problem. It would ensure that serial killers like Clifford Olson 
would never have a chance for parole.
<P>
	Canadians want to have the criminal justice overhauled. 
Canadians want the government to stand up for victims instead of 
standing up for criminals. It is time for the abolition of section 745. 
The Liberals should be ashamed that they have not repealed this 
section. They should be ashamed that they have ignored the views 
of millions of Canadians, in particular the views of victims' rights 
groups.
<P>
	I cannot support this bill. My constituents cannot support this 
bill. My party cannot support this bill. We stand here today 
speaking for Canadians and standing up for the rights of victims 
and their families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to Bill C-45. 
This bill deals with section 745 of the Criminal Code. Section 745 
is not a bad law that needs changing. It is a bad law that needs to be 
turfed.
<P>
	Several experts have spoken about section 745 and have spoken 
about Bill C-45. I do not propose to this House that I am expert of 
justice matters. I have many colleagues who have far more 
knowledge in this area than I do and they have spoken very 
eloquently after extensive research on the issue. We know that 
officials from police forces have spoken about section 745. They  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4608"> 4608 </A></B>
<P>
have far more knowledge than I do on this. They have talked about 
the fact that section 745 needs to be repealed. I respect the views of 
my colleagues, I respect the views of the police.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, provincial officials have spoken about 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. They also are very 
knowledgeable and expert in the area with which they are dealing. 
They are the attorneys general of some of the provinces.
<P>
	On May 11, 1996 the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> reported that during a meeting, 
the attorneys general of Manitoba, Alberta and Ontario pushed for 
the total repeal of section 745, while Saskatchewan and Quebec 
argued that it should be amended.
<P>
	Harnick from Ontario and Evans from Alberta said they would 
like to see the screening of first degree murderers for early release 
be done by the justice minister's office rather than the parole board 
or a provincial judge. The provinces were concerned about Bill 
C-45. They thought it would be a financial burden and an 
imposition on their judicial system as it will be the provincial 
judges who review and determine which first degree murderers' 
745 applications will be referred to a jury.
<P>
	This underlines the fact that there was not proper consultation 
between the federal government and the provinces when the 
government introduced Bill C-45. This is not uncommon. We have 
seen several examples of the federal government failing to work 
co-operatively with the provinces within confederation. Here we 
have another example.
<P>
	It is interesting that the financial agreements with the provinces 
and the territories expired on March 31 and to date the justice 
minister has only signed agreements with a couple of the Atlantic 
provinces. There is a total lack of co-operation between the federal 
government and the provinces and Bill C-45 to repeal section 745 
of the Criminal Code is a prime example.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I do not have extensive and deep knowledge of the justice system 
but I certainly have heard very capable critics and very 
knowledgeable experts suggest this bill is bad, it should not be 
passed and that section 745 of the Criminal Code should be 
repealed.
<P>
	I appreciate what others have said but I want to tell the House 
what I am hearing from constituents and from ordinary Canadians 
like myself who are not experts in the area but who may have very 
strong feelings about the justice system and what is wrong with it.
<P>
	Reform MPs have learned to be excellent listeners. I would 
encourage members opposite who are pushing this type of 
legislation to take a few moments and actually listen to what their 
constituents are saying, what the people on the street, the people on 
the farms, are saying about section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I want them to listen to the victims' rights groups that have 
stated categorically that they are opposed to any tinkering with 
section 745, and are calling for the repeal of that section. They do 
not support Bill C-45.
<P>
	I ask them to listen to the taunting of convicted killers such as 
Clifford Olson who are making a mockery of the justice system, 
that we would even consider a faint hope clause. They are 
becoming notorious because of the lack of action by the Liberal 
government. It is really ridiculous when we see the publicity they 
are getting simply because the Liberal government wants to put 
criminals' rights ahead of victims' rights and not correct the justice 
system.
<P>
	I hear from the local RCMP officers. They certainly do not 
support section 745 of the Criminal Code. They do not support 
changing the act to have two degrees of killers, those who are 
serious killers and should not be given a faint hope clause and those 
who are not quite so serious because they have just killed one 
person and they deserve a faint hope clause. They have been very 
outspoken in their opposition to the Liberal government's 
initiative.
<P>
	My constituents have no use whatsoever for a faint hope clause 
which would allow premeditated killers to get out early on any type 
of parole. I even hear from people who live in Liberal members' 
ridings. They are not very happy with their MPs.
<P>
	I am happy that the member for Prince Albert-Churchill River 
is sitting in the House. The other day I met one of his constituents 
on the plane when I was flying here. His constituent recognized me 
and began to talk to me. He was concerned about justice and crime. 
He talked about the high rate of crime in the Prince Albert area and 
the fact that his member did not seem to be very concerned about it. 
He told me quite frankly that his member would not be re-elected.
<P>
	I thought this person is probably not a Liberal, so we have to take 
his words with a grain of salt. He may have been playing politics. 
However, he told me the feeling in the Prince Albert area was 
pretty widespread that the member did not take criminal issues 
seriously. Of course, he has a federal penitentiary in his riding so 
the issue of crime and convicted killers being released on early 
parole is an important issue in his constituency.
<P>
	I read in the paper the other day that it looked as if the hon. 
member for Prince Albert-Churchill River was going to be 
challenged for the nomination by someone in his own party. Even 
his own people are not very happy with his performance.
<P>
	I suggest there could be broad support for the member beyond 
partisanship. There are Liberal members who actually do try to 
stick up for their constituents and represent them. But this member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4609"> 4609 </A></B>
<P>
does not seem to be  one because his own party, for reasons I do not 
know-maybe justice issues, maybe some other issues-feels their 
member is not doing a good job.
<P>
	All I know is that everything I have heard from his riding, and I 
have heard these complaints for a couple of years, indicates the 
member is in real trouble in his riding and may very well not be 
re-elected. Liberal Party people are concerned about the 
performance of this government for a number of reasons. The 
trouble with Liberals is that they cannot admit they are wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> You're third in the polls in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They can heckle in the House-I am being 
heckled right now-but they cannot admit they are wrong. They do 
not know how to apologize when they are wrong and do not correct 
themselves when they get off course.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Prior to the last election, the Prime Minister said he had the 
people and he had the plan. One of his people is the hon. member 
for Prince Albert-Churchill River. He is the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice and is supposed to be a 
heavyweight on justice matters. However, he does not seem to have 
the support of his own constituency, of his own party in his own 
riding. One has to wonder where they have gone wrong.
<P>
	As I pointed out, it seems fairly obvious that the Liberals cannot 
admit they have made mistakes, have not addressed the seriousness 
of criminal and justice matters, have been totally off course on the 
issue of section 745 of the Criminal Code and are totally off base 
on this bill, Bill C-45.
<P>
	We have debated these justice issues in the House for a long 
time. We talked about repealing section 745 even before one of the 
colleagues of the Liberal members brought forward a private 
member's bill, which had broad support in the House, for repeal of 
the section.
<P>
	However, the Liberal hierarchy on the front benches-I suppose 
the parliamentary secretary would be a supporter of this-decided 
to sidetrack its own member's private member's bill. Of course he 
was kicked out of caucus because he did not see eye to eye with the 
Liberals and they derailed his private member's bill which actually 
had the support of the entire House. It was approved by the elected 
body.
<P>
	That private member's bill would have brought in a more strict 
justice system, which was actually what the people wanted. The 
people of Kindersley-Lloydminster want that. The people of 
Prince Albert-Churchill River want that. But that would never do. 
That would mean that people like Clifford Olson and other first 
degree murderers would not have a faint hope. That would 
probably alleviate some of the opportunities for people in the legal 
profession to generate more income for their law firms. Who 
knows all the reasoning behind the Liberals who determined that 
their colleague's bill should not be passed.
<P>
	I would like to hear some of the explanations from the other side 
why they dumped that private member's bill and brought in this bill 
which does not do the job. It does not repeal section 745 of the 
Criminal Code but provides special status for some murderers and 
less status for others. It is the same old repetitive story: special 
status for some and let us deal more harshly with others. In this 
case it is special status for murderers of one person but does not 
provide that same special status for murderers of more than one 
person. It is really silly when one stops to think about it.
<P>
	It is time for some common sense to emanate from this House. 
We have to start seeing some of it from the other side. We have 
been speaking on behalf of Canadians on these issues but it has 
been falling on deaf ears in the justice department and on deaf ears 
in almost every ministry on the other side. It has to stop. Our 
country is too important to play games with Canadians and not 
abide by their wishes any longer.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf 
of my constituents in Kindersley-Lloydminster. I just hope that 
for a change colleagues opposite will listen to what has been said, 
will recognize the error of their ways and correct them very 
quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to 
have the opportunity to talk about a criminal justice bill. It is not 
something I do very often, but certainly the constituents of my 
riding have indicated very clearly that this is a major concern of 
theirs. It does not matter at what level you talk or to whom you 
speak, very clearly they state that they are concerned about this 
issue.
<P>
	Therefore I am pleased to have the opportunity to go into this in 
a little bit of detail at least, again not as an expert but certainly as a 
concerned citizen, representing my constituents.
<P>
	The public are disgusted with the criminal justice system. They 
feel that too many Liberal governments, whether they are called 
Liberal or not does not seem to matter, but it seems that once 
Ottawa fever sets into people when they come down here that all of 
a sudden they start thinking about the criminal. They very quickly 
lose sight of who we should really be concerned about and that is 
the victims of these crimes. Certainly the opinion is that our justice 
minister is very soft on crime. He is so liberal that he is more 
liberal than all the other Liberals who have been responsible for our 
criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	It does not matter what area we talk about, the concerns are over 
the whole range. Let us start off with the Young Offenders Act. 
Everybody is upset about that.  I have had the opportunity to speak 
to people across the country. Not once did I go into a presentation 
and question period when someone did not ask about the Young 
Offenders Act. It might be senior citizen who is now afraid to go 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4610"> 4610 </A></B>
<P>
out because of the young hoodlums they perceive to be out there 
and who may be a threat to them.
<P>
	It could be a handicapped person in my riding, which I think is 
pretty peaceful. It is certainly a riding I am proud of. I have lived 
there a number of years. In a period of one week two handicapped 
people were attacked by young offenders and sent to hospital. One 
severely handicapped lady received a broken arm by these young 
offenders.
<P>
	The police will say that when there are break and enters they do 
not bother going anymore because they just cannot handle them all. 
This is a major issue. It is part of the whole problem with the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	We can talk about the parole system and sex offenders who are 
put back out on the streets. Some sex offenders do not even have to 
take treatment. We are told they cannot be cured and yet they are 
put out on the streets. Again the Liberal policy is ``well, let us hope 
they do not reoffend''.
<P>
	I have a letter from a constituent: ``It has come to my attention 
that prisoners are being released on parole based on their behaviour 
inside an institution, not on the crime they committed. This is a 
grave miscarriage of justice when the crimes committed are of a 
sexual nature. How many inmates have daily access to sexually 
assault children? I hope none. If released on to our streets, the 
pedophile has unlimited access to our children. We should not be 
required to lock our children away to keep them safe from sex 
offenders''. This is just another cry for help to change the system.
<P>
	Our parole boards are made up of political hacks with high 
salaries. They are not professional people. They are not there to try 
to provide treatment, to provide protection for citizens. They 
certainly are not interested in the victims.
<P>
	In Bill C-45 we have even created categories. If a person kills 
once, premeditated murder, it is one thing. He or she would be 
eligible for parole. If a person kills more than once, then he or she 
is a little more serious criminal. The victims did not have that 
choice. The victims were not given a choice of how serious a 
murder was. Murder is murder is murder. First degree murder is 
planned, premeditated murder.
<P>
	There is no standard for sentencing. Often the punishment does 
not fit the crime. I read an interesting article from the Innisfail 
paper two weeks ago when I was at home. There had been a 
break-in at an auction mart. The person was caught and the owner 
of the auction mart wrote a letter to the paper and said: ``I have no  
confidence in the criminal justice system that the fine or the 
minimum sentence this person will receive will in any way stop 
him from additional crime''. His suggestion in the article was that 
the true way to deal with this person would to be to have him come 
to work at the auction mart for three months. His job would be to 
clean out cattle liners that arrive day after day. He said that after 
three months of cleaning cattle liners he doubted very much that 
this person would break in to an auction mart again.
<P>
	We have to look at things like this. We have to look at 
punishment that fits the crime. For first degree murder what should 
the punishment be? Is 15 years the price we put on a life? Is that 
what we say is enough? It is premeditated. I have heard so many 
speeches in the House about this subject. They talk about murders. 
They say that someone who was in a traffic accident should get 
parole. We are talking about premeditated first degree murder.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The fact that they should not have a faint hope is by far and away 
the majority point of view in the country. This law does not go far 
enough. It is middle of the road liberalism. It is liberalism at its 
very worst. We are talking about first degree premeditated murder. 
Bill C-45 is soft.
<P>
	We have to get back to the punishment fitting the crime. We have 
to get back to thinking about the victims. We have to think about 
the victims who are going to have to relive the crime in just 15 
years. We must think about the victims.
<P>
	I am sure I am not unique in the amount of mail I receive on the 
criminal justice system. This is a letter that I received, not from a 
constituent, but from someone in B.C.:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You as our government have seen fit to enact a faint hope clause which gives 
convicted murderers the opportunity to be released and kill again. It is my opinion 
that you as our government should remove this faint hope clause for all serial killers 
and all murderers that torture, mutilate or sexually assault their victims, as parole 
boards are releasing all murderers that apply for early release under this clause.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have been told that up to 80 per cent of the applications are 
successful.
<P>
	The letter continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is also my opinion that Clifford Olson should never have the faint hope of being 
released on to our streets. That individual, in my opinion, should be given a lethal 
injection. I would not have any objection to doing that job myself.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a pretty strong statement, but that is what Canadians are 
saying out there about first degree premeditated murder. That is 
what we are talking about.
<P>
	We should look at the Liberal record. What we will find is a great 
deal of underachievement. There is a great deal of deceit and 
deception being practised, of saying one thing and meaning 
something quite different, of not really doing what they say they 
will do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4611"> 4611 </A></B>
<P>
	In the criminal justice system we might talk to the justice 
ministers of Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the 
Northwest Territories and Yukon and all of them will say they were 
not consulted by the justice minister.
<P>
	Mr. Scott Newark, director of the Canadian Police Association, 
openly said he has not been consulted and neither has his 
membership. There is a total lack of consultation.
<P>
	I could go on to talk about the broken promises of the GST and 
no tax increases. There have been $26 billion in increased taxes. 
We can talk about the threats to health care and the threats to 
pensions. Those are all coming from the deceit and lies of the 
Liberal government. That is exactly where they are coming from.
<P>
	We can look at committees. Just this morning I sat in a 
committee and watched the member for Edmonton North vote for a 
Bloc member to be the vice-chair of the committee because he had 
to.
<P>
	This is a government made up of underachievers who do not 
listen to the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-45. Unfortunately, I am going to have to 
speak in opposition to this piece of legislation. Once again, as my 
hon. friend from Red Deer pointed out, the government has fallen 
well short of the mark. It has fallen well short of where Canadians 
want it to go.
<P>
	It is the primary purpose of the justice system to ensure that 
justice is first applied and, second, that it is applied evenly. I want 
to talk about that aspect of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	One of the strange anomalies of the bill is that it will grant those 
people already in prison, who were convicted of heinous crimes, 
the right to apply for early release. This is a continuation of the 
so-called faint hope clause.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	People like Clifford Olson, Paul Bernardo, Daniel Gingras will 
have the option under this piece of legislation to continue to come 
before the public to make their case to be allowed out.
<P>
	Have we, in this country, not learned that people like Clifford 
Olson crave that type of attention? What right do we as legislators 
have to allow these people to come forward and continue to wreak 
havoc in the lives of the victims?
<P>
	When I talk about victims in the case of Clifford Olson, I am 
talking about the parents of the 11 children he murdered. Why do 
we as legislators have a right to allow him to come forward and say 
the sorts of things  that he says in the media to really continue to 
perpetuate a crime in the lives of those parents? That is ridiculous.
<P>
	What is the government thinking about when it allows that to 
happen? Obviously it has forgotten the purpose of the justice 
system. The justice system is not to serve the criminal, it is to serve 
the law-abiding citizens. It is to serve the rights of victims.
<P>
	I have a friend here, the member for Fraser Valley East, who 
brought down a piece of private member's legislation that received 
wide support in the House. It called for a victims bill of rights.
<P>
	That is the appropriate type of legislation to be bringing in. Why 
in the world are we bringing in what amounts to a criminals bill of 
rights? Why are we granting criminals more rights? It is absolutely 
contrary to everything Canadians are telling us. It is contrary to 
everything we know in our own hearts, yet the government 
continues to bring down flawed pieces of legislation like Bill C-45. 
It is absolutely ridiculous. It is counter-intuitive. I do not 
understand it at all.
<P>
	To personalize this a little more, I must tell the story of how 
Daniel Gingras wreaked havoc in my riding several years ago. 
People may remember the case where he was out on a pass after 
having murdered a person. He murdered a fellow because he did 
not like the look of his face, according to his own testimony.
<P>
	He murdered someone and was subsequently released on a day 
pass, because it was his birthday, in Edmonton. He overpowered 
the guard and eventually made his way to Medicine Hat, my riding. 
He took the shoe laces from a woman and strangled her with them 
because, according to his own testimony, she was crying like a cow.
<P>
	These people are scarcely human. They are hubris as far as I am 
concerned. I do not understand how we can allow these people any 
rights at all. Yet the government has brought down a piece of 
legislation that will allow people like Daniel Gingras and others of 
his ilk to come before not only the courts, which is bad enough, but 
before the public and to again have their say. They will stir up 
many bad memories.
<P>
	That is contrary to what just people in this country believe. It 
really makes me wonder what possibly goes on in the Department 
of Justice when they think up pieces of legislation like this.
<P>
	People across the way will say we have to be compassionate. 
Compassionate should mean compassionate to everybody, not just 
to criminals. When people talk about letting loose one virtue like 
compassion without a counter-virtue like justice, then they will 
simply allow some of the worst things possible to go on. That is 
exactly what is happening with this piece of legislation.
<P>
	What could have happened? I mentioned a minute ago my friend 
from Fraser Valley East bringing down victims rights legislation. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4612"> 4612 </A></B>
<P>
That is the sort of thing we should have in this country. A lot of 
people ask why life does not mean life in this country. Even a life 
sentence in this country usually only amounts to 25 years where 
there is eligibility for parole after that.
<P>
	Many people in this country want to go further. They want life 
meaning life, but in the wake of the Bernardo trial there were many 
people, as there are still today, believing we need to have a 
plebiscite, a referendum on capital punishment.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Why is it that people such as Paul Bernardo, Daniel Gingras and 
Clifford Olson can murder perfectly innocent people, children in 
some cases, and be allowed to live out their lives when they know 
that their victims will never ever see another day? That is so wrong 
yet people across the way allow it to happen. People across the 
way, who I know in their own hearts do not believe in this 
legislation, will stand up and vote for it simply because it is the 
condition, the price that they pay if they want to stay in that party.
<P>
	At some point principle should mean more than just sticking 
around in a party so that you can possibly get re-elected. If you 
believe in principle you should be willing to jettison all that party 
stuff and stand up for your constituents. That is what members 
across the way have to do.
<P>
	I urge all people who are watching today, and I know there are 
many people watching out there, to let their local MPs know that 
Bill C-45 simply is not adequate. In fact, not only is it not adequate, 
it is actually dangerous. It allows all those people who have 
committed murder in the past to come back and wreak havoc in the 
future and I think that is wrong.
<P>
	This legislation tells me the government has not yet gotten the 
message from the constituents and even from some of its own MPs. 
People out there want the problem of crime dealt with in a serious 
way and they want people to get their just deserts when they 
commit a crime. In some cases that means a life penalty and in 
other cases I would suggest it means the death penalty.
<P>
	During the last election campaign I remember going door to door 
and probably every member in the House ran into this. If you were 
out after dark very often it was difficult to get women to come to 
the door.
<P>
	I know members across the way will say: ``Have you not heard 
the statistics that crime is going down?'' I can tell you that people 
feel very threatened in their homes. I remember how difficult it was 
to get people to come to the door, especially women, and there is a 
good reason for that. Let us not cast aside their concerns and say 
that they just do not know what they are talking about. Let us start 
introducing some laws that have an effect not only in dealing with 
crime but in restoring the confidence of people who are afraid to go 
out on their own.
<P>
	Nowadays there are bars on the windows of houses and 
businesses. But in some cases, like the women's prison in 
Edmonton, we do not even have bars on the jails any more. They 
are trying to rectify that now after there were some real problems 
which actually led to the death of an inmate. Certainly people 
should not feel they have to be prisoners in their own homes simply 
because we have a government that refuses to get tough with 
criminals.
<P>
	Let us face it. There is not an MP in this House who has not 
heard over and over again from their constituents that people 
cannot understand why the government has not been tougher on 
crime. It is not just this government, it was the Tory government 
before. The Tories were the ones who brought in that ridiculous 
Young Offenders Act. That is another issue which we will save for 
another day. It is not just this government, it is several governments 
in succession.
<P>
	I hope members across the way will find it in their hearts to stand 
up for the innocent victims and citizens out there instead of 
criminals in the next go round.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a beautiful fall day like today members, those 
Canadians in the gallery here and those Canadians who are viewing 
this on television will know that the fall colours all across our 
country are just starting to change.
<P>
	If you were in my home of Edmonton, Alberta today and you 
were at the north end of High Level Bridge, the bridge that goes 
across the North Saskatchewan River, you would see a park at the 
northwest corner of High Level Bridge. In that park is a statue of a 
police officer. The police officer has his arm around a young lad of 
about seven or eight years of age. The statue of that police officer is 
pointing across the river at the University of Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Every time I drive by that location I am reminded of Constable 
Ezio Faraone. That park and statue are dedicated to Constable Ezio 
Faraone. Constable Faraone was a young policeman who was cut 
down in the prime of his life by someone who had very little to 
contribute to our society and over the course of his life had 
contributed nothing. He cut down a young man with much promise, 
a young man who had dedicated part of his life to guiding other 
young people. That is why that statue and that park are so poignant: 
because of the contrast of the two lives; one full of richness, 
promise and hope and the other life for whatever reason generally 
speaking of incarceration and despair.
<P>
	We do not know what led to the incarceration of the perpetrator 
of the horrendous murder of Ezio Faraone and we are not 
suggesting that life is fair and that everybody starts with an equal 
chance. However the fact of the matter remains that there are very 
few of us in our country who do not appreciate the difference 
between right and wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4613"> 4613 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem in our country is not so much that people do not 
appreciate the difference between right and wrong, but we are not 
as a nation prepared to accept the consequences for having done 
wrong. That is really the nibs of it. We see this every day in our 
country. People elected or people appointed to positions of 
responsibility, authority and leadership abdicate that leadership 
role or that role of responsibility by sloughing off accountability 
for their actions to someone else or by blaming it on some incident 
in life that caused them to do whatever they did.
<P>
	The fact is that the death of Constable Ezio Faraone, the snuffing 
out of that life of promise, of that young leader of men who was 
working on behalf of all of the citizens of Edmonton and of the 
larger community of our nation, was in part because of the actions 
of this House of Commons. It is the actions of this House of 
Commons and the laws that are promulgated herein which set the 
stage for what is likely to happen in our country.
<P>
	In my opinion there is a direct link between the death of 
Constable Ezio Faraone at the hands of a convict on parole on the 
streets of Edmonton and the Solicitor General of Canada on 
October 6, 1972 who stood in the House and stated, using these 
words which can be checked in <I>Hansard</I>: ``From this day forward 
rehabilitation will be the driving raison d'être of our criminal 
justice system. It will not be the protection of society. It will be the 
rehabilitation of prisoners''. From that day forward, 24 years ago 
almost to the day just a couple of weeks from now, the criminal 
justice system and Correctional Services Canada have had to focus 
on the rehabilitation of prisoners.
<P>
	That is not all bad. The vast majority of people who commit a 
crime or break the social contract that we as citizens have one with 
another are worthy of rehabilitation and should be given a second 
chance. Yesterday the member for Kingston and the Islands, who 
has a major prison in his constituency, spoke long and eloquently 
about the need and the reason for compassion, about how it is 
honourable and correct to turn the other cheek. We as 
parliamentarians have a responsibility that goes beyond ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	When a perpetrator kills somebody or commits any major 
crime-we are now talking about capital offences in particular, 
murder-the charge is not written as victim v. defendant, it is the 
Queen, Regina v. defendant. This is because when someone kills 
another citizen, the crime is not only against the victim but also 
against the community. It is against the nation. That is why when a 
crime is committed it is the crown in opposition to the perpetrator.
<P>
	When we gathered under the oak tree, or whatever tree we 
gathered under, as human beings to suggest and to agree one with 
another that we were going to give up some of our individual 
freedoms in order to ensure the  greater good would be served, we 
then one with another created a social contract. That social contract 
meant that we would not have the personal liberty that animals do 
to kill whatever they choose for whatever reasons. We were going 
to conduct ourselves in a fitting manner. We willingly gave up 
some of our freedoms in order to enjoy the greater good.
<P>
	The populations of various countries, including our country, 
vested with parliamentarians the authority and the responsibility to 
frame that social contract, to give it meaning, to give it foundation, 
to make it work. Therefore when we are called upon to generate the 
laws by which we will govern ourselves, we must use not only 
compassion but reason.
<P>
	Our laws must have strength. They must state that certain crimes 
will be dealt with in the harshest possible manner. We are not 
talking about manslaughter; we are not talking about crimes of 
passion; we are not talking about a momentary fit of madness. We 
are talking about cold blooded murder. We are talking about an 
occasion where someone will take a hostage and kill a prison guard 
or policemen who are on the frontlines to defend us day after day 
after day.
<P>
	We are not talking, as members opposite have said from time to 
time, of everybody who is in jail or of everyone who commits 
murder. We are talking specifically about those criminals who have 
been charged and convicted of first degree murder. This gives the 
courts many avenues of leniency. Not everyone who commits 
murder is charged with first degree murder. As a matter of fact, the 
vast majority is not.
<P>
	When someone commits an offence that is judged by the legal 
community to be first degree murder, that person should be 
prepared to accept the consequences, which brings us right back to 
my first words. The problem is not that our society does not have 
the means and the wherewithal to maintain order and discipline. 
The problem is that we as a society do not have the discipline to 
accept the consequences of our actions.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore if someone is prepared to commit first degree murder 
they should do so in the full knowledge that the sure consequence is 
that they will spend 25 years behind bars, not 24 years and not 26 
years, 25 years. Twenty-five years was the quid pro quo for getting 
rid of the death penalty. We will not put anyone to death, but the 
people who commit first degree murder would do so in the full 
knowledge that by breaking the social contract, one with another, 
they will pay the full penalty.
<P>
	That is why I would urge members opposite to support the 
original bill by the member for York South-Weston which would 
scrap section 745, which was was wanted by virtually every victim 
group and every police group, and not accept this watered down 
version of Bill C-45 presented by the Minister of Justice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4614"> 4614 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish I could say that it was a pleasure for me to rise 
today and participate in this debate on Bill C-45, but I find it is 
just the latest example of this minister's and this government's 
half baked justice policy that they are holding up to the people 
of Canada as a way of getting tough with crime when it does 
exactly the opposite.
<P>
	However, I do appreciate the opportunity to point out to this 
government, on behalf of my constituents of Prince George-Peace 
River and on behalf of the majority of Canadians, that section 745 
of the Criminal Code should be abolished.
<P>
	I believe that Bill C-45 simply introduces more cosmetic 
changes. Over the debate of the last couple of days in this place on 
this piece of legislation-and I use that term charitably-many of 
my colleagues in the Reform Party have said that it is high time this 
government started listening to the people. Of course when that 
was said what we heard from the other side, amidst howls of 
heckling, was that the government is indeed listening to the people. 
I question that.
<P>
	A poll was recently conducted and completed in my riding, 
which is virtually the entire northeastern corner of British 
Columbia. One of the questions the people were asked in this 
scientific poll was: ``We are interested in knowing how you feel the 
federal government is doing with respect to criminal justice 
matters''.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, 56 per cent of the people said they felt the 
federal government was doing a poor job reforming the criminal 
justice system; 11 per cent more were uncertain as to how it was 
doing. Clearly two-thirds of the people of my riding feel either that 
the federal government is doing a poor job of addressing criminal 
justice issues or are uncertain as to exactly what it is attempting to 
do.
<P>
	I view that as a clear indication that the people of my riding and I 
believe the people of Canada are growing increasingly concerned, 
despite what we hear from the government that crime rates are 
falling and the incidence of violent crime is going down. What I 
hear from the people as I travel throughout my riding and across 
the country is that they are increasingly concerned about crime.
<P>
	Victims of Violence, CAVEAT, the Canadian Police Association 
and the majority of Canadians want section 745 repealed. It is that 
simple. I find it appalling that this justice minister and this 
government would not listen to, for example, the Canadian Police 
Association on this issue or on the issue of a referendum on capital 
punishment. Yet, during the debate on the gun control issue they 
said that the major reason why they were bringing in this 
preposterous gun control legislation was because the police 
association wanted it.
<P>
	The justice minister conveniently uses the police association and 
its resolutions where it suits him but does not listen to them on 
other issues. He has ignored the pleas of these groups and he is 
pushing Bill C-45 through the House.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The bill makes a few amendments to section 745, and these have 
been recounted over the past few days. First, the right of multiple 
murderers to apply for a judicial review for early parole will be 
removed. However, instead of making this provision retroactive, 
the new measure will only apply to those convicted of multiple 
murders after Bill C-45 comes into effect. Therefore the minister 
has done nothing to prevent serial killers who are presently 
incarcerated from getting their day in court and getting a chance at 
a reduced parole ineligibility period.
<P>
	Second, the bill will ensure that the murderer will have to 
convince a superior court judge that their application has a 
reasonable chance of success before they will be allowed to 
proceed to appear before a jury. This sounds like a good measure, 
but considering that applicants have had a 72 per cent success rate 
since May of 1994 in having their parole ineligibility reduced, it is 
unlikely that a judge will find fault with a majority of these 
applications and dismiss them.
<P>
	Yesterday my hon. colleague from Wild Rose referred to this not 
as the faint hope clause but as the sure bet clause. He hit the nail 
right on the head.
<P>
	In short, the new hurdle is really no hurdle at all. We will 
continue to see far too many section 745 hearings.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-45 stipulates that a section 745 jury will have to 
reach a unanimous decision before the applicant's parole 
ineligibility is reduced. At present only two-thirds of the jury need 
to find in the applicant's favour. However, in my view the bottom 
line is that section 745 should not exist at all.
<P>
	Section 745 was introduced as part of Bill C-84 in 1976 by the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who was serving as 
solicitor general at that time. Bill C-84 abolished capital 
punishment and established two categories for murder, first and 
second degree. However, not many people noticed the inclusion of 
section 745 in their review of the original bill. As a result, we have 
had to wrestle with this provision for some 20 years.
<P>
	Many Canadians believe that 25 years before being eligible for 
parole is not a suitable sentence for first degree murder. In fact, 
polls have consistently shown that Canadians favour a return to the 
death penalty for those who are convicted of first degree murder.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
said that Reformers were attempting to instil a hate pattern in 
Canadians by advocating a return to the death penalty. In my riding 
of Prince George-Peace River, when I did a poll, 85 per  cent of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4615"> 4615 </A></B>
<P>
the people favoured the return of the death penalty for cold 
blooded, premeditated first degree murder. That is what we are 
talking about today. We should be very clear about that.
<P>
	On May 14 of last spring we had one hour of debate on my 
private member's Bill C-218, which would have brought about the 
reintroduction of capital punishment. One hour of debate. That was 
all the government deemed the debate on capital punishment was 
worthy of.
<P>
	Last Friday one of my colleagues from Nanaimo-Cowichan 
introduced private member's Bill C-261 and there was an hour of 
debate on a referendum on capital punishment. In other words, it 
would have let the people speak. The government does not want to 
let the people speak on this and many other issues.
<P>
	Government members know that people are outraged that 
murderers are given a glimmer of hope after serving only 15 years. 
What glimmer of hope did those murderers give to their victims? 
Speaking of victims, section 745 does them an incredible 
disservice. The whole judicial review process causes the 
revictimization of families and at times of entire communities.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Gary Rosenfeldt, whose son was murdered by Clifford Olson, 
said the whole section is an insult to victims. What is coming from 
the Liberal government? It is simply window dressing with respect 
to dealing with section 745. This really comes as no surprise. The 
Liberals are constantly promoting the rights and privileges of 
criminals and constantly mollycoddling the very worst people in 
our society while victims are completely ignored.
<P>
	I see my time is almost up. I could go on all day talking about the 
government's lack of commitment to the victims of crime. The real 
point here is that the entire misguided and sad policy in the area of 
justice over the past quarter century by this government and 
governments preceding it has been built on a false premise that 
everyone in society is basically a good person. Everyone can be 
rehabilitated in the eyes of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands. It is always the fault of society that they go astray. It is 
always the fault of the parents or because they are poor.
<P>
	There are some in our society who are inherently evil. That is a 
reality. I believe the majority of Canadians know that and it is why 
they want to see section 745 repealed. That is why I am voting 
against this piece of trash, Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-45 and to register my opposition to the 
bill as presented by the Minister of Justice. I certainly would like to 
concur with the closing comments of my colleague for British 
Columbia who said the entire misguided policy of the government 
is built on a false premise. That it absolutely true.
<P>
	Let us take a look. He talked about the original section in the 
Criminal Code, section 745, not to be confused with the Bill C-45. 
Section 745 was called the faint last hope. It was brought in on the 
premise that perhaps these criminals who had been convicted of 
one murder, two murders or many murders would in prison change 
their ways, be sorry for their deeds, rehabilitate themselves and be 
eligible to be turned loose into society and society would have to 
fend for itself and protect itself from these killers who are now 
back in society once more.
<P>
	The faint last hope became the open door that after 15 years 
anybody who applied for parole was virtually assured of getting 
parole. These Liberals and left leaning socialists believed: ``The 
poor guy has been locked up for 15 years. How can we do this? 
That is terrible. We should let him back out into society''. Back 
into society so that he can do it again. There have been umpteen 
situations where he has done it again.
<P>
	Many times we have seen headlines in the papers that another 
family has been destroyed, another murder has been committed, 
another innocent Canadian who just unfortunately happened to be 
in the wrong place at the wrong time is now dead because of this 
government's desire to let these people back on to the streets 
because they are sorry for those folks because they have been 
locked up for 15 years.
<P>
	The information I have is that after 15 years when the parole 
hearing comes up and the families that have suffered the tragedy of 
having one of their members murdered are devastated by having 
the whole thing dredged up once more. Surely the families of 
innocent Canadians are the people who should be protected. People 
should be able to walk the streets without fear rather than worrying 
about one, two, three or fifty killers who are locked up and should 
stay that way, just because the bleeding heart socialists think it is 
time to let them out after 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley West introduced a victim's bill 
of rights. He said, and many Canadians agree with him, that it is 
time to put the rights of individuals who have not committed a 
crime ahead of those people who have forfeited their rights because 
they have committed the most heinous of crimes, murder.
<P>
	It does not take a great deal of mental effort to say that the people 
who have not committed a crime should have preferential 
treatment over those who have. I do not think it is a mental leap of 
logic, but obviously it is beyond the government's capability to 
understand that it is the Canadian people who have to be protected. 
Innocent people deserve to be able to walk this land without fear 
rather than worrying about murderers let loose by the government 
because of the bleeding heart policies of saying 15 years has been a 
long time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4616"> 4616 </A></B>
<P>
	When someone is found guilty of first degree murder the 
sentence is usually 25 years without parole and after that the 
person is on parole for the rest of his or her life. Therefore a 
convicted killer is never completely free but after 25 years he or 
she may return to society.
<P>
	It seems rather strange to me that a judge who has been in 
command of all the facts, has listened to all the testimony, has 
heard the dreadful unfolding of events, has seen the families and 
the tragedy that has been created and has decided in his wisdom 
that this person who is convicted of the crime should spend a 
minimum of 25 years in jail before being eligible for parole, and 
the government wants to interfere with the courts and say the 
decision made at that time in full knowledge of all the facts is now 
found to be too harsh and lets these people out after 15 years.
<P>
	Why is the government siding with the criminal and not siding 
with society? That is the issue. If a judge, in full command of the 
facts decided that this crime warranted 25 years, then surely we 
should listen to this learned man who was put in the position of 
making this types of judgment.
<P>
	The government turns around and second guesses. Government 
interference in the judicial system makes it a mess. For example, 
Karla Homolka, in retrospect got a sweetheart deal because an 
agreement was made between the government and the criminal. 
When the facts came out Canadians were outraged and rightly so. 
Government should stay out of the administration of justice and 
leave it to the courts where the courts have the authority to make 
the decisions. If the courts say 25 years I go along with them.
<P>
	We are dealing with Bill C-45 in the fall of 1996 which is three 
years after the election. The government has had three years to deal 
with this issue. It seems rather ironic that it waited until the fall of 
1996, when people like Clifford Olson of British Columbia is now 
eligible to apply for parole. It could have brought in this bill in the 
spring of 1996. It could have brought in this bill in the fall of 1995. 
It could have brought in the bill in the spring of 1995. It wanted to 
wait until Clifford Olson had the opportunity to apply for parole 
before it shut it down. The government could have stopped it but it 
did not. That is indicative of the bleeding heart type of attitude of 
the government.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	It is an insult to Canadians that this could actually happen. Like 
my hon. colleague from British Columbia who spoke before I could 
speak further. This bill is too little, too late. The government should 
have repealed section 745 many years ago.
<P>
	Reformers are not dealing with statistics. We are dealing with 
real people. We are dealing with the tragedy and misery and the 
hurt of families who have suffered needlessly. I feel a great deal of 
compassion for them. I have no compassion whatsoever for the 
criminals who committed these heinous crimes. I have no 
compassion for the government which will not do something to 
stop these murderers from being back out on the street.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to add my comments to the debate on the third and 
final reading of Bill C-45.
<P>
	The bill was advertised as the response by the Liberal justice 
minister to the demands of the Canadian public that section 745 of 
the Criminal Code which allows convicted, cold-blooded, 
premeditated murderers to apply to be let back into society after 
serving only 15 years of a life sentence.
<P>
	A large number of people have signed petitions, clipped 
coupons, written letters, made phone calls and otherwise in a 
democratic society indicated that they wanted this section of the 
Criminal Code to be done away with. The justice minister promised 
that it would be done away with. He made representations to 
victims' groups and to the parents and other loved ones of 
murdered Canadians that he would respond to their demand that 
these convicted killers would not be let back into society.
<P>
	What do we find has actually been done? Again, it is typical of 
Liberal deception that they tell Canadians they are going to do 
something to deal with an issue, but when what has been done is 
examined, what the actual measures are, they are toothless, 
ineffective and not at all as advertised.
<P>
	The only thing this bill actually does is keep multiple murderers 
in prison for 25 years. Realistically this changes nothing. People 
like Clifford Olson and Paul Bernardo were not going to get out 
after 15 years anyway. Mandating that they are now going to serve 
25 years and hailing this as a great step forward for public safety is 
absolute nonsense. These people were not going to get out in the 
public under any circumstances.
<P>
	What does it do to convicted killers who only murdered one 
innocent, law-abiding Canadian in a deliberate cold-blooded, 
premeditated manner? Does it get tougher for these people? Does it 
send a strong message that we do not like this kind of thing, that we 
are not going to put up with it in our society, that if a person takes 
an innocent life they are going to pay such a heavy penalty that they 
had better think a long time before doing it? No.
<P>
	It gives these people even more avenues of appeal and redress 
than they had before. Instead of going directly to a parole board 
jury to have a decision made about whether they should obtain 
early release or early parole, now they have to convince a superior 
court judge that they have a reasonable chance before such a jury of 
getting a favourable decision. Then if they do not like the superior 
court judge's determination on that issue they can go to the appeal 
level of the superior court. If they  do not like that, they can go to 
the supreme appeal court in Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4617"> 4617 </A></B>
<P>
After all of that, they still have the possible right to go before a 
jury, which is what they are doing now.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Instead of doing anything to send a signal to killers that murder 
will not be tolerated in our society, instead of fulfilling promises to 
victims and families of murdered Canadians, we now have more 
loopholes, more avenues, more layers of redress, more appeals and 
using the system than we did before. That is what this bill does.
<P>
	It does not change a thing for multiple murders, except send a 
message that somehow if only one person is killed, a murderer will 
be treated a lot more lightly than if it is more than one. It actually 
gives more loopholes and more hoops that convicted killers can 
access in our system. It will cost a lot more for Canadians to allow 
the access to these measures. It changes nothing that responds, in 
any way at all, to the legitimate demands and concerns of the 
families and loved ones of murdered Canadians.
<P>
	What else does it do? It makes a small change that says that 
when a murderer finally gets before a parole jury to see whether he 
or she should be given early parole or early release, the decision of 
the jury should be unanimous instead of only two-thirds of the jury. 
This is truly a big step forward for democracy.
<P>
	In our common law system in centuries of jurisprudence, 
unanimity of jury decisions has been mandated. Why the Liberals 
in the first place would have said that a parole decision could be 
made with only a two-thirds majority of the jury I have no idea. 
Thankfully they have finally seen the error of their ways and are 
going to correct that, and well they should. We can hail this as a 
huge victory for democracy. Now the Liberals are saying that a jury 
decision must be unanimous instead of only two-thirds. I am sure 
that Canadians will be cheering in the streets when this measure 
goes through. It is certainly significant for the rights of victims and 
murdered law-abiding Canadians.
<P>
	I hope Canadians who are following this debate will not be taken 
in by the deception of this justice minister and this government 
who talk a lot about doing something with section 745 of the 
Criminal Code that everybody was complaining about. They did 
nothing to this section of even the slightest significance or, even in 
the smallest way, to respond to the demands of the loved ones, the 
families and friends of murdered Canadians to have more justice. 
The consequences of the actions that were taken against these 
law-abiding people to have some peace was absolutely nothing. 
Canadians need to know this.
<P>
	We see this over and over again with the government. It makes 
great representations that it will change the things that Canadians 
are demanding. If anyone ever  looks at what is actually done, it is 
totally insubstantial, totally at variance with the tough talk that is 
given to the people making the demands, to voters, to taxpayers.
<P>
	Much is made that something is being done. It is not much. It is 
not even worth mentioning. That is why we have been standing in 
this House, time after time, speaker after speaker, on our side of the 
House asking the government to be honest with Canadians, to do 
something substantial to deal with their very real concerns.
<P>
	The Bloc does not want us talking about murderers but 
unfortunately for them, that is exactly what this bill deals with. It 
deals with first degree murderers. It is pretty hard to talk about first 
degree murderers without talking about their crimes. Of course, the 
Bloc finds it rather extreme to talk about murderers when we are 
dealing with a bill that tries to address the way first degree 
murderers are treated in this country.
<P>
	We have an incredible situation in the law-making chambers of 
our country where a government is doing absolutely nothing to 
respond to the real concerns of victims and their families. We have 
the official opposition saying: ``This is terrible, we do not even 
want to talk about these things. We think this is a little too extreme 
and too difficult to even raise''.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Only the Reform Party is standing in the House and asking: 
``Why don't we as legislators give the people of this country what 
they deserve, something firm, something strong, something 
substantive, something that sends the signal to criminals convicted 
of premeditated deliberate murders in this country?''
<P>
	I urge this House again to vote down this bill, to reject this bill 
and to demand this justice minister brings back measures that 
really respond to the concerns of the people of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-45 
makes some significant changes to section 745 of the Criminal 
Code.
<P>
	It addresses three major changes. First, a murderer serving time 
for murder must appear before a superior court judge and prove to 
the judge that he should be allowed this glimmer of hope and that 
he has a reasonable prospect of success before this proceeds. That 
is just fluff. That is part of a routine procedure that I am sure judges 
will allow to happen. How does the judge know? He will let the 
jury decide.
<P>
	Second, this bill introduces different classes of murderers. A 
person who commits first degree premeditated murder for the first 
time, or just once, will be given this opportunity. However, if a 
person does it twice or more, they will no longer be given that 
opportunity. This change is not retroactive to serial murderers, to 
people who are already in jail for multiple  murders. It is lacking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4618"> 4618 </A></B>
<P>
severely by not addressing the 58 multiple murderers who are in 
prisons now.
<P>
	Those people will be allowed to come forward for a review. 
Those people will be considered for a review. Those people will 
bring agony to the lives of the families of the deceased and bring 
back the emotions of fear and hatred.
<P>
	The Liberals are supposed to have such huge hearts and be so 
caring that they will spend billions of dollars just to save one life. 
Yet they do not seem to care or be aware of what they are 
potentially doing emotionally to the families of the victims of these 
58 people. That is what is wrong with that section.
<P>
	Third, the bill introduces a requirement that the parole board 
bring down a unanimous decision rather than just a two-thirds 
majority. I will return to that issue.
<P>
	The justice minister is tinkering around the edges with this bill. 
He is trying to satisfy his legal buddies in the system that he is 
allowing them to continue with the high cost of defence and high 
cost of the defence justice system, yet also trying to satisfy the 
Canadian public that he is addressing a serious matter.
<P>
	I believe it will be revealed, as I am trying to do, as a sham. He is 
trying to suck and blow at the same time and it does not work. He 
has created different classes of murder. Some are not as bad as 
others. He said that changes to section 745 are to enhance 
community safety. But how does it enhance community safety to 
allow murderers to walk our streets?
<P>
	The minister also said that section 745 will be available to those 
who are deserving. Consider a person who commits a crime with 
intent to murder. He plans, knows what he wants to do and does it. 
Yet somehow he knows before he commits this murder that he will 
be deserving through a glimmer of hope clause, section 745. He is 
only allowed to do it once, though. He knows that he has a chance 
to get out. Deserving?
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is using the word deserving and making 
it synonymous with premeditated, with murder and with criminal. 
That does not sound right to me and it is not what he should be 
doing when he is trying to address the deterrent and punishment for 
crime and focusing on the criminal. He says he is preserving this 
section for those who should have access to it in a way that makes 
sense.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Premeditated first degree murder does not make sense but it 
happens, and the punishment for that is life with parole after 25 
years, which is the kind of truth in sentencing we need. A person 
must know, as my colleague from Edmonton Southwest said earlier 
today, that if the penalty is 25 years, they serve 25 years. If the 
penalty is life with no parole, it is life with no parole.
<P>
	We should have the punishment meet the crime and truth in 
sentencing, but we do not have that now. We keep having these 
escape clauses. That is why our streets are not safe and why the 
perception is being created for Canadians that they have lots to fear 
from these criminals who are being coddled more than the victims 
and victims rights.
<P>
	It does not make sense that when someone takes the life of 
another human being in a premeditated manner they are still given 
a carrot or, as the justice minister puts it, a glimmer of hope. When 
these people killed another person they took away their glimmer of 
hope. They ended all their dreams and all their plans. They took 
away any chance that these people had to contribute to society.
<P>
	To worry about the rights and democratic freedoms of murderers 
I do not believe is as much of a high priority as the rights of the 
victims and of their families. The minister is not recognizing the 
emotional needs of the people who are left behind. Let us not forget 
that a victim's sentence is forever. It is life six feet under in a 
cemetery. Therefore life should mean life and a life should mean a 
life.
<P>
	Under the charter of rights all people are supposed to be equally 
and are to be protected equally under the law. The justice minister 
has created different classes of Canadian citizens, telling people 
they may be valued more or less depending on how they die or how 
many people they die with. If one person is murdered, that 
murderer is deserving of a glimmer of hope. However, if two 
people are murdered at the same time by one person then that 
murderer does not deserve a glimmer of hope and is put away for 
the full sentence.
<P>
	It gets more complicated. If two people kill two people are they 
deserving? In other words, one person's death is not proof enough. 
Is not one person's death in a premeditated, planned fashion proof 
enough of the criminal tendency of that individual? It takes two 
deaths for this government to act and then it will get tough.
<P>
	Our first priority must be the law-abiding, taxpaying decent 
citizens. Government must respect that Canadians have the right to 
demand that their government give them safe streets and 
communities by cracking down on hard criminals, especially those 
who have been convicted of first degree premeditated murder, no 
matter how many people's lives they affect.
<P>
	Parole boards are supposedly set in place for the purpose of 
rehabilitation after an individual is subject to parole and goes 
before this parole board. This is a quasi-judicial body. For many 
who serve on it the qualifications are vague. They are not really 
based on merit and no real knowledge is required to serve on this 
board.
<P>
	This board is given the power, 15 years later or 18 years later, to 
overrule a judge's decision years after the  fact. Years after the fact 
the circumstances are different and the evidence is somewhat 
forgotten. A prosecutor and a defence lawyer argue the case in a 
more detached and arm's length fashion. I know this to be true 
because I witnessed one this summer in Calgary.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4619"> 4619 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	I went to a section 745 hearing-I believe the man's name was 
Ramsey-and listened to Ramsey's defence lawyer trying to justify 
why this person deserved to have his sentenced reduced from 25 
years. He had already served 16. He had been in there for 16 years 
but he was a model prisoner. He was rehabilitated and he had 
applied to get out early.
<P>
	The prosecutor said: ``No, this gentleman does not deserve to be 
let out. This gentleman is manipulating the system. He is playing 
games''. There was a very descriptive and vivid explanation given 
of the crime. It was a drug related crime. He stood over his drug 
partner and shot him twice in the head. The jury listened to the 
description of the crime. I reacted to the evidence. I said to myself: 
``No, you stay in there and serve your 25 years''.
<P>
	That gentleman got 18 years because of the two-thirds rule. He 
got it reduced from 25 years to 18 years. By doing the right things 
in jail and by following the advice of his lawyer he was able to get 
his sentence reduced, despite the brutality of his crime.
<P>
	This bill should be repealed, just like the prior bill that was 
introduced by the member for York South-Weston. We should get 
on with other legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak to 
Bill C-45.
<P>
	Let us examine what this bill is about. Of course the amendment 
which the Bloc put forward is to give the bill a rest for about six 
months so it can be studied in even greater depth. Quite frankly, I 
agree with the motion, except that it does not go far enough. We 
should give this bill a rest, period. We should throw out this useless 
bill. Let us get back to talking about a criminal justice system in 
which sentences fit the crime and in which the sentences are 
designed to protect society by not allowing criminals to get out 
early to commit another crime. That is what we are talking about.
<P>
	We listened to the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
verbally assaulting us out of the view of the cameras. I would like 
to talk about some of the comments which he made yesterday in his 
presentation.
<P>
	He said: ``The point is most murders, from my limited 
knowledge'', and I will certainly agree with that, ``in this area are 
crimes of passion. I do not think the offender sits and thinks of the 
consequences of his or her acts when a murder is taking place''. 
What a profound statement. The fact is many murders are 
committed in this country with premeditation. That is what we are 
talking about, premeditated murder, first degree murder. We are 
talking about cold blooded murder.
<P>
	Do we accept the philosophy of the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the philosophy of the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands, the philosophy of the Minister of Justice 
and the philosophy of the Liberal government and a good majority 
of its members? Do we accept that philosophy as being how we 
should deal with people who commit cold blooded, vicious 
murders? Should the Liberal philosophy be the guiding light as to 
how we treat these people? Or should it be how Canadians, how our 
society, how law-abiding citizens feel about this? That is the 
question we have to ask here today.
<P>
	Surely one can see from the bill that the Minister of Justice has 
set himself up as some sort of king who is going to decide all. This 
is quite astounding. He has the audacity to determine unilaterally 
that in this country there are good murderers and bad murderers. If 
someone commits one murder they are, in his mind, a good 
murderer and they get to apply for early parole after 15 years. If 
they commit more than one murder they serve a life sentence of 25 
years.
<P>
	There are two points I would like to make. First, how does he 
have the audacity to suggest that the crime of killing one victim is 
any less severe than someone who kills two or three people? How 
can he make that judgment? Could he tell the family of a victim 
that the killer was in fact classified as a good killer and someone 
who killed three or four people was a bad killer? Could he actually 
say that? I think not.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The other point I want to make in talking about multiple killers is 
that in his philosophy and in most of the Liberals' philosophy, a 
multiple killer should serve a life sentence of 25 years. I would 
hazard a guess that most Canadians would prefer that a multiple 
killer serve a life sentence of 25 years for every murder he or she 
has committed.
<P>
	In other words we are talking about consecutive sentencing as 
most other countries have. The governments of those countries try 
to reflect in the criminal justice system what society wants. If we 
were to carry that line of thought into this debate, then certainly we 
should not be talking about whether or not a killer gets out early if 
they kill one, two or three people. If we were to truly reflect the 
feeling among the Canadian people when it comes to first degree 
premeditated murder, then we would be talking about capital 
punishment in this House today.
<P>
	Poll after poll, survey after survey has shown that a majority of 
Canadians first of all would support the return of capital 
punishment for first degree murder in this country, but most 
important, an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4620"> 4620 </A></B>
<P>
even higher majority of the people in this country would simply 
like to be asked. That is what the Reform Party has been pushing 
for.
<P>
	If this government had any intestinal fortitude, any sense, any 
brains, or any sense of democracy, it would take that question to the 
people of Canada. If the government is afraid to deal with that 
question, then let us let the government off the hook and take that 
question to the people of Canada in a national referendum. Ask 
them if they would like to have the return of capital punishment in 
this country. Just ask them. The government will not do that 
because it knows what the answer will be. The answer will be an 
overwhelming yes and that does not align with the Liberal 
philosophy.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce when he was justice 
minister was the one who put through section 745. A companion to 
that bill was to eliminate the death penalty and replace it with life 
sentences and the early parole application. That was a reflection of 
the philosophy of the Liberal government of that day and it is 
apparent in this group of Liberals sitting here today.
<P>
	The minister has set the quota at one life, should at some future 
time the killer want the opportunity to make an application to 
reduce his or her parole. It is disgraceful and reprehensible that the 
justice minister, who really was elected only in one riding and was 
given a little bigger job once he got here, has set himself up as 
judge and jury as to how the criminal justice system is going to 
work without regard for the real jury out there which is the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	Where do the Canadian people fit in this scheme of the justice 
minister's? Quite frankly, they do not count. That is very clear in 
this bill.
<P>
	We talked about consecutive sentencing. If the minister is so 
determined that people who commit premeditated multiple 
murders should serve a life sentence, why do we not see something 
in the bill that says a life sentence for every life someone takes? 
Where is that in the bill? If someone kills two people, it should be 
two life sentences. If someone kills four people, it should be four 
life sentences. Consecutive sentences. That would be the thing that 
would keep these people in prison. Consecutive sentencing puts a 
value on the taking of each and every life in the case of multiple 
killers.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Clifford Olson should have received 11 life sentences. He killed 
11 people. Premeditated and pre-calculated, he killed 11 people. As 
a matter of fact one of the victims was the daughter of the man who 
gave me my first job. That has no relevance to this except to point 
out that I have some personal knowledge of the savage acts Clifford 
Olson committed and he should never ever even have the 
opportunity to apply for early parole.
<P>
	The U.S. uses consecutive sentencing. Some states have 
abolished their parole boards which would be a good  idea given the 
record of our parole boards in this country. They have abolished 
them to ensure that criminals serve their entire sentences. However 
that is not in the philosophy of the Liberal Party, the Minister of 
Justice and cohorts from governments past, the cohorts in this bill. 
It is not in their philosophy.
<P>
	The Liberals are too busy looking after criminals and placing 
them on the same plane as their victims. This government believes 
that the rehabilitation of criminals should have as much attention 
and as much respect as the victims of crime themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Or more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Or more.
<P>
	The Liberals are too busy pampering criminals to have any time 
to deal with the concerns of victims.
<P>
	The member for Fraser Valley West has put forward a victims 
bill of rights that has been widely accepted all over this country. No 
matter what the Liberals say about the Reformers when it comes to 
crime and punishment, we will say what the people say. Reformers 
will stand here and talk long, loud and clear about criminal justice. 
At least our party will reflect the views of the Canadian people in 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
sad parts about this whole debate is the fact that the Liberals appear 
to have completely forgotten about the victims and the victim's 
families. There is a lot of talk about the rehabilitation and release 
of the convicted murderer. There is a lot of talk about the rights of 
the criminals. I have gone through <I>Hansard</I> and I have not come up 
with anything that has been said by a Liberal in this debate that 
deals with the issue of the victim's families in any substantive way. 
It is for the living that we speak.
<P>
	I was interested in the speech of the member for Kingston and 
the Islands last evening. He said: ``In my opinion the bill goes 
counter to the principles governing the treatment of offenders and 
that is why I am against this bill''. He said earlier in his 
intervention that in fact he was planning on voting against the bill.
<P>
	What about the treatment of the victim's families, not what 
about the offender? Further he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to go back to the four principles of sentencing that I talked about. I 
mentioned first, the protection of the public; second, the punishment of the offender; 
third, the rehabilitation of the offender; and fourth, the deterrence to others. I believe 
those are the four principles on which any sentencing bill ought to be judged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	His comment makes my point does it not? His comment is: How 
are we treating the offender? It has been said many many times by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4621"> 4621 </A></B>
<P>
my colleagues that we are not talking about a crime of passion. 
What we are talking about here is premeditated first degree murder. 
We are not talking about an incident that just happened to happen. 
We are talking about the most vile offence that one human being 
can commit on another human being.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	It is therefore strange that while the Liberal government, the 
justice minister and indeed the whole party would be spending time 
on Bill C-45, which is an anaemic response to the demand of 
Canadians for the repeal of section 745 of the Criminal Code, they 
spend no time talking about victims or victims' rights. It was the 
Reform Party that brought to this floor under the very careful 
guidance of my colleague from Fraser Valley West, a motion to 
which the justice minister agreed by the way, that the House was 
going to consider a victims bill of rights. That has not happened. 
Quite frankly, I think it will probably be a sunshiny day for bikinis 
in the Arctic on December 25 before we ever see the victims bill of 
rights in the House.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands also said in his speech 
last night: ``On the other hand, there are a large number of persons 
who have committed murder who pose no danger, who are 
remorseful and who wish they had never done it and, in my view, 
ought to be released and become contributing members of our 
society again''.
<P>
	Is that not wonderful. People have intentionally and willfully 
taken the life of another human being and have left behind them the 
shattered lives of their victims' families. The shattered lives of 
mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, relatives. Their lives will 
never, ever be the same again. Their lives have been so twisted and 
distorted by this heinous crime, yet the member says, and I will 
read it again because it is just so, so outstanding. ``On the other 
hand, there are a large number of persons who have committed 
murder, who pose no danger, who are remorseful and who wish 
they had never done it and, in my view, ought to be released and 
become contributing members of our society again''.
<P>
	I ask members opposite: What are we doing here? Why are we 
spending this amount of time on a meagre repeal of some parts of 
section 745 and spending no time looking after the victims' 
families? Why are we doing this? I would love to have an answer 
from any Liberal member. Why do we spend so much time 
mollycoddling the criminal and ignoring the victim? Why do we do 
that? Any answers? I would love to have an answer to that question 
because I do not think there is one.
<P>
	Last evening the government whip also displayed an attitude 
toward the Reform Party, which has attempted to bring the 
concerns of the people of Canada to the floor of the House, that is 
really an example of how many if not most of the Liberals feel 
toward our representations. I will quote him now referring to the 
Reform Party: ``They think they have a monopoly on the truth. 
Canadians know what they are all about. It is a game of fear and 
hatred that they are trying to promote, Canadians one against the 
other. That is wrong''.
<P>
	Those are not only spiteful words. Those are words of distortion. 
I have said so many times in the House and I will say it again. 
There is more common sense in the average coffee shop in Canada 
than we will ever have in the House of Commons.
<P>
	When the comments of concerned Canadians are spoken on this 
floor in plain 25-cent English words, for the government whip to 
stand and say: ``Oh, it is hatred. They are trying to pit Canadian 
against Canadian'', no we are trying to represent the views and the 
wishes of the people in Canada's coffee shops. We are trying to 
represent the views of the people in the living rooms and kitchens 
of Canada. We are not falling over, the way the justice minister has 
fallen over to the people in his justice department and doing all of 
the things that are politically correct. We are trying to correct 
something in this nation and get the focus where it should be. The 
focus again is that we must return to consideration and respect for 
the citizens of Canada and not just the criminals.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This is a bill that is going to pass. It will pass because that is the 
wish of the Prime Minister and that is the wish of the justice 
minister.
<P>
	It will not pass as a result of the wish of the majority of people in 
Canada. The Liberals have the arrogance and the audacity to come 
to this Chamber and say: ``We know what is best for the people of 
Canada, so we are going to turn, we are going to twist and we are 
going to give a little puffery and a little image and we are going to 
make it appear as though we are actually responding to the current 
concerns of the people of Canada''.
<P>
	Time will tell. There was a time when the people of Canada were 
prepared to buy into the big old parties, buy into the Liberals and 
the Conservatives, which is where the old thing of ``Liberal-Tory, 
same old story'' came from. They are the same old story.
<P>
	We had wonderful prognosticators like Dalton Camp on 
television last night saying: ``People want to have choices, but they 
want to have a narrow band of choices''. There are the Liberals 
here and there are their kissing cousins, the Conservatives, there. 
They want to be able to make those choices within that narrow 
band. The problem for many of the Liberals, particularly for the 
government whip, is that we offer choices outside the narrow band 
of this cosy little club. We offer choices that people in coffee shops 
are asking for. We offer choices to Canadians in ordinary plain 
English.
<P>
	This bill is inadequate. This bill will pass, unfortunately. This 
bill will be a minuscule improvement, but when the Reform Party 
forms the government in Canada we will make this bill right.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to participate in the debate on Bill C-45 and also 
to comment on the amendment that was made by the hon. member 
for Bellechasse.
<P>
	Bill C-45 in the discussion that is going on here is only a part of a 
much larger discussion. The real question we should be looking at 
in this House is whether the government is being tough enough on 
the criminals and those who break the laws of this country and fair 
enough to the people who are victims of those crimes.
<P>
	We should examine the three years of the Liberal record, this 
Liberal government's record, led by the Prime Minister who was 
once a minister of justice, as to whether it is dealing with the 
criminal issues of this country or whether it is continuing this soft, 
easy, be kind, rehabilitative approach that the Liberal Party has 
used over the years which has brought us to the state of affairs we 
have in Canada today where criminals are out of hand.
<P>
	They are not afraid to break the law. They are not afraid to 
commit a crime. Youth are not afraid to commit a crime because 
they know the punishment will not be severe.
<P>
	That is the environment this Liberal government and this attitude 
of the House of Commons for the last 10 to 15 or 20 years have 
brought as a consequence to the citizens of Canada.
<P>
	In the three years that have passed, the Reform Party came to this 
assembly saying: ``We must be tough on criminals. Those who 
misuse a firearm in the act of some type of crime should be 
punished severely. Throw the book at them''. That is what we said.
<P>
	What happened? The government decided that it would punish 
the innocent citizens of Canada by making them all register, pay 
money, put in a bunch of red tape, and the criminals still have 
access to the guns that are unregistered, committing crimes.
<P>
	A crime that was just committed in Abbotsford, the report for 
which came out yesterday, indicated that the person who took the 
lives of a family used a registered gun. This was after the 
authorities were told that this person was a threat to the family.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	Now we are going to register six million guns and it will not do a 
thing against crime in this country. That is one issue. Again, the 
Liberals are soft on criminals. Register the guns of the innocent 
people but leave the criminals alone. They have the guns anyway 
and will use them.
<P>
	Let us look at young offenders. We have raised the issue over and 
over again in this Parliament that we must be tough on young 
offenders, that they cannot get away with what they are doing. 
Young people of 11, 12, 13 and 14 years of age are committing 
adult crimes. The courts cannot deal with them. We cannot give 
them adult sentences because the system, the law of the country, 
does not allow it to happen as easily as it should.
<P>
	Again, that is a symptom of liberal attitude, a liberal approach to 
dealing with crime in the country, to keep peace order and goodwill 
in this country. You be kind, you rehabilitate, you spend a lot of 
money on social workers, counselling and talking, but you do not 
deal with the issue.
<P>
	Young people are out of hand; not all of them, the percentage 
that wants to break the laws and take advantage and run in the drug 
trade and the sex trade and whatever else is going on, to steal and to 
violate other people's property. They are out there without a threat 
of what will happen to them. That must change.
<P>
	What about those who violate families in any way? Do we have 
tough laws with regard to those who would violate members of 
their families in any way? Do we have laws in place that would say 
to a father who violates his children or his wife in a negative way 
that there will be severe punishment? Our books do not say that.
<P>
	I had some faith in our Minister of Justice when I first came 
here. For the first three months I listened to him and I thought here 
is a person who is progressive and ready to change the system, to 
deal with the issues. But what has come out since then is this soft, 
rehabilitative, counselling, easy on the criminal approach that is 
not dealing with the problem of our country.
<P>
	I could list issue after issue. Bill C-45 is a typical example of that 
where we are in a different era. One would think the Minister of 
Justice was in the 1950s or the 1960s when there were a few 
crimes. There were a few murders. But there was nothing as violent 
as what exists today. There was nothing at all in the system. Those 
old ways will not deal with the matters now.
<P>
	Here before us is one opportunity to toughen up the laws. For 
those who murder someone, considered as first degree murder, we 
can change section 745. We can talk about Olson, Peters and others 
in a long list. We say to them that if they commit premeditated 
murder, if they take the life of someone else for their own 
exploitative purposes, we want to give them access to the right to 
serve a sentence of only 15 years rather than 25.
<P>
	The two people I mentioned happen to have murdered more than 
one person, so the law before us, which would be hoisted by the 
amendment I am addressing, would not deal with those people. It 
would not deal with them because they have committed two 
murders. That is certainly a shortcoming of the act.
<P>
	But where did this Liberal government begin to go soft and feel 
it had a better approach than the people of Canada? It was back in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4623"> 4623 </A></B>
<P>
1975 and 1976 when the matter of capital punishment was under 
discussion in this assembly. I recall that discussion very well.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	At that time in the legislature of Alberta we also had a 
discussion. Many members of the Alberta legislature took polls in 
their constituencies to see how they should vote on this matter and 
what kind of a recommendation the legislature of Alberta should 
make to the House of Commons of Canada.
<P>
	A member of Parliament at that time, an Alberta member who 
later became prime minister, took a poll in his constituency. The 
people that day voted in favour of capital punishment. In my 
constituency it was around 90 per cent. Most constituencies in 
Canada voted over 80 per cent in support of retaining capital 
punishment.
<P>
	What did the Liberal government of the day do back in 1976? It 
abolished capital punishment. Member after member stood in the 
House and said: ``Canadians do not understand. They do not 
understand. They do not realize that capital punishment may mean 
that we take the life of an innocent person''. They thought capital 
punishment should be abolished because an innocent person might 
lose their life.
<P>
	Many of the people who are charged with first degree murder are 
obviously murderers. Let us look at Olson and Peters. They 
committed murders. Should they have the right to continue to live 
on this land, supported by us in rather lavish facilities in the prisons 
of this country? I believe that is wrong.
<P>
	I believe if we took a vote today in Canada on the issue of capital 
punishment there would be no question. Canadians would say, with 
at least a 90 per cent majority, that capital punishment should be 
reinstated.
<P>
	We could categorize who it applies to and who it does not. We 
could protect ourselves as legislators against using the instrument 
of capital punishment on someone who may be innocent. That is 
very easy to do. We could define to whom capital punishment 
would apply. Canadians would accept that.
<P>
	The point I want to make in this debate is that the Liberal 
government is not listening to Canadians who want to be tougher 
on criminals and fairer on victims. They want rights for the victims 
of crime in the country. Canadians want that and the government is 
not delivering.
<P>
	The Reformers are that voice for Canadians. We are saying we 
want to be tougher on criminals. We must deal with the issues. If 
someone commits murder, whether they murder once, twice or 
more, they should be sentenced to 25 years in jail. That is the most 
severe sentence we can apply at the present time because the 
Liberals softened their whole approach in 1976 and changed the 
law so we could not take more drastic measures. That is the way it 
should be, 25 years and no less. There should be no right to appeal 
the sentence after 15 years.
<P>
	As legislators and as Reformers we will fight for that position 
during this Parliament and certainly in future Parliaments. When 
we become government that is one specific thing which will 
change.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As it is almost two o'clock, rather than begin with 
another speaker, perhaps we could move to Statements by 
Members.

<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage displays a complete lack of 
understanding of her department. Parliamentary committee

<P>
	This legislation is perhaps the largest undertaking this 
department has introduced and the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
is running a hurry-up offence in order to pass it. Phase II of 
copyright sat on the government's plate for almost two years, yet 
the minister wants Bill C-32 jammed through the committee in just 
eight weeks.
<P>
	This is another example which clearly indicates the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage does not have a clue of the issues facing her 
department. The committee has received over 150 requests from 
Canadians to appear, yet because of the government's self-imposed 
time line, less than 60 submissions will be heard.

	Although the flooding in northern Alberta did not receive the 
attention that the flood in the Saguenay did, the damage to homes, 
crops and businesses was no less devastating to those affected.
<P>
	In spite of this, many of my constituents have been denied 
disaster relief funding to compensate them for the loss of a

off-farm income to keep their farming operations viable.

	I and my constituents believe that if the federal government is 
going to have a program to compensate Canadians for losses due to 
natural disasters, then all Canadians should be equally 
compensated for losses incurred.

circumstance and would have been full time farm operators if they 
had had a choice. The damage sustained is no less devastating to

the scene of the crime to see where the killers left the registration

the Reform Party has released a brochure called ``Do You Feel

	Reformers choose to fuel the fear of crime and ignore the fact 
that crime in Canada has been steadily decreasing as the 1995

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the issue of the family trust scandal, we now have the 
Minister of National Revenue, while still refusing to shed light on 
the flight of capital out of the country, accusing the opposition of 
being on the wrong track for wanting to shed light on the decisions 
made in a panic on December 23 to allow a wealthy Canadian 
family to transfer to the U.S. more than $2 billion without paying a 
penny in taxes. According to the minister, it is a mistake for the 
Bloc to want to get to the bottom of this.
<P>
	How can the revenue minister accuse the opposition of being on 
the wrong track for wanting to know the truth about these tax 
loopholes, when the auditor general, experts with no connection to 
wealthy Canadian families and Canadian editorial writers join with 
the official opposition in demanding that light be shed on this 
tax-free flight of capital out of the country?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me begin by reiterating what I said in the House 
yesterday.
<P>
	First, the government took very seriously the report of the 
auditor general and reacted quickly. It sent the report to the finance 
committee for its full review and for its recommendations. That 
committee has made recommendations that the Minister of Finance 
is reviewing and taking very seriously.
<P>
	As the minister of revenue, I am glad to have received the 
recommendations which said that my department must act with 
transparency, make consistent decisions and have full 
documentation.
<P>
	I am glad that the committee also noted that we have begun to 
take action in that regard and that it praises the government for 
ensuring integrity for the Canadian citizen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as everyone saw in the newspapers, the minister is 
accusing the opposition of barking up the wrong tree, because we 
want to know the truth. We want to know what happened, period.
<P>
	The minister explained that these tax loopholes are maintained 
because the law applies not only to the rich, as she said, but also to 
ordinary people.

<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Does the minister realize that what the auditor general 
condemned was that over $2 billion was taken out of the country, 
tax free, by a single Canadian family, and that it is on this case, and 
other similar ones which may have occurred in the past and which 
may occur in the future, that we want to shed light? It is clear, 
simple and logical to me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not engage in speculation about what may or may 
not have happened.
<P>
	What I would like to do is quote from the report that was 
received by me and the Minister of Finance: ``The committee heard 
no evidence that these transactions have already cost the Canadian 
fisc any actual tax revenue''. The committee notes that the auditor 
general and his officials were able to identify any significant new 
tax avoidance opportunity created for other taxpayers by these 
rulings''.
<P>
	The auditor general could only speculate about tax laws. It is 
beyond me why the members opposite are so definite about this. If 
they have information that they presented to the committee, can 
they present it to this House?
<P>
	My understanding is that when asked outside these walls by the 
press, they were unable to substantiate the claims they are making 
in this Chamber.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, allow me to summarize.
<P>
	The auditor general told us about over $2 billion leaving the 
country, tax free. This is the first element. The opposition has been 
condemning this situation for three years, because we knew, we 
realized this was a possibility. This is fact number two. The third 
point is that the Deputy Minister of Revenue, Mr. Gravelle, told the 
finance committee that there may have been other similar 
occurrences. This is not just anybody. Her deputy minister said 
there may have been other such cases.
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Does the minister not realize that 
she is making a mistake by attempting to cover up what happened 
with this December 23 ruling, by attempting to hide behind the 
report of the Liberal members of the committee to avoid shedding 
light on this issue? All Canadians want to know what happened, 
and we will find out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us recall that this decision happened in 1991 with a 
former government, not a Liberal government, a Conservative 
government.
<P>
	When this was drawn to our attention, we acted very quickly and 
rapidly. As minister of revenue, I placed a moratorium on any 
further rulings on taxable Canadian property while the finance 
committee was doing a very important review, the first review of 
this piece of the Income Tax Act in 25 years.
<P>
	As well, upon receiving the report of the finance committee, I 
have extended the moratorium on any further rulings to do with 
taxable Canadian property until such time as the Minister of 
Finance has had an opportunity to review the recommendations and 
make decisions on making changes that are appropriate and in line 
with the kind of government that we are.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the previous Conservative government is responsible, 
then what do the Liberals have to worry about if light is shed on 
this episode? What do they have to fear? Are they afraid that, if we 
scratch the blue, we may find some red underneath?
<P>
	Yesterday, the revenue minister systematically refused to shed 
light on the family trust scandal. Instead, she attacked the official 
opposition which, according to her, was perpetuating a myth. When 
$2 billion leave the country tax free, it is far from being a myth to 
taxpayers.
<P>
	How can the revenue minister claim that the report of the Liberal 
majority of the finance committee shed light on the issue of tax 
leakages when, in fact, this report served only two purposes: to 
cover up the issue and to discredit the auditor general, who has 
become an embarrassment to the government?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fail to understand how the opposition can talk about any 
kind of lack of integrity. We received the response from the auditor 
general with open arms and then asked the committee, on which the 
hon. member sits, to review it in its entirety for the first time in 25 
years and to make real recommendations not on issues upon which 
they speculate but on the reality of taxpayer migration and how we 
should tax that circumstance. We want to have a tax system that is 
fair and that the Canadian citizenry can have a sense of confidence 
in.
<P>
	We have taken those actions. We have received the 
recommendations. There is a moratorium on further tax rulings. 
The Minister of Finance is looking at the recommendations that 
fully point to the policy in specific. As the minister of revenue, I 
have taken specific actions in terms of improving the manner in 
which my department operates.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the first thing the Liberal government did when the 
auditor general denounced it was to try to cloud the issue, never to 
get to the bottom of it, to the bottom of this scandal.
<P>
	I put the question to the revenue minister: Why refuse to clarify? 
Why refuse to tell Canadians what really happened on the evening 
of December 23, 1991, and what may have happened since then, 
because you have set a dangerous precedent?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I would remind you that you 
must always go through the Chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me be clear on a number of issues.
<P>
	When I reviewed the report of the auditor general I spoke to him 
directly and said: ``Are you concerned about the integrity of my 
department?'' He said to me: ``No, I am not''. When I spoke to my 
deputy minister and asked him if we have a right to be concerned 
about the integrity of the Department of National Revenue, he said: 
``No, we do not''. When the chair of the finance committee spoke 
to the auditor general and to the assistant auditor general about this 
issue he received this response: ``There is no evidence of 
wrongdoing or interference in the decision making process here''.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound said: 
``In spite of serious efforts on my part, in no case could I discover 
any evidence of wrongdoing''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, our government does not engage in any kind of 
witch hunts. If the hon. member has proof that he has not yet made 
public, please ask him to do so.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, retired Major-General Lewis MacKenzie is one of this 
country's most distinguished soldiers. Even the government 
acknowledges that. No one disputes that Major-General Lewis 
MacKenzie cares passionately about the men and women of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. Today he said: ``There is a morale crisis 
in the Canadian forces and my plea is that the political leadership 
accept that and do something about it''.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister accept that there is a morale crisis in the 
Canadian Armed Forces and will he do something by replacing the 
chief of defence staff and the Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course, like a lot of people, I respect very much 
Major-General MacKenzie. I know him personally. But the reality 
is there is an inquiry going on at this  moment on what happened in 
Somalia. Let the inquiry do its job.
<P>
	In terms of the operation of the armed forces, today they made a 
decision to have a new function established to make sure that 
grievances from troops will go straight to the highest level possible 
in the army. That is the way to solve problems. Just shuffling 
people around does not solve problems. We are trying to reform an 
institution that is going through a very difficult time.
<P>
	We had to close bases. We had to reduce the number of generals 
from 120 to below 80. It is very difficult for the people who operate 
in that situation to understand that it is difficult for everybody, not 
only for the soldiers who have to live with that and the managers of 
the department, but it is tough for us too. We do not make these cuts 
and readjustments just for the pleasure of doing them. It is because 
they are needed to make sure that the finances of the nation will be 
in proper shape.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister does not act at the top others are 
forced to improvise down below.
<P>
	Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril has become tired of waiting 
for General Boyle to appoint an inspector general. So he has 
created his own position of command inspector to investigate 
charges of poor leadership and morale. He says: ``I can't wait six 
months. I want to find out immediately, did the leadership fail''. 
The leadership did fail and it continues to fail.
<P>
	How long do the soldiers have to wait? How low does morale 
have to get before the Prime Minister does the right thing, as 
distinct from the politically expedient thing, and fire General Boyle 
and the Minister of National Defence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy that the leader of the third party is 
mentioning General Baril. I heard General Baril last week on 
French TV supporting General Boyle and asking the people of 
Canada to let General Boyle do his job.
<P>
	I agree that General Baril is competent, and he is on the inside. 
He is an outspoken person. He was not ashamed to say last week 
that he has confidence in General Boyle and that he should stay in 
his job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the late Senator Stan Waters was one of Canada's most 
distinguished soldiers. He was a member of our first commando 
and paratroop unit in the second world war and he rose through the 
ranks to become commander of the army in the 1970s.
<P>
	When General Waters was asked what was the most important 
quality a military leader should possess, he said he must be able to 
inspire others to follow him into battle.
<P>

<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that General Boyle and 
the defence minister could not inspire soldiers to follow them 
across the street, let alone into battle, and that both should 
therefore be relieved of their responsibilities immediately?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, talking about leadership, I would think that the member 
who asked the question should take a good look at himself first.
<P>
	The wheels were put in motion by this government when it took 
office to look at and to have a review of national defence. Flowing 
directly from that review was a new white paper for the armed 
forces. Flowing directly from that was the restructuring of the 
forces to bring them into the 21st century. Flowing directly from 
that we brought in private enterprise practices in our purchasing 
methods to ensure we received the best value and that they were 
more efficient. That is what we did. That is why they will not

	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

departmental officials, of the auditor general. I do not understand

yet this government and its committee are trying to gag the auditor 
general.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>

	Very simply, my question, a question being asked by people all 
over the country, is as follows: How many trusts are involved, and 
how many billions of dollars have gone out of Canada since the 
federal decision of December 23, 1991, which has been used as 
precedent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

responsible government.
<P>
	We were given from the auditor general advice of a decision that 
was made in 1991 that may not be the kind of decision that he 
would like. In response to that, this government said that we need a 
review of this particular aspect of the Income Tax Act, the first one 
in 25 years, and that has been done.
<P>
	We do things in a responsible fashion, unlike the opposition 
which insists on referring to and confusing Canadians about this 
issue. It is not about family trusts. It is about taxation of migrants. 
It is not about irresponsible officials. There is no evidence of that. 
It is not about erosion of the tax base. They have been unable to 
substantiate that. It is not about the mythology that legislation here 
does not apply to all Canadians, because it does.

is wrong with the plumbing, you call a good plumber, but when 
something is wrong in the army, you are better off with a good

complete confidence in General Boyle.
<P>
	Together they are introducing the necessary reforms. Today, 
General Baril announced the creation of this new position to ensure 
that members of the armed forces can present their grievances to 
this new officer, who will have the specific task of ensuring that all 
authorities are advised of their content.
<P>
	This new position is intended to help improve relations among 
the lowest ranks right on up to the highest echelons of the army.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when it 
gets complicated like that, something must be wrong. Morale is at 
its lowest ebb, and this is mostly due to a lack of leadership.

Speaker, I have nothing to add to what the minister said. There is a 
contract and there is a dispute. I believe Mr. Bouchard and Mr. 
Tobin previously discussed the contract and are making their cases.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the rule of law exists for everybody in 
Canada, but sometimes, when circumstances change, people sit 
down and review the complex problem they face and try to find a 
solution.
<P>
	The minister has said that there is a contract at this time and we 
must respect the contract which is the rule of law in Canada. This is 
not a new issue. It was debated a long time ago. I believe the 
minister gave a very good answer today and yesterday.

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on the Prime Minister's earlier remarks. He 
alluded to the age of my hon. colleague from Témiscamingue. All 
in all, I would rather have less experience and more common sense.
<P>
	This morning, the newspapers reported that, as of August 26, the 
government still had no strategy for using the remaining $45 
million out of the budget originally earmarked for youth programs. 
That makes no sense, considering that one young person out of four 
is desperately looking for work.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. How can the minister justify his government's 
inaction? Does the government lack imagination or is it hoarding 
money so it can spend it during the months preceding an election to 
charm young voters?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will leave any question about 
charm to the hon. young member. But regarding the funding still 
available to create jobs for young Canadians, the plan was 
originally, in the spring, to set funds aside to create jobs during the 
summer for those young Canadians who are in school.
<P>
	We realized, however, that many unemployed people did not fall 
in the category of students going back to school in the fall. That is 
why I plan to work with my colleague, the Minister of Industry, 
Science and Technology, with the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
and with other stakeholders, including the private sector, to find 
appropriate ways of spending these funds. I can assure you, 
however, that every penny earmarked for creating jobs for young 
Canadians will be spent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sick and tired of the government using my generation to score 
political points.
<P>
	When all is said and done, does the minister realize that the 
government's reluctance to invest in jobs for young people speaks 
volumes about its lack of imagination in dealing with young people 
and the terrible unemployment problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we never know what to expect 
from one week to the next. The hon. member and his colleagues 
often rise in this House to tell us we should not get involved in job 
creation or spend money on training and in other areas. What we 
are doing is honouring our commitment not to meddle in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I have no doubt-and I reiterate to my hon. colleague-that all 
the money set aside for creating jobs for young people will be spent 
in due course and I hope that young people will not be as frustrated 
as my friend is.

convoluted contract negotiated  between the Liberal government in 
Newfoundland, the Liberal government in Quebec with the Liberal 
federal government looking over its shoulder.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister simply comment on whether the 
Churchill Falls deal is fair or unfair to Newfoundland?
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am trying to see the thread to the 
administrative responsibility of the government with these 
questions, which appear at least on the surface should be asked in 
another house. If the Prime Minister wishes to address himself to 
whatever question is posed, I would permit him to do so, but I 
cannot see the link to the administrative responsibility of the Prime 
Minister in the question.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I am to comment on every proposition about that type of 
question, there will be no end. We are a government here and we 
are responsible for the actions of the government.
<P>
	I replied to the question before: It is a debate between the 
premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and the premier of Quebec. 
They have already talked about the question and I hope that they 
will still talk about it because both have an interest in having a 
good relationship. There is a lot of potential at the border between 
the two and they have to make sure that the atmosphere is the best 
possible so it will be conducive to more progress.
<P>
	It is not my role at this moment to say to one or the other to 
respect it or not to respect it. We have courts to settle the question 
of legality. I am happy that both said they intend to respect the law 
of the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I asked the question because there is a way the federal 
government could rectify this deal if it is truly unfair outside of the 
contract.
<P>
	The federal government can do two things. First, it could refer 
this issue to the National Energy Board and ask it to determine a 
fair and reasonable allocation of the profits to Newfoundland. 
Second, it could adjust the equalization formula to reduce the 
amount that goes to Quebec by the amount that should go to 
Newfoundland. Has the federal government considered that 
solution to this problem?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if one is issued payment that is the law of this House, of 
Parliament. I have no choice. It has been voted that there will be 
equalization payments and there is a formula that applies according 
to revenues of provinces. The leader of the third party is asking the 
Prime Minister of Canada not to respect the law. I am not that kind 
of Prime Minister.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for decades now the government has been dealing out hard blows to 
francophones outside Quebec. Their lives are becoming 
increasingly difficult. They are losing ground. The rate of 
assimilation keeps on growing. And the government picks this 
moment to strike another hard blow to francophone and Acadian 
communities in Canada through the CBC cuts.
<P>
	My question is for the heritage minister. How can she agree to be 
the one to add yet another blow to the history of francophones 
outside Quebec, one which will help to hasten their assimilation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the number 
of francophones throughout the country is growing. Another fact is 
that, at the present time, after budgets cuts that are hard on 
everyone, what will happen to French language television across 
the country is that francophones in western Canada will see their 
programming doubled from a half an hour a day to one hour.
<P>
	Of course, French language television in the West hurts the Parti 
Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois, who would have people believe 
that francophones are to be found only in Quebec. But we are 
confident that with one hour of French television in western 
Canada, we will be able to improve the situation of western 
francophones and of French language television throughout the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everyone understands that French language radio programming 
will increase, if there are cuts of $20 million and 240 jobs. 
Everyone understands that.
<P>
	How can the heritage minister show herself to be so insensitive 
today about the fate of the francophone and Acadian communities, 
while being so sensitive to their cause when there are referendums?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

deplorable about the hon. members across the way is that they are

other hand, on March 16 last year, the hon. member for Rimouski 
said the following about CBC cuts: ``If any cuts are needed, there 
are big ones to be made at CBC''. In response to the question by 
Michel Lacombe of RDI: ``Concerning CBC headquarters, you are 
surely not recommending that headquarters be totally cut''? The 
hon. member responded: ``Yes.''

treatment.
<P>
	Airlines are free to hire whom they wish. If Air Canada chooses 
to hire a civil servant who was responsible for the negotiation of air

someone previously hired by one of my colleagues on either side of 
the House, that is all right as well. The fact is that we are treating 
the airlines on the basis of strict equality.
<P>
	Having said that, I have to tell the House that we have a new 
policy in place, one which allows Air Canada for the first time to 
fly to Hong Kong, Korea and Japan. It is this government which 
made that change and allowed Air Canada to get that opportunity 
under our secondary airline policy.

<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-45, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility) and another act, be read the third time and passed; and 
of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc has proposed 
that Bill C-45 be hoisted for six months. I think that is a splendid 
idea. I would like to see the bill hoisted indefinitely, if not forever. 
Then maybe the justice committee would have time for a little 
sober second thought and could allow this House to pass judgment 
on the private member's bill of the member for York 
South-Weston. However, we know that is not going to happen 
because the juggernaut is rolling.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is typical of our justice minister's philosophy which 
values the rights of criminals far more than the rights of 
law-abiding, taxpaying, decent citizens. This philosophy does not 
just show up in Bill C-45. There is a pattern. For example, look at 
Bill C-68 which my colleague from Lethbridge has already touched 
on. In his bill the justice minister has expressed a willingness, an 
eagerness to harass and persecute millions of honest people in 
order to promote his social agenda.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Now he has a new thing coming forward, Bill C-55. Ostensibly it 
is to apply more restraint to dangerous offenders and to have to 
some limited extent more control over people who society would 
not countenance. I will admit it is a faltering little step in the right 
direction. But in this same bill there is provision for the 
surveillance and control of people who have never been convicted 
or even openly accused of a crime. What in the name of heaven 
ever happened to due process?
<P>
	Liberals are always great on due process. To be entitled to it a 
person first has to commit a serious crime, preferably a really 
vicious premeditated murder and then the Liberals will love them 
to death. Then our justice system will pull out all the stops to 
protect their rights. But if the person is an ordinary citizen who has 
never done anything to offend anybody, look out. Our justice 
minister will have something in store for him, something which 
flies in the face of all traditional concepts of British and later of 
Canadian jurisprudence.
<P>
	Some people say that it does not help to keep people locked up. 
The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands probably has 
something to say about that. He has a lot to say about everything 
else. I just wonder how the people in his riding would feel about his 
views about just  getting rid of the prisons and throwing the 
prisoners out on the street, that they are good folks and we have got 
to be nice to them and we should not be mean to criminals.
<P>
	Does it help to keep people locked up? I will say one thing, it 
sure cuts down on recidivism. They do not commit a lot of crimes 
when they are already incarcerated.
<P>
	The government calls section 745 the faint hope clause. The 
word on the street is that it is not the faint hope clause; it is the 
almost a sure thing clause. To date, although we have only been 
really using it for two years, 80 per cent of the people who have 
applied for the right to appeal for a reduced sentence have been 
granted that right. What kind of a faint hope are we talking about?
<P>
	The other part of this bill which I find extraordinarily offensive 
and which many people have already mentioned is that it 
establishes a difference between good murderers and bad 
murderers. A person who kills only one person is a good person and 
is not really bad and therefore should not be terribly punished. If 
someone kills two, look out. What happens if three people kill two 
people? What do we do with someone who is guilty of one and a 
half murders?
<P>
	With respect to good murderers and bad murderers, there is one 
Joseph Robinson who about 10 days ago was convicted of second 
degree murder. Perhaps the House will say I am digressing here by 
bringing forward a second degree murder but give me a little 
patience and I will explain where I am coming from.
<P>
	Normally the penalty for second degree murder is life, ten. This 
gentleman was deemed to have been motivated by racism. It was a 
hate crime. His term for parole eligibility was increased by two and 
a half years. I have no trouble with the tougher sentence. As a 
matter of fact, in view of the crime that this gentleman was 
convicted of, I would not have trouble with a much tougher 
sentence. It was an extremely brutal crime and the extra time was 
probably warranted, but hardly the rationale.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	However, if you shoot a police officer for sport, and there are 
two well documented cases of this that I am aware of, you have the 
right after 15 years to come forward and ask to have your parole 
eligibility reconsidered. As was mentioned in this House earlier 
today, one person who did just that had his parole period cut down 
to 18 years. He did shoot a policeman for sport.
<P>
	Where in the name of common sense and rationale is the justice 
in that? We are making a mockery of our justice system. Nobody on 
this side, and I do not think anybody in Canada, is saying hang 
them high, hang them often, throw the key away. For heaven's 
sake, can we not reintroduce a bit of common sense into a system 
that has completely gone off the rails? This is where I come from, 
this is where my colleagues come from, this is where the general 
public of Canada is coming from. They are sick  and tired of seeing

pleased to stand in support of the Bloc's attempt to hoist this 
legislation. This legislation is not really worthy of passing this 
House.
<P>
	What I have seen in the debate around Bill C-45 is a pattern on 
the part of the Liberals across the floor to focus on the rights of the 
poor prisoner, rehabilitation of the poor prisoner, rather than on the 
issues that Canadians really care about, the rights of the victims 
and the safety of our society. Those are the issues that Canadians 
really care about. This legislation shows once again and is part of a 
pattern of this Liberal government in not going nearly far enough 
on legislation and on its actions as government.
<P>
	For example, with regard to the deficit and debt this Liberal 
government has made a start in that area but has not gone far 
enough or fast enough. As a result what we have is almost a $30 
billion deficit added to our debt last year. Now our debt is up to 
almost $600 billion. It is part of the Liberal pattern, not going far 
enough, not being tough enough.
<P>
	What happens as a result of Liberal inaction? The interest 
payments on our debt are almost $50 billion a year and because of 
this increase in interest costs the Liberals have cut spending on 
programs like health care and education. The Liberals have not 
gone far enough.
<P>
	If Reform's zero in three plan had been put in place, and we 
campaigned on this during the last election campaign, we would be 
debating what to do with the surplus. Should we reduce the debt 
more rapidly? Should we maybe spend more on health care and 
education, the areas that are most important to Canadians? That is a 
much better type of debate than most of the debates that we have 
had in this place as a result of Liberal inaction.
<P>
	On every justice issue that has come to the House the Liberals 
have refused to go far enough. Canadians are very unhappy about 
that and very displeased with that. As I have been listening to the 
debate on Bill C-45 and other justice bills over the past three years, 
it is very clear the government does not have the will to do what it 
takes to make our country a safer place in which to live.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	It should be no surprise because in 1972 it was solicitor general 
Goyer and a Liberal government that deliberately changed the 
focus of the justice system. This is part of the problem and part of 
the reason we have not had changes that are nearly tough enough 
and which go in the right direction.
<P>
	This change was a change away from a top priority in our justice 
system, the safety of our society, making our homes and streets 
safe places in which to live.
<P>
	The focus was taken from that and changed. The focus became, 
as we have heard throughout this debate, especially from the 
member for Kingston and the Islands, the rights and rehabilitation 
of the criminals.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands probably got a lot 
of votes with the speech that he gave on this yesterday. What he 
was saying and showing is great concern for those poor prisoners. 
He has a lot of prisons in his riding of Kingston and the Islands. I 
am sure he got the prison vote. I hope they are not enough votes to 
carry him so that he is here in the next election.
<P>
	This change in the focus to where the top priority has become the 
rights of the criminal, rehabilitation of the criminal, must change. 
It is certainly not what Canadians want. The focus that Canadians 
want is a focus that places as the highest priority in our justice 
system the rights of the victim and the safety of all Canadians in 
their homes and in the streets. That is what the focus should be. The 
Liberal's legislation that would move Canada toward that goal of 
being a safer place in which to live has been dismal indeed.
<P>
	On the other hand, Reform has proposed several substantial 
changes that would refocus the justice system on the rights of the 
victims and on safety of people in this country.
<P>
	For example, the hon. member for Fraser Valley West presented 
last spring a victims bill of rights focusing on the victim. The 
Liberals refuse to focus on the rights of victims. They do not seem 
to care about the victim.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley West presented a victims bill 
of rights. Had it passed, it would have become law. Did the Liberals 
support Reform on the effort to refocus the justice system, to give a 
higher priority to the rights of victims? Did the Liberals support 
this move? No. They voted against it. That legislation was shot 
down. Because of that, the victims still do not have the rights they 
deserve.
<P>
	I want to quickly, because it is worthy of some debate and 
recognition, go through some of the points that the hon. member 
for Fraser Valley West has put forth in his victims rights bill, which 
is the type of legislation that Canadians want.
<P>
	For example, he said victims should have the right to be 
informed of their rights at every stage of the process, including 
those rights involving compensation from the offender. They must 
also be made aware of any victim services available. It does not 
happen now.
<P>
	They must be informed of the offender's status throughout the 
process including but not restricted to notification of any arrest, 
upcoming court dates, sentencing dates, plans to release the 
offender from custody, including notification into which 
community the parolee is being released and the conditions of 
release, parole dates and all that type of information.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4638"> 4638 </A></B>
<P>
	We would think in a country like Canada with supposedly a well 
developed justice system that the victim would be shown at least 
as much consideration as the criminal. That is not the case. That 
change is needed.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Another proposal by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West is 
that the victim would have the right to choose between giving oral 
and/or written impact statements before sentencing. It is a right one 
would expect in Canada.
<P>
	If this Liberal government will refocus, if it will come back 
again and do what Canadians want, focusing much more on the 
rights of the victim and on the safety of society, we will not have 
nonsense legislation like this and Canadians will be much more 
pleased with what it is doing. Right now Canadians are extremely 
upset with the inaction of the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could not let the moment pass. I listened to colleagues 
opposite who have made a point here this afternoon of detailing in 
debate how bad things are. I do not for a moment think the 
Canadian criminal justice system is nearly as bad as they say it is.
<P>
	The most important thing I want to say here today is that both of 
my colleagues opposite have failed to address the bill that is being 
debated here now. Each one of them has criticized the section 745 
procedure that is now in the Criminal Code. They have attempted 
to outline why it is unbalanced, unfair, inappropriate, unjust. But 
neither one of them has stated what this bill, which amends the 
section 745 procedure, does.
<P>
	It attempts to redress the perceived unfairness that existed in that 
procedure. It increases the criteria that would enable someone 
convicted of a capital crime, someone who is serving more than 15 
years in prison, to readdress the issue of parole ineligibility.
<P>
	This bill raises the bar, raises the standards so it will be 
extremely difficult for someone to obtain a reduction in the period 
of parole ineligibility. Some of my colleagues think this bill goes 
too far and is too strict and will make it virtually impossible for a 
convict to obtain a reduction in a parole ineligibility period.
<P>
	I know most of my colleagues on this side of the House support 
the bill, support the purpose for which it was put forward. They 
believe it will redress inequities perceived by the Canadian public 
with respect to the application of this section.
<P>
	In case anyone would want to take members opposite as having 
the complete picture on criminal justice reform, each of the 
colleagues opposite has failed to note criminal law reform 
initiatives, statutes passed in this House involving the corrections 
act, the Criminal Code, the Young Offenders Act and the Prisons 
and Reformatories Act, all of which have been passed and are  
being worked on by this Parliament. Not a mention of these 
progressive reforms in the criminal justice area. I wanted the 
record to show that just in case anybody might have failed to note 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say a 
few words on this topic. I cannot believe that we are taking such 
mediocre steps to solve what is a very big problem.
<P>
	I do not know if all the members here have gone through the 
trauma of having a person in their family murdered. We have and it 
is devastating. It is absolute abhorrent. It is totally impossible to 
imagine. If any of us were to imagine that this evening our life 
might come to an end because someone else would choose to take 
it, it would give us a perspective on this problem that is quite 
different.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We need to pay very close attention to what we are talking about 
and that is the gravity of the situation. We need to send a message 
loud and clear that cannot be mistaken, that in our society, in our 
country, it is not acceptable to contemplate and to actually carry out 
the taking of the life of another person. If that message does not 
come through, then I do not know what does.
<P>
	I am aware of the fact that we cannot pass a law that will make 
people good. I do not think that is possible.
<P>
	The purpose of the law is to restrain those who are not good. The 
purpose of the law is to say to that person who is contemplating the 
act of first degree murder that the person is going to have to say: 
``If I do this, there are big consequences for me''. Right now in 
Canada those consequences are inadequate.
<P>
	We are talking in this bill about the question of first degree 
murder, contemplated, carried out deliberately. I urge members, 
especially the Liberal members, who are the ones who can do 
something about this, who are the majority in the House, they are 
the people ones who can say by voting correctly on this bill we 
want to send that message. We want to protect society. We want to 
protect the lives of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Failure to do so is failure to exercise our responsibility as 
parliamentarians to do what is right in protecting law-abiding 
citizens in this country.

	The House resumed from September 17 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to amend the Prisons and 
Reformatories Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Bill C-53, 
an act to amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act.
<P>
	I have had the chance to observe what has been going on here 
over the last couple of weeks and indeed what has been going on in 
this House over the last few months.  What we have here is a simple 
case of Liberal electioneering.
<P>
	I give the Liberal Party more credit than do most Canadians. The 
Liberal Party knows very well that the criminal justice system is a 
huge concern in the minds of the Canadian people. Liberals have 
done their polling and their homework and know that most 
Canadians think there is a huge void between where the criminal 
justice system is and where it should be.
<P>
	Let me be the first to say that my colleagues in the Reform Party 
and I take a whole lot of credit for getting out the information to the 
Canadian people. It has raised their awareness to a point where they 
are starting to say that there is something wrong with the justice 
system.
<P>
	The Liberals know that the Canadian people are very concerned 
about the justice system, the way the prisons, the parole system and 
the sentencing procedures are. The Liberals are trying to balance 
just how much it will take to make the Canadian people think that 
they are actually doing something about the disparities in the 
criminal justice system. They are trying to balance that and at the 
same time not offend the bleeding heart philosophy of the Liberal 
Party and most of its members.
<P>
	If ever there was a definition of a conundrum, we have it right 
here between the Liberal philosophy of dealing with the criminal 
justice system, with people who commit murders and robberies and 
with people who drive impaired and kill people. There is a problem 
in dealing with all of those issues in the criminal justice system and 
balancing that against Liberal philosophy.
<P>
	I do not envy the Liberals for being in that position. The fact is 
that when it comes to being honest with themselves, let alone with 
the Canadian people, when they are faced with this situation they 
honestly know they cannot give Canadians what they want because 
it throws their philosophy out of balance.
<P>
	What we have here is a situation of tinkering, smoke and 
mirrors, deception, making believe that they are doing something 
but they are not. We see the government failing to take the 
necessary steps to restore justice to the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-53 would amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act by 
adding a statement of purposes and principles with respect to the 
temporary absence programs. It also permits the provinces to 
create additional types of temporary absence programs for people 
convicted of crimes. Further, and this comes as no surprise as far as 
this government is concerned, Bill C-53 will extend the period of 
temporary absences to 60 days. Does this mean that prisoners are 
now going to be able to go on a Club Med holiday because they 
have more time out of the can?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4640"> 4640 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, the bill sets out the grounds for suspending, cancelling 
or revoking temporary absences and confers the power to 
apprehend and return persons to custody.
<P>
	Those are the provisions contained within the bill, but a huge 
concern to the Reform Party and of far more importance is what is 
not included in the bill. What is not included in the bill is a clear 
statement that the protection of society must be paramount, the 
most important thing, of prime consideration with respect to 
temporary absence decisions. What is not in this bill is a statement 
that says the most important thing when considering temporary 
absences must be the protection of the Canadian people, of society, 
of our wives, of our husbands, of our children, of our 
grandchildren, of our cousins, of the Canadian law-abiding people.
<P>
	Why is this not in the bill? Because this Liberal government has 
a philosophy which is held over from the Trudeau days. It is a 
philosophy that was brought to this House and this Parliament by 
the members for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Kingston and the Islands, 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, and the Prime Minister himself. 
All the holdovers from the Trudeau government. I am sorry, the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell was probably a little bit 
young then but that philosophy is still here.
<P>
	The Liberal philosophy is that as a Liberal government it must 
place the rights of prisoners on the same plane as the rights of 
law-abiding citizens and victims. That is the philosophy of this 
government. The government may ask: ``Well why do we lock 
them up if that is the case?'' The fact that they lock them up is that 
the law says they have to, but this government is doing everything 
it can do to change that law and let them out. That is the problem 
and we have it right here in Bill C-53.
<P>
	The Corrections and Conditional Release Act which governs the 
behaviour of the parole board has a clear statement that the 
protection of society is to be the most important factor in 
determining whether or not a prisoner should be given parole. I 
suppose it is only a matter of time before the Liberals will try to 
amend that act to remove that statement.
<P>
	Bill C-53 considers the protection of society to be of the same 
importance as the prisoner's rehabilitation and reintegration into 
the community. Personally I find it quite appalling that this 
government would have the audacity to put the protection of 
society, of people who have never committed a crime, our children, 
our brothers, our sisters, our parents, the protection of law-abiding 
Canadians on the same plane and the same importance as the 
prisoner's rehabilitation and reintegration into the communities. 
That is the most appalling philosophy I have ever heard and this 
government has done it.
<P>
	Once again the Liberals are elevating and promoting the rights of 
criminals. It is as simple as that. Let me just repeat that. Once again 
this Liberal government is attempting to elevate and promote the 
rights of criminals.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals may want to pat themselves on the back for that but 
I am sure the Canadian people will not give them a hand on that 
one. The bill says to Canadians that their safety as law-abiding 
Canadians, as families is not the primary responsibility of the 
correctional system.
<P>
	This Liberal government has the nerve, the audacity to put 
forward a bill that says to Canadians their safety is not the prime 
responsibility of the corrections system. Congratulations. Their 
safety is of no more importance than a criminal's rehabilitation. 
Congratulations. This is absolutely ludicrous. How can this 
government, how can these Liberals even consider the thought?
<P>
	How can they consider saying to Canadians: ``I am sorry, the 
correctional system in this country really does not think that the 
safety of our families and our communities is important. Therefore, 
we are going to elevate the rights and the privileges and promote 
that criminals get out into society quicker. Do not worry, if they 
commit another crime, we will just pick them up, put them back in 
and then go through the same process again''.
<P>
	The Liberals opposite are saying that I am crazy. Let us listen to 
what the Library of Parliament has to say. These are not my words. 
The Library of Parliament says that this bill gives less importance 
to the protection of society than does the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act. This appears in the legislative summary 
prepared for all members by the Library of Parliament. It does not 
represent my personal opinion on the bill. This is an impartial 
opinion of the contents and effects of this bill.
<P>
	The legislative summary also states: ``The principles set out 
relating to temporary absences are similar to those set out in the 
CCRA with the significant exception''-this is the Library of 
Parliament-``that in the act the protection of society is to be the 
paramount consideration in the determination of any case''. I go 
back to what I said before. It is not so much what is in this bill; it is 
what has been left out, that is, the consideration of society when it 
comes to releasing criminals into the community.
<P>
	Members will note that the author of the Library of Parliament 
legislative summary uses the term ``significant exception''. They 
picked it up right away. They agree with Reformers when we say 
that this bill does nothing to protect society. It will in effect place 
the protection of society on the same plane as the rehabilitation and 
reintegration of criminals into our society. That is appalling. 
Canadians will not and cannot accept that for a moment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4641"> 4641 </A></B>
<P>
	That is just a symptom. That is a result of this Liberal 
philosophy that was born in the Trudeau era and brought forward 
to this Parliament by members of Parliament who were present 
then. We see it so much in evidence today.
<P>
	The author from the Library of Parliament uses the term 
``significant exception'' with good reason. It is very significant that 
the Liberals do not consider the protection of society to be their 
primary concern. That is significant and we have seen it.
<P>
	Time after time they have presented government bills in the 
House that purport to toughen up the justice system, that purport to 
get tough on criminals, that purport to get tough on people who 
commit horrendous crimes in this country. In actuality they are just 
a smokescreen to fool the Canadian people into thinking this 
Liberal government actually cares about whether people who do 
crimes in this country pay a price for them or not.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Of equal concern to the Liberals, judging by some of the bills 
they have brought forth, is the criminal's rehabilitation and 
reintegration into society. I believe that this is wrong that they 
place these two things on the same plane. The protection of society 
must be reflected in every single part of the criminal justice 
system. The protection of society must be paramount.
<P>
	No other part of the criminal justice system deserves to be even 
anywhere equal to the protection of our society. No rights of 
criminals, nothing to do with the parole system, nothing to do with 
lenient sentencing, nothing to do with temporary releases; none of 
that should even begin to come on the same scale as the protection 
of our society, of our children, of our sisters, our brothers, our 
parents in this country. Nothing should ever even begin to climb the 
scale to get to the level that protection of society is.
<P>
	I read these bills and I think are they nuts over there? Where is 
their logic? I need to give the Liberals a simple lesson in the 
purpose of our justice system. I am even going to dumb it down for 
them so they can understand. They should listen closely. We put 
bad people in prison to punish them for their bad acts and protect 
society from their bad behaviour. Is that too complicated for this 
government to understand? We put bad people in prisons and we 
punish them.
<P>
	There is no way that anyone in their right mind could even 
consider supporting Bill C-53. It is a bill with so much audacity, 
with so much trickery in it, with so much electioneering in it that it 
does not even deserve a place in this House. I certainly oppose it 
and so do my colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about 
rhetoric. I heard nothing but rhetoric from the last speaker.
<P>
	If he wants to consult <I>Hansard</I> of last week he will note that even 
his colleague from Fraser Valley is almost about to support the bill. 
I question whether the hon. member has even taken the time to read 
the bill.
<P>
	We are not talking about a bill which addresses criminal justice 
issues. We are talking about a bill which allows provinces and 
territories to address the severe problems they have with the 
administering of inmates within their jurisdictions. That is people 
of less than two years and a day. We are not talking about hard core 
criminals.
<P>
	In the federal system there is a procedure in place for us to 
administer the penitentiary system called the National Parole 
Board. Some provinces have that mechanism in their jurisdiction. 
The majority of them do not have that privilege in their legislation. 
The temporary absence system is then used in place of parole to 
administer those prisoners who are in for an average of less than six 
months.
<P>
	When I hear the member say this applies to hard core criminals, 
we are going to let them out and we are going to endanger the 
public security, I have a hard time. I doubt if he even read the bill.
<P>
	This bill is an initiative which has been discussed by federal, 
provincial and territorial leaders, all ministers responsible for 
justice in their territories since May 1996. They have asked our 
government to give them the same leverage and the same latitude 
to deal with the administration of their justice system. It has 
nothing to do with what the hon. member was talking about.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The provincial-territorial actions program will allow the 
provinces to control offenders in their jurisdictions. It will allow 
provincial prisoners leave for a specified period of time, with or 
without an escort, for medical, humanitarian or rehabilitative 
purposes. It is designed to help offenders reintegrate into the 
community. They are going to serve their two years less a day 
sooner or later.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member, if all the federal and provincial ministers 
are in agreement with the bill, if the Bloc Quebecois is in 
agreement with the bill, if members on this side of the House are in 
agreement with the bill, what is his concern?
<P>
	This bill will allow the provinces and territories the flexibility to 
tailor their temporary absence programs according to their needs in 
their provinces and in their communities. That is all we are dealing 
with. We are not dealing with all the issues the hon. member raised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member 
opposite about a little phrase that one of the  health groups is using 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4642"> 4642 </A></B>
<P>
now: just say no. The reason they say just say no is that doing that 
activity will have a harmful effect on them.
<P>
	I am saying to the government just because someone asks it to 
soften up a bit and give a little more latitude in working out a more 
lenient way to deal with prisoners in the provincial system, that 
does not mean it has to say ``of course, go ahead and do it''.
<P>
	The government needs some backbone. It should tell them: ``I 
am sorry, the Canadian people do not want us to soften up the 
justice system. They want us to toughen up the justice system. No, 
we are not going to pass the bill. We are not going to give you the 
additional freedom to treat prisoners in a more lenient manner. I am 
sorry no, the people do not want it''. Why do you not have the guts 
to say that?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before we continue the 
questions or comments I would like to make two points. I remind 
all members to make their interventions through the Chair and also 
to be very judicious in the choice of their words to support their 
arguments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague from the Reform Party is citing such individual cases 
that we might perhaps accept, but then they flood us with stories of 
this person or that in their questions, they seem to want to go for 
guilty and the death penalty. I find that despicable.
<P>
	I think that a bill whose goal is to protect society is very 
worthwhile. However, I would like to add something. I have 
worked in secondary schools almost all my life, and when a young 
person was a delinquent when he came to us, we had to wonder. 
When a young girl had already been involved in serious 
misdemeanours before coming to us, we had to wonder. Was it the 
fault of this 13, 14 or 17 year old, or was it something in their 
background?
<P>
	As for myself, I would like to see this bill include something 
about helping to protect seven, eight, nine and ten year olds in 
primary school. We must give young people a great deal of help, 
and if we put out the money needed to protect them, they would not 
turn up in prison at 18, 20 or 30 years of age, and we would not be 
having the sort of discussions we are having today about how to 
keep them in prison, essentially rehabilitate them. It is no easy 
thing to spend 20 or 25 years in prison. We have to think about that 
too.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Society must, of course, be protected, and when someone has 
committed a crime, he must be punished. I would like to put the 
following question to my colleague. Instead of spending hours 
talking about how to punish people, should we not be looking 
harder at prevention?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I actually could not agree with the 
hon. member more. Let us talk about prevention. Let us have the 
nerve to talk about the consequences of committing a crime in this 
country. That is prevention. Let us tell the people out there at the 
grade school level, at the university level, people in their 20s and 
30s, people of all ages in this country, if they commit a crime in 
this country we are not going to let them get away with it. There is 
going to be a consequence.
<P>
	That is called deterrence. However, the Liberal government and 
the separatist group here do not seem to understand the word 
deterrent. When I was a kid my mother told me: ``If you do that, it 
is wrong and you will pay a price. There will be a consequence to 
that''. That was a deterrent.
<P>
	I do not think that kids have changed that much that in their early 
learning years to not understand that if they do something wrong 
there will be a consequence. What has changed is the attitude of 
governments like this and parties like this which say: ``We are 
sorry, there is no such thing as a bad person, only a person who has 
been a victim of society and these people should be treated fairly 
because it is not really their fault''.
<P>
	I talked about the Trudeau era which started that philosophy and 
it is still present today in this Liberal government and with the 
separatists here there is no such thing as a bad person. They are not 
to blame. Society made them that way. That is bunk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley for doing such a fine job in elucidating 
this very important issue that affects Canadians from coast to coast. 
I think he raised a very important point which the government 
tends to forget. Canadians today are more afraid in their homes 
than they have ever been in the last 20 years. Sometimes the facts 
do not support it, but in many cases the facts do support that. I will 
get to that later in my speech.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-53, an act to amend the Prisons 
and Reformatories Act. The purpose of the bill is to change the 
temporary absence program, creating additional types of temporary 
absences, and to lengthen the time temporary absences are 
available.
<P>
	Let us stand back and look at what this actually means. If a crime 
is committed and a conviction obtained at public expense, and 
sometimes it can be a threat to the men and women in our police 
forces, the felon is released on a temporary absence program. The 
felon does not pay a penalty for actually committing the crime. 
That is a very important thing to realize. It means that if a felon 
commits a crime and is convicted, the felon is then released back 
into society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4643"> 4643 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me give an example. A friend of mine checks on people 
out on temporary absence programs. He went to Vancouver to 
check up at the home of a convicted cocaine seller who lives in 
an opulent home in Vancouver. This person is smiling away, going 
full and continues to sell cocaine through his back door. He is 
living in a home worth millions of dollars and is laughing at the 
police officers who come to his door. That is an example of a 
temporary absence program. That is not what the taxpayer wants 
to hear. That is not justice. That is not the way the criminal justice 
system should work, but in this instance that is the way it is 
working. The government wants to make this even more lenient.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the overall crime situation in Canada with 
statistics from the National Crime Prevention Council. In 1994, 
contrary to what the government says, the crime rate was 8 per cent 
higher than a decade ago, and this is probably under-reported.
<P>
	A substantial number of crimes are never reported to the police 
for a number of reasons. The statistics are truly appalling. It is 
notable that 90 per cent of sexual assaults and 68 per cent of 
non-sexual assaults are not reported. These are violent crimes that 
are not reported to the police. The victims go unheard. They do not 
get restitution. The criminals continue to go on their merry way 
with no penalty.
<P>
	About 80 per cent of crimes are committed by only 20 per cent of 
the population. For future reference, it is exceedingly important for 
us to identify who those 20 per cent are. I know the government 
will not disagree with that.
<P>
	We got some laughs from the other side when I mentioned that 
Canadians were more scared today than they were before. 
According to the statistics of the National Crime Prevention 
Council, not mine, not the Reform Party's, one in four Canadians 
feel unsafe walking in their neighbourhoods at night. Only 10 per 
cent of males reported feeling unsafe, but 42 per cent, nearly half 
the female population, felt unsafe walking in their neighbourhoods.
<P>
	That is not the society that Canadians want. That is not the 
society of which we should be proud, and it is something that we, 
the legislators of this country, must change. It must be an 
embarrassment to every person in this House to face up to that 
statistic.
<P>
	It means that half the wives of the men in this House are afraid to 
walk in their own neighbourhoods. It means that half of the female 
children of the people in this House are afraid to walk in their 
neighbourhoods. That is totally unacceptable and must change.
<P>
	I saw the Minister of Justice on a CBC television program saying 
that violent crime is not as bad as we think. Let us look at an 
independent statistic on that matter. According to police statistics, 
the rate of violent crime in Canada has increased fourfold in the 
past three decades. That is 400 per cent in the last three decades. 
Bear in mind that those statistics are under-reported, as I said 
earlier. The vast majority of violent crimes never come to the 
attention of the police.
<P>
	Youth crime is worse. Criminal Code offences by youth have 
increased by 16 per cent since 1986 and violent crime among youth 
has escalated dramatically. We have heard this time and time again 
from my colleagues and the government has repeatedly ignored 
them. But it ignores youth crime at its peril.
<P>
	The public has repeatedly said to the government and to us that it 
wants this fixed and fixed now. Canadians no longer want to be 
fearful of walking in their own backyards, something we as 
Canadians should never have to do.
<P>
	Since 1962, when penalties started to be reduced for committing 
crimes, when governments got soft on crime, rates began to 
increase. What the government said to the public was that if you are 
victimized you will not see restitution; you are not going to see 
retribution.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	What it said to the police is that no matter what hard work they 
put into it they will not be able to put criminals behind bars. What 
is happening now is many of them are standing back and asking 
why they should do it any more. It is a sad thing.
<P>
	What it tells the public, who feel they are not being protected by 
the justice department, is that they now have to take matters into 
their own hands and vigilante justice may be their only recourse. 
That is not something we would like to see in Canada. If we start 
having vigilante justice we progress along that slippery slope 
toward anarchy.
<P>
	The real reason for Bill C-53 is that jails are too crowded. The 
government wants to decrease the pressure on the jails, which we 
completely understand. However, in doing so, it wants to put more 
and more people on these temporary absence programs.
<P>
	We are not opposed to temporary absence programs, but it must 
be done with forethought and within a certain framework. The most 
important overriding concern in this framework has to be the 
protection of the public and of innocent people above all else. That 
is the role of justice first and foremost. It has other roles certainly, 
but the government has forgotten that. The roots of this began in 
the early 1980s when the solicitor general of the day, a Liberal, said 
that from now on the justice department's primary role would be 
not the protection of society but serving the criminal. It is going to 
be the rehabilitation of the criminal, not the protection of society.
<P>
	That is a significant departure. What we want to do here is get 
the justice department back to having as its primary focus the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4644"> 4644 </A></B>
<P>
protection of innocent civilians. It is not to say that the 
rehabilitation of the criminal is not important. If we ignore that we 
ignore it at our peril. However, there are intelligent and effective 
ways of doing that. I will get back to that a little later because the 
experience in the United States has been very fruitful and cost 
effective.
<P>
	The framework must be, as I said before, the protection of the 
public. This cannot apply to violent criminals and must certainly 
not apply to any criminal who is going to continue doing what got 
them into jail in the first place. It cannot apply either to non-violent 
criminals who demonstrate no remorse. A non-violent criminal in 
this situation is going to commit criminal acts again.
<P>
	It is also in the public interest to understand the situation that is 
taking place right now in our criminal justice system. When a 
person is convicted of a crime, automatically one-third of the 
sentence gets knocked off and often times that person will only 
serve one-third of the total sentence. Therefore, two-thirds of a 
person's sentence is knocked off for good behaviour. A criminal is 
automatically deemed to have good behaviour and have one-third 
of his or her sentence knocked off by the system. That is very 
disingenuous to the victim who believes that if a person who is 
sentenced to 15 years that person will spend 15 years in jail.
<P>
	Perhaps the most glaring example of this is section 745 of the 
Criminal Code which states that if a person commits first degree 
murder by killing a police office he or she can get out in 15 years. 
There is a list longer than my arm of individuals who have 
committed first degree murder and have been let out shortly after 
their 15th year of prison. We want to see that revised because first 
degree murder means first degree murder and it means the person 
spends 25 years in prison. It does not sent a clear message to those 
who commit this most heinous of crimes that they should be getting 
out after 15 years. If they do the crime they must pay the time.
<P>
	I would also like to give some examples of the absurdity that is 
taking place in our criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I was at a correctional facility treating some patients not so long 
ago. The first patient I saw had a large laceration in his arm. I said 
to him while I was sewing him up: ``How did you get this?'' He 
said: ``Doctor, I got this because I was making a knife''. This man, 
while incarcerated in jail, was making a knife. He was not the only 
one making knives because making knives was part of their 
program in that medium security jail, one of our newest I might 
add.
<P>
	This same jail, which cost $175,000 per cell to build and which 
has a beautiful foyer with vaulted ceilings, has cameras. In the area 
where the inmates are housed they have their cells and then they 
have a communal area where they eat, play cards and talk. The 
guards are in the middle of this without any protection. 
Furthermore, the charter of rights prevents a camera from being on 
that communal area because it is an infringement of their privacy, 
the same individuals who are making knives in jail.
<P>
	I am sure the taxpayer would be very interested to know that they 
are paying $60,000 to $80,000 a year to house individuals in jails 
where they are making knives. That is not justice, for crying out 
loud.
<P>
	In the jail previous to this one, the inmates decided to set the jail 
on fire. There were soiled clothes and water everywhere. The 
inmates were locked up. Who was cleaning this mess up, but the 
guards, not the inmates. That is the situation that we have.
<P>
	The guards are afraid for their own safety and they are afraid of 
actually doing a number of duties that they have to do for fear of 
retribution from the inmates. That is the situation in many of the 
correctional facilities across the country. That speaks well of our 
criminal justice system, but it speaks of what this government and 
previous governments have done to completely turn our criminal 
justice system on its head. Justice must protect society at all costs. 
It is not doing that at all.
<P>
	Last, I would like to let the government understand that there 
will be some superb suggestions coming from my colleague from 
Calgary Northeast and my colleague from Wild Rose on a number 
of areas on how to revamp our justice system and prevent crime.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party have often been accused of being 
hang'em high. We are not hang'em high. We want effective 
solutions to address crime, the appropriate punishment, appropriate 
protection of the public and appropriate, effective methods of 
rehabilitating criminals.
<P>
	We do not want the situation we have today, which has proven 
not to work but cost effective solutions that will work. I will give 
some examples. These are not examples that my colleagues will 
mention because they will announce this in the very near future. 
These are a few from my personal experience.
<P>
	We have to separate the psychiatric patients from the 
non-psychiatric patients in our criminal justice system. One of the 
silent tragedies that is occurring is the closing of psychiatric 
hospitals.
<P>
	There has been a mindset of taking these psych patients and 
putting them in the community. For some, that is acceptable. For 
many, unfortunately, it is not. They are not given a choice. The 
choice is not there for them.
<P>
	All we need to do is walk along the streets, even in Ottawa, and 
see the number of burnt out schizophrenics walking the streets. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4645"> 4645 </A></B>
<P>
Many other psych patients are not medicated and walking the 
streets, often falling afoul of the law and often suffering.
<P>
	It does a disservice not only to these people who are ill but it 
does a disservice to the public too, who have to suffer from the 
unfortunately criminal activity that these people engage in while 
they are perhaps psychotic. That has to be done. These people have 
to get the appropriate treatment, otherwise they will never get 
better.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	To address the recidivism rate, we have to pull out that 20 per 
cent of the prison population which repeatedly continues to show 
an abhorrent respect for Canadian society. We must pull them out 
and deal with them in a much firmer and very different way than 
the 80 per cent who do not repeatedly run afoul of the law.
<P>
	While in jail skills training should be obligatory for individuals 
so that when they come out they can gain employment and become 
integrated back into society. One of the problems with individuals 
once they get out of a correctional facility is there are not many 
support programs for them and there is not a lot for them to do. 
They have a great deal of difficulty integrating back into society 
because they do not have the skills necessary to deal with that. This 
must be dealt with.
<P>
	Also, alcohol and other substance abuse problems have to be 
dealt with while incarcerated in jail. That should be obligatory. If 
an individual is not prepared to deal with it, they should be dealt 
with differently too. There is no point in putting them back on the 
street as a cocaine addict if it contributed to the reason why they 
ran afoul of the law.
<P>
	Last, it is wise for us to look at the experience in the inner cities 
of the United States. Columbia University did an excellent job of 
taking children at the age of four and five in school, bringing the 
parents into the schools and teaching the children not only their 
ABCs but also about self-respect, respect for others, appropriate 
conflict resolution, drugs, alcohol and so on. They learned that. The 
parents also learned these skills if they had never learned 
themselves. The outcome was a much lower rate of teen pregnancy, 
violence and drop-outs.
<P>
	I thank the House for its time and consideration. I sincerely hope 
the government pays attention to these suggestions and the 
suggestions of my hon. colleagues.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I always listen to 
the hon. member for Esquimalt-Jean de Fuca with respect, for 
normally he uses good judgment. This time, while being less 
zealous than his Reform colleagues, he is still speaking along the 
same lines.
<P>
	I understand what fear is. He speaks of people being afraid to go 
out in their own neighbourhoods. I do not have the statistics with 
me, but in Quebec, at least when I looked at the figure for my 
region, 80 per cent of  murders were committed by people known to 
the victim. More often than not, three out of four times I think, the 
murderer was a former partner, and in more than half of these cases 
or something like that, he then took his own life.
<P>
	I certainly take no pleasure in such statistics. We are seeing the 
increase of such cases, but at the same time the crime rate in 
Quebec and in all of Canada is decreasing. Yet the Reform Party is 
still raising the argument that people are afraid.
<P>
	I am not all that old. I have not yet turned 50, but I can remember 
how frightened my grandmother was, how frightened my mother 
was, how frightened women have always been, both in cities and in 
the country. If we take fear as a criterion, there is unfortunately no 
polling company that can do a historical study for us, but I am sure 
that, if such a study were done, it would be seen that there have 
always been people who were afraid.
<P>
	Yes, there are worrisome things going on, particularly where 
young people are concerned. I say that there are too many violent 
shows on television, and that could be one explanation.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	As I know the member who just spoke to be level headed and 
usually of good judgement, I would like him to confirm to me, as 
he is a doctor, that there has been an increase in violent crime, 
leaving out the crimes committed by ex-spouses, people who know 
each other and criminals settling scores with other criminals. Is 
there really an increase where he lives in Vancouver, and is it that 
serious in this region? If so, he should warn us, because I may have 
to go to Vancouver next week.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my honourable friend from the Bloc Quebecois. Merci 
beaucoup pour votre question.
<P>
	The statistics I am very happy to share with the hon. member do 
not come from the Reform Party. These statistics come from the 
National Crime Prevention Council of Canada and they 
demonstrate unequivocally that the rate of crime, violent crime in 
particular, has increased and this in fact is paralleled by an increase 
in fear among the Canadian populace. In terms of breaking that 
down to those who knew their assailant and those who did not, I do 
not have that breakdown.
<P>
	I concur with the member that most people who are victims of 
violent crime do know their assailant but I do not know whether 
those numbers are increasing. However, the overall picture clearly 
demonstrates that there is an increase in violent crime particularly 
among youth and that people are afraid across this country 
including les gens de Québec about their personal safety. That must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4646"> 4646 </A></B>
<P>
be dealt with and is something that all of us collectively in this 
House can put our minds to and address.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the last two speakers from the Reform Party have spent an 
awful lot of time focusing on the general background of criminal 
law legislation, the fears of Canadians and those types of things. 
While those issues are important, although I am not saying I agree 
that there is all this fear they say is out there, surely they again have 
missed the point of dealing with the legislation at hand and I want 
to ask the hon. member to comment on this.
<P>
	This particular statute addresses the institutional aspects of 
responding to criminal behaviour after people have been sentenced 
by the courts. It deals with institutions that deal with offenders who 
have sentences up to two years.
<P>
	The federal legislation for the federal institutions that deal with 
all of the other longer term offenders, the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, was recently amended here in this House 
for the second time. First on the list it deals prominently with 
public safety.
<P>
	This statute which we debate here is an attempt to parallel and 
incorporate much of what is in that CCRA statute by concept and it 
deals with the administration of temporary absences. It tightens up 
on the administrative ability to terminate, cancel and administer 
them. In other words, addressing public safety.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not think he has failed in addressing this 
bill to and acknowledge that the government in this case is 
updating the Prisons and Reformatories Act to bring it in line with 
the CCRA, which has as its number one focus protection and safety 
of the public?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to point out to my hon. friend that nobody in the Reform Party 
ever fails, and he should understand that very clearly first of all.
<P>
	I think we ought to cut to the chase. The real reason for this bill 
is to empty the jails because the jails are overflowing. This and 
previous governments have been completely unable to deal with 
increase in crime that we see in a number of sectors.
<P>
	I think it is disingenuous for the government to admit anything 
else. The lengthening of temporary absence programs is merely 
sending a message to the criminal population that if they are going 
to commit the crime there is less chance they will have to do time.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is high time we all put our minds to developing better solutions 
which prevent people from running afoul of the law and to ensuring 
that the 20 per cent of the people who will be repeat offenders will 
be dealt with in a very forceful manner. For the remainder, the 80 
per  cent, the temporary absence programs must be based on merit. 
The temporary absence must be earned, not automatically granted. 
We must have, first and foremost as our primary motive the 
protection of society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-53 which is before us today. I am not 
pleased to speak to it because it is a substantial piece of legislation 
or because when the bill passes it will make changes to improve the 
system. It will not. I am pleased to speak to the bill because it gives 
me a chance to very clearly point out the difference between the 
Liberals and their totally ineffective legislation on crime and 
justice and Reform and our substantial and comprehensive 
proposals which will make the system better. Our proposals are in 
line with what Canadians want.
<P>
	The member for Scarborough-Rouge River in asking a 
question to the previous speaker pointed out that the legislation 
only deals with sentences which are less than two years in duration 
and, therefore we are not really dealing with serious offenders. I 
disagree.
<P>
	If that member were to ask his female colleagues in the House, 
he would find that they are not only concerned with being raped 
and murdered, they are concerned when they take that walk into the 
parking lot at night that somebody might try to steal their purse or 
that somebody might give them a violent push. They are concerned 
that when they are at work their homes might be broken into.
<P>
	These crimes are not considered to be serious. These crimes 
violate what I believe is a right of all Canadians, a right to feel safe 
and to be safe in our streets, in our parking lots and in our homes.
<P>
	I completely disagree with the member. These are very serious 
offences which do very serious damage to people not only 
physically but also psychologically.
<P>
	We should not make light of this issue just because we are 
dealing with sentences of under two years. That is a big mistake.
<P>
	I am going to take a little time to go through Bill C-53. It is an 
act to amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act. It would add a 
statement of purpose for temporary absence programs and it would 
authorize the provinces to create additional types of temporary 
absence programs.
<P>
	The key issue for Reform is that although the principles relating 
to temporary absence are similar to those set out in the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act, there is one substantial and very 
serious exception. In the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
the protection of society is to be of paramount consideration, 
whereas in this act that is not the case. In that way this legislation is 
actually a step backward. That principle is found nowhere in Bill 
C-53.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4647"> 4647 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-53 would consider prisoner rehabilitation and 
reintegration into society as equal to the consideration of the 
protection of society.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	Again, this resulted from years and years of Liberal thinking, the 
same Liberal thinking that led to the changes in the justice system 
which took the focus away from the protection of Canadians so 
they can feel safe in their homes and in their streets. But I will talk 
more about that later.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is an extension of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act and would expand the scope and number of temporary 
release programs in Canada. Past experience has demonstrated that 
temporary absence, especially for violent and serious repeat 
offenders could jeopardize public safety.
<P>
	For example, Daniel Gingras was out on a temporary escorted 
absence when he escaped at the West Edmonton Mall and went on 
to kill again.
<P>
	The concept of temporary absence illustrates that there is little 
truth or honesty in sentencing. Many Canadians feel that this 
approach is wrong, specifically that criminals owe a debt to society 
and this debt should be fulfilled in its entirety. They want certainty 
in sentencing. None of this out on early release with half the 
sentence or less carried out. Canadians are truly fed up with that 
and they want a change. This legislation does not offer substantial 
change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Tell us your views on caning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> The member for Kingston and the Islands seems 
obsessed with the issue of caning. He asking me once again to talk 
about caning. I would much prefer to talk about this piece of 
legislation, as weak as it is, and to talk about Reform's substantial 
proposals which I will present later.
<P>
	The programs of temporary absence are an extension of the 
status quo correctional philosophy. I believe it is important to talk 
about that philosophy a bit. First, it says that most criminals 
commit crimes because they are also victims. How many times 
have we heard that from the members across on the government 
side and from the separatists in the House? It is an excuse. I am 
sure that the people who are committing or thinking about 
committing a crime think that they will always have this excuse to 
fall back on. This excuse has found its way into our justice system 
that most criminals commit crimes because they are victims of 
crime.
<P>
	Second, this philosophy states that crime is mostly a product of 
social conditions and that the most effective remedy is for the state 
to intervene through programs such as a step up in welfare 
payments, more money handed to these poor people so they do not 
become criminals. There is absolutely no evidence that this is the 
case in Canada in particular. This philosophy is flawed  from the 
start. So of course the legislation which flows from Liberal thinkers 
would be flawed.
<P>
	I would like to talk a bit about temporary absences. It is another 
in a long list of language which is used by people who believe in 
the Liberal philosophy. It is the language which is preferred by 
welfare state criminologists, which includes conditional release, 
mandatory supervision, statutory release, community sentencing, 
alternative measures and other newer labels which are essentially 
built on the same theme, the same philosophy. They build on the 
notion that the purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation.
<P>
	As we have heard from speakers from the government and the 
separatist side, the focus is on rehabilitation of the criminals and 
the rights of the criminals. This is the philosophy that has driven 
the change of this government. Because of that we get this type of 
legislation which really is not going to help one bit when it is 
passed. Again, it will be passed because the Liberals will vote as 
they are told to vote.
<P>
	I would like to talk a bit about something else which should find 
its way into the philosophy of people who are trying to redesign the 
justice system. That is the deterrent to crime. We need to focus 
more on deterring crime.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Reform is sympathetic to opponents of the status quo in 
corrections and parole who argue that substantial crime savings can 
be made through deterrence rather than programs of temporary 
release and that type of thing, the changes that are proposed in this 
bill for example. Reform is very open and I would say that we 
support that philosophy.
<P>
	The answer is not to throw people in jail and throw away the key. 
In some cases a longer sentence and certainty in sentencing is what 
we need. But in other cases, we need to look at other options.
<P>
	There are people sitting on the government side who are not even 
willing to consider other options. We have to look at every possible 
option that we can find to deter crime. This is not happening on the 
government side. But all the options are being talked about and 
considered, for example, boot camps for young offenders. These 
are the kinds of things we have to discuss.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> As you can hear, Mr. Speaker, the members across 
the floor are kind of laughing at this idea of having a stronger 
deterrents.
<P>
	I would like to use an illustration I have used before in the 
House. They obviously have not hear it so I will present it again. I 
will talk about deterrence to crime and how it works. I will use the 
example of I believe his name was Bratton. He was hired as head of 
security for the subway system in New York City.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4648"> 4648 </A></B>
<P>
	His philosophy was entirely different from the Liberal 
philosophy which I have talked a little about. He said that we have 
to focus on the so-called petty crimes. If we are really tough on 
petty crime like vandalism and that type of thing, then criminals 
will not go on to commit the more serious crimes.
<P>
	He found that his philosophy was absolutely right. Through the 
application of that philosophy, by getting very tough on so-called 
petty crime like panhandling and graffiti being painted on walls, 
the crime rate for the more serious crimes dropped off 
dramatically.
<P>
	Mr. Bratton was later hired by the city of New York as chief of 
police and as chief of police they found the same thing. If you get 
tough on the so-called petty crime, you are using a strong deterrent 
to crime. That is what he did and he is very successful as chief of 
police for New York City. That demonstrates how we can use 
deterrence to crime effectively. For that reason the subways in New 
York City are much safer than they were before he came in and 
started to do his job.
<P>
	I will talk more about the changes that Reform proposed in this 
area to fix things up. Part of our job as an opposition party is to 
critique, both positive and negative criticism. That is part of our 
job, which we do. Sometimes it is negative criticism which has 
been earned in many cases. We also offer positive alternatives to 
what we hear from the government side which I will talk about.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Let's hear it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I am so encouraged that some of the members over 
there are expressing their impatience, their eagerness to hear 
Reform's alternative proposals. I am really pleased to hear that. It 
pleases me to no end.
<P>
	What does Reform say? Here are the positive alternatives. First, 
offenders should serve the full sentence for committing violent 
crime. Violent offenders should serve full sentences. Reform 
believes that Canadians' faith in the justice system needs to be 
restored.
<P>
	We believe that violent offenders as defined by section 752 of 
the Criminal Code should serve their full sentences with no 
eligibility for parole. Our proposal makes punishing crime and 
protecting law-abiding citizens the top priority in our justice 
system.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The precise resolutions that were passed by Reformers at our 
assemblies over the years dealing with this issue are these. This is 
what Reformers, normal Canadians, have said at the assemblies 
and these are the resolutions they have supported which give us the 
policy which we build on here. This is what is in the Reform blue 
book, our policy book, which by the way was presented to 
Canadians long before the Liberals ever came out with a red book. 
There are some substantial differences between  our blue book and 
the Liberal red book. The Reform blue book has our substantial 
policies in place. It says what we will do when we gain power and it 
is very clear and comprehensive, which differentiates us 
substantially from the red book.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the requirement that violent 
offenders serve their full sentence. Some violent offenders and all 
repeat offenders once released should be under parole supervision 
for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	The second resolution dealing directly with this is that the 
Reform Party supports a judicial system which places the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens and 
their property ahead of all other objectives.
<P>
	If there is any one thing that differentiates Reformers from the 
Liberals, that is it. We clearly in our policies place as the top 
priority the protection of Canadian citizens. The Liberals' top 
priority, which we have heard again and again and too often over 
these last few days, is the rights of the criminals and rehabilitation 
of criminals.
<P>
	I can understand that from the member for Kingston and the 
Islands. He is going to need the prison vote to get him elected next 
time. We know there are many prisons around Kingston. I can 
understand him but the others I cannot forgive. There is no excuse 
for it. I am sure he will get the prison vote very handily. Reformers 
sure will not because we believe we have to be serious with 
criminals.
<P>
	The second thing which Reform is proposing and is related to 
this issue is Reform thinks that two convictions for violent crimes 
or sexual crimes against children is enough to prove that an 
offender poses a serious danger to society. Therefore we would 
deem that any person who commits on two separate occasions an 
offence causing serious personal injury, as defined under section 
752 of the Criminal Code, a dangerous offender and subject to an 
indeterminate period of imprisonment.
<P>
	Again, this came from Reformers, everyday Canadians, who 
care enough about this country to make changes which are going to 
make it a safer place to live. The Reform MPs who are working in 
this area have taken this policy from assembly and have built 
substantial policies which will make things better.
<P>
	The third resolution is Reform believes that the National Parole 
Board must be accountable to Canadians. We believe this can be 
achieved by ending patronage appointments. I hear groans across 
the floor. I am sure some of the Liberals are counting on patronage 
appointments after the next election. We believe in ending 
patronage appointments, hiring its members on the basis of merit 
alone and ensuring that they answer directly to the Solicitor 
General of Canada. In order to fully restore confidence and reflect 
new accountability we will rename it the merit release board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4649"> 4649 </A></B>
<P>
	As the name would indicate, a person does not get early release 
unless they earn it. They have to earn it based on merit. That is 
important to note.
<P>
	Reform has proposed many changes to the criminal justice 
system and some to the Young Offenders Act are substantial 
changes. It is a comprehensive package that will be tougher on 
young offenders. It will also look for ways, other than putting them 
in prison, to deter young offenders who so often offend again and 
again until they have formed a pattern of crime. We put forth 
proposals that will deal with this and hopefully end their life of 
crime early. That is needed.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The member for Fraser Valley West has put forth substantial and 
very important proposals which would give victims rights under 
the law. We put forth positive proposals.
<P>
	I would like to close by repeating that Reformers have clearly 
distinguished themselves as being completely different from the 
Liberals. We have put forth changes that Canadians favour. Those 
changes when implemented-and we will get a chance pretty 
soon-will truly make Canada a safer place in which to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was delighted to hear the hon. member indicate how I 
would need help in the next election in order to get elected in 
Kingston. I attribute that to my rationale for expressing myself 
yesterday in my speech on Bill C-45.
<P>
	I have two questions for the hon. member arising out of his 
remarks. First of all he said at one point that he did not believe, and 
neither did any of his colleagues, in the policy of locking them up 
and throwing away the key, that that was not part of the Reform 
agenda.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Northeast is laughing at that 
because he knows that is his position. Indeed, it is the position of 
many members of his party. They have said repeatedly in this 
House in the course of the debate-and I am surprised that the hon. 
member who just spoke was not here listening-that they favoured 
locking them up and throwing away the key. In their view, when 
life means life, when someone gets sentenced to life imprisonment, 
they should go to jail for life. If that is not locking someone up and 
throwing away the key, I do not know what is. That was the 
proposal I heard from many of the members opposite.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia could get up later and explain his view on this 
but I think it was lock them up and throw away the key. Then he 
said that their policy was not that, that they did not approve of that 
policy, that that was not any part of it. In the next moment he said 
on crimes of violence when someone got a sentence they stayed in 
prison for the full length of the sentence.
<P>
	If it is a life sentence and someone goes to jail for life-I assume 
he considers murder a crime of violence-is that not locking 
people up and throwing away the key? I just wanted to clarify this. 
Is murder a crime of violence for the purpose of his definition? 
When someone gets sentenced to life for a crime of violence, do 
they not then go to jail for life under Reform policy? If that is not 
the policy, I would like to hear about it. I would like him to clarify 
that and I am happy to give him that opportunity.
<P>
	The second matter goes back to a subject that nobody opposite 
dares talk about any more since the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast blew the whistle on the member for Calgary Northeast on 
caning. There are parts of Calgary in different directions which 
seem to get very confusing. I have trouble remembering which 
member came from which district but I think I got it right that time 
because I checked in the book.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast blew the whistle on 
extremism in the Reform Party and she got the boot. One of the 
things she went on about on extremism was caning, which the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast said he thought he should have a 
good look at. He wanted to go to Singapore to learn all about 
caning.
<P>
	I am wondering if from the discussions in caucus concerning the 
problem of caning, which no member on the other side seems to 
want to talk about, the hon. member for Vegreville could clarify for 
us what the Reform Party position is in respect of caning. Is that 
part of the new package of prison and reformatory matters that are 
dealt with in this bill that Reform will be introducing as 
amendments later at the committee stage?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, in regard to more prison time, what 
Reform has said is that we must target. For those offenders who 
pose a serious threat if they are released, in those cases they should 
not be released. That is what we say. In other words, our top 
priority is the protection of Canadians.
<P>
	On the issue of corporal punishment, Reform has no policy on 
corporal punishment. Some Reform members have views on 
corporal punishment. My personal view, which is shared by many 
in my constituency, is that corporal punishment is something we 
should look at very seriously. We should debate it in this House and 
across the country and let Canadians tell us whether they want 
corporal punishment to be a part of our penal system, pure and 
simple.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Liberals clearly do not understand the idea of listening to 
Canadians on issues like that, but they will know after the next 
election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western  Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party in dealing with this topic 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4650"> 4650 </A></B>
<P>
seems to continuously deal with particular offences. Of course 
Reformers want to punish young offenders more.
<P>
	Let us talk about young offenders. Let us talk about an eight-year 
old or ten-year old who may be stealing a candy bar in a store. If he 
or she struggles with the owner and runs away I guess that is a 
violent offence.
<P>
	However, the Reformers never mentioned the fraud experts who 
steal hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars. There is no 
suggestion that any of those people should be thrown in jail to serve 
their full term, no suggestion that they are dangerous and maybe 
should be held in custody for the full term. There is no suggestion 
that they are dangerous offenders even though what they have done 
is taken funds from people and caused people to lose their life 
savings. Some people when they lose their life savings commit 
suicide.
<P>
	What is Reform's position on offences such as major frauds in 
this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the issue of fraud and getting 
serious with that type of crime, I fully agree with the hon. member. 
Some people tend to think that a so-called white collar crime does 
not hurt people. Well it does and people are robbed of their life 
savings. People are hurt in a way that can totally turn their life 
around for the worst.
<P>
	I believe the member is a lawyer and would know that this type 
of crime is serious and should be taken very seriously. That is also 
the Reform's position on this issue.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-53, 
an act to amend the Prisons and Reformatories Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon we are debating Bill C-53, an act to amend the Prisons 
and Reformatories Act.
<P>
	Canadians who are watching should not be misled that this 
amendment is in any way going to further the protection of the 
public. It simply gives more flexibility to the consideration given 
to prisoners. It would add a statement of purpose and principles to 
the temporary absence programs. The question arises in the minds 
of those who are watching: What is a temporary absence program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> It is when you escape.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> It is not when you escape. The purpose of a 
temporary absence program is to allow a prisoner to be absent from 
his incarceration for the following purposes: for medical purposes; 
for ``humanitarian purposes''; for rehabilitative purposes; or to 
help offenders integrate into the community; or for any other 
purpose established by a province and relating to prisoners 
convicted under provincial law. For any of those purposes there can 
be what is called a temporary absence.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The bill before us would amend the Prisons and Reformatories 
Act to add a statement of purpose and principles which would 
apply to the temporary absence programs. It sounds good. There 
certainly should be purposes and principles for these kinds of 
programs and processes. Unfortunately, the effect of the bill is to 
expand the practical operation of these programs no matter what 
the purposes and principles are. In fact the purposes and principles 
are sorely lacking in one important respect.
<P>
	Also this bill for the first time authorizes the provinces to create 
additional types of temporary absence programs. That was done at 
the request of the provinces as they administer much of the 
practical result of our justice system.
<P>
	Also this bill will lengthen the maximum duration of temporary 
absences. In fact it will lengthen them by four times. Right now the 
maximum temporary absence can be for only 15 days. Under this 
bill it will be expanded to 60 days. Even after the 60 days under this 
bill the temporary absence can be renewed. That is something  else 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4651"> 4651 </A></B>
<P>
to consider when we talk about whether the bill is good for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Also under this bill the grounds for suspending, cancelling or 
revoking temporary absences are set out for the first time.
<P>
	There are some greater certainties or particulars in the bill. What 
we want to look at is what Canadians actually get in the bill.
<P>
	There is another act which is quite similar to the Prisons and 
Reformatories Act. It is called the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act. In the Corrections and Conditional Release Act these 
words are stated: ``The protection of society is to be the paramount 
consideration in the determination of any case''. In the amendment 
to the Prisons and Reformatories Act the principle that the 
protection of society is to be paramount is absent. I would like to 
ask the government why that is. Canadians are entitled to know 
why. By implication, by omission, the protection of society need 
not be the paramount consideration when permitting convicted 
offenders to be out of prison on temporary absences.
<P>
	In 1971 the Liberal solicitor general of the time rose in the 
House and made the following statement: ``We are going to put the 
rehabilitation of individuals ahead of the protection of society''. In 
other words, in 1971 the Liberals decided that our justice system 
which for centuries had as its primary purpose the protection of 
law-abiding citizens and their property would now serve a different 
master. Its main purpose, focus and reason for being would be to 
rehabilitate people who had violated the rights of others and the 
protection of society would come second.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	It was strange to me, although I was quite a bit younger at the 
time, and I do not want to say exactly how much younger, that there 
was not a big uproar about such a fundamental philosophical shift. 
One of the main reasons why we have an organized society and an 
organized government is to protect the lives and property of 
law-abiding citizens. However, the Liberals made that tremendous 
shift in the focus of the justice system.
<P>
	We have been urging the government, indeed all of society, to 
consider whether that shift in the focus and priority of the justice 
system has in fact served us well over the last 20 some years. Of 
course my party and I submit that it has not. The protection of 
law-abiding citizens and their property and the protection of 
society, the safety of our families and communities should be first 
in the justice system. Rehabilitation measures, important and 
necessary as they are, should be second.
<P>
	This is very important when we come to judging whether we 
should support these amendments to the Prisons and Reformatories 
Act in Bill C-53, which expands the operation of temporary 
release. This  philosophical decision or choice is very important. If 
we are going to put the rehabilitation of prisoners first and 
foremost then these additional tools to use conditional release in 
the way we treat prisoners and the way we deal with them would 
make perfect sense. That is probably why the Liberals propose it 
and why they are supporting it.
<P>
	However, if we are worried and concerned and have as our 
priority putting the protection of society and law-abiding citizens 
first, then we would have some extremely serious concerns about 
the provisions of this bill. The reason is that temporary release can 
and has jeopardized public safety, can jeopardize the safety of our 
communities, can jeopardize the right to security of innocent and 
law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Canadians are increasingly outraged at how little truth or 
honesty there is in the sentences handed down by the Canadian 
justice system. We had a huge debate on this on Bill C-45 where 
life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years really means 
possibly 25 years in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 
years.
<P>
	Under the provisions of Prisons and Reformatories Act an 
offender may be sentenced to incarceration but in fact there are a 
number of provisions whereby this incarceration can be changed to 
something quite different and the public is not always aware that 
this is the fact.
<P>
	In addition to parole, which we talked about in Bill C-45, in 
addition to this temporary absence for medical, humanitarian, 
rehabilitative, reintegration or any other purpose, convicted 
offenders may have the benefit of conditional release, mandatory 
supervision, statutory release, community sentencing and 
alternative measures.
<P>
	If we are going to put the protection of society and law-abiding 
citizens first and foremost, and if we decide that people who violate 
the rights, liberties and the freedoms of others, should be subject to 
criminal sanction and have a debt to society then the question 
arises: Why are criminal's rights and the rights of law 
abiding-citizens to security of the person so much at variance? 
Why is the balance being continually shifted by these kinds of 
social experiments?
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Again, it comes back to what Canadians want as the underlying 
philosophy, the underlying purpose of our justice system. Do we 
want it to attempt to rehabilitate offenders, people who have shown 
a willingness to choose to violate the rights of others, above the 
protection of society? On the one hand we have rehabilitation. On 
the other hand we have the rights of victims and the protection of 
society.
<P>
	There is a very simple resolution to the proper balancing of these 
two considerations because they are both important. I suggest that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4652"> 4652 </A></B>
<P>
when the desire for rehabilitative measures and the need to protect 
the law-abiding citizen conflict, then the justice system  should err 
on the side of safety for law-abiding citizens. That is why in the bill 
I think we should see a statement to the effect that the protection of 
society is to be the paramount consideration in the determination of 
any application for temporary absence. But it is not in there. I 
would suggest that the measures in this bill fail Canadians.
<P>
	In the bill principles are set out which would guide decisions 
relating to temporary absence. These are the principles. First, the 
decision should be the least restrictive one on the prisoner, keeping 
in mind the protection of society-good-and prisoner's 
rehabilitation. Both are given equal paramountcy in this statement 
of principles. Again, the protection of society is not given 
paramountcy. The clear principle is that the decision on behalf of 
the convicted person, the person who owes a debt to society, should 
be the least restrictive on that person.
<P>
	There is a lot of protection of prisoners having information 
relating to the decision, reasons for the decision, access to a review 
of the decision. Guess who gets to pay for all of the time, the people 
and the resources it takes to make sure that the rights of offenders 
are tenderly and carefully protected? Again, mention of the rights 
of law-abiding citizens seems to be a poor second.
<P>
	Then there is the matter of giving information about these 
programs to prisoners, victims and the public. This is something 
which needs to be highlighted. We need to have a real debate on the 
philosophy underlying these measures and, indeed, our entire 
justice system.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a judicial system which places the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens and 
their property ahead of all other objectives. Interestingly enough, 
previous considerations of this whole area by the House have been 
consistent with that Reform principle.
<P>
	I would like to refer the House to the report of the Standing 
Committee on Justice which came down in October 1991. This was 
a report relating to a consideration by the House justice committee 
on the escapes of Daniel Gingras and Allan Legere. Members will 
know that both of these individuals murdered other Canadians 
when they were out of prison on temporary absences.
<P>
	On June 29, 1987 Daniel Gingras, an inmate at Edmonton 
Institution, escaped while on escorted temporary absence to West 
Edmonton Mall. He was later convicted in 1988 and 1989 of two 
separate first degree murders committed while he was at large. 
Allan Legere, an inmate at Atlantic Institution, escaped on May 3, 
1989 while on an escorted medical temporary absence. Later there 
were several charges of murder against him which he committed 
while he was at large.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	According to the committee both of these incidents raised 
serious concerns in the surrounding communities. As a result, there 
were requests from many sources for the release of the reports 
concerning the circumstances surrounding these two escapes.
<P>
	In early 1990 the Correctional Service of Canada reviewed these 
two reports and released them with numerous deletions under the 
Privacy Act. Many passages in the documents were deleted, thus 
making any complete understanding of the underlying findings and 
analysis almost impossible.
<P>
	The report goes on to say that it took over a year for the 
committee to obtain access to the two unexpurgated reports. When 
the committee finally did, it said this in October 1991: ``The first 
priority of any correctional system is protection of the 
community''. That recommendation of the justice committee has 
stood since October 1991. I would submit that here we are in 
September 1996 completely ignoring a strong, explicit 
recommendation that came out of one of our own committees 
relating to two terrible consequences of crimes committed flowing 
out of temporary release.
<P>
	I will read it again, because I know some members of the House 
are having little visits and perhaps did not hear this point. The 
committee said: ``The first priority of any correctional system is 
protection of the community''.
<P>
	We have a bill here which vastly expands the consideration given 
to convicted criminals in the matter of temporary absences. There 
may be reasons for that. We could debate whether this is desirable 
or undesirable. Leaving aside all that, I would say, at the very least, 
we should make it very clear in this legislation that the protection 
of society is to be the paramount consideration in the determination 
of when temporary absences should be permitted. That is not in this 
legislation.
<P>
	For that reason I urge this House to either amend the legislation 
to include it or to reject this bill by voting it down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member has occasion to remind me of some work that 
I and other members of the House participated in on the justice 
committee in the previous Parliament, including the member for 
Moncton who is here this afternoon with us.
<P>
	I want to bring to the attention of the hon. member that following 
that report and in the drafting of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act legislation which followed, the matter of public safety 
and safety of the community was inserted. If I am not mistaken in 
the first draft of the act perhaps it was left out. I am trying to 
remember and I think it may have been. This was five or so years 
ago.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4653"> 4653 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe the work at the committee stage resulted in the 
insertion of that principle. If am not mistaken in this Parliament 
a CCRA amendment was going forward, or perhaps it was the 
sentencing act, and the issue of public safety was listed at about 
number five on the list of criteria. For cosmetic purposes we were 
successful in moving that up the list to number one or number 
two. In any event, the member has made a good point. If the issue 
of safety to the community, public safety, is missing from this bill 
and it is not already present in the statute it amends, then perhaps 
this House through the committee which will study the bill should 
consider inserting it as a principle. She may wish to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Scarborough-Rouge River. It is good to have people with us who 
have institutional memories which some of the rest of us are just 
acquiring. He is correct.
<P>
	I mentioned in my intervention that the primacy of the protection 
of the public is in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. My 
whole contention was that is good and is another argument for its 
inclusion in the bill before us.
<P>
	I would welcome adding that amendment to the bill. It would 
make our party a great deal more comfortable with the bill. If he 
and other members of the justice committee would recommend and 
bring forward that amendment to the House and support it, I would 
certainly applaud that and I would applaud him for making that 
move.
<P>
	I thank him for his intervention and look forward to perhaps 
having that carried through.
<P>
