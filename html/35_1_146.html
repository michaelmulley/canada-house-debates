	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, prior to the 
Christmas recess I made some unacceptable comments on a 
decision that the Speaker made, which I appreciate in the 
traditions of Parliament were inappropriate. I suggested some 
motives which was also inappropriate. This morning I wish to 
apologize for any problems that those remarks might have 
caused you, Mr. Speaker, and withdraw those remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I accept, of course, the explanation of the hon. 
member for Kamloops.
<P>
	I remind all hon. colleagues that any reflection on the 
decisions of the Chair cause problems for us as a House of

	After all I am a servant of the House and I am a servant of each

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANPOTATOMARKETINGACT">CANADIAN POTATO MARKETING ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP)</B> moved that Bill C-266, 
an act respecting the orderly marketing of potatoes, be read the 
second time and referred to a legislative committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am proposing a private member's bill 
today that would have the effect of creating a national marketing 
agency for potatoes.
<P>
	As I go through the reasons for the bill members will see that 
probably there are simpler ways of dealing with this problem. 
However because Parliament in the past 20 years has been loath 
to adopt a simpler way and has forced the dealing of national 
agencies commodity by commodity, I am following that 
process.
<P>
	During the course of my remarks I will point out a simpler 
way. First let us recall that marketing boards are a relatively new 
method of dealing with the bargaining power vis-à-vis sellers 
and buyers. It dates back to the 1930s when New Zealand, 
Australia and the United Kingdom brought in marketing board 
legislation. Canada followed shortly thereafter with its first 
major marketing board, the wheat marketing board, introduced 
by a Conservative government in 1935.
<P>
	The wheat board still exists. It has only undergone a few 
minor amendments and changes in the intervening years. 
Numerous provincial boards and agencies exist across the 
country with only a handful of agencies operating on a national 
basis. Chicken, turkey, eggs, hatching eggs and dairy products 
join wheat and barley, and western wheat and barley at that, as 
products marketed by national marketing agencies.
<P>
	I argue this is a very slow progress. Agricultural producers are 
being forced to adopt very ancient means as private individuals 
in what has become a huge international market. Buyers have 
control in dozens of countries, being the principal buyers, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9166"> 9166 </A></B>
<P>
the bargaining power between the buyers and sellers is not even 
close to equal.
<P>
	Even though some people might argue that the new 
information technology permits people on farms to link into the 
latest marketing information. Information alone does not 
provide those farmers with the ultimate marketing power that 
they require, namely, to be able to fill a whole shipload of a 
product and to provide hundreds of boxcar loads of the product 
to a particular purchaser in the required time, of the required 
volumes and grades necessary. Only an agency acting on behalf 
of all of the producers can hope to perform that function.
<P>
	The fact that information is a little faster now than it was in 
the 1930s does not address the real problem of marketing, which 
is the ability to put together large amounts of product to fit the 
needs of the very large corporate buyers that are buying 
internationally these days.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	In the 1970s Parliament had an opportunity to put a bill before 
the country that would permit the various provincial marketing 
boards. These have to be put together on a provincial basis 
because, as members know, agriculture production is under the 
aegis of the provinces in our Constitution.
<P>
	It is only when the product is marketed across borders that the 
federal sphere is infringed on and federal rights are taken into 
account. Therefore provincial marketing boards that wish to 
market product that is handled by a marketing board in another 
province have to apply to the federal jurisdiction for the power 
to go beyond their borders.
<P>
	This is usually granted relatively simply. However it does not 
take away the problem that exists for all commodities not 
already under a national plan of competing one province against 
the other.
<P>
	I was involved in the early 1970s in putting together a 
marketing board for hogs in the province of Saskatchewan. It 
was at about the same time that similar boards were put together 
in Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia. They each followed 
the example of Ontario a few years previous to that.
<P>
	We had worked very hard to come together as those four 
western provinces to offer hogs to foreign and domestic buyers 
over one desk. We had political agreement. We had agreement 
from the farmers involved. Yet when the final signatures were 
required on all the multitude of agreements that this required, 
the heads of each of the boards found it very difficult to put their 
signatures to paper because that would have seen the demise of 
at least three of the positions. We do not need four presidents in 
order to run one regional marketing board. It fell down at that 
level.
<P>
	We need some federal guidelines and federal guidance if we 
are going to be able to achieve the coming together that is 
required if producers of the various commodities are going to be 
efficient and useful in meeting the market trends that are out 
there right now.
<P>
	The marketing board concept is really not much different for 
those who are interested in history of marketing than the power 
the state gave four and five hundred years ago to corporations. It 
is a power that over time has been granted to corporations 
simply on application.
<P>
	Even up to 30 or 40 years ago to strike a new corporation, the 
provisional board of directors had to come to the House of 
Commons and the Senate in order for that corporation to be set 
in motion and to be created. That has not been the case for many 
decades.
<P>
	Yet in order for farmers to form an organization that would 
have similar powers in the marketplace, this ancient institution 
still requires that a special bill be prepared and that special 
requirements be made. We still have to be very cognizant of the 
federal-provincial powers. We have to go through the process of 
proposing, as I am, a shell of an agency that would be able to 
function nationally that the provincial agencies can link into.
<P>
	Passing this legislation would not instantly create a national 
marketing agency. It would only be an effective national agency 
when the provincial marketing boards decide to avail 
themselves of the powers that are there in the federal act which 
would be passed.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	This slow, cumbersome process could have been sped up if in 
the early 1970s when the farm products marketing councils were 
established, and the national farm products marketing act which 
brought those agencies into effect had permitted the usage of 
national legislation for all farm products. However, there was 
some agitation on the part of mainly Alberta cattlemen 
concerning rights to establish an agency that would include 
management of supply, which is only a normal thing for any 
marketing agency.
<P>
	Ask General Motors, Ford or Beatrice Foods. Any of the big 
players always have a good handle on their supplies. They are 
manufacturing the product. They make certain they do not 
manufacture or process more than they have sales for. They 
make certain they are able to manage the product so it arrives at 
the customer's door on the day the customer wants it; not later, 
not sooner, right on time. This is the kind of service the 
marketing boards have performed and can perform for 
producers who are part of a marketing agency.
<P>
	The problem with the provincial agencies is that they often 
are not large enough to meet the kind of bargaining conditions of 
the corporations they deal with. Most of the processors and 
handlers of potatoes are huge international conglomerates. They 
have access to markets all over the world. When dealing with a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9167"> 9167 </A></B>
<P>
little potato board from Prince Edward Island or Manitoba the 
farmers very quickly find that they do not have very much clout 
when it comes to dictating terms of price and terms and 
conditions of how many potatoes will be produced, how they 
will be produced and what price the processor will pay for them. 
The people who are handling fresh potatoes to supermarket also 
have extremely large bargaining clout in that there are very few 
supermarket chains across North America that the producers 
must face on a day to day basis.
<P>
	The marketing agency can provide the management of the 
product to the final destination on time and at the most 
beneficial price to the producer rather than always at the behest 
of the various buyers who can very quickly take advantage of a 
day when individual producers through their own 
unco-ordinated activities may be offering-usually they are 
offering-far more product on any given day than the system 
needs. Therefore they are always accepting a much less than 
optimal price because they are presenting for sale far more 
product than they are able to sell and deliver. As far as the buyer 
is concerned that surplus of product is always available to them. 
They take advantage of that, keeping the price lower than it 
would otherwise be.
<P>
	Management of supply is more possible under marketing 
boards. I would note that we have other ways of managing 
supply. Notable and somewhat ironic, given their long 
opposition to any legislation that would permit supply 
management for all general farm products including beef, are 
the official cattlemen associations based in Alberta and to a 
certain extent in southwestern Saskatchewan. They have always 
argued that they are free marketers, that they do not want to have 
anything to do with supply management. It is ironic and 
somewhat instructive to note that they are probably one industry 
that has been very effective at controlling supplies into North 
America, particularly the Canada-U.S. markets. They have 
managed by other means to put political pressure where it 
matters and have limited on a consistent basis the amount of 
imports, whether from Ireland and the European economic 
community or whether from New Zealand and Australia. By 
setting quotas on those imports they are indulging in supply 
management.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The advantages of the seller versus the buyer are being 
eschewed by cattle producers in most areas right now. For some 
time there was a very effective marketing agency in 
Saskatchewan that was strictly voluntary where producers could 
market through the beef marketing commission and that gained 
quite a lot of acceptance and approval. However, for political 
reasons that was struck down by the government of Grant 
Devine a few years ago. Farmers are now back in the business of 
negotiating their own prices each day. They find, when they 
compare notes, that they are not being treated equitably for the 
same day's market.
<P>
	I found when I began drafting this legislation that the simplest 
answer would have been to amend the Natural Products 
Marketing Act so that we pull out the sections the cattlemen 
insisted on being in there in the early 1970s which would have 
had the effect of permitting all fruits, vegetables, tobacco, farm 
products, honey, meats, cereals and oilseeds. Every farm 
product would have been the simplest solution but I was told that 
this would somehow impinge upon the royal prerogative 
because a small section of that act permits the government to 
finance such new agencies. Private members do not have the 
privilege of establishing a law or adding to a law that would 
perhaps cost the government some money out of the 
consolidated revenue fund.
<P>
	I have had to resort to setting up what is, I admit, a shell 
agency that has no funds. It would simply exist and be funded by 
producers as the provincial agencies decide to become part of a 
national agency and use this as a forum or beginning again a 
debate as to whether producers of potatoes would have some 
benefit by using a national marketing agency.
<P>
	This has been a program that many producers have engaged in 
several times in the last couple of decades. In the early 1970s 
there was a determined effort to put together a national 
marketing agency for potatoes. The legislation was being 
worked upon. The plan was being worked upon. A very detailed 
proposal was put forward. Somehow it fell apart. Twice since 
that time similar efforts have gone forward, only to be stopped at 
the political level.
<P>
	I wish the new group of parliamentarians in the House 
now-almost 200 people who have never been here 
before-would again think about the issue, look at the 
possibilities here and bring agricultural marketing into the 20th 
if not the 21st century and bring us up to date with the corporate 
sector which for more than 500 years has had the ability to 
simply go to government and get immediate acceptance for its 
application to allow many people to come together under one 
agency and take advantage of all of the benefits that such a 
coming together reaps.
<P>
	By persisting on keeping the old National Products Marketing 
Act which was flawed from the beginning on the books would be 
something like going back in time and saying corporations can 
be established but only to gather and market furs, because in 
Canada the Hudson Bay Company was one of the first 
corporations to function on our soil even though the idea of a 
corporation had existed in Europe some time before.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time for us to be brought up to date to permit our farmers 
to use all of the tools that their competitors and their opponents 
in the market have. I would urge members of Parliament to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9168"> 9168 </A></B>
<P>
consider giving that right to farmers to form national agencies 
for all products, but specifically here today for potatoes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate the opportunity to make some comments on Bill 
C-266 before the House this morning, presented by the member 
for Mackenzie.
<P>
	The comments I will make are as a result of a discussion with 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food on the matter of this 
bill and also as a former potato grower myself for a few years.
<P>
	Bill C-266 is a well intentioned proposal to promote the 
orderly marketing of potatoes in Canada. I do not believe this 
bill is needed or wanted by the industry. The potato industry is 
one that has made great strides over the last few years. It is 
developing workable processes to resolve major issues at a 
national level and to take control of its own future.
<P>
	Last fall I had the opportunity to speak to the potato growers 
of Alberta at their annual meeting. I can assure this House that at 
the meeting and in a small discussion with the executive of the 
potato growers of Alberta there was no one in the general 
meeting or the executive of that very vibrant organization who 
even mentioned supply management as a goal of their industry.
<P>
	This is not to say that the idea had never come before the 
industry previously. Twice in the past number of years the potato 
industry has examined it and the possibility of federal 
legislation during the 1980s and earlier in the 1970s. On both 
occasions it was unable to come to a workable consensus within 
the industry.
<P>
	This bill would create a Canadian potato marketing 
commission that would act, quoting from the bill, as the sole 
agent for all imported potatoes and all potatoes produced in 
Canada. This commission would also have extensive powers 
including the buying, storing and selling potatoes.
<P>
	When the potato industry was seeking national agencies in the 
past its major objectives were to stabilize prices and to remove 
surplus so that it could continue to market its product in an 
organized fashion; in other words, to maintain traditional 
markets at traditional prices. It did not want an agency that 
would control its marketing.
<P>
	Through all the troubles in recent years the industry has 
strengthened its infrastructure nationally with the formation of 
the potato committee executive of the Canadian horticultural 
council in 1992. That committee has begun dealing directly with 
issues affecting the industry in Canada. The committee has 
taken on a big responsibility.
<P>
	I am confident that the industry and the provincial 
government representatives on the potato committee executive 
will continue to deal successfully with future problems and they 
will mature even further in their decision making. This maturing 
process will lead to a further strenghthening of the potato 
industry at a national level and the development of sound, 
strategic directions for the industry to follow in its production 
and marketing endeavours.
<P>
	Bill C-266 would restrict production and marketing of 
potatoes to producers holding permit books and would prescribe 
delivery points and quotas.
<P>
	Potatoes are a very perishable product. They have to be 
marketed in a timely and efficient manner to meet good delivery 
standards. The responsibility for good shipping and handling 
conditions must remain as much as possible between the 
producer and the receiver.
<P>
	In recent years the industry has had to deal with many issues 
and some of them have not been pleasant to deal with. There 
have been overproduction, low prices, drought, PVY-n, late 
blight and various other issues which have seriously affected the 
marketing of potatoes both within Canada and in our export 
markets. Despite these difficulties potato production in Canada 
keeps reaching new peaks with records being set in various parts 
of the country every year. Across Canada this industry is 
becoming more and more aggressive, strengthening existing 
markets and developing new ones with strong returns to 
producers. Our potato industry today is very healthy. It will 
continue to be healthy as it competes effectively in open markets 
around the world.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	In addition our government is a promoter of free trade. A 
quota system for the marketing of potatoes would only erect 
more barriers to trade in Canada and with our trading partners.
<P>
	I just want to remind everyone again that the potato industry 
in Canada is making great strides in increasing production, 
increasing revenues and expanding its markets worldwide. The 
industry has developed an infrastructure that meets its needs at 
the provincial and national levels and is becoming even more 
aggressive in finding its own solutions to its own concerns.
<P>
	The industry, I repeat, has shown no visible support for the 
proposal contained in Bill C-266. Until the industry identifies 
the need for further national legislation to accomplish its goals I 
see no reason to proceed any further with Bill C-266.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was somewhat intrigued by Bill C-266, the bill before the House 
today.
<P>
	This is the first time we have an opportunity to deal with the 
agricultural sector as it affects potato producers. The purpose of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9169"> 9169 </A></B>
<P>
this bill, introduced by the hon. member for Mackenzie, is to 
ensure the orderly marketing of  potatoes, having due regard to 
the interests of producers as well as consumers.
<P>
	At first, I thought a bill that introduced changes in the 
marketing system as it affects producers and consumers was 
entirely justified. Since I am not an expert, however, I decided to 
get in touch with a number of agencies and potato producers to 
find out what they had to say. In fact, I met a dozen potato 
producers in Quebec and several in New Brunswick, who were 
astonished that a federal member would bother to call them and 
even go to see them to find out what they wanted, and who 
thanked me for taking the trouble.
<P>
	I wanted to make sure this bill faithfully reflected the needs of 
this particular sector. People actively involved in this 
agricultural sector were quick to explain that the changes 
proposed in Bill C-266 did not suit them at all.
<P>
	Before deciding how to change existing procedures, we must 
understand the forces at work in the current potato marketing 
system. Apparently, there are no national regulations on potato 
prices. This means that the market is controlled by 
interprovincial marketing decisions. In other words, the 
provinces are self regulating.
<P>
	At this point, perhaps I may recall that four years ago in New 
Brunswick, the fall harvest was exceptionally abundant. To 
maintain potato prices, the provincial and federal governments 
and the New Brunswick association of potato producers agreed 
to destroy several tonnes to keep prices as high as possible, since 
the crop was well in excess of demand.
<P>
	This approach makes it difficult to set up a system under 
which all provinces would have to conform to the same 
standards.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The idea of setting up a national mechanism is not new. In the 
early 1980s, the provinces were consulted about the possibility 
of setting up a mechanism of this sort. From the consultations, it 
was obvious that the positions of certain regions were totally 
irreconcilable.
<P>
	The western market, for example, is import based. It is the 
complete opposite of the eastern market, which is largely export 
driven. Furthermore, it appears that many provinces have a 
potato producers association of their own. Since regional 
objectives may vary, the roles of these associations may be 
diametrically opposed.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the Fédération des producteurs de 
pommes de terre du Québec by way of example. It is a labour 
organization and has both a political and a marketing focus. The 
Manitoba association, on the other hand, is concerned strictly 
with marketing.
<P>
	Quebec potato producers have had a dual scheme since 1979. 
It covers advertising campaigns as well as the control of potato 
quality. Moreover, as many producers have their own packing 
companies, they look after selling their products themselves. 
They have created a customized marketing system for 
themselves. What more could you want, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	As I see it, the provincial producers are already well 
organized. They develop their own markets and their own way of 
operating. I do not see any point in centralizing and messing up a 
system that works the way the people using it like it. As I said 
earlier, I met with several of them and they recommended that I 
not support Bill C-266 tabled by the hon. member for 
Mackenzie.
<P>
	Furthermore, a working group was created in 1990-as was 
mentioned earlier-to evaluate the various options for 
implementing a potato marketing system, to evaluate, for 
instance, the advisability of establishing a Canadian potato 
board or to examine the possibility of setting up a supply 
management system or other options. The group had to interrupt 
its work in 1990 and never produced a final report. And even if 
they had concluded their work in some way, their findings would 
no doubt have been overtaken by market developments.
<P>
	In view of free trade, previous studies would perhaps be less 
relevant today. GATT and NAFTA have changed the rules of the 
game. Were it indeed advisable to create a national system as 
proposed in the bill, one would first have to consider all the new 
aspects of today's market.
<P>
	If my information is correct, this is not the first time a 
measure such as Bill C-266 has been presented in the House. 
The aim of the member proposing this bill, namely to assist 
potato producers, is most admirable. Bill C-266 shows a desire 
to bring together producers and consumers. Research in this area 
could be financed, for example, by deductions from producers, 
as is the case for wheat and barley under Bill C-50 regarding the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which the House of Commons passed 
before the holidays.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	There is, however, a major difference between these two 
sectors. Grain producers themselves asked to be able to make 
this kind of contribution. In my opinion, there is no need to 
respond to needs that potato producers have not expressed. Let 
us look at it this way: western grain, barley and wheat producers 
had asked the House of Commons to pass this kind of bill; potato 
producers did not and have no desire to do so.
<P>
	Besides, it may seem advantageous to promote a product by 
pooling all available resources. However, if the objectives of the 
parties are irreconcilable, as is the case with the provinces, 
pretending to cover all bases by trying to put producers and 
consumers into the same mold can only throw a wrench into the 
works.
<P>
	In closing, I would simply like to inform the hon. member for 
MacKenzie that, unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois will not 
support his bill since all the farm producers, all the potato 
producers from Quebec who were consulted do not see the need 
for it and unanimously asked us to oppose the bill, which the 
Bloc Quebecois will do.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak this morning on Bill C-266 sponsored by the 
member for Mackenzie.
<P>
	I must tell the member for Mackenzie that this bill is really an 
untimely gesture in the history of the potato industry. Usually 
there is a demand for this type of legislation from producers or 
from the provinces. In this case I do not detect any support for a 
bill of this sort from producers, from provincial governments, or 
from departments of agriculture. It has been some time since 
there has been any kind of demand for an orderly marketing 
system for potatoes.
<P>
	I remember back in the 1980s during an election campaign 
there was a move by the producers in Prince Edward Island and 
eastern Canada to set up an orderly marketing system. At that 
time there were some difficulties for a number of years in 
marketing potatoes for a fair price or for marketing potatoes for 
any price.
<P>
	An effort was made by Parliament to initiate discussions that 
might lead to an orderly marketing system for potatoes. That 
effort died rather quickly. The demand for potatoes and the 
marketing problem they were experiencing in the late 1970s 
disappeared and the enthusiasm the producers had for an eastern 
potato marketing board waned pretty quickly. Basically the 
effort went nowhere.
<P>
	In the early 1990s I am told, although I did not realize this 
until we looked into the background material for the bill, an 
effort was made nationally for an orderly marketing of potatoes. 
It also died because of lack of support.
<P>
	Why is the bill being brought forward at this moment when 
the marketing of potatoes has never been better? The demand for 
potatoes has never been better and the prices paid to producers 
have rarely been higher. If we had twice as many potatoes in 
Prince Edward Island as we do now, we would be able to sell 
them all.
<P>
	There is demand from Europe. We are getting calls from 
countries that until this year probably never knew Prince 
Edward Island existed. They are phoning our exporters looking 
for potatoes.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	This is an unusual year for that kind of demand. Even without 
the drought or whatever affected the potato crop in Europe, the 
demand for the processing of potatoes is growing steadily year 
after year. The demand for table potatoes and for P.E.I. seed 
potatoes has rebounded from the PVY-n crisis.
<P>
	The industry is in a very healthy position. There is no 
guarantee it will always be in a healthy position but if there are 
any free market farmers in Canada, the eastern Canadian potato 
producers have to be in that group. They have very rarely had to 
rely on government for any kind of stabilization or bailouts for 
their industry. They grew their own potatoes. They marketed 
their own potatoes. They exported their own potatoes and 
developed their own markets in South America and overseas in 
Algeria and the Middle East. They have been doing a 
tremendous job. They do not really see how government could 
assist them in any way in the selling of their crop.
<P>
	In the whole situation mentioned earlier by a Bloc member 
with respect to free trade, GATT, NAFTA and so on, the potato 
industry is probably more ready for these efforts in bringing 
down trade barriers than any other commodity group in this 
country. It is that those in the potato industry have never been in 
favour of trade barriers. They have always had to rely on a free 
trade spirit in order to market their crop.
<P>
	Even with that, since 1980, the last time there was a demand 
for this type of legislation, the number of acres of potatoes 
grown has come close to doubling. That is in the last 15 years. 
They have not only been able to market those potatoes; on a 
yearly basis, they have been able to increase their production 
and to sell everything they have had.
<P>
	The only experience they have had with government has been 
as a result of the PVY-n crisis and it was thought they would not 
be be able to market their potatoes in 1991 and 1992. The 
government assisted the growers in destroying thousands and 
thousands of pounds of potatoes for a certain price in order to 
relieve the market of potatoes in storage.
<P>
	What happened a few months later was that there was a 
demand for the potatoes that were destroyed. They would have 
received a lot more money out in the marketplace than they did 
out of government. Any time the government has been 
associated with the market it tends to distort it. It is better left to 
the market system, especially these days. It is a free market 
commodity and has been doing quite well.
<P>
	I am sorry I cannot lend any support to my colleague from the 
NDP for this bill. Basically there is no support from either the 
potato producers or the governments in eastern Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
this private members' Bill C-266, an act respecting the orderly 
marketing of potatoes.
<P>
	My speech has four main points. First, I will explain what this 
bill is about very briefly. Second, I will explain why this bill has 
failed in the past and will not be supported again in this House as 
we have seen from the speeches so far, in particular from the 
governing party. Third, I will outline the Reform Party's posi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9171"> 9171 </A></B>
<P>
tion on supply management and supply managed products.  
Finally, I will put forward some viable alternatives to 
government involvement through new supply managed 
industries.
<P>
	The stated purpose of this bill is to ensure the orderly 
marketing of potatoes having due regard to the interests of 
producers as well as to consumers. It would establish a corporate 
body to be known as the Canadian potato marketing 
commission.
<P>
	The commission would be composed of five to nine members 
who would not receive pay from government. The commission 
would operate in a somewhat similar fashion to that of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. It would act as a sole marketing agent 
for all imported potatoes and for potatoes produced in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	The commission, using a permit book system as the wheat 
board does, would pay producers to sell potatoes to the board. 
What we would have is a single desk buyer as we have with the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Payments made to the consolidated revenue fund to offset any 
expenses the commission may have must be approved by 
Parliament. I was encouraged to see at least in the proposal there 
was the recognition that when we come to an expenditure of 
taxpayers' money in order to have proper accountability it 
should have approval by Parliament and not just by governor in 
council, the cabinet or the minister. That is what this bill is 
about.
<P>
	This bill has been attempted before and has failed. The 
member for Mackenzie has attempted to pass the same bill. Bill 
C-246, an act respecting the orderly marketing of potatoes, 
received first reading on May 30, 1989. Bill C-252, an act 
respecting the orderly marketing of potatoes, received first 
reading June 19, 1991. Now here we go again with Bill C-266, 
an act respecting the orderly marketing of potatoes. I wonder if 
this member is trying to make an argument in favour of term 
limits for politicians so that we get new ideas into this House, 
ideas that change with the changing market conditions.
<P>
	The fact this is the third time in six years the same member 
has put forward the same bill certainly indicates one thing: he 
holds an ideology; he sticks to his ideology regardless of 
whether or not producers agree with that ideology. Hon. 
members opposite have presented an overview of the state of the 
potato marketing industry and the general lack of support on the 
part of farmers and processors for this type of a bill.
<P>
	An attempt was also made in 1980 to establish a potato 
marketing agency for eastern Canada. Public hearings were 
held, reports were submitted and the idea failed. The national 
potato agency task force presented its report for a program for 
the marketing of potatoes in Canada to the minister of 
agriculture and the chairman of the National Farm Products 
Marketing Council on November 17, 1986 but nothing came of 
it.
<P>
	In February 1988 the National Farm Products Marketing 
Council submitted a report on the inquiry into the merits of 
establishing a national marketing agency for potatoes. On April 
28, 1988 Judge Teitelbaum of the Federal Court of Canada trial 
division at the request of a group of potato processors issued an 
order quashing the report. The conclusions and 
recommendations contained in the report were never 
implemented.
<P>
	In the past there was never enough collective enthusiasm to 
implement a potato marketing agency. In the present it is not an 
idea whose time has come. In fact it is clearly an idea whose 
time has gone.
<P>
	With the passage of the Uruguay round of GATT, the free trade 
agreement and NAFTA, the existing government co-ordinated 
marketing agencies have come under fire. In recent news stories 
we have heard some of the results of Canada putting tariff levels 
at the rate they are in other supply managed industries. There is a 
lot of pressure particularly from our largest trading partner, the 
United States, to have a rapid reduction in the tariff protection in 
the present supply managed industries. I am surprised the hon. 
member is proposing to put in place a new supply managed 
industry board under this type of situation.
<P>
	On January 28 the Canadian Wheat Board was under fire 
because it requires end user certificates on imported American 
wheat. The Americans' response is to impose end user 
certificates on Canadian wheat entering the United States. If this 
threat were to become a reality the result would indeed cause a 
large problem for Canadian grain farmers who do ship Canadian 
grain into the United States. It would cause an increase in 
paperwork and another level of regulation which is totally 
unwanted and not needed by farmers.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	The United States has also served notice that it plans to 
challenge Canada's new import duties on dairy and poultry 
products. I mentioned this a few minutes ago. The levels set 
under GATT according to the United States really go against the 
spirit and the terms of NAFTA. That is the argument the United 
States has been using. Again, the mood just is not there on the 
part of the United States and certainly on the part of Canadian 
potato farmers for a new supply managed industry, especially 
when that industry is potatoes.
<P>
	In terms of the disputes with the United States, who ends up 
being hurt by these disputes? It is not the bureaucrats who are 
hurt; it keeps them employed. It is not the politicians who are 
hurt; it gives them the spotlight and keeps their names in the 
news for a little longer. In the end it is the farmers who lose from 
these disputes. We want to do nothing that will encourage 
trading disputes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9172"> 9172 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that having this bill which is being proposed today in 
<I>Hansard</I> could be considered an anachronism, an error in time.
<P>
	My wife and I went to see ``Richard III'' last Friday night in 
Edmonton and as you know, Shakespeare is famous for the 
anachronisms in his plays, but there is a new anachronism in this 
play. ``Richard III'' came out on stage crippled up in a 
wheelchair, which of course is a new anachronism that was built 
in by the writers of this version of ``Richard III''.
<P>
	This piece of legislation is very much like using a wheelchair 
in a play that took place hundreds of years before wheelchairs 
existed, electric wheelchairs in particular. I believe it is totally 
out of place.
<P>
	I want to talk a little bit about Reform's position on supply 
management in general. Reform believes that farmers should 
definitely have the right to work together collectively. They 
should have the right to strengthen any part of their industry or 
their business they feel can be strengthened by this co-operative 
work.
<P>
	For example, I believe there is a very strong future for 
co-operatives in agriculture. I also believe we will see farmers 
with other business people in small communities in particular 
forming new co-operatives as a mechanism to work together for 
the common advantage of the farmers and the processors 
involved. I encourage this type of activity. I believe there is a 
future for various other types of joint ventures but not for new 
supply managed industries.
<P>
	The greatest service this government can provide to producers 
who are in the supply managed industry right now is to be honest 
and open with the farmers. We know the world is moving more 
and more to an open and free marketplace. Knowing that, the 
greatest service government can provide for farmers is to say: 
``We are moving to a system of more competition. We know it is 
going to be more difficult even for present supply managed 
industries to compete, but at least we are acknowledging it and 
we want to help in any way we can without interfering in the 
move to an open market system''.
<P>
	Clearly, this bill is totally out of place and I am very pleased 
to see the support from the members opposite.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the 
subject of Bill C-266.
<P>
	As the House knows the government recently concluded a 
comprehensive negotiation on a new GATT agreement which 
will create a new trade regime under the World Trade 
Organization. As a member of the GATT and the World Trade 
Organization, as well as being a signatory to the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, Canada has created for itself many new 
and expanding opportunities and with those, certain 
international trade obligations.
<P>
	Bill C-266 as it is written suggests that a commission would, 
as the sole marketing agent, control all imports and all exports 
of potatoes. Under NAFTA and the MTN Canada has agreed 
not-let me stress not-to introduce any prohibitions or 
restrictions on the importation or exportation of goods.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	If Canada were to change its current policies and thereby 
affect current and future access to our market, Canada would be 
modifying benefits that our trading partners would expect to 
accrue under the provisions of the trade agreements. This could 
be subject to challenge by our trading partners.
<P>
	The Canadian potato and processing industries are major 
exporters and have significant interests in free trade and open 
markets. I realize the potato industry has been faced with many 
issues in recent years that have affected the marketing of 
potatoes both domestically and internationally. However, I do 
believe the issues would best be addressed in a manner that does 
not have negative implications on trade or violates our trade 
obligations.
<P>
	For that reason I am not prepared to support Bill C-266 and I 
am sure that although the member opposite has real concern for 
that industry he can understand that in changing times we have 
to deal with the realities and that we are in a new trading pattern 
and these items will be dealt with in an open and free trade 
market.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONACT">IMMIGRATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration)</B> moved that Bill C-44, an act to amend the 
Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act and to make a 
consequential amendment to the Customs Act, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I extend a warm word of welcome to all 
my colleagues as we resume this very important session of 
Canada's Parliament.
<P>
	As we said in the immigration plan last November 1, the focus 
in immigration policy must be nation building and people and 
not criminals and their despicable deeds. It is time to get back to 
what we do best, building a nation that is strong and free.
<P>
	However, the actions of a small criminal element that has 
infiltrated our immigration system have occupied our time and 
the public's attention for far too long. The actions of a few have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9173"> 9173 </A></B>
<P>
hurt the reputations of many. Logically we must respond to the 
few so that we may  protect the many and uphold our laws. Bill 
C-44 accomplishes that twin goal.
<P>
	There can be no equating the words criminal and immigrant. 
Immigrants helped build this country and are the men and 
women who have made history and the men and women who will 
help us build Canada's tomorrows. Criminals are only the 
riff-raff of society who are not even a footnote in the history of 
our proud immigration tradition.
<P>
	Members on all sides of this House are to be congratulated on 
the speedy work in getting this legislation, Bill C-44, before the 
House of Commons at third reading. A special thanks to my very 
able parliamentary secretary, the member of Parliament for 
Halifax, as well to the committee members of my caucus who 
went well beyond the normal working days on this important 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	The bill comes back with a number of amendments that will 
clarify timeframes, technical points and a transition period. This 
is very much a case in point of how this government first listens 
and then acts. Quite simply, the amendments to the immigration 
act that we are dealing with today in Bill C-44 will move us a 
significantly long way toward restoring integrity to our system.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill is an enforcement tool set. It allows us to fix some 
worn equipment without shutting down all the machinery.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I know there are those who would use criminal behaviour by a 
few as an excuse for draconian law. For those people, we have 
not gone far enough. To them I simply say, this government was 
not elected to shake a chainmail fist or wield a big stick.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Then there are those who say that we have gone too far, that 
we have reacted too strongly against the actions of just a few 
wrongdoers. To those Canadians let me say that although the 
criminal element that has intruded into the immigration process 
is tiny, it is at the very same time very destructive.
<P>
	As a result the government has struck a middle course 
between those extremes. A balanced, realistic middle course is 
often the wisest course, for it takes us away from the rocks of 
extremism and reaction while steering us clear of the dead 
waters of those who would do nothing.
<P>
	This legislation is a central component of our ten-year 
immigration strategy. It is not the most important part, but it is 
one of the two underpinnings that will make it successful. Fair 
access and the rule of law are the two principles embodied in our 
plan which was tabled on the floor of the House of Commons last 
November 1.
<P>
	Those who abuse our nation's hospitalities and laws will not 
be given the privilege of access. It is simple: play by the rules or 
face the consequences. Canadians do not want any more queue 
jumping, any abusing of the system or any manipulating of the 
system. Most certainly we on the government side will strive to 
prevent criminals from taking the places of both legitimate 
refugees and legitimate immigrants to Canada.
<P>
	The tools being provided here through Bill C-44 will allow 
law enforcement officials to get the job done. While I am on the 
subject of tools and law enforcement, let me pay tribute to the 
special police, RCMP and immigration task force that was 
recently established. It is making steady progress at removing 
foreign criminals from our midst. While the task force does not 
have any direct linkages with the legislation before us today, it is 
very much part and parcel of our resolve to restore integrity to 
the immigration and refugee process. That task force was also a 
response to our citizens' demands and needs and that task force 
is very much getting the job done. My government colleagues 
and I are very appreciative for those professional efforts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to say in a straightforward, non-partisan way, that past 
governments, and that is governments in the plural, simply let 
too many people in the door without proper legislation in place 
to stop criminals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me recap quickly for our colleagues in the House today the 
main points in this legislation.
<P>
	First, serious criminals deemed to be a danger to the public 
will not be allowed to claim refugee status as a means to 
delaying their removal from Canada. For instance, we will not 
tolerate any longer those cases that we have read about in our 
newspapers or watched on our television sets in which a 
convicted murderer serving time in Kingston penitentiary now 
is able to compel the Immigration and Refugee Board to travel to 
that penitentiary to listen to an obviously unworthy refugee 
claim.
<P>
	Second, appeals against removal orders by persons convicted 
of series crimes will be decided by the minister or the minister's 
designate and not by the immigration appeal division.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Third, senior immigration officers will be allowed to 
terminate refugee hearings because of criminality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another common sense application is if once the refugee 
process has started and subsequent to that starting information 
comes to the fore that the individual has committed a serious 
offence, we will now be able to stop that refugee hearing, move 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9174"> 9174 </A></B>
<P>
it into an immigration inquiry hearing and proceed with the 
evidence provided before that tribunal.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	If the information we receive is validated, that individual will 
be subject to deportation rather than any refugee hearing. Again, 
it is a practical response to some of the cases that over the last 
number of years have certainly caused much public attention 
and some public grief.
<P>
	Four, this legislation will also give immigration officers the 
authority to seize identity documents from international mail if 
it is clear they are meant to be used to circumvent immigration 
and other Canadian requirements. As well, senior immigration 
officials will also be able to turn formerly deported people away 
from our borders if those individuals are attempting to come 
back to Canada without proper permission. This will now be 
done without having to go through the inquiry procedure that at 
present is mandated on those officials.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fifth, it will ensure that persons with summary convictions, 
whether obtained inside Canada or abroad, would be 
inadmissible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, thanks to the co-operative spirit shown in this 
House by members opposite in allowing me to propose a new 
amendment at report stage, this legislation will prevent the 
release on day parole and unescorted temporary absences of 
inmates who face deportation following the completion of their 
sentences.
<P>
	It is our firm belief that because these foreign criminals are 
not going to be reintegrated into Canadian society, there is no 
need to let them work slowly back into our Canadian 
communities. Once again, this is a common sense practical step 
forward. For this I would also like to thank for their 
co-operation Canada's Solicitor General and Canada's Minister 
of Justice.
<P>
	Bill C-44 will also allow us to stop the processing of 
citizenship while that same person is undergoing an 
immigration inquiry. Once again, this is a practical step forward 
in which the right and the left hands will work in conjunction 
with each other as opposed to being in a vacuum apart from each 
other.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, this government is prone to listen 
before it acts. As a result of our listening to the committee work, 
there are also a number of changes before the House today. Some 
involve the transition while others are designed to prevent 
costly and time consuming court challenges based on the scope 
of authority the bill gives to senior immigration officials.
<P>
	Of a more substantive nature is the definition of what 
constitutes a serious crime. We propose to remove the right of 
appeal to the immigration refugee board on all grounds-I 
underline all grounds-for individuals certified to be a danger to 
the public. This means that those who have committed a crime 
involving violence, weapons, sexual assault or drug offences 
that are punishable with a sentence of 10 years or more will no 
longer be able to tie up our system.
<P>
	They would retain their right to seek judicial review in the 
federal court. Of course humanitarian issues would be 
considered by the minister or the minister's designate when a 
decision has been rendered.
<P>
	Persons not considered such a danger would retain their right 
of appeal on all grounds, including the humanitarian grounds, to 
the immigration appeal division.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is good legislation and it will go a long way to removing 
the stigma that a few wrongdoers have placed on all immigrants. 
There is no welcome mat in this country for thugs and evildoers. 
They can stay right where they are.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know that Canadians are a tolerant and compassionate 
people. These are some of the values that have allowed us to 
build the kind of society we are, distinguishing us from other 
countries and societies.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The public frustration and exacerbation expressed from time 
to time are very much aimed at those who have twisted the rules 
or those who have broken covenants with Canada. Accordingly 
Bill C-44 targets those people.
<P>
	The problems we faced required the legislative action we are 
taking today. Let me be very clear: the porch light is on and the 
welcome mat is out for those who are genuine refugees, those 
who are escaping brutality and torture in their countries, 
individuals who are not only seeking out Canada as some would 
have us believe but seeking out other countries of the world. 
They are seeking no more or no less than the things we have in 
abundance in Canada. The porch light is on and the welcome mat 
is out for those who want to help us create jobs and continue to 
build this great nation.
<P>
	Let us get on with it, for there is much nation building to be 
done.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
extend my best wishes for the New Year to all my colleagues in 
this House.
<P>
	Today, we are going back to work after a seven-week break. 
Before speaking to Bill C-44, I would like to salute and 
congratulate my friend and colleague, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and Leader of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9175"> 9175 </A></B>
<P>
the Official Opposition in the  House of Commons, Lucien 
Bouchard. Thanks to his courage and determination he was able 
to survive a terrible disease and win a very tough fight for his 
life. He will soon be back in this House and in the political 
arena. I wish to say to him how happy and proud of him we are. 
Quebec needs Mr. Bouchard.
<P>
	I rise to participate in the debate at third reading on Bill C-44, 
an act to amend the Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act and 
to make a consequential amendment to the Customs Act. This 
bill was introduced and read the first time in the House of 
Commons on June 17, 1994. It passed second reading on 
September 27 and was then referred to the Standing Committee 
on Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	The committee tabled its report after hearing many 
individuals and organizations interested in this bill. Bill C-44 
was debated at report stage in this House on December 12, 1994.
<P>
	According to its authors, the bill has the following objectives: 
prevent a person convicted of a crime punishable by a term of 
imprisonment of 10 years of more in Canada or abroad from 
claiming refugee status; give immigration officers the authority 
to seize documents sent by international mail that could be used 
for fraudulent purposes; remove from the Immigration Appeal 
Division appeals based on grounds of equity, when the minister 
believes the appellant to be a danger to the public-from what I 
just heard, he will use this power very often-; take away from a 
person affected by this the right to appeal, on the grounds that 
they represent a security risk.
<P>
	As I have said time and again, we in the Bloc Quebecois say 
that the state and the government have the right and the duty to 
protect Canada and Quebec against criminals whatever their 
origins.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	We agree that entry should be denied to immigrants and 
refugee claimants who have committed major crimes against 
persons in their country of origin and decide to flee to Canada, 
given our reputation as host country. While recognizing that 
there are problems with the criminal activity of refugees and 
immigrants, we suggest that the government already has all the 
legal and administrative means to deal with this situation.
<P>
	For example, under the present legislation, Bill C-86, the 
minister has the power to have war criminals and anyone who 
has perpetrated a crime against humanity removed. But the 
government is taking no action against criminals in this 
category. Several Nazis still live in Canada. Léon Mugesera, 
said to be a Rwandan criminal by his own community, has not 
yet been expelled, in spite of the questions I have put to the 
minister in this House.
<P>
	The law presently states that persons convicted of an offence 
outside of Canada are inadmissible to the refugee claim 
determination system when there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that the offence of which they have been convicted may 
constitute an offence punishable under a Canadian Act of 
Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or 
more and when the Minister of Immigration is satisfied that they 
might be a threat to public safety in Canada.
<P>
	This is good enough for me, but I must point out that the 
Canadian Council for Refugees wants this clause that I just read 
to be deleted. Needless to say, they object to it being expanded to 
include permanent residents.
<P>
	This bill is an excessive and disproportionate response to the 
two murders committed in Toronto in the spring of 1994 by 
foreign nationals. It was produced hastily, without any prior 
consultations, in spite of the fact that the minister promised 
when he took office that national consultations on the 
immigration policy would be held, at a cost of over $1 million.
<P>
	Even the counsels and groups who work with immigrants and 
refugees were surprised. This bill is this Liberal government's 
response to the drastic and reactionary positions endorsed by the 
Reform Party. This bill, and several statements made by the 
minister, reflect a shift to the right by the Liberal Party of 
Canada.
<P>
	It is very unfortunate that the government rejected every 
amendment moved by the opposition. The Liberal majority had 
already rejected the Bloc Quebecois proposals during the clause 
by clause study of the bill. Moreover, the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration took, at the report stage, the same 
inflexible stance as his Liberal colleagues in the legislative 
committee, rejecting over 20 amendments I personally moved 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois as well as those put forth by my 
colleague from Laval East.
<P>
	One of our amendments, for example, was designed to 
exclude from the application of the new legislation landed 
immigrants who have resided in Canada for ten years or more, as 
is currently the case in Australia and several other countries. 
Some of these people have no emotional ties with their country 
of origin. As it stands, there are people who have been living in 
this country for over 40 years who could now be removed. The 
minister and the Liberal majority have rejected this perfectly 
valid amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Many organizations testified before the Standing Committee 
on Citizenship and Immigration, including: the Canadian 
council for refugees, which is a very well-respected 
organization in that sector; the national immigration law section 
of the Canadian bar association; the Canada employment and 
immigration union; the United Nations high commissioner for 
refugees; the Canadian section of Amnesty International; the 
national action 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9176"> 9176 </A></B>
<P>
committee on the status of women; the Canadian labour 
congress-incidentally, I congratulate CLC  officials for the 
quality of their submission as well as for their very supportive 
position regarding immigrants and refugees; the inter-church 
committee for refugees; the Quebec association of immigration 
lawyers; the Canadian ethnocultural council; the immigration 
and refugee board; the customs and excise union, etc.
<P>
	None of these organizations supported the bill. The 
overwhelming majority of them strongly opposed this 
legislation. Some even made suggestions to help the House 
ensure that this bill is better designed, and that it is fair and 
efficient. Some asked for the outright withdrawal of that 
legislation because it is unfair and it violates commitments 
made by Canada regarding political asylum.
<P>
	To that effect, allow me, Mr. Speaker, to quote from an article 
written by Nantha Kumar, which appeared in a Montreal 
publication called <I>Hour</I>, on December 15, 1994. The author 
alludes to a war said to be fought against refugees within the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The war is being fought on two fronts. Abroad, plain clothed immigration 
officers sit at major international airports, intercepting people they suspect are 
heading for Canada to apply for refugee status. At home, a propaganda war is 
being waged against claimants in order to convince Canadians that a more hard 
line approach is needed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Montreal immigration lawyer, Richard Kurland, says that he 
has discovered ``a department within the immigration 
department''. Kurland says the communication strategy is 
clearly intended to sell the Canadian public on an enforcement 
oriented immigration policy. For example, when a government 
sponsored report by Professor James Hathaway criticized the 
fairness and legality of some practices at the Immigration and 
Refugee Board, it failed to make the front pages of most 
newspapers.
<P>
	What instead made headlines the day the Hathaway report was 
released was the first of a series of immigration abuse stories. 
``The anti-immigrant and anti-refugee stories at the time were 
extraordinary'', adds Kurland.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, says Kurland, 
``is not only under serious political pressure from the Reform 
Party. He is also under siege by the department within the 
department''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We, Bloc Quebecois members, deplore this regrettable swing 
to the right by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Such a move, which signals a dangerous shift towards 
intolerance, is made so as to manipulate public opinion and 
make Canadians forget that the vast majority of them, including 
myself, have come here in successive waves of immigrants, 
since the discovery and founding of this country.
<P>
	I agree that something must be done regarding criminals in 
Canada, including those who are not Canadian citizens and who 
are seeking refugee status. However, any measure must comply 
with the Charter, as well as with the international conventions to 
which Canada is a party. I should also add that the minister and 
all of us agree that the overwhelming majority of immigrants are 
honest and law-abiding people.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The question therefore arises whether we really need 
legislation to deal with this very small minority. After all, the 
government already has a whole arsenal of laws, regulations and 
resources to deal with the small number of criminal immigrants.
<P>
	At the very least, this bill raises some very serious 
constitutional questions. For instance, since its decision in the 
Singh case in 1985, the Supreme Court has determined that 
everyone in Canada, not just every citizen or every permanent 
resident but everyone in Canada, is protected by the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. According to the Supreme Court, an 
inquiry is necessary in situations that are not clear.
<P>
	The Supreme Court also says that the potential cost of 
conducting an inquiry on certain refugees does not constitute 
reasonable grounds for restricting that right, even if the 
government says it would be too expensive. According to the 
Supreme Court, this would not justify depriving someone of the 
right to an inquiry.
<P>
	We are very critical of Bill C-44. The powers of senior 
immigration officers, which are already very extensive, have 
been considerably expanded with respect to the exclusion of 
claimants of refugee status at the Canadian border or at points of 
entry. The bill gives these senior immigration officers the 
authority to issue a warrant for the arrest of a person who fails to 
appear. Such warrants may be issued in the case of any person 
with respect to whom a decision is to be made or an examination 
or inquiry is to be held. The warrant may be served by the police 
in order to force the person concerned to appear.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the excessive authority vested in 
senior immigration officers. In any democratic society, judges, 
and not mere public servants, are authorized to issue arrest 
warrants.
<P>
	Regarding the right to appeal on compassionate grounds, the 
original wording of the bill was amended to read that the 
minister must issue a statement that a person constitutes a 
danger to the public, before he loses his right to appeal, and the 
minister has said he intends to make frequent use of this 
authority.
<P>
	The term ``danger to the public'' is very ambiguous. No 
definition is given, which opens the way to arbitrary decisions 
and abuse. Who will make the very crucial decision to state that 
someone is a danger to the public? The minister, public servants, 
the RCMP or the Canadian Security Intelligence Service? On 
what grounds? Will they go through thousands of files with a 
fine tooth comb to find out whether someone constitutes a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9177"> 9177 </A></B>
<P>
danger to the  public in Canada? The decisions will be secret. 
This is contrary to the practice in our judiciary system, where 
hearings are public. Those are just a few of our concerns.
<P>
	There is another aspect I would like to discuss. The bill does 
not weigh the seriousness of the crime and the danger to the host 
country, in this case Canada, as provided under the Geneva 
Convention on refugees. According to many authors and legal 
experts, if a person is threatened, on political grounds, with 
certain death, life imprisonment or serious abuse if he returns to 
his country of origin, he should be granted refugee status even if 
he is guilty of a serious crime.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The seizure of international mail by immigration officers just 
mentioned by the minister constitutes another very dangerous 
provision in a democratic society.
<P>
	The Refugee Convention distinguishes between crimes of 
common law and those of a political nature, a distinction 
completely absent from Bill C-44.
<P>
	According to the manual of the UN Office of the High 
Commissioner for Refugees, consideration must first be given 
to the nature of and reason for the crime, in other words whether 
it was committed for truly political reasons or whether the 
motive was monetary or purely personal.
<P>
	Neither does the bill make a distinction between prosecution 
and persecution. According to the manual of the UN Office of 
the High Commissioner for Refugees, a person guilty of a 
common law offence who is liable to an extreme penalty may be 
in a situation that is tantamount to persecution as defined by the 
Geneva Convention. In certain countries, prosecution may be a 
means of persecuting someone, and the law may be applied in a 
discriminatory manner.
<P>
	The bill refers to a person convicted of an offence that, if 
committed in Canada, would carry a term of imprisonment of 
ten years or more. It mentions the maximum sentence for the 
offence, not the sentence actually handed down. As you know, 
the circumstances of a crime may vary from one extreme to 
another, justifying a maximum or minimum sentence 
accordingly.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that, in general, Canada's Criminal 
Code does not specify minimum sentences for offences. Thus, 
an individual convicted of an offence for which a term of 
imprisonment of ten years or more may be imposed might not be 
sentenced to jail or even fined. He might simply be put on 
probation or given a suspended sentence.
<P>
	Among the most important briefs submitted to the legislative 
committee, I would like to cite the very comprehensive 
document and testimony of the Inter-Church Committee for 
Refugees. This organization is concerned that certain classes of 
refugees will be found inadmissible at a point of entry or 
elsewhere in Canada, and that they will be deported without an 
impartial examination of their need for protection. This 
organization, which includes about ten Canadian churches, is 
therefore asking that refugee claimants be allowed to present 
arguments against their deportation before an impartial and 
independent tribunal.
<P>
	They object to legitimate refugees claiming refugee status at 
the border being turned around without even considering their 
need for protection. The right of asylum is entrenched not only 
in the Geneva Convention but also in the Charter of the 
Organization of American States, as well as several other 
international instruments.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the excellent presentations from such 
organizations and individuals, who are very knowledgeable on 
the subject, the government is rigidly standing its ground, 
except for making a few minor changes.
<P>
	On the other hand, section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms states that no one may be deprived of the right to 
liberty and security, except in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice. Section one of the Charter says that these 
rights may be subject only to reasonable and demonstrably 
justified limits.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that Bill C-44 is a very technical, 
difficult, complex and sensitive bill.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government is showing a blatant lack of 
sensitivity towards immigrants and refugees who are victims of 
persecution. In so doing, the Liberal government goes back on 
promises made in its red book.
<P>
	Today, the minister stated the same inflexible position as he 
did at first and second reading. He paid no attention to the 
opinion of the opposition.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration already had the 
means, as I said earlier, to deny criminals entry into Canada and 
to send them back to their country of origin. Several 
administrative measures like the ones mentioned earlier by the 
minister have been taken to do so. The minister created working 
groups made up of immigration, RCMP and local police officers 
in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in order to arrest and deport 
criminals in the process of obtaining immigrant or refugee 
status.
<P>
	This House is also considering Bill C-37, an act to amend the 
Young Offenders Act and the Criminal Code. This bill also deals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9178"> 9178 </A></B>
<P>
with young people who do not have Canadian citizenship and 
have been convicted of criminal offences.
<P>
	Finally, a memorandum of agreement was signed by the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration and Correctional 
Services Canada in order to make deporting foreign criminals 
faster and easier. Hundreds of people have been tracked down 
and deported from Canada. RCMP officers and others have been 
posted in Canadian embassies and at major airports abroad in 
order to prevent criminals from entering Canada.
<P>
	In November 1993, the recently appointed minister stated that 
he wanted to reduce political influence in refugee matters. He 
told <I>La Presse</I> that he wanted a system with as little political 
involvement as possible. Yet, this bill contradicts what he said 
in 1993. He wants to politicize even more the immigration and 
refugee determination process. He will issue statements to the 
effect that someone constitutes a danger to the public and will 
also stop appeals. This bill raises questions on the independence 
of the IRB and all administrative tribunals.
<P>
	He also said that he wanted to introduce a more progressive 
approach and move away from Tory positions. Indeed, the 
minister's approach differs from that of the Conservatives. 
However, it is not because his refugee policies are more 
progressive, but because they are more reactionary and harsher 
than were those of the Conservatives. A Liberal minister is 
actually doing something the Conservatives never dared to do.
<P>
	When the minister took over his portfolio, he immediately 
separated the immigration component from the department of 
public security, a measure which we welcomed at the time. 
However, Bill C-44 now links immigration to crime. Once 
again, the minister, like his government, does exactly the 
opposite of what he preached during the election campaign.
<P>
	This bill gives the impression that all criminals in Canada are 
immigrants and refugees, which is utterly false and unfair. In 
fact, the crime rate among new Canadians is lower than that for 
those born in Canada. It should also be pointed out that, in recent 
years, the crime rate has been on the decline in Canada, which is 
of course a good thing.
<P>
	Let me say a word on the issue of patronage at the IRB. In 
1994, the government appointed, or renewed, the mandate of 
over 100 IRB members, including 65 new ones.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The IRB was created in 1988 by an act of Parliament. 
Although the board is a quasi-judicial tribunal, it has been used, 
since the beginning, as a patronage instrument.
<P>
	The board is the largest administrative tribunal in the country; 
it is made up of 210 members appointed by the governor in 
council, as well as 40 adjudicators, who are public servants.
<P>
	Since the beginning of the 35th Parliament, the Bloc 
Quebecois has been asking that the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration fulfill its mandate and review the 
appointments of IRB members. It must be understood that, 
while the IRB is subject to the power of review of tribunals, it is 
also subject to the administrative control of Parliament.
<P>
	Since January 1994, the committee's Liberal majority only 
once allowed a review of a dozen or so appointments. Although 
very little time was allowed for this exercise-just one 
morning-we could see to what extent the Liberals had 
reproduced the same kind of patronage system established by 
the former Conservative government.
<P>
	Take the following appointments made by the present 
government. These are Liberals and friends of the party, 
appointed as members of the IRB with an annual salary of 
$75,000: Auguste Choquette, former Liberal member for 
Lotbinière, Quebec, from 1963 to 1968, who was even 
temporarily disbarred by the Barreau du Québec; Joan Kouri, 
former Liberal candidate in Brome-Missisquoi, Quebec, in 
1993 and former president of the Liberal Women's Federation; 
Philomen Wright, supporter of the hon. member for York West 
and current Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and 
member of the York West Liberal Riding Association in Ontario, 
a friend of the minister; Elke Homsi, former assistant to various 
Liberal MPPs in Ontario; Sherry Wiebe, director of research for 
the Manitoba Liberal Caucus; Inderjit Bal, appointed in 1994, 
who had to resign following a review and revelations before the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, and who 
sought the Liberal nomination in the riding of 
Bramalae-Gore-Malton, Ontario, in 1993 and organized the 
campaign of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration; Ravi 
Naqvi, who unsuccessfully sought the Liberal nomination in 
Mississauga West, Ontario; Patricia Davey, wife of a former aid 
to Pierre Elliott Trudeau; Ethel Teitelbaum, executive assistant 
to the former Liberal Minister of Finance, Donald MacDonald.
<P>
	Some of these board members had no previous knowledge or 
experience of refugee problems, as we realized during meetings 
of the Standing Committee on Immigration and Citizenship. The 
case of Mr. Michael Schelew, former deputy chairperson of the 
board, appointed by the present minister, goes well beyond the 
most fundamental limits of decency.
<P>
	Because of internal wrangling within the board between 
Liberal and Conservative factions, Mr. Schelew was suspended 
and a legal inquiry was ordered by the minister. Pressured to 
resign, he agreed to do so only the day the inquiry was to start 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9179"> 9179 </A></B>
<P>
and after he was promised  more than $100,000 of public money, 
although he had not completed even one year on the job.
<P>
	The minister never really explained what happened in this 
rather embarrassing case for the government. It bought the 
silence of this deputy chairperson of the board with a substantial 
amount of money, while cutting payments to the unemployed, 
welfare recipients and the neediest in our society.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Worse, with this outlandish settlement, the minister 
prevented the judge from looking into the board's 
mismanagement. The Bloc Quebecois has asked for, and will 
continue to demand, a public inquiry into the operations of the 
IRB which, at the very least, is going through a serious crisis. 
The Bloc Quebecois will continue to denounce patronage 
appointments by the minister and his government. We will 
demand a review of all future appointments by the committee. It 
is high time that the minister put into practice the 
recommendations contained in Professor Hathaway's report, 
that he personally commissioned.
<P>
	I ask the minister and his government, instead of blindly and 
stubbornly defending Bill C-44, to try to counter the rise of 
anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiment in Canada. We must 
promote better understanding among Canadians, regardless of 
their origin.
<P>
	On many occasions, in this House, I have decried the climate 
of hostility towards newcomers which is spreading across this 
country. I also reminded members that we have to meet our 
international humanitarian obligations and provide a safe haven 
for victims of political, religious or social persecution.
<P>
	Unfortunately, immigrants, and especially refugees, are 
increasingly being used as scapegoats for the social and 
economic problems Canada is facing. In this context, Bill C-44 
only serves to reinforce prejudices linking crime to 
immigration.
<P>
	As an immigrant, and the official opposition critic for 
immigration and citizenship for over a year, I have noticed that 
Canada is becoming increasingly less generous and welcoming 
with refugees, in spite of the commitment made by the Liberal 
government in the red book to develop a humanitarian refugee 
policy and to admit a fair share of them.
<P>
	I will point out that Canada is only taking in less than 0.25 per 
cent of persecuted and displaced people throughout the world. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, there are more than 100 million of 
these people. Therefore, I ask the minister and his government 
to promote a more humane and more generous attitude toward 
newcomers, especially refugees, instead of defending Bill C-44 
which is so full of injustices and will lead to abuses.
<P>
	In this international year of tolerance, the government should 
organize an awareness campaign highlighting the contributions 
of immigrants to Canadian society and the benefits of 
immigration.
<P>
	For these reasons, I will vote against the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
here we are again back to debating a bill which there really need 
not be much debate on. Bill C-44 was a poor piece of legislation 
several months ago when we began debate and it remains a bad 
piece of legislation today.
<P>
	When this bill was introduced we examined it carefully and 
came to the conclusion that it, not unlike the party and the 
minister who proposed it, was all talk and no action, big on 
words, short on effect.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is snake oil. It is being marketed as a cure all, a fix 
to the national mess that we call immigration policy.
<P>
	Last year people died because of poor enforcement of the 
immigration policy. People who did not deserve to be residents 
of Canada remained residents of Canada. People who should 
never have been allowed to enter this country were allowed to 
enter.
<P>
	The Immigration and Refugee Board laughed in the collective 
face of Canadians and ignored the needs of thousands of 
suffering refugees around the world by jacking up inland 
acceptance rates, granting hearings to even the most outrageous 
claims, overturning the deportation orders of dangerous, violent 
repeat offenders and suckering taxpayers out of a billion dollars 
or more all in the name of their brand of compassion.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	In response to these and many other outrages that were 
splashed across the front pages of papers across the country and 
which rightly angered Canadians who felt that our immigration 
system was out of control, the minister responded by saying: 
``No problem. Don't look at the planes that crash, most of them 
don't''. He said we need to pay more attention to the planes that 
land, the success stories, and ignore the rest.
<P>
	We and millions of Canadians did not ignore the planes that 
crashed. Every time one of the minister's metaphorical planes 
crashed, every time the Immigration and Refugee Board 
screwed up, every time the immigration enforcement fell down 
on the job and every time the court system was abused by queue 
jumpers it hurt Canadians, it hurt immigrants across the country 
and it hurt the tens of thousands of genuine refugees who are 
overseas and need our help but cannot get it because we have left 
it up to the Immigration and Refugee Board to award scarce 
places to those who manage to show up, get a legal aid attorney 
to plead their case and push the right politically correct buttons 
of the IRB.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9180"> 9180 </A></B>
<P>
	Sometimes when the minister's metaphorical planes crash it 
costs Canadians outrageous amounts of money but sometimes it 
costs people their lives.
<P>
	Suddenly things got a little too hot for the minister of 
immigration. He suddenly realized that he had to do something, 
anything, and he had to do it fast. He thought he needed to table 
something, needed to make it look as though he really made a 
change or had taken charge and was really cleaning up his act. 
He and his legislative assistants got together and hurriedly 
drafted Bill C-44.
<P>
	Here it is, they told us, the panacea, the cure for the 
immigration problems. With C-44 they assured us they were 
getting tough and would not tolerate abuses in immigration. 
This would stop the tragedies that occurred last year and are just 
waiting, mark my words, to happen again.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is an impressive looking document. It is pages and 
pages of thick legal text adding this to the Immigration Act. It 
strikes out some parts, redefines some things and reiterates 
others.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is really a whole lot of nothing at all. Is it a cure all 
for immigration woes?-not even close. Does it tackle the 
serious problems of morale and under staffing in the 
immigration department, especially in the area of 
enforcement?-no, it does not. Does it take away the incentive 
or the means for lawyers and advocates to endlessly tie up the 
IRB and our courts with appeal after appeal?-no way.
<P>
	Does it restore accountability to the immigration decision 
making process, a lack of accountability that has allowed the 
immigration minister to slither away from foul ups by saying: 
``What can I do, it is an independent board'', or allowing the IRB 
to say it is accountable only to the courts?-not even close. Does 
it secure the front door, our ports of entry?-no.
<P>
	Does it get to the root of virtually all the problems in 
immigration today, the problems of numbers, too many to be 
properly handled by the department under any circumstances 
with the degree of care and precision that would allow for 
careful and thorough screening of all applicants?-no, it does 
not.
<P>
	Here is what C-44 does. It provides an easy out for the 
minister and the government who are utterly incapable of 
making real choices, exercising real leadership and taking 
action, who instead are always looking for the easy way out, the 
appearance of action, much ado about nothing, sound and fury 
signifying nothing. Bill C-44 is exactly that. It is a great deal of 
legislative sound and fury which signifies absolutely nothing to 
the average law-abiding Canadian who wants a sane 
immigration policy and to immigrants who just want to start a 
new life, obey the law and enjoy their new home.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister of immigration has often spoken of his lofty 
ideals for immigration. He has often presented to Canadians and 
this House his vision of what immigration should do for Canada 
and what Canada should do for immigrants.
<P>
	The minister has tried to argue that high immigration levels, 
the IRB and other elements of Canada's immigration policy are 
good for Canada because they enhance Canada's economy. He 
said that immigrants put into the economy more than they take 
out. We do not argue that. He has argued that immigration is a 
Canadian legacy, that immigration built Canada, it continues to 
build Canada and should build Canada in the future. That is 
obvious. That is the Reform Party's position on these points, just 
as it is the Liberals' position, the Bloc's position and also the 
NDP's position. It is even the position of the previous 
government.
<P>
	The minister of immigration is taking no high road when he 
talks about the history of immigration and the need for that 
continued tradition. However there is a huge difference in 
talking about the past, talking about broad universally shared 
ideals and putting those ideals and values into practice.
<P>
	That is where this government and my party part company. We 
both agree that immigration is a vital part of the Canadian 
heritage. We both agree that immigrants are an asset to the 
economy.
<P>
	It is time to get beyond the ``we are for immigration but you 
are not'' rhetoric. We are all for immigration. The Reform Party 
and the Liberal Party are for continued immigration. Frankly, 
we in the Reform Party think we speak for the Canadian people 
when we say that enough is enough of the name calling and mud 
slinging that surrounds the immigration debate. That is the sort 
of rhetoric the government likes to employ when discussing 
immigration.
<P>
	As offensive as that sort of rhetoric is, the rhetoric contained 
in Bill C-44 is even more offensive. It is most offensive because 
it looks like legislation that could help. Only insiders, people 
who are intimately familiar with the workings of immigration in 
Canada, would know why this bill is of little value and why it is 
unnecessary.
<P>
	As I said before, there is no disagreement over the value of 
immigration to Canada. The Reform Party says that Canada 
could do better when it comes to immigration policy. The 
Reform Party says that there are real solid immediate changes 
that could be made to Canada's immigration policy that would 
benefit not only Canadians but immigrants as well.
<P>
	When the government thinks that the status quo, a status quo 
created by the former Conservative government, is the way to go 
with ultra high levels, levels that are more than twice as high as 
those in any other country on earth, astronomical levels in this 
day and age, levels that are simply too high for our immigration 
department to handle, is it any wonder that large  numbers of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9181"> 9181 </A></B>
<P>
undesirables are slipping through? Is it any wonder that large 
numbers of deportable people are evading arrest, given these 
astronomical numbers?
<P>
	One way we can make a huge dent immediately in stopping 
large numbers of undesirables from entering the country and one 
way we can reduce the incredible number of deportable 
immigrants is simply to bring the total number of immigrants 
down to a reasonable sustainable level.
<P>
	This minister and this government-and I dare them to stand 
up and say differently-have not established quotas on the 
number of immigrants entering the country. They have not 
reduced the numbers. They are simply taking credit for a lower 
number of applicants in some categories. It is smoke and 
mirrors.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is the same sort of smoke and mirrors, the same sort 
of cynical politics. Take credit for something that is not real 
seems to be the motto of this government and this immigration 
minister.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is not real. It too is smoke and mirrors. It too is a 
shell game. It too is cynical politics. This minister has tried to 
fool the people of Canada into thinking that something is 
happening when nothing is happening.
<P>
	Let us go through this piece of legislation to see what it 
purports to do, why it does not do what it purports to do and why 
all members of this Parliament, those who want to report to their 
constituents with good consciences, will vote against this bill.
<P>
	As a side bar, I know that not all members have had a chance 
to read this bill. Reading all bills is simply not possible for a 
member of Parliament. That is why I urge members to listen 
carefully as I go through the major clauses of Bill C-44 so that 
they will know why voting for this bill serves neither the 
interests of their communities nor the country as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	The first major thing this bill purports to do is to empower 
customs officers to seize identity documents that are fraudulent 
and sent through the mail. That is fantastic. I would love it if all 
fraudulent documents sent through the mail could be stopped 
and seized. Such a measure if implemented would take the heart 
out of the illegal immigrant industry and let me assure members 
that there is an industry out there.
<P>
	The minister has included that clause to give the Canadian 
people the impression he intends to stop the flow of illegal 
documents, or at least curb it. What could be wrong with that? I 
will tell you. Mansel Legacy, the head of the Customs Excise 
Union, says that this measure is utterly unenforceable. He 
appeared before the standing committee.
<P>
	Throughout the whole country there are only a handful of 
officers with the power and the job description to actually open 
and seize these documents. Further, law restricts officers from 
opening mail that is under 50 grams. Put a visa or an identity 
card in an envelope and weigh it and you will come up with the 
same thing I did. It weighs less than 50 grams. Even if someone 
were dumb enough to enclose a pound of fake passports in a 
single envelope there are only a handful of officers who would 
be able to seize them.
<P>
	The minister wants to give the impression he is taking care of 
a serious problem in customs and immigration policy. In fact he 
is just introducing a clause that is a lot of talk but is utterly 
unenforceable. That is the first piece of evidence that this bill 
was introduced to do nothing more than pull the wool over the 
eyes of Canadians.
<P>
	Another part of the bill that has been trumpeted by the 
minister as a serious get tough measure has been the limiting of 
immigration procedures for serious criminals. Bill C-44 
promises to limit the appeals of serious criminals to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. That is the board the minister 
so often defends which has developed a reputation for sending 
into the streets serious violent criminals and non-residents who 
have gone on to kill innocent Canadians. As he puts it, it is a 
great Canadian institution. I beg to differ.
<P>
	On first sight it is a good move. That was certainly my first 
reaction until I heard from the various lawyers and others who 
appeared before us at the standing committee. I am no legal 
expert and obviously the minister is not either. It is important for 
both of us to turn to the advice of lawyers when a bill is 
discussed in the standing committee.
<P>
	When the lawyers appeared before the standing committee 
they said that this bill would not stop criminal immigrants from 
making appeals, it would not even slow them down. Bill C-44 
does not stop serious convicted criminals from making appeals; 
it only stops them from making one kind of appeal. Bill C-44 
would stop the IRB from hearing appeals based on humanitarian 
and compassionate considerations only but it would still permit 
them to hear appeals on matters of fact and law.
<P>
	The lawyers who handle immigration and refugee cases and 
have the knowledge and a vested interest here have told us that 
C-44 will do nothing more than make them change their 
paperwork a little. Instead of making an appeal on 
compassionate grounds, they will make an appeal on fact and 
law. The bottom line is that criminal immigrants stay in the 
country. They stay, we pay.
<P>
	This measure, the second major part of the bill, will not work 
but it does sound good. It sounds good and it appeases the 
majority of Canadians who want tougher immigration laws 
without actually changing anything important. No vested 
interest will be offended. As such I have to give this government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9182"> 9182 </A></B>
<P>
credit for its savvy. I have to give it credit for being able to write 
a bill that sounds like so much while delivering so little. It is a 
bill that  appeases the majority without offending the ever so 
important minority who have the ear of the minister.
<P>
	The third major part of this bill would make someone 
inadmissible for a claim before the IRB if it is discovered they 
have been convicted of a major crime in or outside Canada. That 
is great. Superb, as a matter of fact. That is exactly what the 
Reform Party has been demanding all along. Let us look a little 
closer at what Bill C-44 would really do.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Experts appearing before the committee have told us that Bill 
C-44 would have the perverse effect for example of allowing 
people who are caught with illegal guns in the trunks of their 
cars to remain in Canada while those who write bad cheques will 
no longer be able to stay or to make that claim. If you ask me, 
neither of these people deserve to be heard before the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. Clearly this bill uses an 
arbitrary measure of criminality to determine who is bad and 
who is not.
<P>
	There is something much more insidious about this section of 
the bill. For those who want to do their homework before voting 
on this bill, and I encourage all my hon. colleagues to do just 
that, this section of the bill is absolutely unnecessary. It is 
unnecessary because the minister through his representatives 
already has the power to stop refugee hearings for people who 
would constitute a danger to Canada.
<P>
	I have a list of individuals or at least one individual here for 
whom the minister has already signed an order to remove him 
from the country. He has done so. He can intervene at any time. 
The minister would have an opportunity to intervene in any of 
those claims that would constitute a violation of the 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	The minister already has the power and it has been legislated 
again into Bill C-44. The minister can already intervene and 
make ineligible for a refugee hearing people whose presence in 
Canada would constitute a danger to the public interest.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is not necessary legally. It is only necessary 
politically. It is necessary because the minister of immigration 
does not have the political will. He does not have the guts to 
intervene personally to stop refugee hearings for people who do 
not deserve status in Canada.
<P>
	He says that he cannot intervene. That is simply not true. The 
minister just does not want to intervene and that is a fact. He 
could have intervened on Mendoza or Inthavong. Rather than 
sticking his neck out and possibly offending the special 
interests, the minister is passing the buck to the IRB. Believe 
me, the IRB is the last group of people with whom we want to 
entrust the safety of Canadians. Bill C-44 is just a way for the 
minister to pass the buck.
<P>
	As another side bar, compare Bill C-44 with the Reform 
Party's refugee determination proposals. In those proposals 
there is a recurring theme. That theme is that the minister should 
use the power already available to him under the Immigration 
Act to toughen up on refugee determination and stop dangerous 
and undeserving people from making claims. We have the guts 
to do it. I think the majority of government backbenchers would 
have the guts, but this minister does not. Think about that before 
raising your hand in favour of this bill.
<P>
	The final major clause of Bill C-44 deals with people 
applying for citizenship who are convicted of serious crimes or 
who are guilty of serious crimes outside Canada. The bill would 
temporarily halt the processing of applications for citizenship 
for those who have been found to have criminal backgrounds. 
That ignores a very serious question, a question that we have 
posed to this minister again and again over the past year. When 
exactly are the backgrounds checked and how thoroughly? 
According to the minister all backgrounds are checked.
<P>
	I do not need to tell you about the multiple and frequent cases 
of people who have been allowed into Canada. They have been 
given status and then because of tips or information on the side 
have been found to be serious criminals, even war criminals.
<P>
	Our immigration department is simply not able to thoroughly 
and adequately check the backgrounds of the quarter of a million 
immigrants Canada accepts each year. It is just not possible 
given the numbers. In order to stop a citizenship application a 
background has to be discovered but we have neither the ability 
nor the manpower to do it. It will not work.
<P>
	Even assuming the best case scenario in terms of Bill C-44 if 
it is implemented and is used effectively, what then? Many more 
deportation orders would be issued. Good news you say. Wrong. 
Perversely and as a direct result of the inaction of the current 
immigration minister and the previous immigration ministers, it 
is bad news. It is bad news because of the sheer number of 
deportation warrants that are currently on the books.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Estimates, and that is all the immigration department has been 
kind enough to give us, suggest that there are up to 40,000 
deportation warrants outstanding and unaccountable.
<P>
	We have heard that in the city of Toronto there could be as 
many as 25,000 people who have deportation orders against 
them. Are they being rounded up? No. Are those numbers being 
substantially reduced? No. Can they be substantially reduced? 
Not given the priorities of this minister. The priorities of this 
minister are keeping the levels at the highest ever for Canada 
and the world, stressing family class immigration over 
independent immigration, keeping our inland acceptance rate of 
self-proclaimed refugees up to 50 times higher than other 
refugee accepting nations at a cost of over a billion dollars per 
year to the Canadian taxpayer. These  priorities have not allowed 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9183"> 9183 </A></B>
<P>
direction of attention and resources toward immigration 
enforcement.
<P>
	I told the House there are up to 25,000 outstanding 
deportation warrants in Toronto. To round these people up and 
escort them out of the country is a group of only 30 people with 
few tools, virtually no self-protection equipment and morale 
that is lower than that of any other group of public servants I 
have ever come across.
<P>
	Even if Bill C-44 adds a few more people to the deportation 
rolls, it will not mean more people actually leaving Canada. 
Even dangerous criminals will still be able to appeal their 
deportation orders endlessly in the courts and to the IRB, all at 
the taxpayers' expense and probably with some success.
<P>
	Just a few weeks ago a suspected war criminal from Rwanda 
was apprehended in Montreal after having successfully made it 
through Canada's almost non-existent screening process. He 
was allowed permanent resident status in Canada. This is a 
person who is accused of playing an instrumental role in 
whipping up the racial hatred that resulted in the deaths of 
hundreds of thousands and of ethnic cleansing of a sort not seen 
since World War II. Has he been deported? No. Is he in a holding 
cell? No. Is he in prison? No. He is on the streets, released by an 
adjudicator on a $5,000 bond.
<P>
	Had Bill C-44 already been passed would it have prevented 
this sort of outrage? No, it would not have. It does not address it 
at all.
<P>
	Over the recess a foreign criminal by the name of Inthevong 
who had been convicted of assault, various minor crimes and 
playing a role in a murder, was scheduled for deportation. He 
was brought before one of the minister's appointees at the IRB 
and was set loose on Canadian streets.
<P>
	Like most Canadians I take the stupidity of the Immigration 
and Refugee Board for granted. Adding insult to injury in this 
case is the fact that the minister for immigration, the 
representative of the people of Canada, had the power to 
intervene and chose not to do it. The minister openly said that he 
would not intervene in this case to reverse the decision of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. I find that inexcusable.
<P>
	Could Bill C-44 have stopped Inthevong's release? No, but 
the minister could have. The problem is not a lack of legislation. 
The Immigration Act gives the minister of immigration a broad 
and unique range of powers already. However all the ministerial 
power in the world will not do any good when the minister does 
not have the guts to use it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to take 
a moment to ask members to be a little more aware of the 
selection of words that can be used at times on issues that are 
sensitive and controversial but nonetheless very important.
<P>
	I return the floor to the hon. member for Calgary Northeast.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, legislation like Bill C-44 can even 
have the effect of giving the minister and the government an out, 
an excuse. Canadians have been asking of the minister: ``Why 
are you not doing anything?'', to which he can cynically answer 
if Bill C-44 passes, ``I am''.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is an excuse. It is an out. It is a cheap substitute. 
This minister does not have the intestinal fortitude to do what 
has to be done.
<P>
	The rationale behind Bill C-44 is contradictory. With Bill 
C-44 the minister says that the problem of criminals abusing our 
immigration system will be addressed. He says that Bill C-44 
will allow for easier deportation. However, just a few short 
months ago the minister announced the creation of a task force 
of immigration officers and RCMP that would be charged with 
seeking out hundreds, if not thousands, of dangerous criminals 
that are in Canada illegally.
<P>
	The minister has been remarkably silent about the success of 
the task force. He has not stood up in the House to trumpet the 
success of the initiative, an initiative that I said right from the 
start would not work.
<P>
	It has not worked. Why? Because the task force is the 
clean-up crew for a mess that has been building for over two 
decades. The task force is trying to push undesirables out the 
back door at the same time as the front door has been left wide 
open, hanging by a hinge, rusting and squeaking in the wind. 
Also because once inside this great home that we call Canada 
undesirables are given the run of the place, hiding in the closets 
of the courts, ducking into the dark passageway of the IRB, 
making them untouchable, hidden by the very policy and 
regulation that the government has maintained from the 
previous government.
<P>
	That is the crux of the issue. That is why the Reform Party is 
opposing the bill. We are not opposing it out of spite. We are not 
opposing it because we do not want an initiative of this minister 
to pass. We are opposing it because we have more than enough 
bills already. We have a massive series of laws on the books that 
were ostensibly designed to protect Canadians, to make 
immigration work for both Canadians and immigrants. They 
have not.
<P>
	The House has passed a maze of laws that do nothing but 
allow those who have bad intentions and good legal counsel to 
make a mockery of Canada, to make us an international laughing 
stock. Every time one of the new immigration laws was passed a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9184"> 9184 </A></B>
<P>
minister stood before the Canadian people and said: ``See, I am 
doing something'', when in fact he or she was doing nothing but 
avoiding real action.
<P>
	That is what is going on here. That is what the current minister 
of immigration is doing. That is what the government has done 
in so many areas. An overwhelming deficit and high taxation 
threaten to relegate this once great country to third world status. 
The response to this crisis is that the government wants to raise 
taxes and to make some non-offensive cuts to government 
spending. Then it says: ``We are doing something'', when in fact 
things are getting worse.
<P>
	Crime threatens the security of our neighbourhoods and the 
tranquillity that Canadians have long taken for granted and 
considered their birthright. The government says: ``Let us pass a 
gun control law. See, we are doing something'', when in fact 
nothing is being done about the real problem.
<P>
	We have an immigration system that is out of control. The 
government gives us Bill C-44 and says: ``See, we are doing 
something'', when in fact it is doing nothing at all. It is all 
smoke and mirrors and more of the same. It is cynical politics 
designed to fool the Canadian people into thinking that 
something is being done.
<P>
	There is something that can be done. There is a way to clean 
up our immigration mess. The Reform Party has led the way and 
has put itself on the line. We have taken the high road by offering 
real solutions.
<P>
	The IRB is a large part of the immigration problem. We have 
offered a solution. Disband the IRB. Subsume its functions 
under the minister. Take more refugees from abroad. Tighten up 
our inland process so that it is more in line with the 
determination systems of other countries and is not driven by 
special interests. We have offered 13 proposals which, if 
enacted, would make the refugee system work better for both 
Canadians and refugees. It is a win-win situation.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	We have told the minister to exercise his powers to stop those 
that abuse the system by making appeal after appeal and to stop 
refugee hearings that are manifestly unfounded. We have told 
the government to cut the total number of immigrants to levels 
that are internally proportionate, numbers that the immigration 
department can handle, numbers that would still make Canada 
the world leader in immigration. We have told the government to 
increase the percentage of immigrants who come from the 
independent category.
<P>
	C.D. Howe, as reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, agrees with 
this proposal. Raising the number of independent immigrants 
would have the effect of making immigration a net positive for 
Canada. It would cut the $700 million bill for family 
reunification and cut the number of people who would come to 
Canada unchecked with questionable backgrounds.
<P>
	The minister claimed to have done this but anyone able to read 
a column of numbers knows that he was not on the mark. The 
numbers of family class immigrants under the minister's most 
recent targets actually goes up, not down. Smoke and mirrors, 
more of the same.
<P>
	We have offered real solutions, not bogus solutions like Bill 
C-44. We have said that the government and the immigration 
minister must be accountable. He must do more than just 
introduce faulty legislation that gives the impression of action 
without addressing any of the real problems or resulting in real 
benefit. We have offered solutions and they have been ignored 
by the government.
<P>
	I urge my hon. colleagues, through you, Mr. Speaker, to vote 
no on this bill. Members, like the people of Canada, may have 
been talked into believing that the bill will solve some of the 
problems plaguing immigration policy today. I am here to tell 
them, with all sincerity and with partisanship aside, that it will 
not. I am here to tell them that the bill is just an excuse for 
inaction. It is an excuse for a minister who does not want to 
exercise the power already available to him, a minister who 
wants to pass the buck.
<P>
	For those on both sides of the House who want to represent 
their constituents, who are truly concerned about making a 
difference, making government work and making government 
accountable, I urge members to read the bill and discuss it with 
people in the know from either side of the ideology fence. Once 
they have had their concerns validated from their own trusted 
resources I urge them to do the right thing and vote no on this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Following the minister's 
intervention and that of the two critics, members during the next 
five hours will be allowed up to a maximum of 20-minute 
interventions subject to a 10-minute question or comment 
period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with honour that I rise in the House today to speak in support of 
Bill C-44.
<P>
	Leaving my prepared text for a minute, I want to say that 
many of the concerns brought forward by the Reform Party 
relating to enforcement and the resources in the department are 
also shared by the minister, all Canadians and myself. We live in 
difficult fiscal times and budget constraints are a reality for 
many departments. I know that probably the finance minister 
was listening with real interest when people said that we should 
spend more money in the immigration department. The minister 
of immigration would probably support that.
<P>
	Let me begin by talking a little about my riding. I come from 
an area where immigration is an important issue but certainly 
not one of the main issues. My riding is on the north shore of 
Lake Erie. It has been settled by wave after wave of 
immigration, like many parts of this country have been. 
Originally it was settled by people from Britain, primarily by 
Scots. More recent-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9185"> 9185 </A></B>
<P>
ly it was  settled by the Dutch community in the 1950s. We have 
recently had Portuguese immigrants.
<P>
	We have a long tradition of recognizing the importance of 
immigration to this country and to our communities. Everybody 
is concerned about making sure that Canada has the right type of 
immigrants, that we are the ones who are doing the selecting and 
not others selecting us. We want to have an appropriate system 
in place. If a criminal comes to this country and commits a 
crime, we want to have certain mechanisms in place. If they are 
a danger to Canadians this mechanism will allow us to get them 
out fairly quickly, with reasonable recognition that they have 
legal rights. We want to kick out the right people, not the wrong 
people.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why we want to put in place a proper process. I stand in 
support of Bill C-44 because I believe it does that. I am sure 
members will think, after listening to my speech and the speech 
of my colleague who spoke before me, that one of us could not 
have been listening at the immigration committee or one of us is 
patently wrong. I will try to point that out as I go along.
<P>
	The key aspect I like about the bill is that it will remove the 
right to appeal to the immigration appeal division of the refugee 
board when the minister has made a determination that the 
person is a danger to Canadian society and has committed a 
crime with a maximum sentence of more than 10 years.
<P>
	To understand why that is important we need to understand the 
process now. Let us say my colleague is a landed immigrant who 
commits an assault or a series of assaults. He does his time in 
jail. Then he comes out and the department says that it wants to 
kick him out. He can appeal to the immigration and appeal 
division and ask to stay in Canada simply on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds.
<P>
	Whether or not we agree with that the system as it stands now 
has a three-year wait. That is inexcusable. We have a process in 
place that says we want him out of the country because we think 
he is dangerous and the criminal can say that on humanitarian 
and compassionate grounds he wants to stay. We should have a 
mechanism in place that at least decides that question fairly 
quickly. A three-year wait is just unacceptable.
<P>
	Another thing that concerns me about the immigration and 
appeal division doing its work is the people on the board who 
determine whether someone is a refugee. We would want people 
that would give applicants the benefit of the doubt. They should 
be fairly liberal in their views and have a good understanding of 
circumstances in other countries. I am not sure whether the same 
person should be putting the mechanism in place, controlling the 
mechanism and deciding whether to deport somebody.
<P>
	I do not think anyone wants to deport someone. It is difficult 
to do and one has to be fairly tough minded to do it. I am not sure 
we want the same sort of character making judgments about who 
is a refugee. We want to be more liberal in our determination of 
refugees and fairly tough minded in our determination of who 
should be deported.
<P>
	The criteria determining when someone will lose their right to 
appeal is fairly straightforward. First there is the 10-year rule, 
which means if a person commits a crime he has to be sentenced 
up to a maximum of 10 years. That mechanism will ensure we 
are not using this rule or law for trivial matters. Simple things 
like shoplifting or writing a cheque under $1,000 will not get 
someone kicked out of the country. That is appropriate. More 
serious crimes such as rape, assault and murder will get 
someone kicked out of the country.
<P>
	Another rule being applied is that the minister must make a 
determination that the person is a danger to the country. While 
some offences, oddly enough like writing a cheque for more than 
$1,000, make one eligible for up to 10 years in jail, I do not think 
any of us would say: ``We want to deport you for that''. Maybe 
some of my colleagues across the way would say that the person 
should be deported for that.
<P>
	Clearly the law is saying that one has to be a dangerous 
criminal, a danger to Canadian society, someone who we think 
will perhaps assault, rape or murder again. Those are the people 
we want to kick out of the country.
<P>
	Some very difficult questions arise. I know the minister does 
not have an answer and Canadians will have to determine the 
answer. Let us say we have someone who comes here when they 
are six years old. Their parents, for whatever reasons, do not 
apply to make them Canadian citizens; they forget or whatever. 
These persons go through life not realizing they are not 
Canadian citizens. If they commit a serious crime at 25 years of 
age, do we kick them out, even though other persons in the same 
circumstances simply because their parents went through the 
process of making them Canadian citizens when they were 
seven, eight, or nine years of age did not get kicked out? They 
might have committed the same crime.
<P>
	Say someone comes here at six months of age. They are from 
an Asian country or any country dissimilar to ours. Are we going 
to take people who have virtually lived here all their lives, 
except for maybe the first six months, and deport them simply 
because they have not become Canadian citizens?
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Many people in Canada would say that was their tough luck 
and if they have committed crimes they should be put out. I am 
not sure it is that simple. That is something we have to work out, 
because there is no provision in law that if people come to this 
country before a certain age they will be able to stay here. The 
definition is clearly that if one is a Canadian citizen one stays 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9186"> 9186 </A></B>
<P>
and if one is  not a Canadian citizen and is a danger to Canadian 
society one has to go.
<P>
	We have touched on the issue of criminality. I noted the Chair 
asked us to use language that was sensitive. When we talk about 
immigrants and criminals we risk getting into the trap of taking 
an identifiable group, foreigners by definition, and blaming 
them for things they ought not to be blamed for. There are many 
cases in history where people in a community have whipped up 
resentment against an identifiable group of outsiders, 
oftentimes foreigners, to support a particular political ideology. 
When we touch on the issue of immigration and criminals we 
risk getting into that game.
<P>
	By way of a backdrop, I want to point out that the 
overwhelming majority of immigrants and refugees are decent, 
hard working and law-abiding people. They appeal to Canada 
for protection because they need our help. Others come to 
contribute to Canada's economic progress while others seek to 
be reunited with their families.
<P>
	However there are exceptions. In recent months there have 
been a few highly publicized cases of criminals claiming to be 
refugees, and refugee claimants and immigrants breaking our 
laws while in Canada. It needs to be understood that these are the 
exceptions.
<P>
	If we look at Canadian jails and survey whether the people in 
our jails were born in Canada or elsewhere, we discover that the 
immigrant population in our jails is lower than the general 
population as a whole. Statistics show that immigrants who 
come to the country are hard working. Oftentimes they are more 
hard working than the general population as a whole and commit 
fewer crimes. That does not mean there is not the odd exception, 
and this bill is about dealing with the odd exception. The 
government takes these exceptions seriously. The government is 
taking a number of steps to ensure the system is not open to 
abuse and that Canadian society is protected.
<P>
	My friend across the way indicated in his remarks that the 
minister could kick someone out whenever he wants. The 
member has his facts wrong. I know the heckles are about to 
start. Let us say a landed immigrant or a permanent 
resident-and these words can be used 
interchangeably-commits a crime and does a sentence. Let us 
say the person is a danger to society. The government can bring 
about a process fairly quickly to have him deported. However 
the person can ask to have it stayed and appeal to immigration 
and Refugee Board on humanitarian grounds. Such persons can 
say: ``I am sorry. I throw myself on the mercy of the country''. 
Maybe the person has a wife or children here; maybe he has a job 
and circumstances have changed. He can bring forth all sorts of 
arguments. Unfortunately, as I said, that is a three-year delay. In 
law, the minister does not have the right to interfere in that 
process. That right to appeal is in the Immigration Act and is in 
law and the minister must follow the law.
<P>
	My colleague across the way has said that the rules in place 
now will do the trick. Unfortunately he is wrong. They will not 
do the trick, but Bill C-44 will take a step forward in terms of 
helping to deport landed immigrants who should be deported.
<P>
	The government has proposed changes to the immigration law 
that will help prevent immigration fraud and abuse by criminals. 
Among the most important amendments are changes that 
prohibit people convicted of serious crimes from claiming 
refugee status. It also has to be determined that they are 
dangerous. This applies whether the crime took place in Canada 
or anywhere else.
<P>
	It will remove from the immigration and refugee board the 
power to allow serious criminals to be in Canada on 
humanitarian and compassionate grounds and to give the 
minister or his delegates sole authority to do so. This means we 
can move fairly quickly.
<P>
	My colleague across the way has suggested that they will still 
be able to appeal. He has that part right. They will still be able to 
appeal to the federal court on issues of law, not on issues of fact 
and law. They will be able to appeal to the federal court, but if 
they took some time to examine the federal court process they 
would find they need to have leave to appeal to the federal court. 
It is not a right. Instead of taking three years, which is the case 
under the current system, that process will take about 30 days. 
They may say that three years or 30 days makes no difference, 
but most Canadians will say that a faster process is a better 
process.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Had they asked that question at the immigration committee 
they would have found that this is a much quicker process. If 
they do not believe me, I encourage them to check it out.
<P>
	Because it is done by appeal the federal court can deal with it 
by leave. The federal court can deal with it very promptly. They 
will not be able to appeal on humanitarian and compassionate 
grounds. Appealing on law is a very technical appeal. It is not 
something that is easily done. It is not something that can be 
done summarily or just on a whim. It has to be based on clear 
legal arguments.
<P>
	It is different from an appeal on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds. I might ask my colleagues across the 
way to appreciate the substance of the difference, to appreciate 
that it is an important difference, and to give the government 
credit for changing the process from three years to 30 days.
<P>
	How serious is the problem? It is very serious. Right now the 
government estimates there is probably about 1,200 people 
whom it would like to deport and not give the right of appeal to 
the immigration and refugee board on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds. Six hundred of those people are in jail.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9187"> 9187 </A></B>
<P>
	Many people in my community want to see the government 
get the bill through quickly and bring about a process by which 
these people will be deported because they are a danger to 
Canadian society.
<P>
	What else is the act going to do? As my colleagues have 
mentioned, it is going to give immigration officers the power to 
seize identity documents from the international mail that might 
be used by impostors for fraudulent and improper purposes. My 
colleagues have made the argument that the staff is 
under-resourced. Yes, it is. The police department can say it is 
under-resourced, that it does not have enough police to do the 
job. Does that mean that the law itself is bad? Does that mean 
giving them the power to do it is bad?
<P>
	If the Reform Party wants to make an argument to spend more 
money on our immigration department, it should make it to the 
finance committee. It will be part of the budget considerations, 
and away we go; it may actually see something happen.
<P>
	The act will make sure a person can have only one refugee 
claim process at a time. This makes common sense. Someone 
wanting to abuse the system can put in a refugee claim in 
Vancouver and perhaps open a file in Toronto or wherever. Also 
the act will make sure that any application for citizenship is put 
on hold until all immigration investigations or proceedings are 
completed.
<P>
	I come to another point mentioned by my colleague. A 
citizenship and immigration-RCMP task force has been 
established in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver to co-ordinate 
and ensure the removal of people with serious criminal 
convictions who have evaded removal orders. Local police will 
assist the task force to which 20 RCMP officers have been 
assigned: 12 in Toronto and 4 each in Montreal and Vancouver.
<P>
	Again they can make the argument that it is not enough. They 
come up with a figure of 25,000 removal orders in Toronto. Let 
us say my friend sitting beside me is a landed immigrant whom 
we want to kick out and he says: ``Fine, I will leave''. We do not 
have a mechanism in place or we do not have controls at our 
border watching the people leave. It may well be that he leaves, 
but unless he tells us that he has left we do not know whether he 
has.
<P>
	To suggest that because there are 25,000 removal orders none 
of these people have left simply on their own recognizance is 
really playing with the facts. It is trying to whip up hysteria in 
Toronto that there is a massive underground of illegal 
immigrants and dangerous criminals when the truth of it is not 
anywhere close to that. There is a problem. Let us deal with the 
problem but let us not inflame it with numbers like 25,000. It is 
ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I come back to my point that 12 RCMP officers are not 
enough. If we give them good law to work with let us see how 
they do and we can come back in a year's time and take a look.
<P>
	In addition, the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs is examining the question of how immigration should 
respond to young offenders who are not Canadians citizens 
convicted of a serious crime. That is a tough one. We are going 
to kick someone out who is 12 or 13 years old. Maybe their 
parents have not done anything, are permanent residents, landed 
and are not Canadian citizens yet. What are we going to do to a 
13-year-old who commits a serious crime of assault? I do not 
know. I do not know that the minister knows. I do not know that 
any of us in this Chamber really knows. At some point we are 
going to have to try to exercise the wisdom of Solomon.
<P>
	The government believes that immigration is a benefit to 
Canada and that Canada should maintain its international 
reputation for assisting refugees and welcoming immigrants. 
However, the government also believes that a good immigration 
program must promptly manage to protect Canadians. The 
government is committed to move as quickly as possible to 
make these changes to ensure the integrity of the Canadian 
immigration and refugee system.
<P>
	In closing, I would point out to Canadians that I think there is 
real substance in this bill. Taking away the right to appeal on 
humanitarian and compassionate grounds in some very specific 
circumstances I think is the right thing to do where someone is 
clearly a danger to Canadian society.
<P>
	When we talk to the immigrant communities they are tired of 
being tarnished with the brush of being what some people in the 
political spectrum want. They know when immigrants commit 
crimes that good, hard working new Canadians are often the 
ones who bear the penalty the most. They are the ones who want 
to make sure that hard working decent immigrants or new 
Canadians are the ones who want fairly tough criteria for 
deporting people and that serious criminals are actually 
deported promptly without much delay. If the Reform Party 
would actually look at the substance of the bill and do its 
homework it too would support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very interested in the member's comments regarding the 
front end concerns about the Immigration Act enforcement. It 
appears the member never availed himself of the opportunity of 
going to a border crossing for instance and watching the process 
of refugee claimants coming in from the United States. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9188"> 9188 </A></B>
<P>
come in with no documents. They have no means of 
identification and no support systems per se to assist 
immigration officers in determining who they really are.
<P>
	I am wondering if the member really understands the 
importance of determining who these applicants really are who 
come through because there is no identification, because it is an 
unknown quantity. What does the hon. member have to say 
about that when it comes to this background check that he 
alludes to and that the minister should not have the power to 
remove someone if they are determined to be a danger to 
society?
<P>
	Could the member please describe to me how he would get 
around this aspect once the individual is here and has gone 
through his claim and his appeals when there is no means of 
really determining who the individual is?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to my colleague's 
question but let me say this. The guts of what this bill is about-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> You cannot use that word here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> The pith and substance. I do not want to be too 
high falutin because as my colleagues have said they are not 
legal experts. I use the vernacular instead of using a term that 
might have been used in the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	The pith and substance of what this bill is about is really 
taking an appeal process that has been dragged out to three years 
to non-lawyers, non-judges, the Immigration and Refugee 
Board, an appeal process on humanitarian and compassionate 
grounds and saying in some very narrow circumstances where 
someone has committed a serious crime that will get them more 
than 10 years in jail maximum sentence and they are considered 
a danger to society, taking that appeal process and reducing it to 
virtually 30 days, narrowing the terms where they can only 
appeal to the federal court. That is the pith and substance of this 
bill and that is what the Reform Party should be supporting.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	My colleague is absolutely right. I have never been to a border 
crossing and looked at the refugee determining process and what 
happens when someone shows up without documents. My view 
is that we should hold them in detention and should not let them 
go until we know who they are. I would certainly be happy to sit 
down with my colleague and look at the Immigration Act and 
look at the system that is in place and try to work something out 
that is reasonable. I agree, we should not be letting just anyone 
in. If they do not have documentation or cannot prove who they 
are then we should be concerned about that.
<P>
	However, to re-emphasize my point, that is not what this bill 
is about. This bill is about people who apply on humanitarian 
and compassionate grounds to the refugee board and Canadians 
do not want to give them the right to do that. They have 
said:``You are a danger to Canadian society and we want you 
gone from our land''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an outline here from an 
individual who was removed from the country after the minister 
issued a security certificate to have him removed. The power is 
already there for the minister to do something about it.
<P>
	In Calgary alone six foreign criminals have been deported. 
Their backgrounds include cocaine dealers, pimps, weapons 
charges, assault, you name it. The power is there to remove 
already. The minister is not exercising his powers to remove.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member's comments with regard to 
section 46 of the act where it states we can remove. Why are we 
going through this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, we disagree on that one fact. The 
member is saying that the appeal to the refugee board does not 
stay that proceeding and I say it does. However, I will get a 
reference and send it to him.
<P>
	Clearly this act takes power away from the refugee board and 
puts it in the minister's office. If he was not responsible before, 
Canadians can now look to him and say that he is the one they are 
relying on to deport dangerous criminals who are not Canadian 
citizens. That law will narrowly focus it on the minister and on 
the government and they can take responsibility for that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
ask the hon. member why the current law is not being 
implemented in its entirety. Why does the minister not use all 
the legal and administrative means at his disposal? Does the 
current law not allow us to deport war criminals, Nazis or people 
who have violated human rights elsewhere?
<P>
	Why is the minister not taking such action now and why does 
he need a new law? Why does he not make more effective use of 
the officials, local police and RCMP officers on the working 
groups he has created in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver? 
Why does he not make more of an effort to motivate officials 
who are very disappointed?
<P>
	As a result of the cutbacks and office closures at the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration, morale is very low. 
People are likely to face even more staff cuts in the upcoming 
budget. It has been said that 100 jobs will be cut at the IRB 
alone, where there are not many jobs to start with. Why not 
motivate staff, why not use all the available means and eliminate 
the need for a piece of legislation as drastic as Bill C-44?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in another form that is the same 
question the Reform Party is asking. It is saying the minister has 
the power and that he should just use the current act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="9189"> 9189 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I would like to point out that under the current act, under the 
current law, if somebody is convicted of a crime after they have 
served their time in jail they can apply to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board on humanitarian, compassionate grounds to 
defeat their deportation from this country. That process now 
takes three years. There is a three-year delay. Under this new 
law the process will probably be reduced to about thirty days. 
There are about 1,200 people the ministry or the department has, 
at least on first glance, determined could be dangerous criminals 
we want removed. This bill will do it.
<P>
	With regard to the issue of the immigration department being 
understaffed and needing more resources, I will not dispute that 
with anyone. I will not dispute it with my colleague. I will not 
dispute it with the Reform Party. I am not responsible for that 
decision. I would suggest that you make your argument to the 
finance department or to the finance minister. I am sure the 
minister of immigration, if he were here, would be quite happy 
to be getting extra resources for his department.
<P>
	The last issue is that he used the word draconian. I do not think 
the measures are draconian at all. First of all, the person has to 
commit a crime that will get them a maximum of ten years in 
jail. That raises one threshold. The second threshold or test that 
they have to meet is they have to be considered a danger to 
society. Clearly we are not going to be throwing out the person 
who simply steals a television that is worth more than $1,000. 
Clearly we want to go after the people who are committing 
assaults or murders or rapes or a whole bunch of other types of 
crimes for which Canadians have no appetite to have these 
people kept in our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, a concern that is on the minds of 
many Canadians is the fact that when we do have violent 
criminals under deportation orders they are never removed 
because of a lack of being able to obtain a travel document. 
From this member I would like an explanation as to why or how 
Bill C-44 is going to address this concern.
<P>
	I have a list of probably a dozen very violent criminals, some 
of whom have been convicted of murder, who are walking our 
streets because travel documents cannot be obtained to get rid of 
them. I want this member to explain to me how Bill C-44 is 
going to deal with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I acknowledge that it 
is a legitimate concern and that the hon. member has raised a 
legitimate point. The short answer is that I do not know. That is 
not what the guts of the bill are about. It is not about sorting out 
the technicalities of travel documents.
<P>
	Let us say we have someone who came over when they were 
six years old. They grew up here. They are not a Canadian 
citizen. Then they commit a very serious crime. The country we 
are going to send them back to does not  want them back. It 
considers them to be Canadians and is not going to give us the 
travel documents to send them back. We have a policy in this 
country of simply not putting someone on an airplane, sending 
them off to somewhere and simply leaving them there. Then we 
get into a game. We send them there, they send them back, we 
send them there. Who knows where the person disappears to. We 
cannot kick someone out of the country if we are going to make 
them stateless.
<P>
	There is a mechanism that we have to follow. There is a 
process. If the country on the other side does not co-operate, I 
agree it is a problem. I do not have the answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, about the expression ``danger to the 
public in Canada'', the minister will be able to prevent an appeal 
by saying that the person constitutes a danger to the public in 
Canada. This is very ambiguous and subjective. Who will decide 
who constitutes a danger to the public in Canada? Will it be the 
minister, his officials, the RCMP, CSIS? Who? This is a very 
dangerous concept, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with my hon. colleague's 
point. It is something we have to be very concerned about. I 
would remind him though that it is not the only threshold; it is 
not the only test. The first thing the person must have done to get 
into the problem is to have committed a crime where they would 
have received a maximum of 10 years in jail or more. Then the 
department would make its finding that they are a danger to 
Canadian society.
<P>
	I appreciate the member's worries and concerns and we will 
have to watch the system as it develops.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by Members

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
strongly denounce the action of Liberal MPs and of the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, who took advantage of a meeting with the 
Chairman of the CBC to discuss coverage of the referendum 
campaign.
<P>
	The Liberal members displayed, to say the least, a lack of 
subtlety by linking the financing of the French network of the 
CBC to a pro-federalist referendum coverage. In fact, this is 
unjustifiable interference in the network's affairs. We wonder 
whether the Liberals are implementing the directives of the 
current Minister of Foreign Affairs who, back in April 1977, 
said this in an interview: ``I do not want the network to adopt a 
neutral stance in presenting both sides of the issue. When the 
referendum comes, the employees must unequivocally be 
pro-Canada in their coverage''.

on some congratulations that are now long overdue to a 
wonderful group of young Canadians. They made all of us very

	Shortly after Christmas my riding of Red Deer hosted the

<P>
	With the championship won, our junior players shared the 
pride of having won gold for Canada. Players from all across our 
country, east to west, including Quebec juniors like Alexandre 
Daigle and Eric Dazé, stood out as a unified team that took the 
world on and won.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently 
the minister of heritage announced plans to introduce legislation 
that will amend the Copyright Act.
<P>
	In his announcement the minister mentioned there would be 
reforms that would include some neighbouring rights for 
producers and performers for the use of their creations. The 
neighbouring rights amendments will have a negative impact on 
the private radio broadcasting industry which could result in the 
closing of radio stations and job losses.
<P>
	A government study has been released by the Department of

President Clinton introduced a budget measure that would in

car to enter the U.S.
<P>
	The U.S. administration will seize Canadian dollars and use 
them to beef up security at the U.S.-Mexico border. Essentially, 
it looks to me as though the U.S. government wants to tax 
Canadians to solve its security problems at the Mexico border.
<P>
	These measures are a violation of our agreements which allow 
the free movement of goods and people across our borders. This 
is an illegitimate tax grab by the U.S. government and an insult 
to Canadians who respect reciprocal cross-border freedom for 
Canadians and our American neighbours.
<P>
	This is a further irritant to the already strained Canada-U.S.

taken off the U.S. budgetary table.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the social program reform scheduled for last 
September has already been postponed once. Now, after more 
than a month of consultations, the government is further 
postponing this reform it had promised to implement in the 
upcoming budget. It is well known that cabinet and the Liberal 
caucus are seriously divided on this issue.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Since the Prime Minister maintains that social 
program reform is still on the agenda, can the Minister, who is 
unable to sell his reform plan to cabinet, and the Minister of 
Finance in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9194"> 9194 </A></B>
<P>
particular, tell us now what the revised timetable for his social 
program reform will be?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has done a terrific job and that he has the 
confidence of all his cabinet colleagues. Never has there been so 
much consultation on a fundamental reform that will bring about 
changes in Canada.
<P>
	Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois will promote the status quo. 
But these changes are under way, and the committee is expected 
to table its report at three o'clock this afternoon. So, it is a bit 
much to ask a minister to prepare for such changes before the 
committee report has even been tabled. To adopt such a stance in 
this House does not show much respect for the democratic 
process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there certainly is no shortage of consultations. But the 
minister himself said on television last week that his reform 
plans had to be delayed because Canada's financial situation 
makes any real reform of social programs impossible. That is 
what the minister himself, true to his own way of showing 
respect for the democratic process in this House, stated outside 
this House.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development 
recognize that social program reform has been cast aside not 
only because of the budget but mostly because of the Quebec 
referendum, as the minister knows that his reform will affect 
thousands of Canadians and Quebecers who are among the most 
disadvantaged in society?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
engaging in some very unfortunate speculation.
<P>
	At no time did I say the reforms were postponed. There may 
have been a headline writer or two who made that judgment but I 
certainly did not say it. We said that we had to have the 
committee report that we will have today. We will examine the 
recommendations in the report very carefully.
<P>
	We will begin discussions with the provinces in terms of their 
putting forward a proper new blueprint and design. There will be 
a budget which we know will establish a new sense of economic 
confidence in the integrity of the country. That is the best 
platform and basis for undertaking social reform.
<P>
	We will be following our timetable which is to bring in new 
legislation dealing with social issues this fall. It is exactly the 
timetable we laid out a year ago and it is a timetable we are still 
on.
<P>
	We would only hope that the Bloc Quebecois and other 
members in the House will learn and be willing to participate in 
what should be and can be one of the most important initiatives 
in the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my third question is for the Minister of Finance, who 
will have the final say on social program reform. In that sense, 
he is the real human resources minister.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance give us the assurance that his next 
budget will not, once again, target the unemployed, with further 
cuts in benefits and increasingly restrictive eligibility 
requirements for UI, as his first budget did?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Following the last budget, Mr. 
Speaker, more than 438,000 jobs were created in Canada. This is 
the best performance in a decade. I am quite confident that we 
will see the same results after the next budget.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Let me just say quickly that, contrary to what the Minister of 
Finance just said, it is not 400,000 jobs, but an annual average of 
261,000 jobs, a total which has been verified over and over 
again. Rumours are spreading about the upcoming budget.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	It is even being said that a document from the Department of 
Finance proposes that the federal government completely 
withdraw from financing some social programs without, of 
course, transferring to the provinces equivalent financial 
resources allowing them to take over from the federal 
government. I remind you that Ottawa has deprived the Quebec 
government of more than $12 billion since 1982 by cutting into 
transfer programs.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance confirm his intention of 
transferring responsibility for some social programs by putting 
an end to his financial contribution without full financial 
compensation for the provinces, which would effectively 
amount to offloading his deficit onto the provinces once again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, not only are the 
figures I just quoted accurate, but I might add that 82,000 jobs 
were created in Quebec in 1994, the best performance since 
1988.
<P>
	Moreover, am I to understand from the question that the hon. 
member is in favour of the status quo? We, on the other hand, 
stand for change and for reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9195"> 9195 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we 
compare December with December, the figures are accurate, but 
the Minister of Finance is supposed to know that the figures we 
are referring to represent the annual average, which is 261,000 
jobs, including 70,000 in Quebec.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not realize that such actions on 
his part would be totally irresponsible since he would be 
reducing transfer payments for education, health and social 
assistance, leaving the provinces with the extra burden while 
imposing national standards that are more and more restrictive 
under the circumstances? Is this what you call flexible 
federalism?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
</B><B>responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite 
interesting that the member opposite and I are engaged in a 
debate as to whether the job creation record of the government in 
its first year of operation is the best record in five years or the 
best record in 10 years. But it is the best record we have seen in 
one heck of a long time.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development made it very 
clear when he embarked on the program of social security 
reform that we intended to bring it into the nineties, that we 
intended to make social security reform a very important part of 
the job creation capacity of the country and a very important part 
of the overall program of the government.
<P>
	I support what the minister has done. He has had the courage 
to deal with fundamental and far reaching changes. I find it very 
difficult that a party opposite is so rooted in the status quo, in the 
1940s, that it fails to understand what the Canada of the future 
means.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> At the beginning of the period I said welcome 
to 1985 because in 1985 they had very long questions and very 
long answers. But in 1995 I am sure we are going to shorten 
both. The hon. member for Beaver River.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are glad to be here in the first period.
<P>
	Canadians are among the highest taxed people in the world. 
Over 50 per cent of our pay cheques go to the tax man in one 
form or another. That is more than food, shelter and clothing 
combined. That would be more than enough but evidently it is 
not enough for this finance minister. He seems ready to add to 
our crippling tax load in this month's budget.
<P>
	Canadians are not going to take it any more. Their message is 
no tax increases, period. Will the Prime Minister listen to 
Canadians and immediately rule out any tax increase in this 
month's budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, members of the Reform Party are very desperate. They 
set the target there to be in the news because they cannot really 
attack the government.
<P>
	The hon. member should be patient-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> No, they cannot. Now they 
say that we will increase the taxes. Even I do not know. The 
budget will be later in the month. I will discuss that with the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Again the Reform Party will have to recognize that the 
Minister of Finance last year predicted that growth would be 3 
per cent. It turned out to be 4.2 per cent. Inflation has been zero. 
Unemployment went down from a prediction of 11.1 per cent to 
9.6 per cent.
<P>
	We have a big problem, the debt. In the previous nine years 
before we arrived the previous government accumulated $300 
billion of its own debt. We have a problem with that. We all 
recognize it. We will do what we said we would do in the red 
book. We will meet our target of 3 per cent of GDP next year.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
aiming at a target of going $25 billion per year in the hole is 
hardly considered noble.
<P>
	The Prime Minister says to wait until the budget. That is of 
little comfort to Canadians. Why should home buyers who have 
seen their monthly mortgage rates go up over $200 wait until the 
budget? Canadians want this government to act now. They have 
wanted it to act for over a year.
<P>
	The finance minister is not dealing with abstract numbers. He

for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last Thursday, Quebec's National Assembly passed a 
resolution denouncing proposed federal cuts in post-secondary 
education and asking the federal government to withdraw from 
that sector and give Quebec the tax points equivalent to the level 
of Ottawa's current financial contribution to that sector.
<P>
	Given the differences of opinion of the Minister of Finance 
and the Minister of Human Resources Development, can the 
Prime Minister tell us if his government will give a favourable 
reply to the National Assembly's request?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be very important 
for the hon. member to relay the message he has just delivered to 
colleagues in the Government of Quebec. Just before Christmas, 
as he will well know, it announced it will be cutting $1.5 billion 
from health services, social services and education.
<P>
	It would seem to me that if any government is going to take its 
responsibility, the question should be asked of the provincial 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the 
Minister of Human Resources Development that the motion was 
unanimously approved; in other words, it was also supported by 
the Quebec Liberal Party.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, by refusing to provide a clear 
answer, the federal government persists in wanting to eliminate 
cash transfer payments and instead allocate part of these funds 
to the Canada Student Loans Program, without any regard for 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces over education?

maneuver and more freedom of action for the provinces, the

the government of this country what they call the triple-R

are going to revolt in terms of any kind of tax increases. If that is 
not good enough, they are going to reform this country.

Canadians that there will be no tax increases in 1995?

that the member did not mean his words to come forth as they 
did. He is not encouraging Canadians to revolt. I am sure that is 
not the case. I would not interpret it in that way. Revolting is not 
a word that one would use when applied to the Reform Party.
<P>
	There is some time between now and when the budget will be 
brought down. The Prime Minister stated it very clearly. We 
know that Canadians do not want to see themselves burdened 
with further taxes. That has been made very clear. The Prime

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The president of the CBC met with the members of the Liberal 
caucus, at his request, on Friday to discuss the CBC's budget. 
According to the chairman of the Quebec caucus himself, Mr. 
Manera discussed the CBC's coverage of the referendum on 
sovereignty.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that the president of 
the CBC made a serious error in judgment by discussing the 
CBC's coverage of the referendum campaign in camera with the 
members of his party, in total disregard of the CBC's 
requirement to remain independent and neutral?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the caucus met with the president of the CBC at his 
request. He requested the meeting. They asked questions as they 
are entitled to do. You can ask me questions in this House. You 
can ask the ministers questions. We will pass them on.
<P>
	We want news coverage to be fair across the country and that 
the CBC be allowed, within its mandate, to do what it wants. We 
just want it to be fair for everybody and we want all viewpoints 
heard and not just one. In fact, we are asking all the broadcasters 
in Canada to give everyone an equal opportunity.
<P>
	Up to this point, provincial government money has been spent 
on distributing pamphlets-not the pamphlets of the Liberal

both campaigns to be given exactly the same coverage.

experienced civil servant with long service at the CBC who

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the repeated drops in the value of the Canadian dollar 
and hikes in interest rates can be attributed to the government's 
inaction and its refusal, for more than one year, to work on 
cutting the government machine's overall spending. Financial 
circles are becoming even more sceptical because of the 
possibility that the government will try to arrest its deficit by 
implementing new taxes or a general surtax on income.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that his government's 
inaction and complete nonchalance have directly caused interest 
rates to rise, in particular mortgage rates? Will he admit that 
implementing a general surtax will strangle economic growth 
and will only drive interest rates even higher?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Once again, Mr. Speaker, the 
opposition is asking hypothetical questions and is inventing 
straw men. Why? I do not know.
<P>
	Allow me to say that at our last meeting, my counterparts 
from G-7 countries and IMF officials had only praise for the 
progress that Canada has made over the past year. When we hear 
the figures that the Prime Minister quoted earlier, when we see 
the action taken since the last budget, we can conclude that, for 
the first time in a long while, the government not only intends 
attaining its goals, but also is credible in this pursuit. The hon. 
member should be very proud of our achievements since we 
formed the government a year ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course we have nothing but praise for the fact that 
interest rates have increased during the past two months and the 
fact that the financial community has lost confidence in a 
Minister of Finance who, for the past year and a half, has done 
nothing to bring the deficit under control. That is certainly 
praiseworthy.
<P>
	How can the minister reject the official opposition's 
recommendations to cut spending and review the tax system? 
How can he justify imposing new taxes and asking the middle 
class to add to its tax burden, while at the same time giving 
Canada's wealthiest taxpayers tax credits of over $2 billion so 
they can buy deluxe condominiums in the United States? Now, 
that is good management. That is something to be proud of.

make existing programs work better, to get better value for our

	When will the minister show some leadership and start real

	The GST credit is for low income Canadians. For example, a 
Canadian family of four with a family income of $38,000 would 
be above the limit for any GST credit. Eligibility is based on 
family income and this reflects the situation of these low income 
Canadians.
<P>

entitlement to the GST credit. There may be cases of people with

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am informed that there are some. I could find out how 
many, although the President of the Treasury Board 
acknowledged not knowing any personally. I do not know any 
either, but I am told there are some. I got this information from 
the Privy Council. If I was misinformed, I will apologize, but I 
was told again, afterwards, that there were some.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board. This 
weekend negotiations over the workforce adjustment directive 
failed and public servants, including those who live in 
Ottawa-Vanier, want to know what the government is doing 
about it.
<P>
	Is this government afraid to finalize its position because of 
the byelection in Ottawa-Vanier? Why will the government not 
tell public servants now whether it is going to legislate changes 
to the workforce adjustment directive?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think the hon. member should be worrying 
about Ottawa-Vanier at all. I do not think it is in the cards for 
him to worry about it.
<P>
	Long before there was to be a byelection we were talking with 
the unions with respect to the matter of workforce adjustment 
because of the number of people involved in downsizing as a 
result of the program review process. We will continue with 
those discussions. I hope to have further discussion to try to 
bring some resolution to the matter because the workforce 
adjustment directive is in the union agreement.
<P>
	As I said earlier in response to the previous question, we 
intend to treat our employees fairly and reasonably in dealing 
with this matter.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. His government has now 
brought Canadians through a major social policy consultation. 
We will soon have a budget in the House of Commons that 
promises major cuts to social policy.
<P>
	The minister of human resources today said that they are 
targeting for more efficiency. My question to the Prime Minister 
is quite simple. What are the targets and priorities pursued by 
his government in the area of social policy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. leader of the Conservative Party would read 
the red book he would know what our priorities are in terms of 
social policy.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, N.D.P):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Minister of Finance simply say that what we read in the press 
today is not true, that in spite of the fact that we all appreciate 
there are a whole host of loopholes for the wealthiest in Canada, 
now we find out that the minister is going to provide one more 
loophole outside the parameters of the budget? Canadians who 
sell off assets in excess of $600,000 in the U.S. are going to pay 
U.S. tax but this minister now is contemplating giving them a 
tax credit to make up for that.
<P>
	Will the minister stand in his place and say this will not be a 
tax loophole that he will be introducing, although it is part of the 
protocol being negotiated? While he is on his feet, will he tell us 
what the Prime Minister is going to tell President Clinton to do 
about that head tax at the U.S. border?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the most 
recent measure does is protect the Canadian tax base on the one 
hand. It also makes sure that Canadians who own property 
abroad are not further discriminated against as a result of their 
Canadian citizenship compared with Americans.
<P>
	What has happened is a very good measure that protects not 
only the Canadian tax base but Canadians. I am sure the member 
would agree that is worthwhile.
<P>
	In terms of what the Prime Minister should tell President 
Clinton, it is really an absurd idea that the Americans at the time 
of NAFTA and the current times of exchange of trade would put 
on some kind of crossing border tax. It is simply absurd. It is an 
idea to which this government takes great exception.
<P>
	I know that I speak for the minister of trade, although I also 
would say that it is sometimes very difficult to speak for the 
minister of trade.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege arising out 
of the leaking to the media of the report of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development on changes to 
social programs.
<P>
	I submit that the privileges of members of this House have 
been breached by the premature release to the media of this 
report due to be tabled today. It is a question of privilege 
because it is a violation of the proper order of proceedings that 
reports from committees should be presented first in the House 
of Commons so as to ensure equal opportunity to access by all 
members of Parliament and all Canadians. Until such 
presentation in this House, reports should be confidential.
<P>
	To accentuate the breach that has taken place, as an associate 
member of the committee I was denied access to the report while 
it was freely available to the press.
<P>
	I would ask that you consider what appropriate action might 
be taken to deal with what is surely a gross contempt of the rules 
and procedures of this House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for the question of 
privilege. Of course I will look into it and report to this House if 
necessary.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on December 13 a vote was taken on Bill C-226. 
Although I stood to be recorded as voting for the bill, I was 
inadvertently omitted from the list. May I have the record 
corrected?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My hon. colleague, it would be difficult to go 
back and change a vote that has already occurred. It would set a 
precedent that would be very difficult for us to manage in the 
House.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will have his views put on the 
record. They stand there now. This is not really a point of order 
but his point has been made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member was present in the House and he voted 
on a measure.
<P>
	Through inadvertence his vote was not recorded. It was not 
his inadvertence, it was the inadvertence of the Table. It seems 
to me that the only appropriate way of dealing with this matter 
perhaps by unanimous consent is to record the hon. member as 
voting in favour of the bill that was before this House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would take the suggestion of the hon. member 
for York South-Weston. Notwithstanding the fact that it is 
rather a different approach, if there were unanimous consent by 
the House I would agree to letting the vote be recorded.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before giving 
unanimous consent, are we to understand that this would create a 
precedent and that it will now be possible to ask for a vote to be 
reviewed after three, four or five days or even a week?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, with unanimous consent in the 
House, we can change just about anything we want. I hope this 
will not become an everyday occurrence. That is why I asked for 
unanimous consent. If there is unanimous consent, the vote can 
be changed; if not, it will stay the same.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Perhaps the Speaker would allow the whips from all three 
parties to confer on this issue and we will come back to the 
House tomorrow with our recommendation and that would 
perhaps save the time of the House and solve the problem more 
rapidly.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If the three whips would get together we will 
come back to the point tomorrow.

Committee on Human Resources Development entitled 
<I>Security, Opportunities and Fairness: Canadians Renewing

committee in difficult circumstances. We thank them for their 
welcome.
<P>
	I must add, however, that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development did not publish most technical discussion papers 
in time, something which we and the groups who appeared 
before the committee find unfortunate.
<P>
	I also wish to commend the work done by all committee 
members and say that the report was produced and the 
consultations held in difficult conditions. In closing, I want to 
add that the good will that was in evidence at the beginning

hearing of Robert Paul Thompson seeking his early release.

Carter and Daniel Earl and signed by residents of the great city 
of Kamloops.
<P>
	Motivated by the Melanie Carpenter tragedy the petitioners 
call for changes to Canada's justice system, including assurance 
that those who are violent and sexual offenders are jailed for 
sufficient terms and if necessary for life to ensure that safety and 
security return to our streets and to our neighbourhoods.
<P>
	This is the first of many petitions to come. To this date well

few days urging for changes to our criminal justice system.

Quebec dealing with social issues.
<P>
	In the first two, petitioners pray that Parliament not amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in any way that would tend to indicate societal 
approval of same sex relationships or of homosexuality 
including amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to include 
in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the undefined phrase 
sexual orientation.

protection enjoyed by born human beings to unborn human 
beings.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
part of my parliamentary duties I rise today to present four 
petitions to the House.
<P>
	The first is on behalf of Mr. Michael Dobbin and T.S. 
Symington who along with 82 other Calgarians call on 
Parliament to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to protect 
individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	The second petition is on behalf of Mr. Robert McNutt who 
along with 36 other Canadians calls on Parliament to prohibit 
discrimination the basis of sexual orientation and to adopt all 
necessary measures to recognize the full equality of same sex 
relationships in federal law.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEFAMILY">THE FAMILY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> The third petition, 
Madam Speaker, represents the opposing view on sexual 
orientation as 55 Albertans call on Parliament to oppose any 
legislation that would directly or indirectly redefine the family.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	The fourth and final petition also relates to the subject of 
families, as 34 Calgary and area residents call on the 
government to amend the Income Tax Act to provide a child care 
expense deduction to all families and not just those using 
outside receipted child care.
<P>
	I will continue to present all petitions that are sent to me by 
constituents of Calgary Centre regardless of my personal or 
political views on the subject.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am pleased to present a 
petition with 16,300 signatures.
<P>
	This petition was collected by a constituent, Mr. Bernard 
Castet, whose son was murdered by two young offenders. The 
petition asks for amendments to the Young Offenders Act stating 
anyone committing a crime of violence will be tried in adult 
court if he or she is 14 years of age or older.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have three petitions to table today. The first two 
pertain to the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to put an end to 
discriminatory treatment in Canada of gay and lesbian citizens 
and their familial relationships by amending federal legislation 
that currently allows unequal treatment, including an 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit 
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>

sections of their petition, but I feel it is their right to have me 
table it in the House on their behalf.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ABORTION">ABORTION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the third petition is a little more complicated. I will not 
go through the whole petition itself.
<P>
	The petitioners claim it is clear that in the languages of 
Parliament and Canada there is evidence that the unborn human 
foetus from fertilization onward has recognition as an 
individual and also is included in ``everyone''; whereas the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to the 
Parliament and Government of Canada and article VII 
guarantees to everyone the right to life and security of the 
person and article XV(1) states that every individual is equal 
before and under the law and has the right to equal protection 
and equal benefit of the law.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to urge the government to 
recognize the unborn foetus from fertilization onward as an 
entity separate from the mother and to prepare a response to this 
petition which identifies the formal parliamentary process 
which selected the response of Petition No. 3510130, which I 
tabled last year, as the sole basis for the government's position

Speaker, I am pleased to rise to present three petitions signed by 
almost 300 people from several communities in my 
Cariboo-Chilcotin constituency.
<P>
	My constituents are convinced that existing gun controls are 
sufficient. Therefore they call on Parliament to support laws that 
will severely punish all violent criminals who use weapons in 
the commission of a crime, support new Criminal Code firearms 
control provisions which recognize and protect the right of 
law-abiding citizens to own and use recreational firearms, and 
support legislation that will repeal or modify existing gun 
control laws that have not improved public safety or have 
proven not to be cost effective or proven to be overly complex so 
as to be ineffective or inefficient.

	These petitions are presented with my concurrence.

Madam Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition signed 
by hundreds of residents of my constituency of

<P>
	They point out that the current provisions of the Criminal 
Code deny people who are suffering from terminal or 
irreversible and debilitating illness the right to choose freely 
and voluntarily to end their lives with the assistance of a 
physician. Therefore they call upon Parliament to amend the 
Criminal Code to ensure the right of all Canadians to die with 
dignity by allowing people with terminal or irreversible and 
debilitating illness the right to the assistance of a physician in 
ending their lives at a time of their choice, subject to strict 
safeguards to prevent abuse and to ensure that the decision is

76, 88 and 108.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 76-<B>Mr. Peric:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regarding the decision to proceed with construction of the Kitchener prison 
for women, (<I>a</I>) how much money has been spent to date on the prison project, 
(<I>b</I>) how were those funds allocated, (<I>c</I>) was consideration given to relocating 
the prison to the Maple Grove road site? If yes, why was the site found to be 
unsuitable, (<I>d</I>) has any consideration been given to the recent offer by the 
warden of the Oxford Regional Centre in which a portion of that prison was 
offered to Correctional Service Canada, as an alternative to building the prison 
for women in Kitchener? If not, why not and (<I>e</I>) what would the anticipated cost 
of relocating the prison to an alternate site be and what types of expenditures 
would be included in that cost?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so far 
as Correctional Service Canada is concerned, the answer is as 
follows:
<P>
	(a) Money spent to date: Approximately $3.11 million has 
been spent to date.
<P>
	(b) Allocation of funds: $1.61 million for acquisition of site, 
including legal fees; $1.5 million for two environmental studies, 
architectural design drawings, salary and operating cost for the 
Kitchener federally sentenced women office to house the 
warden, the deputy warden and support staff.
<P>
	(c) In November 1993 the Maple Grove site was given 
consideration as a possible site for the prison. However, the 
location was found to be unsuitable for the following reasons:
<P>
	(1) There are only two possible locations at the Maple Grove 
site which are sufficiently level to permit construction of the 
new women's prison. Neither is large enough to build on.
<P>
	(2) Making the site larger to accommodate the needs of a 
women's prison would entail removing an esker. This would 
require provincial environmental approval and such a process 
would be both costly and time consuming. Meeting the 
anticipated environmental concerns would significantly 
increase the cost of the prison. Also, an agreement would have to 
be negotiated with the province of Ontario concerning the role 
of Correctional Service Canada in sharing the costs arising from 
this process.
<P>
	(3) There would be significant additional costs of bringing 
storm and sanitary sewers to the Maple Grove site.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9208"> 9208 </A></B>
<P>
	(4) The minimum travel time required for services such as 
ambulance, police and fire to reach the location in the event of 
an emergency is exceeded because it is not close enough to these 
services.
<P>
	(5) The Maple Grove site is not within a maximum 15-minute 
walk to available public transit services.
<P>
	(6) Alternative sites would only have been considered if the 
Solicitor General had decided to reopen the site selection 
process. This is not the case.
<P>
	On June 6, 1994, the Solicitor General issued a news release 
announcing the decision to proceed with the site already 
purchased on Homer Watson Boulevard and describing the 
reasons not to reopen the site selection process. This decision 
was based on an extensive review of all aspects of the Kitchener 
project and confirmed that the site on Homer Watson Boulevard 
was the best of the 21 sites originally proposed by the city of 
Kitchener. The review did not include consideration of sites not 
on the original list.
<P>
	(d) The Oxford Regional Centre does not have design features 
that are consistent with the principles established by the task 
force on federally sentenced women, such as a home-like 
atmosphere with small cottage units to promote independent 
living in small groups, building structures that have natural light 
and good air ventilation, a size that would allow an interactive 
atmosphere, and non-intrusive security measures, in order to 
reflect the low risk to the community presented by most 
inmates. For these reasons further consideration was not given 
to the Oxford Regional Centre.
<P>
	(e) The cost of relocating the facility to another site is 
estimated at $5.2 million, which consists of an estimated $2.8 
million to acquire a new serviced property, conduct 
environmental studies and modify the architectural drawings to 
the new site. The remaining $2.4 million represents the cost of 
operating the prison for women in Kingston, Ontario, for an 
additional year. As for federally sentenced women, the 
construction of the other facilities is planned to be completed in 
late fall 1995.

Question No. 88-<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For 1992 and 1993 what were the car leases for the CBC, who had a lease, 
what were the make, model, year and detailed costs of each lease?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> For the years 1992 and 1993 the CBC's total number of 
car leases, which includes leases starting or ending within the 
two-year period, was 78 and 64 respectively.
<P>
	All those leases were for general use vehicles for the purpose 
of corporate business, except for the following which were 
assigned to specific individuals and were leased under the name 
of the CBC: (1) 1989 Buick Lesabre at $560 per month; lease 
expired April 23, 1992; (2) 1988 Buick Lesabre at $450 per 
month; lease expired June 30, 1992; and (3) 1993 Buick Lesabre 
at $529 per month; lease expires May 4, 1996.
<P>
Question No. 108-<B>Mr. Forseth:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How much money was spent in 1992-93 for ad hoc private lawyers to do 
local federal prosecutions in place of local provincial crown counsel?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
The Department of Justice does not hire private lawyers either 
on a standing or ad hoc basis to replace local provincial crown 
counsel. Agents of the Attorney General provide legal services 
that would otherwise be provided by Department of Justice 
lawyers but cannot be provided because of geographic location 
or workload pressures.
<P>
	In those circumstances where it has been necessary to hire 
standing or ad hoc crown agents to conduct federal prosecutions, 
the prosecutions have been pursuant to such legislation as the 
Narcotic Control Act, the Food and Drug Act, the Income Tax 
Act, the Competition Act and the Fisheries Act. In 1992-93, the 
federal government paid crown agents $21.3 million for 
criminal prosecution work. As well, other work performed by 
crown agents on behalf of the federal government totalled $18.7 
million. This means that the total cost of crown agent work for 
1992-93 was $40 million.
<P>
	As a result of these very significant costs, the Department of 
Justice began to look at alternate approaches in its provision of 
criminal prosecution services. One approach involves pilot 
projects that, where economically feasible, would replace crown 
agents currently performing prosecution responsibilities with 
respect to the Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drug Act 
with in-house Department of Justice counsel. The first such 
project is currently under way in Toronto with two other sites 
under consideration. It is expected that these pilot projects will 
realize savings ranging from 15 to 20 per cent and serve as part 
of the department's commitment to the cost effective provision 
of government services to the public.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What results were produced by the $3,404,136 invested in the Kahnawake 
Reserve from 1989 to 1993 under the national native alcohol and drug abuse 
program?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9209"> 9209 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> The 
amount injected into the national native drug and alcohol abuse 
program (NNDAADAP) for the Kahnawake community 
between 1989 and 1993 is $3,095,853.27. This breaks down as 
follows: 1989-90 $489,800.60; 1990-91 $560,601.60; 1991-92 
$662,860.50; 1992-93 $681,331.07; and 1993-94 $701,259.50.
<P>
	These amounts were provided to the Kahnawake community 
through contribution agreements, but they were not necessarily 
used exclusively for the Kahnawake aboriginal population. 
Shakotiia'takehnhas Community Services is the organization 
mandated by the Kahnawake Band Council to co-ordinate the 
following programs: (1) social services (2) NNAADAP program 
(3) community health representatives program and (4) 
NNAADAP resource centre program
<P>
	It acts as an administrator for regional NNAADAP activities 
for the entire aboriginal population of Quebec, submitting 
financial reports to Health Canada.
<P>
	The key NNAADAP activities at Kahnawake are as follows:
<P>
	Prevention: Various strategies (control, influence, education) 
have been used to prevent or minimize the use of the substances 
involved. The team in place has been involved with 
consciousness raising and education activities, as well as those 
offering alternatives to substance abuse. All these address the 
population of Kahnawake in general; some have specific target 
groups.
<P>
	Activity reports are submitted to us regularly to justify the 
funding.
<P>
	NNAADAP Resource Centre (Film Library): The resource 
centre is administered by Shakotiia'takehnhas Community 
Services. Its purpose is the acquisition and distribution to 
aboriginal communities and other organizations affiliated with 
NNAADAP of films, videos and other material free of charge. 
Principal activities are: material loans and handling, searches 
for pertinent and user adapted material, and support to workers 
in preparing promotional and educational activities in both 
official languages. The centre is not exclusively for the 
population of Kahnawake but rather for all aboriginal 
communities throughout Quebec.
<P>
	Rehabilitation: An aboriginal centre has been set up to 
provide rehabilitation services to Quebec's Mohawk 
population: the Onen:To'Kon Centre. While mainly serving the 
Kahnawake and Kanesatake Mohawk, it also provides services 
to other English speaking nations in Quebec, as therapy cycles 
are available.
<P>
	Administration of the various NNAADAP activities: 
Shakotiia'takehnhas Community Services acts as the 
administrator, co-ordination and reimbursement of costs, for 
certain regional activities, at the request of Health Canada. 
Note: these activities are for the entire aboriginal population of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Results: The results of these activities have been a new 
attitude toward drugs and alcohol within the aboriginal 
population. Alcohol-free social activities are now more 
popular. There has also been a markedly increased interest in 
National Drug Awareness Week; the last time, related activities 
went on for a month. It is also worthy of note that the 
Onen:To'Kon Treatment Centre has treated more than 1,312 
persons for alcohol and drug abuse on an in-patient or 
out-patient basis.

*Question No. 103-<B>Mr. Caron:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As of November 1, 1994, how much money has the federal government 
invested and how much will it invest under the Economic and Regional 
Development Agreement (ERDA) and, more specifically in relation to the 
project to upgrade the highway linking the municipalities of Alma and La Baie, 
Quebec (highway project 70/170)?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> The 
70/170 highway project is part of the Canada-Quebec subsidiary 
agreement on transportation development signed in 1985 within 
the framework of the Economic and Regional Development 
Agreement (ERDA).
<P>
	The transportation agreement, administered by Transport 
Canada on the federal side, expired on October 31, 1993, but 
commitments for registered projects were met with current 
funds under the agreement for an additional 12 months up to 
October 31, 1994.
<P>
	The project concerned was registered when the agreement 
was signed. A $25 million portion was to have been financed in 
equal parts under the agreement between the Canadian and the 
Quebec governments, $12.5 million each.
<P>
	The total amount allocated under the agreement from the 
early stages up to October 31, 1994 was $21,529,600, of which 
$10,764,800 came from the federal government. Since no 
additional funding could be allocated after October 31, this sum 
was for all intents and purposes the federal government's total 
maximum contribution to this project.
<P>
	Each government's $1,735,000 shortfall relative to the $12.5 
million initially promised was primarily attributable to delays 
during the course of the project.
<P>
	The 70/170 project was not able to follow the originally 
planned schedule. Although the first section between La Baie 
and Jonquière was completed on schedule, construction was 
slowed down significantly in 1991 and 1992 because of 
environmental studies, cancellation of the Jonquière bypass 
road and budget restrictions in the Quebec department of 
transport. Later, construction resumed on the Jonquière-Alma 
section, a four-lane divided highway. The first 3.8-kilometre 
segment beginning three kilometres north of Jonquière is 
currently nearing completion. Expropriation for the remainder 
of the segment leading to the outskirts of Alma has also been 
completed.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9210"> 9210 </A></B>
<P>
	It should be noted that funds which could not be committed to 
the highway 70/170 project were reallocated to another highway 
project under the agreement in order to ensure that these funds 
were spent. The Quebec government is expected to carry this 
project to completion subject to availability of funds.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, that Bill 
C-44, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the Citizenship 
Act and to make a consequential amendment to the Customs 
Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9211"> 9211 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to participate in the debate, at third reading, on Bill 
C-44, which amends the Immigration Act, the Citizenship Act 
and the Customs Act.
<P>
	Before getting to the crux of the matter, I want to make a few 
comments to help us during this debate or at least to make us 
think of the importance of the decisions which we will be 
making when we vote on this bill.
<P>
	In Part I of the Immigration Act outlining the Canadian 
immigration policy, sections <I>(i)</I> and <I>(j)</I> mention the need to 
``maintain and protect the health, safety and good order of 
Canadian society'', and also ``promote international order and 
justice by denying the use of Canadian territory to persons who 
are likely to engage in criminal activity''.
<P>
	We agree with these principles and objectives because they 
reflect the large consensus on which are based our legal and 
justice systems. But there are also concerns which are directly 
related to Bill C-44 and which are equally important to 
understand the issue being debated.
<P>
	During the recent consultations held by the minister regarding 
immigration, someone said that ``intolerance was the fastest 
growing industry in Canada''. Hysteria, racism and fear result 
from intolerance and generally lead people to confuse reality 
with perception. Reality is what exists in fact, while perception 
is the representation of something based on an impression.
<P>
	This is why, for some time now, Canadians have been under 
the impression that criminal immigrants abound in our country. 
Given such an impression, it is easy to jump to the conclusion 
that immigrants are responsible for most crimes.
<P>
	We must firmly oppose the spreading of adulterated and 
erroneous information on immigration, since it adversely 
affects the relation of confidence which should exist between a 
host country and its immigrants.
<P>
	Last year, a study conducted by the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration revealed that there is no link between ethnic 
origin and the propensity to commit crimes. Contrary to what 
some people would have us believe, persons born abroad and 
now living in Canada are under-represented in the prison 
population, as Derrick Thomas, senior researcher in the 
department has confirmed. While new arrivals represent 20.2 
per cent of Canada's population, they represent only 11.9 per 
cent of the population in prison or on parole. Moreover, contrary 
to certain popular beliefs, visible minorities are not inordinately 
represented in statistics on crime.
<P>
	In view of the many questions people have and the concerns 
they express, it is worth pointing out that the crime rate dropped 
by 5 per cent in 1993. According to the Canadian Centre for 
Justice Statistics, the crime rate reported by police departments 
dropped for the second consecutive year in 1993. The 5 per cent 
decrease is the biggest in a single year since the practice of 
gathering statistics on crime began in 1962.
<P>
	This confirms the statement I made earlier about reality and 
perceptions. While the public feels that crime has increased 
generally, this is not actually the case. The same thing may be 
said for the relationship people try to establish between 
immigration and criminality.
<P>
	It is certainly not my intention to downplay the seriousness of 
criminal activities. They exist, and we are aware of them. I know 
people experience real fear about their safety. Surveys have 
shown this. Nevertheless, we have to look at the facts.
<P>
	We should also look for and decry the source of public 
misconceptions. This House must not reflect the sensationalism 
of supermarket tabloids or the media, which give too much 
attention to individual cases making them appear to be the norm 
in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	It is unbelievable that, having first singled out young people 
as being the source of all evil, we are now pointing to 
immigrants as being the scourge of humanity. Should we not 
regard socio-economic conditions as the fundamental basis of 
crime and not immigration? And are not the difficulties in the 
areas of finances, adjustment, training and employment 
experienced by immigrant families, and young people in 
particular, the true causes of crime rather than immigration 
itself? Do you agree?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes, it is true.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Beyond the fears weighing on our minds, we 
have the following reservations about specific provisions of Bill 
C-44. The most important of these is the clearly expressed 
desire to eliminate the right to appeal allowed immigrants and 
refugees accused of crimes punishable by a prison term of ten 
years or more. This seems to run counter to the fundamental 
principles which should exist in a just society. The Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms should apply for us all as regards a fair and 
impartial procedure.
<P>
	Another element of the bill which concerns us is that of 
sentencing. The bill considers only the nominal act, that is, the 
maximum penalty for the type of crime committed, without 
regard for the sentence actually imposed. We all know that, even 
though a crime is punishable by a 10-year prison term, in 
practice, judges use principles of sentencing to set terms. For 
example, someone who breaks into a private residence can be 
given a life sentence. According to the bill, the accomplice of 
someone who issues fraudulent credit cards could be deported to 
his or her country of origin.
<P>
	In general, defendants are given much lighter sentences than 
the maximum. In certain cases, the sentence does not even 
include a prison term or a fine, the defendant is only given a 
suspended sentence or is put on probation. Persons given only 
very light sentences could see themselves, under the bill before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9212"> 9212 </A></B>
<P>
us, forced to leave the country. This provision of the bill could 
constitute, in our opinion, a violation of the Geneva Convention. 
The manual of the United Nations High  Commission for 
Refugees states that, depending on the nature of the crime 
presumed to have been committed, all of the pertinent factors, 
including extenuating circumstances, must be taken into 
consideration. In our opinion, bill C-44 should take these 
considerations into account.
<P>
	Another aspect that is ignored in the bill is the distinction 
between political crimes and common law crimes. It seems 
imprudent to deport persons convicted for political reasons to 
their country of origin without taking into account the risks they 
will face there. This kind of regulation is clearly lacking in 
flexibility and humanity. Would it not be better to take a closer 
look at the anticipated risks as compared to the seriousness of 
the crimes committed?
<P>
	Other important issues are of concern to me, and I ask myself 
what will happen to permanent residents who have been living in 
Canada for several years. In some cases, they arrived in this 
country when they were quite small. Today, they are adults, they 
work here, are part of the same family and have only vague 
memories of their country of origin. They have no more 
relatives and often no more friends over there. Since these 
people are now Quebecers and Canadians, is returning them to 
their country of origin the answer?
<P>
	Other aspects of the bill also deserve closer scrutiny. The bill 
proposes to authorize immigration officers to seize and open any 
parcel or document if they suspect it may be used for fraudulent 
purposes. Is this not a violation of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms? One of the principles of our judiciary system is the 
presumption of innocence, but these provisions on seizing mail 
reverse the burden of proof. On what grounds will seizures be 
made and how can the criminal nature of the contents be 
identified? That is something to think about.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The bill also provides that certain decisions that were 
formerly made by the Immigration and Refugee Board will, 
from now on, be made by the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration and its officials. The minister and his officials are 
being given new powers to appeal decisions made by an 
adjudicator in the course of an inquiry, but on the other hand, the 
commission is being deprived of its power to review cases on 
humanitarian grounds. Does this mean the administrative 
process is being politicized? Is this an attack on the 
independence of the IRB? Would it not be better to improve the 
way the IRB operates?
<P>
	I would also like to mention the findings of a study by the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration which were 
released last summer. According to the study, 1,888 foreign 
criminals who were to be deported were still at large. Is there a 
way to find these people and try and prevent others from doing 
the same thing in the future, without necessarily making it 
harder to enter the country and running the risk of creating 
situations that are just as embarrassing as the one I just 
described? Is the problem  of foreign criminals at large specific? 
In other words, are there more foreigners at large than 
Canadians or Quebecers that were born here? How many 
Canadians and Quebecers are now wanted by the police? Do they 
represent a percentage of Canadians that is significantly smaller 
than the percentage of immigrants in the same situation? We 
think the government should provide all the facts on the subject 
in order to better inform the public and set the record straight on 
the number of foreign criminals at large. In that way we would 
stop the witch hunt for immigrants and refugee claimants.
<P>
	I would like to say again that the Bloc Quebecois is aware of 
the problems associated with foreign criminals presently in 
Canada. We also know that crime causes turmoil and terror in 
our communities. We will support the government in its 
attempts to arrive at an enduring and fair solution to this 
problem. We agree wholeheartedly that immigrants and refugee 
claimants cannot use the legislation or reputation of Canada or 
Quebec to escape their country of origin if they have committed 
serious offences.
<P>
	We will not be distracted by unfounded observations which, 
as we have emphasized, do not reflect reality. The Canadian 
government seems at this time to be toughening its stance in 
order to appeal to certain voters. Consider for instance the 
Young Offenders Act passed during the last session or the 
increasing hesitation of Liberal caucus members in respect of 
gun control, or even motion M-157, tabled by the Liberal 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River, which aims to restrict 
immigration during periods of recession.
<P>
	And while we are on the subject, I would also like to point out 
that Bill C-44, like many other government initiatives, does not 
reflect the situation in Quebec. In fact, public opinion in Quebec 
differs greatly from that in the rest of Canada in regards to the 
link between crime and immigration. As the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
reminded us last week, Quebecers did not let the few bad cases 
recently experienced in Canada-which we deplore-influence 
their attitude and behaviour. This may be another aspect of 
Quebec's distinctiveness.
<P>
	Immigrants make a fundamental and undeniable contribution 
to Quebec and Canadian society's collective wealth. A law 
designed to prevent criminals from enjoying the right of 
admission to and asylum in Canada should not be misused. The 
goals set are not always consistent with the measures put 
forward to achieve them.
<P>
	That, unfortunately, seems to be the problem with Bill C-44 
as it now stands.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government caved in to public pressure 
from certain groups and ignored our recommendations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9213"> 9213 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister unjustifiably rejected our recommendations. Let 
us take only one example, as time is running out. Let us consider 
the minimum two-year  limit that we propose as a guideline. 
The minister replied that this proposal was not credible because 
the duration of the sentence handed down varies according to 
geographical and other arbitrary factors. He would rather keep 
the theoretical ten-year limit, when the courts use 
well-established rules to determine sentencing. These rules take 
into account the mitigating circumstances surrounding the 
crime. The minister thinks he is better able to determine an 
individual's fate than the courts. Instead of relying on the court, 
he prefers to decide himself whether or not he should use his 
power for humanitarian reasons. That coming from the same 
person who said barely a year ago that there should be less 
political involvement in the immigration system. It is easy to 
see that he is already under some pressure. What will happen 
when he and his colleagues are continuously subjected to strong 
public pressure?
<P>
	For all the reasons I mentioned in my speech, the opposition 
cannot support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my hon. colleague on her excellent speech. 
Several of the problems that Bill C-44 touches on could be dealt 
with administratively. In this regard, I would like to draw the 
attention of the House to the malfunction of the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration through a number of examples.
<P>
	It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain information 
from immigration officials for a number of reasons: there has 
been enormous personnel cuts in the department and there are 
more to come. This has caused a lot of motivation problems 
within the department.
<P>
	In the Montreal area, for any information, you have to dial 
496-1010. Everyone knows this number: the lawyers, anyone 
who works with immigrants and refugees. The mere mention of 
this telephone number can provoke an allergic reaction, because 
there are six stages involved and it takes several minutes to get a 
final answer. If you ask to speak to an official, you are told: 
``Sorry, the line is busy.''
<P>
	That is no good for us members of Parliament, as a large part 
of our work consists in resolving immigration problems. Last 
year, the department put out guidelines saying: ``If you want 
information, send us a fax.'' But it received so many faxes that 
we never got an answer. Now, they are telling us: ``Phone 
instead.'' But it is even worse than last year. It is incredibly 
difficult for government services users because they never get to 
talk to a department official. In some instances, they come from 
abroad and do not know the language spoken here, let alone how 
our telephone system works, a completely dehumanized system. 
You have a machine answering calls, instead of people. It is 
becoming increasingly difficult for us, members of Parliament, 
to fulfill our role as representatives of the public, particularly as 
regards immigration. When we write to the minister, it takes two 
to three months to receive an acknowledgement, and another 
month or two to get a substantive answer. Yet,  these are not 
minor issues: sometimes, what is at stake is the life of refugees 
who want to bring to Canada family members who are abroad.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The minister should take action to solve these administrative 
problems within the Department of Immigration, because these 
problems will become more serious once Bill C-44 is passed. 
The decision-making process regarding immigration issues is 
becoming increasingly politicized. The minister and his senior 
officials will make the decisions.
<P>
	We, members of Parliament, will constantly have to contact 
the minister. We will not get answers within reasonable delays 
and this will generate a lot of frustration for the users of that 
service. I ask the minister to take the necessary steps to correct 
the problem as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make a 
comment.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the excellent presentation 
made by the hon. member for Québec. I liked the way she 
described the public's perception of the crime rate in Canada.
<P>
	I agree that for some time people have been saying, especially 
certain opposition members, and even members of the general 
public, that more and more young people are involved in crime. 
This is just not true. In fact, according to statistics compiled by 
the Solicitor General and other departments, there has been no 
increase in youth crime, contrary to public opinion. Indeed, 
according to a Maclean Hunter poll, nearly 60 per cent of 
Canadians thought, and this of course includes Quebecers, that 
crime was on the increase.
<P>
	I would also like to say that with respect to immigration, there 
is a general consensus in this country on the importance of 
recognizing not only the work done by the department but also 
by new immigrants to this country. We must not forget that 
during the eighties, nearly 90,000 immigrants came to Canada 
each year. As you know, Canada is known as a host country that 
is generous and tolerant. In fact, more and more people in other 
countries are interested in becoming citizens of the country with 
the best reputation in the world.
<P>
	We now receive nearly 300,000 immigrants annually. Our 
strength is immigration, attracting people from other countries 
to come here and settle and become full fledged Canadians and 
contribute to the economic prosperity of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9214"> 9214 </A></B>
<P>
	But to say that the process has become very politicized-I do 
not think that is part of our culture. I do not think that in this 
country, we necessarily make political decisions on who will or 
will not be allowed into the country. We have certain 
procedures, we have a well established public service and 
programs to promote immigration by investors. People cannot 
say Canada is not a host country, is not a country where you can 
have a good life. If we only admit 300,000 annually, I am 
convinced-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Two hundred thousand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> It does not really matter, but I would like to 
know how many applications we get from all the Canadian 
consulates or embassies throughout the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to make a brief 
comment because this is not really a question. I agree with the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine when he says 
that crime has not increased; on the contrary, as I mentioned in 
my text, it decreased by 5 per cent in 1993, and we are very 
happy about that.
<P>
	However, I would like to go back to the comment made by my 
colleague for Bourassa, who says that we should have been more 
efficient in this bill and provided corrective action of an 
administrative nature. It is inconceivable that all the services 
should have been concentrated in Végréville.
<P>
	In my riding, people are demanding services. They have 
expectations. They complain about public services that are very 
impersonal and becoming more and more inhuman, especially 
for an immigrant or someone who wants to come to Canada. It 
seems to me that the relationship that should exist between the 
people from the host country and those who want to come here 
has been removed.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I think that this contact has been removed and I too would 
have liked to see some corrective action in the bill. I will not go 
back to all the clauses in the bill, but I believe that some of them 
are contrary to the principle of equity and fairness towards the 
immigrant population and permanent residents. I think that 
leaving in the bill the concept of discredit, that is that 
immigrants are more criminals than native born Quebecers and 
Canadians is to harm these cultural communities that have 
chosen to live in Canada.
<P>
	My colleague for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine said 
that Canada and Quebec are indeed societies that welcome 
immigrants and are in favour of immigration, but this bill, in my 
opinion, will contribute instead to an increase of racism towards 
these cultural communities. We read in the newspapers that a 
black or a Haitian has committed a crime, but when it comes to a 
Quebecer or a Canadian, they just say an individual. We should 
be extremely careful on this issue and I will not repeat my 
speech, but I think that many clauses in the bill are not  flexible 
and compassionate enough, and I will conclude my remarks on 
that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak once again in support of Bill C-44. 
I believe the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration clearly 
highlighted the bill's intention and the changes proposed as a 
result of the amendments that were passed by the committee.
<P>
	As I have said in the past, Bill C-44 will provide us with the 
tools to deal effectively with people who abuse the system. 
Moreover it is part of the government's strategy to introduce an 
immigration plan that is fair, sustainable and responds to the 
needs of Canadians.
<P>
	The minister of immigration said last August: ``A good 
immigration policy is one that ensures the balance between 
equity and tolerance on the one hand and law enforcement on the 
other hand''. Unlike members of the opposition, we have 
listened and continue to listen to what Canadians and Quebecers 
want in their immigration policy.
<P>
	The legislation is long overdue. The bill we are dealing with 
today is necessary if we are to restore integrity to a system that 
has been damaged by the infiltration of a small but destructive 
criminal element.
<P>
	My experience has shown me that for the most part 
immigrants who come to Canada wish to become full members 
of Canadian society. Canada is a great and generous country as 
all of us in the Chamber agree. Our doors have always been open 
to people fleeing economic hardship, persecution, war, civil 
strife, and to people who seek a better future for their children 
and themselves.
<P>
	Immigrants, people like my parents, became Canadian 
citizens and participated actively in all segments of our society. 
Canada's history is full of such stories. The Chamber is full of 
stories of immigrants who through hard work and perseverance 
have made the country what it is today: one of the best countries 
in the world in which to live.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians will not tolerate those who take advantage of their 
generosity, violate their laws or try to use the immigration and 
refugee determination process for criminal purposes. They must 
know that the government will not tolerate abuse. With Bill 
C-44, the government has taken all necessary measures to 
prevent abuse and protect the Canadian public against criminals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9215"> 9215 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the minister mentioned earlier, the amendments we are 
considering today respond to various criticisms that the bill was 
vague and open to misinterpretation.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore the amendments we are examining today will 
improve the enforcement package we have put forward. They 
are not draconian measures as the opposition would like us to 
believe. They are a fair, efficient and common sense approach to 
the problems criminals pose to our immigration system.
<P>
	The opposition parties continue to be opposed to our 
legislation, yet both have admitted they agree in principle that 
changes have to be made. The Bloc Quebecois thinks we have 
gone too far with our proposal and the Reform Party thinks we 
have not gone far enough. I think we are on the right track.
<P>
	We are here to represent all Canadians. We have listened to 
Canadians from across Canada and put forward what we feel is 
the best solution.
<P>
	The main points of the legislation are as follows. First, 
serious criminals deemed to be a danger to the public will not be 
allowed to claim refugee status as a means to delay their 
removal from Canada. Appeals against removal orders by 
persons convicted of serious crimes will be decided by the 
minister or his designate and not by the immigration appeal 
division. Senior immigration officers will be allowed to 
terminate refugee hearings because of criminality. Further, the 
legislation will give immigration officers the authority to seize 
identity documents from international mail if it is clear they are 
meant to be used to circumvent immigration requirements.
<P>
	The legislation will also ensure that persons with summary 
convictions whether obtained inside Canada or abroad will be 
inadmissible. Bill C-44 will allow us to stop the processing of 
citizenship when a person is under inquiry.
<P>
	Concerns have been raised over the definition of a serious 
criminal. Some are concerned that rightful refugees will be 
turned away. This will not be the case. One of the amendments 
we are considering today clarifies the definition of criminality. 
This is the essence of much of what Bill C-44 says.
<P>
	It is important to note the two conditions. To be ineligible for 
refugee status an individual must be convicted of a crime 
punishable by 10 years or more in prison and must be deemed a 
serious threat to public safety by the minister. Both those 
conditions have to be met. Those considered a danger to the 
public would lose their right of appeal to the IRB on 
humanitarian grounds, law and issues of fact. They would retain 
the right to seek judicial review in the federal court and 
humanitarian issues would be considered by the minister when 
he or she makes a decision.
<P>
	Contrary to what a lot of opposition members said, this 
responds to a lot of the concerns brought forward by the various 
organizations that presented their briefs before the immigration 
committee, for instance the Canadian Bar Association and other 
groups. We listened, took note and made those changes in Bill 
C-44. This is a government that listens to Canadians and, as we 
have proven in various other areas of legislation, takes their 
concerns seriously when the time comes to bring forth 
legislation.
<P>
	Unfortunately the two opposition parties continue to voice the 
concerns of only parts of Canada. It is easy to put forward the 
ideas of just one region of Canada. It is, however, much more 
difficult to find the middle ground that will try to satisfy all 
Canadians. I believe we have done that with Bill C-44.
<P>
	The Reform Party continues to call for an inquiry into the 
practices of the Immigration and Refugee Board and most 
recently proposed a total ban of the board. We recognize that 
Canadians are tired of abuse and we have moved quickly to 
respond to these concerns. Bill C-44 addresses a number of 
concerns of the Immigration and Refugee Board to allow for 
flexibility, a respect of humanitarian and compassionate 
grounds, and the need to prevent abuse of the refugee system.
<P>
	The government recognizes changes have to be made in order 
to make the system work better. We are streamlining the system, 
making sure that other points such as enforcement are stronger.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government is committed to maintaining a truly effective 
immigration policy, preventing illegal immigration and 
ensuring effective border control. These new provisions are fair 
and reasonable. Furthermore, contrary to what was said on the 
other side of the House, they are consistent with the 
crime-related provisions of the Geneva convention on refugees. 
It is a matter of justice, of democracy.
<P>
	The measures proposed in Bill C-44 are not excessive and do 
not ignore the needs of immigrants.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, allow me to add that the immigrants 
themselves admit that the system is being abused. Those who 
took part in the public consultations and testified before the 
Minister of Immigration asked us to amend the legislation as it 
now stands. I reiterate that our goal is not to penalize 
immigrants but to eliminate existing cases of abuse in the 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9216"> 9216 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-44 is about crime. There are a small number of 
criminals who abuse Canada's good nature and compassion. We 
must protect the integrity of the system against these few, and I 
repeat these few.
<P>
	Hon. members of the Bloc have said that we are tainting all 
immigrants by bringing forth this legislation. I do not believe 
that this is so. In fact, we are presenting the true picture of what 
immigrants have brought to this country. We are assuring that 
the few criminal elements that do exist in any system are dealt 
with quickly and efficiently and thereby, in my opinion, 
assuring that the good name of all immigrants is protected under 
the Canadian system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Again, Bill C-44 will help us restore integrity and instill 
renewed confidence in the Canadian people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this member will recall that she sat in on a meeting with 
a group of Vietnamese people who expressed concerns about the 
undesirable elements among them. The gist of that meeting was 
that they indicated they wanted certain individuals removed 
from their midst.
<P>
	I have the names of several of those individuals who have 
been causing problems in their community. Unfortunately half 
the Liberal members got up and walked out of the meeting when 
this group of Vietnamese concerned citizens wanted some 
deterrent and strong action on the part of the government.
<P>
	An adjudicator just released several of these individuals into 
the community. Some have been charged with sexual assault 
with a weapon, B and E with a weapon. One was a gang member. 
Another one shot a kid in the face with a gun in Vancouver. One 
was just released from the Fraser Regional Institute. There is 
robbery, assault, trafficking in heroine and the list goes on and 
on. These individuals walk freely in the community. Why does 
Bill C-44 not deal with these very violent criminals?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to 
correct something the hon. member said. I remember sitting in 
on the meeting with the Vietnamese community and I did not 
walk out. Neither did the rest of the members but that is not the 
point of the hon. member's question.
<P>
	As far as the cases that he has brought up, I am not personally 
aware of those cases. I do not know if they are real or fabricated. 
A lot of times the terms of what is brought forth by members of 
the opposition is sensationalization. That is exactly the type of 
thing that gives a bad name to all immigrants, including myself 
if I may say so since I am a child of immigrants to Canada.
<P>
	What we have to keep in mind is that Bill C-44 is one way we 
can as a government effectively, efficiently and quickly take 
care of the criminal elements in our society.
<P>
	Bill C-44 does address some of the problems that have been 
raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What about the other one?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> That was before Bill C-44. That is not after 
Bill C-44. We have not adopted it yet, have we?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
often hear government members say that Canada is the best 
country in the world. I am not disputing it, I am simply urging 
more caution. There are 1,500,000 Canadians who are 
unemployed and four million living under the poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We are struggling with enormous problems. Unemployment is 
high in Montreal. In the riding of the hon. member for 
Saint-Denis alone, 20 per cent of the population is either on UI 
or on welfare.
<P>
	Each year, 80,000 persons leave Canada. Why? When we 
travelled to Cyprus together-a very pleasant trip-many 
Canadian Cypriots told us they had returned to their country 
because of the problems we are having here. I think we should be 
more careful.
<P>
	As for Bill C-44 not violating the Geneva Convention on 
refugees, the Canadian Council has testified that certain clauses 
are in violation of the Geneva Convention. Not one of the major 
organizations that the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration has heard supported this bill. Every organization 
and individual who testified before the committee criticized it, 
some going as far as asking for its withdrawal. The  Canadian 
Bar Association, a most respectable organization, criticized the 
substance of the bill. When I asked the Canadian Ethnocultural 
Council if any cultural community organization in Canada 
supported this bill, the answer was ``no''.
<P>
	So, I wonder if the hon. member for Saint-Denis could tell me 
why no organization supports Bill C-44.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not think that all of 
them have said that we had to get rid of the whole legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think a lot of them said they would like to see certain 
clarifications and certain amendments made to the legislation. 
We have listened to their concerns.
<P>
	We have in fact brought forward some of those amendments. I 
stated one: In order to be ineligible for refugee status an 
individual would have to be convicted of a crime punishable by 
10 years or more in prison. It must be deemed a serious threat to 
public safety. I think that was brought up because in Bill C-44 
we did not stress that it was 10 years or more in prison.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9217"> 9217 </A></B>
<P>
	We did listen to the representations of the various 
organizations and did take their concerns into account when we 
prepared the legislation. To say that they told us to do away with 
the legislation is not the truth. In fact, a lot of people felt there 
were valid reasons for bringing forth this legislation.
<P>
	I do not want to repeat what I have already said in my speech. 
The minister has held public consultations across this land. He 
has listened to the Canadian people. The Canadian people have 
told him that they want to see criminals deported as quickly as 
possible. This legislation does respond to the general sentiment 
across this country, including Quebec, that criminals who 
commit crimes in Canada which are punishable by 
imprisonment for 10 years or more will be dealt with quickly 
and will be deported to their country of origin.
<P>
	I do not think that anyone who came before the committee can 
dispute that fact.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Madam Speaker, just a point of clarification 
from this member in reference to the search of mail coming 
through customs.
<P>
	I ask the member what the government is going to do about the 
shortage of manpower in the area of customs in order to 
adequately search for the illegal documents. I am very much 
aware, as is the member, that there is a serious shortage of 
manpower to do this job. As the customs union representative 
pointed out the legislation would be moot. It would be of no 
value whatsoever.
<P>
	What is your government going to do?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, I think the minister has 
answered that question often enough. He has been asked that 
question numerous times by the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	I think what we have said is that we are going to work closely 
with the Minister of Justice and the minister of public security to 
ensure that there is seizure of the mail. That question has been 
answered numerous times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, there are a number of deficiencies in this bill, 
deficiencies that were drawn to the attention of the government 
by witnesses who came and spoke eloquently at the standing 
committee hearings. These deficiencies were not dealt with and 
I would like to just deal with those now at some length if I may.
<P>
	In 1991 The Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future released its 
final report on the state of our country. It was one of the most 
wide ranging and I might add, one of the most expensive 
committees in Canadian history. It spent over $23 million to get 
the pulse of the citizens of this country. However, it amounted to 
little more than a very expensive blood pressure check. Thanks 
to chairman Keith Spicer we were told what we knew all along: 
that people get angry when they are ignored by their 
governments.
<P>
	The Reform Party grew out of this frustration and the fact that 
52 of us now sit in the House of Commons is proof that this 
frustration is still alive and well.
<P>
	Among its findings, the citizens' forum found Canadians have 
had enough of this partisan political system that the Liberals 
enforce and encourage with a passion. According to the report: 
``One of the strongest messages the forum received from 
participants was that they have lost their faith in both the 
political process and their political leaders. They do not feel that 
their governments, especially at the federal level, reflect the 
will of the people and they do not feel that citizens have the 
means at the moment to correct this''.
<P>
	It adds later: ``They would like major decisions affecting 
them to be made in a responsible manner and in a manner that is 
responsive to both the expressed views and the general 
well-being of citizens''.
<P>
	Two years later the Liberals promised in their much touted red 
book to restore respect for government. They said that in the 
House of Commons a Liberal government would give MPs a 
greater role in drafting legislation through the House of 
Commons committees.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration, I was looking forward to playing a constructive 
role in drafting legislation that reflected the needs and the 
aspirations of Canadians. It was my hope that a new spirit of 
co-operation would come from this government, a spirit I am 
always willing to help and encourage.
<P>
	To me, Bill C-44 was to be a test of this Liberal commitment. 
Would the Liberals be willing to co-operate with the Reform 
Party of Canada in making Bill C-44 work? Would they be 
willing to listen to Canadians on the pros and cons of this bill? 
Would they be willing to  make changes to the bill to account for 
its flaws and shortcomings? I am sad to say on all accounts they 
most emphatically were not.
<P>
	From the very start of the hearings Reform MPs have been 
faced by Liberal members who have shown neither an interest in 
working with us in the manner the red book promised nor the 
respect their peers expect and deserve. After promising to take 
the high road in dealing with the opposition, the Liberals have 
suddenly taken a liking to slinging mud at anyone on the 
opposition benches.
<P>
	The Reform Party members of the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration and the Bloc Quebecois members I 
might add have tolerated constant interruptions when 
questioning witnesses, sarcastic comments in the middle of 
statements, an atmosphere of unfounded animosity and 
confrontation at levels never before seen in Canadian politics. I 
wonder, is this what this new style of government is all about?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9218"> 9218 </A></B>
<P>
	I am more upset though with how undemocratic the entire 
committee process has become. In black and white, the Liberals 
promised to give the Commons committees more leeway as 
well as the power to be more than just lap-dogs of the ministers. 
Committees are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the House, 
ensuring that average Canadians are heard on important issues.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Over the past several months the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration heard from numerous witnesses 
who came at taxpayers' expense to share their concerns about 
Bill C-44 and to offer their suggestions about how it can be 
made more effective.
<P>
	The standing committee heard from a wide range of groups 
and individuals: lawyers, refugee advocates, police officers, 
labour groups and international organizations. Not one of these 
groups had kind words for the government on this bill. Yet 
clearly the Liberals have turned their backs on Canadians and 
followed the beck and call of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	For the record, and to jog the memories of the Liberal 
members sitting opposite, let me state what some of these 
groups had to say on this piece of legislation.
<P>
	Amnesty International believes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Measures contained in Bill C-44 potentially violate rights guaranteed by the 
charter and in international treaties concerning refugees and the prevention of 
torture.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Quebec Immigration Lawyers Association, after 
outlining 14 series concerns, concluded: ``Bill C-44 must be 
withdrawn''.
<P>
	The Canadian Bar Association is concerned that ``the express 
goals of saving money and reducing delay are not likely to be 
advanced by the provisions of Bill C-44''.
<P>
	The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 
Canada believed that Bill C-44 violated sections 30, 58 and 
1(f)(b) of the Geneva convention.
<P>
	The Canadian Labour Congress stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe C-44 in fact violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are numerous other warnings from groups all across the 
political spectrum. I wonder what my Liberal colleagues across 
the way remember of these concerns.
<P>
	In summary, these and other groups accused the government 
of breaking sections 11, 7 and 15 of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, as well as numerous international conventions 
dealing with refugee treatment, torture, execution, war zones 
and disappearances.
<P>
	The bill would not stand up five minutes against a charter 
challenge and would be condemned by the international 
community if passed. It is hard to believe that the government 
would refuse to deal with these serious concerns or even at least 
acknowledge that they exist.
<P>
	On the issue of enforcement, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and I had a rather heated discussion when he 
appeared before the standing committee. I asked him bluntly: 
``Can you enforce Bill C-44? Yes or no?'' His response was: 
``Yes, we can''. That was a strong pledge in my opinion, but 
fortunately for the minister he is not the one who will be 
enforcing the bill. What about the people who will be enforcing 
the bill? What did they have to say?
<P>
	According to the Canada Employment and Immigration 
union, ``Additional staff is needed to process applications and 
help integrate new entrants in a timely fashion''. They do not 
have the staff needed to fulfil their current duties, let alone any 
new duties.
<P>
	The customs union said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What benefit can be derived by the amendments proposed by Bill C-44, if we 
currently do not have the resources or the capacity to enforce even the existing 
legislation?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally, Canadian Police Association President Neal Jessop 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It reminds me of putting a band aid on the Hindenburg. The problems are not 
going to go away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What else is there to say? Whom should I believe? The 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, a politician with little 
or no background in policing issues, who claims that Bill C-44 
can be enforced? Or, shall I believe the people on the front lines 
who admit that they cannot enforce the laws now and that Bill 
C-44 will not make enforcement a more realistic possibility in 
the future? Whom should I believe?
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Northeast, Bloc Quebecois 
members on the committee and I have pointed out each and 
every one of these flaws to the committee. We have brought 
them to the attention of the Liberals through questions, 
statements and finally a motion last December calling for an 
inquiry into these concerns.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Liberal members struck down the motion. When asked why, 
the Liberal member for Elgin-Norfolk responded: ``We don't 
need to tell you''.
<P>
	The member for Bourassa cautioned the Liberals that they 
were being disrespectful of their fellow MPs. I was shocked at 
the response from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration. She responded: ``If the shoe fits, 
wear it''.
<P>
	Is this the new form of government the Liberals promised? Is 
this how the Liberals listen to Canadians? Is this how our 
country is going to be governed for the next three years?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9219"> 9219 </A></B>
<P>
	I say for the record that the committee hearings into Bill C-44 
have been an absolute and total farce. They have wasted my time 
as a member of Parliament, time that could have been much 
better used perhaps in dealing with constituency concerns. They 
have wasted the time of witnesses who have travelled hundreds 
of miles in some cases to share their concerns with us, only to 
find they were shut out in the final analysis. Finally, they have 
wasted taxpayers' dollars on a series of consultations that the 
government obviously did not take seriously.
<P>
	The Liberal government has not addressed the serious 
concerns over the legality and the enforceability of Bill C-44. In 
the process it has made a mockery of the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration. The Canadian people want 
meaningful legislation. They want to deal firmly with criminals 
who take advantage of our country's goodwill. They do not want 
laws that will be struck down by the courts and ridiculed by the 
international community. Most important, they do not want laws 
that cannot be enforced.
<P>
	Until these specific concerns are addressed by the 
government, until the Liberals prove they are willing to 
seriously listen to the Canadian people, until they deal with the 
unconstitutionality of the bill, and until they give our 
enforcement officers the resources they need to make the bill 
work, I and the rest of the Reform caucus intend to oppose Bill 
C-44.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to follow my colleague on the parliamentary 
committee, the hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin, because I 
heard something in his speech that appears to be a departure 
from normal Reform policy.
<P>
	As you are well aware, Madam Speaker, and as other members 
of the House who were here in the previous Parliament are 
aware, I have a very deep and abiding affection for the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. I feel it is one of the great gifts that the 
legacy of the Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau left to the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You can't say his name.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The hon. member opposite might want to check 
parliamentary procedure. The Right Hon. Prime  Minister 
Trudeau is no longer a member of the House. Ergo it is 
permissible to name him without breaking the rules of 
Parliament.
<P>
	It was a pleasure to hear the hon. member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin cite with regard to Bill C-44 that it would 
not withstand a charter challenge and I forget whether he said for 
three seconds or three minutes. I would like to know specifically 
from the hon. member what that charter challenge would be. 
Under which section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
would he put it and could he possibly outline an argument?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, I was in discussion with a 
constituent of another constituency, not my own. The concern 
there was that following the policies of the right hon. member 
who has been mentioned we hardly live in a country any longer. 
``We are a large plot of geography'', he said, ``in which a lot of 
different people try to make a living without any common 
history, without any common destiny or without any means of 
coming together''.
<P>
	With regard to the member's question, if she would like to 
review the transcript of the committee meetings the information 
is all there.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, it is fairly rare that I am 
accused of being obscure in my comments. As a matter of fact 
most people tend to think that I can perhaps be outspoken at 
times. I will be as succinct and as quick as possible. I already 
talked with my colleague next to me from the province of 
Saskatchewan who is a member of the bar. I found that he had the 
same concerns as I do with regard to the comments of the hon. 
member for Cariboo-Chilcotin.
<P>
	I repeat. The hon. member said in his speech that the bill 
would not survive a charter challenge. I cannot remember 
whether he said three seconds or three minutes but he did say it. I 
know my colleague in the Chamber from London, another 
member of the bar of Ontario, would agree with me that there are 
sections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that can come in 
conflict with federal legislation.
<P>
	If one is to make a statement that says a bill before the House 
would not survive a charter challenge, as we would say in the 
land of my birth, Nova Scotia, ``put your money where your 
mouth is and tell us how it will not survive a charter challenge''. 
What section does it offend? What is his argument that states it 
would leave us in a constitutional quandary?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be glad to quote the 
sections of my speech once again for the hon. member's benefit. 
If the hon member has her pencil out, she can take notes.
<P>
	I quote Amnesty International that said there were measures 
contained in the bill that potentially violate rights guaranteed in 
the charter.
<P>
	I also quote the Canadian Labour Congress that says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe C-44 in fact violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9220"> 9220 </A></B>
<P>
	There are other groups that accused the government of 
breaking sections 7, 11 and 15 of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, as well as numerous international conventions 
dealing with refugee treatment, torture, execution and war 
zones.
<P>
	I do not have to quote the sections because they have already 
been quoted by people who know more about the law than I do, 
and the hon. member too, I might add.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to take part in third reading debate on Bill C-44.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin who spoke 
before me will probably stay for some of my speech. I was very 
interested to hear the comments of the hon. member. I am still 
waiting to hear which sections of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms are violated, but I was particularly interested to hear 
him talk about the way people feel about politicians.
<P>
	I was particularly interested in the comments of the hon. 
member for Medicine Hat who made a comment about 
politicians. I would really like to tell the member for Medicine 
Hat that like it or lump it the day he got elected he became a 
politician.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> A representative.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> We are all representatives, Madam Speaker, 
through you to that gentleman.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Some better than others.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I represent the people of Halifax and I have been 
re-elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You won't be next time. 
That seat is gone.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Wait and see.
<P>
	At any rate, the member for Cariboo-Chilcotin talked about 
this and I would like to say it is interesting that he used that 
against a government with a Prime Minister who enjoys an 
unprecedented rate of approval and popularity. I merely bring it 
up as an anomaly, clearly in the way the members opposite seem 
to deal with the realities of politics.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	What I really want to talk about here today is again the 
question of a phrase that is often used in this House and is 
perhaps ill understood. The phrase I want to talk about is due 
process. I want to make it very clear that I ascribe to my Reform 
colleagues across the way the best of intentions when it comes to 
areas of criminal law and the protection of Canadian citizens, 
the protection of victims and the incredible need to ensure the 
very important concept of safety in our streets and in our homes. 
I want to make very clear to my colleagues across the way that 
the questions of safety for Canadians are very important.
<P>
	The hon. member is whistling. I will talk to him later. I will 
finish my thought first.
<P>
	At any rate, the whole question of due process is one that can 
be very frustrating, as we all know. Situations arise and the way 
the law works can often be mystifying, lengthy, unsatisfactory. 
To many people it creates a solution that on the face of it at the 
very least is unjust or appears to be unjust. It is a difficult 
concept to come to grips with.
<P>
	If you look at the concept of due process and the development 
of English law under which our criminal law has developed you 
will know that it is a process that has been developing for well 
over 1,000 years. The courts in England developed it prior to the 
Magna Carta and the bill of rights and they worked along 
through these various times and ages, through the politics of 
monarchs to the politics of Parliament, until now when we have 
arrived at the last decade of the 20th century and they still are 
colossally imperfect.
<P>
	I do not think anyone who deals with the criminal justice 
system in any of those countries that follow the English system 
of common law would disagree with that. They are colossally 
imperfect. While they are colossally imperfect, they tend to be 
better than anything else. The difficulty is that if you lift the 
rights for some you lift the rights for all.
<P>
	I have a constituent with whom I discuss these matters quite 
frequently and we tend to disagree a lot. This constituent is very 
concerned with questions of public safety, as am I. He feels that 
our courts are too lax, give too much credence to the rights of the 
accused, and on and on.
<P>
	Not too long ago he told me about his son who in his early 
twenties was pulled over because his car resembled a car that 
had been used in the commission of an offence. He was very 
upset that his son was stopped and put in the position of possibly 
being a suspect in a criminal offence. As it turned out for his son 
it came to nothing because his son was completely innocent in 
this case and went on his way. It was a frightening experience for 
the young man and a disturbing experience for the father.
<P>
	I listened to that and I took it under advisement. A couple of 
weeks later when he called me and talked again about the 
accused having too many rights and the accused being allowed 
this and that, I reminded him of his concern about his son who 
had been stopped, who was completely innocent.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I reminded him that those safeguards that protected his son 
have to protect the guilty and the innocent alike or they will not 
work at all. We have to believe in the presumption of innocence 
and we have to practise the presumption of innocence. We have 
to practise fairness in the courts. We have to practise the 
independence of the judiciary and the independence of 
quasi-ju-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9221"> 9221 </A></B>
<P>
dicial bodies. There are lots of times that the decisions that are  
mounted are irritating and frustrating and downright wrong.
<P>
	There is an old story in a book about judges that was published 
some years ago. A particularly narrow minded member of the 
judiciary was giving a barrister a very difficult time. Finally he 
said: ``I can only advise you to take your petition to the Lord'', 
to which the barrister responded: ``Thank you very much, my 
Lord, but I will take it to the appeal court and probably will do a 
lot better''.
<P>
	At any rate, the point is that the freedom and the balance of the 
law sometimes tip too far one way or the other. What we attempt 
to do through legislation, what we attempt to do through the 
administration of justice in this country is to keep the balance as 
fair as possible. It does not always work.
<P>
	When I was in law school a professor who is now teaching at 
the University of Victoria used to talk about something called 
the universal theory of rough justice which is not terribly 
satisfactory. His theory as a professor was that 80 per cent of the 
time justice gets done.
<P>
	I can remember as first year law students we were horrified at 
this because that meant 20 per cent of the time justice did not get 
done. He explained to us that by and large it was a pretty good 
average. To this day that still frightens and horrifies me, that in 
20 per cent of cases justice does not get done.
<P>
	In the 20 years that I have been involved either as a lawyer or a 
legislator I have yet to see another system that works better. 
That is not to say that we do not constantly strive to refine the 
system that we have, but we do not refine that system by taking 
away rights. We refine that system by ensuring its fairness and 
its balance. We refine that system by refining the basic theory of 
due process and justice.
<P>
	With regard to Bill C-44, we have listened over the past year 
or more to a variety of people telling us where we needed 
refinements, particularly with regard to the criminal justice 
system and immigrants, and we listened.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from across the way made the statement 
that we did not listen to the people who came to us at the 
committee. I would like to say with the greatest of respect to that 
member, we did listen. We brought in 11 amendments that 
reflected the majority of concerns of the people who came 
before us.
<P>
	One of the things that I have learned in six years in this House, 
and I think it may be the most important lesson one can learn as a 
legislator, is again the lesson of balance. We cannot go too far 
one way or the other way. That probably reflects my own 
political philosophy. It reflects the political philosophy of the 
party of which I am proud to be a member. It reflects the 
political philosophy and the response of the vast majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	To quote the former Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, those of us 
in the Liberal Party were the party of the radical middle, the 
party of the extreme centre. To paraphrase a poet, William 
Butler Yeats, the Irish poet, the centre cannot hold.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	In Canadian politics and in the affairs of Canadians, 
particularly those matters that relate to the criminal justice 
system, to maintain fairness and to ensure justice the centre 
must hold. It is our responsibility on this side of the House to 
hold that centre.
<P>
	I want to say a few words in particular about immigration in 
Canada. I want to say that it bears repeating over and over that 
every single one of us in this House, every citizen of this country 
is of immigrant stock. Even both our colleagues who come from 
the north and several other colleagues from Manitoba, those of 
our colleagues who belong to Canada's founding peoples, the 
aboriginals, will admit that their ancestors first came here 
across the land bridge from Asia 5,000 years ago. Everybody in 
this country came from somewhere else.
<P>
	We are a nation of immigrants. If it were not for the Scots, the 
Irish, the English, the French, the Germans, the Italians, the 
Ukrainians, the Poles and on and on, all of the different groups 
that came here and chose Canada, we would be a poorer country. 
We would be a weaker country. We would be a less tolerant and 
less fair country.
<P>
	The vertical mosaic that is Canada is an amazing experiment, 
a terrific example to the rest of the world. The response to the 
vertical mosaic from other countries is the response that the 
United Nations told us, that this is the best country in the world 
in which to live. Obviously that forms part of the reason for 
people choosing to come here, but it is also something that we 
must hold on to as legislators as we pass laws that will affect the 
citizens of this country, the people we are here to represent.
<P>
	I have been very fortunate in the year and a month that I have 
been parliamentary secretary in immigration and citizenship to 
travel all over this country. I was in the riding of Calgary 
Northeast on Friday with the hon. member opposite, the 
immigration critic. I was there for a symposium on immigrant 
youth. There were 350 I believe-and my hon. colleague will 
correct me if I am wrong-places at this conference. They were 
all filled and there were 100 on the waiting list to meet and talk 
about the problems and concerns of young people who come to 
this country from other places.
<P>
	At the opening ceremonies that the hon. member and I 
attended there were about 100 people, most of whom 
represented service organizations, NGOs, government levels, et 
cetera, all there because of their concern for immigrant youth to 
ensure that they settle into this country, to ensure that their 
needs are met. These things are increasingly important because 
we hear over and over  again when so and so came 100 years ago 
we did not have settlement groups. No we did not. Of course we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9222"> 9222 </A></B>
<P>
also did not have small pox vaccinations and medicare. I hope 
we have improved to some degree on both of those things.
<P>
	I note, Madam Speaker, that you are cutting me off in full 
flight. I have two minutes to go, so I had better wind up and talk 
a little bit about the specifics of Bill C-44.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The specifics of Bill C-44 are the response to a need. This 
morning the minister talked about the problems we dealt with, 
the rank insanity, if you will, of convicted criminals calling the 
immigration board to prisons to hear their stories on whether 
they should be granted status in Canada. Those problems will be 
dealt with by Bill C-44. Those problems will not be solved 
completely by the bill, but again we move forward to deal with 
each difficulty in the area as we see fit.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is a strong and open response by the government to 
the problems evinced to us by the major players and 
stakeholders. We will deal with the bill and if further 
developments are necessary in the legislation, so too will we 
deal with those.
<P>
	I support the bill and I adjure my colleagues on the other side 
to do the same thing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Québec-social program reform; the hon. 
member for Frontenac-international trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I, like 
several lawyers who participated in the committee hearings, 
believe that this bill violates certain provisions of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and of the Geneva Convention. I 
hope that, once it becomes law, it will be immediately 
challenged before the courts.
<P>
	I am thinking in particular of the provision which allows for 
the seizure of international mail by immigration officials. This 
is a reversal of the burden of proof. The presumption of 
innocence is protected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, but not in this legislation. The mere fact of importing 
or exporting identification documents or papers is an offence. 
Consequently, a person must prove that he or she has not 
committed an offence, which is contrary to the basic rules of 
law.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary then tells us that this is an 
excellent bill. Why is it then that all the organizations and all her 
colleague lawyers, including the president of the Canadian 
council for refugees, David Matas, who is also a lawyer and a 
former Liberal Party candidate, told the committee that this was 
a bad piece of legislation and that it violated the Charter and the 
Geneva Convention for refugees?
<P>
	Indeed, the Canadian bar association, the Barreau du Québec, 
the Canadian ethnocultural council, as well as highly respected 
members of the legal profession in Canada criticized this bill, 
from a legal standpoint. I agree with the comment made by the 
hon. member who spoke before me to the effect that the Liberal 
majority did not co-operate. The Liberal members did not read 
all the briefs and they did not listen to all the testimonies made 
before the committee. More importantly, they did not listen to 
the opposition.
<P>
	We submitted amendments that have ben implemented in 
other countries. We said that it was necessary to protect those 
who are here, the permanent residents who have been in Canada 
for at least ten years. These people already belong to our society; 
they have very little in the way of emotional links with their 
country of origin; they no longer have any family left over there. 
Why not make an exception for the people who have been living 
in Canada for a long time, for 40 to 50 years, and who, for many 
reasons, have not become Canadian citizens? They still are 
permanent residents.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	We also said that we have to protect the younger people who 
are living here, in Canada, with their parents but who are not 
Canadian citizens. They are the products of our society. If they 
commit an offence, they have to pay for it here. Why should we 
deport them? They no longer have any family over there, their 
family is here, and our society is responsible for their education.
<P>
	So, why were the amendments put forward by the opposition, 
by the Bloc Quebecois, rejected? I refer to amendments 
designed to include in this bill provisions found in other 
jurisdictions like Australia, which is as open to immigrants as 
Canada. Even in a country like France, not recognized for its 
open immigration policy, the immigration act is more caring 
than this bill introduced by the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to respond to the 
questions of the hon. member for Bourassa.
<P>
	First, with regard to his contention that we are in conflict with 
the Geneva convention I can only say that I believe the hon. 
member was there, as I was, when the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees' representatives came to the 
committee, were questioned on that and did not agree with him.
<P>
	The government does not think it is in contravention of the 
Geneva rules and neither does the UN. Beyond that I am not 
quite sure where we should go. Perhaps the hon. member thinks 
we should run to the position of the Bloc. I can only say that I am 
not now nor have I ever been nor do I intend to be a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9223"> 9223 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to co-operation on amendments, particularly on 
the amendment that the hon. member mentioned-I am going to 
try to say this as clearly and as succinctly as possible because 
this is something that a number of members on the other side in 
both parties do not seem to understand-the reason is that we are 
on opposite sides. We have different beliefs and different ways 
of achieving our ends.
<P>
	We are on the government side. We have a majority. 
Frequently we are going to disagree with the Bloc on a number 
of issues, particularly those issues that go to the heart of what it 
is to be Canadian. We disagree as well most vociferously with 
the third party on practically everything.
<P>
	Consequently I am not quite certain what the members of the 
opposition expect here. That is the point. They are the 
opposition. We are not supposed to agree.
<P>
	I am quite happy to think that both parties are serving Her 
Majesty in the best way possible by being a loyal opposition and 
disagreeing with what we say. If we agreed, I would be worried.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I know that the parliamentary secretary likes to talk 
about flying as does the minister. He certainly has alluded many 
times to the planes that fly and land and the ones that crash. I 
believe the parliamentary secretary is still flying and she has not 
come down to earth yet to learn what is happening. She needs to 
put her feet on firmer ground.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary attended various meetings and 
listened to all kinds of experts dealing with Bill C-44. Several 
flaws have been pointed out in the removal provisions by these 
experts.
<P>
	These flaws are in the existing legislation as well as Bill 
C-44. It is not going to change anything.
<P>
	Could the parliamentary secretary tell me if the government is 
going to keep confined those violent criminals until travel 
documents to remove them are obtained rather than releasing 
individuals into society. I have the name of one here. Mr. 
Gregory George Jordan has been charged with second degree 
murder. He is an Australian with a deportation order against 
him. He is walking around on day parole. What is the 
parliamentary secretary going to do about individuals like that? 
Is she going to keep them confined until removal orders are 
present to remove them?
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, sometimes one feels as if one is 
a voice howling in the wilderness. The hon. member knows, or at 
least he should know after a year and some time in the House and 
after a year and some time as the critic for immigration, that 
commenting on individual cases is neither proper nor 
appropriate. He knows I am not going to comment on a specific 
case.
<P>
	What I am going to do is refer the hon. member yet again to 
the provisions of the bill that deal with the question of serious 
criminals, that deal with their removal. I remind the hon. 
member that a bill that is not yet passed can hardly be enforced. 
Let us get the bill passed so the kinds of criminals he is talking 
about can be dealt with expeditiously.
<P>
	If we had the support of the third party on this bill, if they 
were so concerned with the whole question of criminality and 
the speedy removal of serious criminals, then perhaps they 
would support this bill instead of haranguing on issues that are 
not really on point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, in a sense it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to 
address Bill C-44, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the 
Citizenship Act. This bill is not all bad but it surely is not all 
good. If I had to summarize, it is just not good enough.
<P>
	When the government first announced its intention to amend 
these two controversial pieces of legislation it was my hope to 
be able to offer support. However, since the bill is little more 
than smoke and mirrors I have to speak in opposition to it.
<P>
	The bill offers very little of substance and provides only a 
false impression of security to the millions of Canadians who 
are concerned about our lax immigration process. It offers no 
significant changes, contrary to the words September 19, 1994 
by the immigration minister. During his speech at second 
reading the minister said: ``Enforcement is a priority of my 
department''.
<P>
	Yet in this bill we see no provision for extra enforcement 
officers. There are also no specific measures for strengthening 
the enforcement process. In fact, during his speech the minister 
admitted: ``There has been slow enforcement'' yet I repeat there 
are no provisions to increase enforcement.
<P>
	He also said: ``When it comes to enforcement of immigration 
issues we have to do a better job''. I fully agree with the 
minister's statement and therefore have to ask why this bill has 
side stepped the issue of enforcement?
<P>
	The minister also talked of the integrity of the immigration 
system saying: ``If we do not deal swiftly and crisply with both 
the perception and the reality of abuses to our immigration and 
refugee system, the integrity of the entire system is in 
jeopardy''. The minister was correct in his assessment, yet by 
offering up this innocuous legislation he will create a false sense 
of security that will do more harm than good to the integrity of 
the process he is worried about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9224"> 9224 </A></B>
<P>
	While the minister talked a good talk during his speech his 
actions have failed to match his words. He says he wants to get 
tough on immigrant criminals. However, in Toronto the minister 
recently cut the number of investigation and enforcement 
officers back from 36 to 30. Only 30 officers to track down the 
approximately 24,000 deportables suspected of living in and 
around the greater metro Toronto area. The minister also cut 
overtime staff in the Vancouver region. This is what the minister 
calls making enforcement a priority?
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The minister might argue these cuts were made to save money, 
but that is a red herring. If he wants to save money he should stop 
appointing his friends to the high paying jobs at the IRB. When 
those friends are found to be abusing the power of their positions 
he should not be permitting them to receive golden handshakes. 
Need I remind this House of the Michael Schelew affair? If the 
minister wants to restore integrity he should disband the 
Immigration and Refugee Board instead of giving it more 
power.
<P>
	Under this bill the IRB is given the power to stop a refugee 
claim if a serious criminal background is discovered. Sounds 
good. The minister heralds this part of the bill as a great 
improvement. However, what the minister does not say is that he 
already has that power under section 69(1) of the current 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	The problem is the minister is afraid to use that power. In 
bestowing that authority on the IRB the minister is abdicating 
his own authority. He is the man ultimately accountable to 
Canadians, yet by abandoning this power it is obvious he is 
unwilling to be accountable.
<P>
	In fairness, in reviewing the bill I have to acknowledge that 
the government has made an effort to make the appeal process 
slightly tougher. However, it is only a small step in the right 
direction and it simply does not go far enough.
<P>
	There are also other measures contained in this bill where I 
must say the government is on the right track, but in typical 
Liberal fashion these are only half measures. For example, the 
minister has seen the wisdom of limiting the power of the 
immigration appeal division to stay the removal of or allow 
appeals by serious criminals on humanitarian or compassionate 
grounds. Again this is only a half measure.
<P>
	It is also a positive step to fully legitimize the act of allowing 
customs officers to seize mail suspected of containing 
fraudulent identity documents. However, at the committee 
hearing on this bill Mansel Legacy, the head of the Customs 
Excise Union, said there are so few mail checkpoints and 
inspection personnel that this measure is not enough in itself and 
will accomplish very little.
<P>
	Many may say the examples I have cited here in opposition to 
this bill are just further proof of the Reform Party's desire to 
shut Canada's borders to immigrants. I would like to remind this 
House that almost without exception witnesses before the 
standing committee condemned this bill as inadequate.
<P>
	Just for the sake of clarity I want to reiterate a few of the 
salient points of immigration policy that the Reform Party 
advocates.
<P>
	First the Reform Party supports an immigration policy that 
has as its focus Canada's economic needs and we welcome 
genuine refugees. The Reform Party remains convinced that 
immigration has been and can be again a positive source of 
economic growth, cultural diversity and social renewal.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposes any immigration policy based on 
race or creed. We do support an immigration policy that would 
be essentially economic in nature. Immigrants should possess 
the human capital necessary to adjust quickly and independently 
to the needs of Canadian society and the job market.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports restricting sponsorship privileges 
to members of immediate families, that is, wives or husbands, 
minor dependent children and age dependent parents. All others 
should apply for entry through the normal selective process.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a policy accepting the settlement 
of genuine refugees who find their way to Canada. A genuine 
refugee is one who has a well-founded fear of persecution and 
qualifies under the strict requirements of the United Nations 
convention.
<P>
	By the same token, we support a policy of immediate 
deportation of bogus refugees. If the government opposite 
would like to read from this it is all contained in the Reform's 
blue book, good reading as opposed to the red one.
<P>
	During his speech the minister also talked about his broad 
consultative approach in all of this. However, a leading Toronto 
immigration advocate labelled that same process a sham. Well I 
will not do that, but I will say that on a couple of occasions I 
invited the minister to come to my riding of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan to hear what immigrants there think needs 
to be done to address current problems. It is unfortunate, I know 
the minister is busy, but he has been unable to find the time to 
accept those invitations for true grassroots consultation.
<P>
	In Nanaimo we are experiencing the type of problem the 
minister talked about in his speech at second reading, namely a 
few immigrant criminals casting a shadow over the reputation of 
many. In fact, a confidential police report obtained by my office 
states: ``The hub of Asian organized crime for the world will be 
situated in Vancouver and Vancouver Island by the turn of the 
decade''. Unfortunately I see very little in this bill to stop this 
ominous prediction from becoming a reality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9225"> 9225 </A></B>
<P>
	People of Nanaimo, immigrant and non-immigrant alike, are 
concerned about this fact. That is why I wanted the minister to 
hear directly from these people. Since that has not been 
possible, at least not so far, I would like to tell the minister and 
this House just what a group of Nanaimo immigrants feel must 
be done to correct the current immigration process.
<P>
	First, a direct quote from one of the Vietnamese participants 
at a meeting I held in Nanaimo in this last year: ``The 
government screwed up by allowing many immigrants into 
Canada without properly checking their backgrounds''. Again, 
there is nothing in Bill C-44 that leads me to believe this 
situation will be addressed.
<P>
	Second, the same Vietnamese Canadian participants said: 
``Those immigrants selling drugs have no fear of the law''. That 
is because most of these immigrants know that even if they are 
ordered deported, it may be years before they are actually kicked 
out of the country, that is if they are ever tracked down by a 
grossly understaffed and overworked enforcement service.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, quoting again from this group of Vietnamese 
participants: ``The government must get serious about 
toughening its immigration laws''. These are immigrants telling 
the government what they believe should be done.
<P>
	Legitimate law-abiding immigrants in Nanaimo do not fear 
the kind of tough measures Reform has advocated. In fact, they 
would welcome the kinds of proposals Reform has talked about 
knowing that our policies would only be detrimental to those 
who do not or will not abide by Canadian laws.
<P>
	In short, Nanaimo's immigrant population wants to be a 
productive part of Canadian society and we want them to be. 
They want to contribute toward building a better and safer 
Canada. However they agree that this cannot be done without a 
strict immigration policy of zero tolerance toward immigrant 
criminals. This bill does not have the teeth required to 
implement such a policy.
<P>
	It is with the views of immigrants within my riding in mind 
that I appeal to this government here today to abandon this 
nebulous piece of legislation in favour of meaningful and 
significant changes.
<P>
	Those changes should include provisions for extra 
enforcement officers, a zero tolerance policy for immigrants 
convicted of serious crimes either in Canada or prior to their 
arrival, the addition of health provisions such as mandatory HIV 
testing, and a policy to refuse admittance or expedite 
deportation of those suspected of war crimes or crimes against 
humanity.
<P>
	In his 1994 annual report the Auditor General also suggested 
changes to the way in which immigration responsibilities are 
carried out by different government departments. The Auditor 
General has concerns about the lack of reporting either by the 
immigration department or the other departments that have 
some responsibility in this area. If the minister is looking for  
ways to save money, which he should be, he should consider 
making the necessary reporting changes advocated by the 
Auditor General a part of this legislation.
<P>
	There are many more areas where this bill falls short. The 
minister has shown some courage in taking these first steps but 
he has also demonstrated a lack of understanding as to what 
Canadians want in a sound immigration policy. Either that or he 
simply lacks the intestinal fortitude required to make the needed 
changes.
<P>
	The minister is fond of telling this House that the buck stops 
with him. In the sense that the buck is a dollar, I urge the 
minister to withdraw this two-bit piece of legislation and come 
back to this House with the entire dollar's worth of change 
needed to address the serious inadequacies in the current 
immigration process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was following the speech given by the hon. 
member. He always refers to new Canadians other than his own 
race as immigrants. I want to know, the people he was talking to, 
the Vietnamese Canadians, are they still immigrants or are they 
Canadian citizens who have the right to express themselves? 
Just because they look different, we should not call them 
immigrants for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	He quoted the figure of 24,000 deportees and mentioned that 
we have only 20 investigators. I am sure he knows that of the 
24,000, not all of them are criminals. Some of these people are 
missing papers or documentation. One cannot call 24,000 
refugees waiting for papers to be in order as criminals and ask 
them to be investigated.
<P>
	Can he clarify those two points for me? I would appreciate it.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, to respond to the first point, of 
course concerning people who are landed immigrants, we 
should stop calling them immigrants after a while. The group I 
was referring to was a mix. Some were immigrants without 
status, others have status.
<P>
	We are all immigrants after all, as the hon. parliamentary 
secretary stated just a while ago. In this case there was specific 
reference to a Vietnamese community. Am I to go into the 
political correctness realm to try to skate around the fact that 
they are identifiable? It was a group to whom I spoke, 
identifiably with a Vietnamese background, whether they are 
immigrants or not. Let us not skate around things. Let us call 
them as they are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Call them Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9226"> 9226 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> All right, fine, then this group of Vietnamese 
Canadians. I can speak to a group of French Canadians, Dutch 
Canadians, Ukrainian Canadians. There is nothing wrong with 
identifying their background I hope because we should all be 
proud of where we came from.
<P>
	I cannot clarify the hon. member's question on the 24,000. 
The phrase I used on that-I would have to go back to it-was a 
suspected group that are at large. This comes from a source. The 
public domain says this is what it probably is. If we do not have 
the inspectors, the people to back it up, let us increase it. Let us 
spend more money there where it is needed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, N.D.P):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan pointing out how he and his party feel that 
there has to be more staffing in the immigration department. It 
seems that is a necessity.
<P>
	I have also been listening to his party for the last year and a 
quarter complaining that the government must cut some $40 
billion from the deficit and they keep saying it should be done 
almost immediately. That will mean reducing about 25 per cent 
of the services that the government now looks after which 
presumably will mean a 25 per cent cut in the personnel who 
have been delivering those services.
<P>
	If the hon. member is going to be adding to the immigration 
department, what departments is he going to be proposing to do 
away with and where can he get rid of 25 per cent of the current 
crop of civil servants and still add to some departments? He will 
have to do away with whole departments and perhaps do away 
with the military to perform these new services that he is now 
advocating. Where can he take these kinds of cuts and still get 
rid of about a quarter and still add to his chosen ministry?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> The answer to that question, Madam Speaker, is 
very simple. We take the cuts out of the fat bureaucracy and put 
them into the sharp end. The Department of National Defence 
was mentioned as an example. It is taking 3,000 out of its 
headquarters in Ottawa to bolster the front lines where it needs 
them in support of the UN.
<P>
	I say the department of immigration should do the same thing, 
take it out of the bureaucracy here in Ottawa and put it into the 
front lines where it is needed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, if I 
understand correctly, my hon. colleague agrees in the case of a 
genuine refugee. I would like to ask him a question.
<P>
	After an individual has been allowed to enter the country as a 
refugee and has been given refugee status, there is a fee of $500 
per adult and $100 per child for permanent residency. A lot of 
genuine refugees are impoverished when they come here. They 
have no money  and sometimes have to turn to churches or to 
agencies that help immigrants and refugees find the $500.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	We looked into the matter and found that genuine refugees do 
not have to pay anything for permanent residency in the United 
States. What does my colleague think about this problem?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, genuine refugees need not 
fear. If they fit the definitions set by the United Nations, we have 
to accept them, we have to pay their expenses, etc. But the 
number of genuine refugees is undoubtedly much smaller than 
what the immigration department currently claims. If they truly 
are refugees, we accept them and give them financial assistance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I go back to my second question about 24,000 
deportees. I would appreciate if in the near future the hon. 
member would look into the numbers and report to this House 
the exact number of criminals. He says there are 24,000. Maybe 
he can tell this House how many criminal deportees he is 
referring to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Madam Speaker, I would be more than pleased 
to try to pin down the exact numbers and report back to this 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I suppose I could start by wishing everyone a happy 
1995. I wish everyone prosperity.
<P>
	In this House sometimes we educate others, sometimes we get 
educated from discussions such as this. I welcome this 
opportunity to discuss Bill C-44 today in this House.
<P>
	I was watching television on January 16 which happens to be 
Martin Luther King's birthday in the United States. In one of his 
speeches he said that a first class nation deserves first class 
citizens. This bill calls for Canada being a first class nation, 
which it has been called for the last two years by the United 
Nations. This is a first class bill for first class citizens, 
especially those who are new arrivals in this country. They know 
they are going to start a new life with their family in this new 
country which they have adopted.
<P>
	I was following the comments of both of the opposition 
parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party. Obviously the 
Bloc Quebecois is telling us that we are not going far enough. I 
know its point of view because it sits with us on the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. The Reform Party 
spokesman said that it does not go far enough. We are confused 
as to how far to go to satisfy the Bloc or how far to go to satisfy 
the Reform Party. That is why as good Liberals we always 
support the middle ground because the middle ground is where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9227"> 9227 </A></B>
<P>
the average Canadian's mentality rests. That is where average 
Canadians want us to be.
<P>
	When we talk about immigration we always refer to negative 
things, the cup is always half empty. Let us look at the positive 
side of immigration.
<P>
	Earlier I asked my colleague if he could give us the number 
for the 24,000 deportees which he mentioned. He could not give 
me a number. I would think the number is not more than 625. For 
625 criminal refugees it is fair not to raise the figure to 24,000. It 
gives the impression that immigrants are all criminals, that they 
all have criminal records or that they intend to commit a crime 
when they adopt Canada as their new homeland.
<P>
	This bill makes six basic points. Earlier the Reform Party 
spokesman said that this is a good bill but does not go far 
enough. As was mentioned earlier, the job of the opposition is to 
oppose. That is what it is paid for. We on this side are paid to put 
forward programs, which we are doing. The six points that were 
mentioned by the hon. member go far enough.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	We should not take the approach that we are going to build a 
cement wall like the Berlin wall against refugees coming in, 
saying that anybody coming in from a certain part of the world is 
a criminal or intends to commit a crime in this country. That is 
not the way we do business in Canada. That is not the way we do 
business in western society.
<P>
	I am sure the member agrees with me that we cannot put 
police officers with machine guns at every step of the way who 
will say: ``You look different than I do, so you had better stay out 
because you look like a criminal to me''. We cannot do that.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois says that he hopes 
after this bill is passed that someone will challenge this bill in 
the courts. I hope they will because we want to do the best we 
can. We want to make sure that we become first class citizens in 
this first class country.
<P>
	That is the responsibility we have and we take it very 
seriously. I hope they will share that responsibility with us and 
support the bill. If there are improvements or suggestions to be 
made, we should do that as we go along. The system allows that 
to be done. For the time being we should support this bill 
because it is the best we can do under the circumstances.
<P>
	Before we arrived at this bill we had one year of consultations. 
I know the Bloc Quebecois says that consultations were not good 
enough because of a, b, c or d. The Reform Party says they were 
not good enough because x, y or z and because 29 million people 
did not have a chance to come forward to speak.
<P>
	In my riding I organized two or three meetings to talk about 
immigration. People spoke up. Some said yes and some said no. 
Some said it was good policy and others said it was bad policy.
<P>
	I sent out questionnaires and 1,100 people responded. I passed 
those questionnaires on to the minister. I am happy to say that 
most of the concerns presented to me by my constituents are 
addressed in this bill.
<P>
	I am very happy to support this bill. I will do whatever I can to 
support this bill because it is important. We must have it because 
we have to go forward and be forward looking. We cannot be 
negative on everything new planned by this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have heard several times today from Liberal members 
about hitting the middle road when it comes to immigration, that 
they would like to pick the so-called balance and policy and 
compare the message of the Bloc with the message Reform 
delivers.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member across realizes that we are 
talking about apples and oranges when we compare messages 
the Bloc sends and what Reform has been saying for some time 
now. The Bloc already has an agreement on immigration levels 
and on the way it handles immigration policy which differs 
dramatically from the rest of the country. The levels that the 
Bloc has are probably more realistic than the levels set by this 
government for the rest of the country.
<P>
	I am going to ask this hon. member what he has in his mind 
when he wants to tell the people of this country that they have 
struck a balance. I would suggest to this member that there is no 
balance struck by the Liberal government when it comes to 
immigration policy, that it is floundering. If a comparison is to 
be made between the Bloc and the Reform the member should 
abandon the comparison.
<P>
	I would like to hear more comments from the member 
regarding the so-called balance he is talking about between the 
Reform and the Bloc.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, I would be more than 
happy to address the hon. member's concern.
<P>
	A few months ago when I put forward Bill C-229 about 
limiting political parties from becoming federal parties when 
they do not have 50 per cent of provincial representation. I noted 
at that time the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party both voted 
against my bill. They shared that regional concern.
<P>
	The other point I want to make is that both of them have 
national headquarters for their parties outside of Ottawa. I want 
to remind them that Ottawa is the nation's capital. The way I see 
it you cannot be a federal party in this country and have your 
headquarters in some other region of the country. Members 
work in Ottawa so their headquarters should be here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9228"> 9228 </A></B>
<P>
	Concerning immigration policy levels, the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
said the minister did not go far enough because he has to have 
255,000 new immigrants. We have dropped to 190,000. This 
person complained that we dropped too much. This is a 
conservative newspaper that speaks often on behalf of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	It says we have to increase the number to make it 255,000. It 
says here that each immigrant coming in will add to the national 
budget a $10,000 surplus. How much more of a balance do we 
want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Go to the immigration department and find out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Why do we not go together? Maybe you 
can apply to re-enter Canada so you will know what Canada is 
all about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
several occasions, my hon. colleague mentioned the Bloc 
Quebecois. I am proud to be the citizenship and immigration 
critic of my party.
<P>
	During the past year, as a member of the House and of the 
standing committee, I noticed that the positions of the 
organizations and individuals who appeared before the 
committee have been closer to that of the Bloc Quebecois than to 
the Liberal Party's. Of course, they do not even come close to 
the Reform Party's position.
<P>
	We found that we shared identical views on many issues 
regarding immigration and the plight of refugees. This is 
because we come from a province, the province of Quebec, 
which is generous with immigrants and refugees, takes care of 
them, welcomes them and helps them settle by providing French 
language instruction and assistance to find work and housing. 
We have our own immigration department. We are the first 
province in Canada to have its own immigration department and 
a well defined immigration policy, and to have signed 
agreements with the federal government, giving us self 
government in many areas.
<P>
	We are proud of the fact that Quebec has a progressive, 
generous, and open policy. Quebec is the province where there 
are the fewest problems with immigrants and refugees. We have 
not seen in Quebec events such as those in Toronto. We do not 
see in Quebec papers the kind of over-reactions we sometimes 
see in the English press with respect to refugees and immigrants.
<P>
	I am very proud to be from Quebec. We do not need and never 
will have headquarters in Ottawa. Our headquarters are in 
Quebec, where we are from, where we work; we are only trying 
to make Canadian immigration policy a little more humane. 
This is the contribution of the Bloc Quebecois to the House of 
Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, he cannot have it both 
ways. First he complains we do not listen, then he says that all 
the witnesses spoke very highly about the Bloc Quebecois. 
Which one is true? Did they speak very highly about your policy 
or our policy? We listen. If he does not like the decisions we 
make, I am sorry. He does not want to stay in Canada anyway, so 
what is the point? He wants to go.
<P>
	Also he says he is proud that he came to Quebec. He should 
know if Canada was not here he would not have any Quebec 
anyway. He should stand up and thank Canada for allowing him 
to come here and also thank the people in the province of Quebec 
for asking him to serve Canadians in the province of Quebec in 
this Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have just a couple of questions for the hon. member. 
First, I have a general comment. I do not know where the hon. 
member spent the Christmas break. I assume in his riding. If he 
spent his time in the riding perhaps he would realize that the 
world does not revolve around Ottawa, but the world actually 
does go on outside of this place.
<P>
	The idea that a party must have its headquarters in Ottawa, 
must lick the boots of the special interest groups in Ottawa, must 
spend its time catering to Ottawa, looking after Ottawa, making 
its friends comfortable in Ottawa is typical, I may add, of the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	However, since they brought it up and not myself, I would like 
to take issue with a couple of comments that the member made 
that if immigrants sometimes look different they are persecuted. 
Obviously when that happens or if that happens then Canadians 
should be outraged that people are persecuted based on their 
looks, their race or their gender. It should not be tolerated and 
has no place in Canadian society.
<P>
	However, the point that the member does not seem to want to 
admit is not that people may look different, it is that they 
commit serious illegal acts while they are not Canadian citizens. 
While they are refugees and commit serious acts what should 
happen to them?
<P>
	I guess my question for the member is this. If someone who is 
claiming refugee status is charged with a serious crime should 
they be held in detention pending a deportation order or should 
they be released back into the general population?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Madam Speaker, I am appalled that some 
members take the matter so lightly. They make the accusation 
that 24,000 new Canadian immigrants or refugees who are 
waiting to be processed are criminals and that 30 people are not 
enough to investigate them. Now they turn around and try to 
defend themselves which is indefensible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9229"> 9229 </A></B>
<P>
	The other point that the member made earlier was that one did 
not have to be in Ottawa to know in which direction the 
government is going. He is very right. He is 100 per cent perfect. 
During the Christmas recess I was in my riding and I knew it far 
ahead of the hon. member. The reason I mentioned that they do 
not know what is going on in Ottawa and the rest of the country 
is because during the campaign in my riding on Victoria Park 
Avenue, the Reform Party candidate had a four by eight sign 
which read: ``We will run the country the way we run the 
campaign'' and they ran the campaign without Quebec, just 
remember that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, how apropos that I have the floor after that rather inane 
comment by the member opposite because of course the sign 
reads: ``We will run Canada as we will run our campaign, which 
is debt free''. The Liberal Party is still paying off its debts from 
the election because of course it cannot even run an election. 
The Reform Party has a tidy surplus which we will use to win a 
majority in the next election.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to address Canada's immigration policy within 
the context of Bill C-44 this afternoon. I find myself a bit of the 
horns of a dilemma with respect to this bill. On the one hand it 
does represent a rather feeble attempt to toughen up the 
immigration system. Since Canadians want and need changes in 
the immigration system the bill at least recognizes that change is 
required. Therefore in one sense this bill is better than nothing.
<P>
	Unfortunately it is not a whole lot better than nothing. It 
places some restrictions on the rights of refugee claimants who 
would abuse our system. It contains provisions allowing 
immigration authorities to seize fraudulent immigration 
documents from the mail. Any non-citizen convicted of a crime 
in Canada carrying a sentence over 10 years long would be 
deported. Although with our justice system one pretty well has 
to murder someone to receive a 10 year sentence. Those 
immigrants who are found to have been convicted of a crime in 
another country that would carry a sentence of more than 10 
years here would be automatically barred from entering Canada.
<P>
	These are welcome provisions and I generally support this 
tentative first step toward creating an immigration policy 
acceptable to Canadians. However, when we look at the 
government's overall priorities as they are seen in terms of its 
actions, not just its words, it places the bill in a different light. 
We will see that as a whole this bill is timid. It is weak and it is 
ineffective.
<P>
	Edmund Burke said: ``The concessions of the weak are the 
concessions of fear''. His proverb is two centuries old but it 
rings true today. If there are two dominant characteristics of the 
Liberal government they are weakness and fear. The Liberals 
fear going out on a limb. They fear acting aggressively in the 
public interest. They fear confronting wrong in order to 
accomplish justice for  all Canadians. Fear causes the 
government to act with timidity and weakness.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	This fear drives the strength out of the government's 
legislation and it saps the morale of government officials, 
officials who are supposed to be zealous in the protection of 
Canadian citizens but who are today demoralized and 
discouraged because they are not properly supported by the 
government.
<P>
	I am not without feelings of goodwill toward bona fide 
refugees. The people who testified before the standing 
committee dealing with the bill have expressed their 
reservations about the fact that it reduces the rates of refugee 
claimants. They are very concerned that every refugee have 
access to fair consideration of his or her claim and they do not 
want people deported into countries where they will be tortured 
and imprisoned because of their political views and other 
obvious injustices.
<P>
	I appreciate the sensitivities of groups like Amnesty 
International and the Mennonite Central Committee came to 
testify. The fact that we have tender consciences in how we treat 
refugees reflects well on our nation. This is a wonderful thing, a 
thing to be thankful for in Canada. I stand with them in their 
desire for fairness in their hope that Canada will remain an 
international sanctuary for people who are truly oppressed.
<P>
	However there is a question of balance today, a question of the 
genuine concerns of the Canadian people balanced against the 
convenience of some of the phoney refugees who use our system 
as a cloak to hide their criminal intentions.
<P>
	Today Canadians are the ones being oppressed by some 
so-called refugees. The balance must be swung in favour of 
protection of our own citizens. It appears to me that the 
presumption of innocence in Canadian law has come to mean the 
determination of innocence without investigation.
<P>
	It has become the practice of our immigration system to 
assume that all refugees are nice people, that all refugees are 
good for society. They ignore the fact that some of them have 
long criminal records. The government appears to ignore the 
outrageous crimes some of them commit on our soil.
<P>
	One of those crimes was the senseless murder of Todd Baylis, 
a constable in Toronto who was gunned down last year. An 
immigrant who had been ordered deported in 1991 stands 
accused of the crime. The department simply failed to deport 
him earlier, which I am sure provides little comfort to the Baylis 
family. Would the people at Amnesty International agree that 
this person should have been deported four years ago? I think 
they would.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9230"> 9230 </A></B>
<P>
	I will cite one more outrageous case. There are many more. A 
Vietnamese man is serving an eight-year sentence in Kingston 
for murder. He stabbed a man to death in a Toronto bar in 1991. 
His case was heard while he was in prison in Kingston serving 
his sentence and all his legal fees were paid by the Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>
	That man was granted refugee status. In a few more years he 
will be free and soon he will be a Canadian citizen. I doubt that 
the Mennonite Central Committee would approve of this 
situation.
<P>
	Our system is becoming unbalanced. The focus of this 
imbalance is the Immigration Refugee Board, a quasi-judicial 
body set up to hear the cases of refugee claimants and hear 
appeals of deportation orders.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the Reform Party critic for immigration 
advanced a discussion paper that said that the IRB is out of touch 
and is virtually untouchable. The IRB is ridiculously lax. In 
some regions of Canada, the IRB accepts more than 90 per cent 
of the claimants that come before it.
<P>
	In making a determination about a refugee claim, IRB 
officials are not even allowed to use an adversarial approach as 
in a regular judicial hearing. They take the burden of proof on 
themselves to disprove a refugees claim and even take pains to 
avoid using a tone of voice that would suggest that the onus of 
providing proof of legitimacy rests with the claimant and not the 
board.
<P>
	Officers of the IRB are discouraged from checking into the 
personal history of a suspicious claimant or even cross checking 
to verify their stories. It is incredible.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, this is a question of balance. Where the 
safety of Canadians is at stake, any error should be on the side of 
caution, not caution in favour of the refugee claimant who is 
already known to be a dangerous criminal but the balance must 
lean in favour of the victims, the Canadian people.
<P>
	Bill C-44 intends to change the appeal process for refugees 
convicted of serious crimes. It will take away the right of appeal 
on humanitarian grounds from the Immigration Refugee Board 
and give it to departmental officials. Why is the minister doing 
this? This action really amounts to an accusation against the 
IRB. The bill in fact shows that the IRB cannot protect the 
public.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals act in weakness and respond in frailty. First they 
appoint their friends, friends who are usually non-objective 
refugee advocates, to the board. Then they allow their ridiculous 
decisions to stand. When the public outcry becomes so great that 
someone must do something, the Liberals grudgingly take 
action. They certainly do not want to disturb their leftist friends 
at the IRB. No, the Liberals will just give their work to the 
department.
<P>
	The government refuses to attack the problem at its roots. The 
problem lies in the decisions of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. Rather than taking the board in hand and taking it to task, 
the Liberals take the easy way out and pass legislation that 
changes the board's authority.
<P>
	The bill is a vote of non-confidence in the IRB. It is an 
admission that there is rot in the system and the rot should not be 
ignored. It should be cut out. Bill C-44 will not be able to patch 
up this problem; it will only fester and grow worse.
<P>
	We would know exactly what to do with the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. Reformers would dismantle it and replace it 
with immigration department officials who have a mandate to 
protect Canadian citizens. These competent public servants 
would be able to do a much better job of determining refugee 
claims at much less expense than 235 left wing political hacks 
making $85,000 a year.
<P>
	In short, we would toughen up our system to protect 
Canadians born in Canada as well as Canadians who have been 
welcomed as immigrants to our land. Canadians born in Canada 
and newer immigrants who are Canadians by choice realize that 
some refugees come to Canada not to escape persecution but to 
escape prosecution.
<P>
	In Vancouver near my own riding there was a recent headline 
in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> quoting the Vancouver chief of police 
saying that one of the greatest problems facing the police in that 
city were despicable Asian gangs that extort money through 
violence and intimidation from other innocent recent Asian 
immigrants. These gang members act with virtual impunity 
because of loose laws and a silly bleeding heart Liberal 
government lacking both the will and the courage to protect 
innocent people.
<P>
	That brings me to another issue. Immigrants call my office 
and tell me they are ashamed and disgusted by the illegal actions 
of a few and because of the government's inaction in this regard 
every immigrant is tarred with the dirty brush of the criminal. 
That is not fair to the vast majority of immigrants and refugees 
in the country. The government is undermining its own policy by 
allowing criminals to roam free. It is not fair.
<P>
	Allow me to suggest a recommendation of the Canadian 
Police Association that we would do well to think about. At 
present we have two parallel systems of justice in Canada: one 
for refugees and one for everyone else through the criminal 
courts. The police association says we should allow criminal 
courts to determine whether or not refugees are criminals and 
then to decide if they should be deported, so that there is one 
system for everyone in Canada: the equality of treatment idea.
<P>
	This would take the burden away from the department and the 
minister and give it to judges who work daily with criminal law. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9231"> 9231 </A></B>
<P>
However the Liberal government will  no doubt leave its friends 
in the Immigration and Refugee Board undisturbed.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is like sewing a new patch of cloth on a ragged old 
pair of jeans. When we wash them the new patch shrinks and 
tears away, and in the end the hole is bigger than it was to begin 
with. The bill will do nothing more than tear new holes in the 
fabric of our old flawed immigration system.
<P>
	Why? Because it mandates more work and more powers for 
officers without providing the resources to get the job done. The 
bill barks but it has no bite. It is nothing more than window 
dressing. It is good theatre with a parade of fine characters, but 
when the curtain comes down and we go back to real life nothing 
will get done, nothing will change.
<P>
	Canada does not need more patchwork legislation. It needs a 
completely new wardrobe. Nothing less than a complete refit of 
our immigration system will do the job, and I might add that 
Canada will probably also need a new tailor to finish the job. 
Decades of Liberal neglect have whittled protection to the bone.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	You may not be aware, Madam Speaker, of an amazing fact. 
These figures are give or take a thousand so I will not argue with 
the figures in totality. There are currently 24,000 outstanding 
deportation orders in the city of Toronto. How many 
enforcement officers are there to deal with this problem? There 
are 35 officers to locate and deport 24,000 people. This is just 
one indication of the priority the Liberals place on the protection 
of ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	Even when the immigration department just trying to do its 
job issues deportation orders to these people, the Liberal 
government does not have the will to remove them. Canada's 
refugee determination system is in a shambles. It is worse than 
shameful. The electorate will one day act as police, judge and 
jury because of it. The people will try the Liberals, convict them 
and stick them in the political slammer for a generation.
<P>
	The minister with great fanfare set up a task force last July to 
crack down on illegal immigrants.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Rhetoric.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Oh, no. He means it. This so-called task force is 
made up of twenty RCMP officers, four assigned to Montreal, 
four to Vancouver and only twelve to metro Toronto where there 
are 24,000 outstanding deportation orders. Immigration officers 
are so overwhelmed by the sheer numbers that they are unable to 
execute a removal order unless the individual voluntarily turns 
up. What a mockery of our system.
<P>
	When the task force was struck the words of the sergeant in 
charge were pitiful. He said right away to the press that he was 
not going to go knocking on doors and arresting people. What 
was he supposed to be doing then? This is symbolic of the 
government's attitude toward 24,000 illegal acts gone 
unchecked, 24,000 people  flouting Canadian law and laughing 
behind the backs of a lax justice and immigration system.
<P>
	Listen to what the Canadian Police Association said just 
before Christmas during the committee hearings on the bill. I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How anyone in this world when you have a police service of 16,000 
members-that's the RCMP-could call 20 persons spread in the three major 
cities across Canada a task force is really inconceivable to me. That phrase is 
seriously abused-I'm not trying to be facetious, but (C-44) reminds me 
somewhat of putting a band aid on the Hindenburg.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I think I have heard this line before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> The Canadian Police Association said that band 
aid solutions would not work any more. Our system is 
hemorrhaging and nothing less than radical surgery will restore 
it to health.
<P>
	There is the question of balance and there is the issue of 
protection. I want to address one final issue upon which this 
entire discussion turns. That is the issue of priority. The 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration and all the costs 
associated with settlements and so on approach $3 billion each 
year. It costs $1 billion alone to process refugees. They teach 
English, settle immigrants and do a host of other good things. 
They also enforce the provisions of the Immigration Act.
<P>
	However the priority placed on enforcement is the real 
barometer of the government's real concern for these law and 
order issues. The government can talk all it wants about 
protection, but all this is just talk unless the government puts its 
money where its mouth is. Only $50 million each year is spent 
on enforcing the act, and that is compared to total expenditures 
of $3 billion.
<P>
	If my math is correct-and I think it is because I checked it on 
this side of the House and not with the finance minister-that 
amounts to 1.6 per cent of total expenditures. Less than 2 per 
cent of the money we spend on immigration is spent on 
protection and for that matter protecting recent immigrants as 
well. How much is spent on salaries alone at the Immigration 
and Refugee Board? I am sure you could guess, Madam Speaker. 
In salaries alone the IRB costs the Canadian taxpayers $58 
million each year. It is an outrageous abuse of taxpayers' money 
and an indication that the government places less priority on 
protecting innocent Canadians than on pleasing its fat political 
friends at the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Reformers do not suggest that the government spend more 
money on immigration. Far from it. Reducing immigration 
flows as we have suggested would reduce expenditures and free 
up some of the taxpayers' funds to be placed where the priority 
should be, on the protection of Canadians. Changing the priority 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9232"> 9232 </A></B>
<P>
from an Ottawa based bureaucracy to a front line bureaucracy 
would save additional millions.
<P>
	While the government announced a reduction in immigration 
rates last year, as a York University professor argued today in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>: ``Mr. Marchi imposed only a symbolic 
reduction. He has buckled to the pressure of ethnic lobbies''.
<P>
	Bill C-44 is just talk and it will remain empty talk until the 
government gets busy and makes real and not just symbolic 
changes to the immigration system.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
overwhelmed at the extremely low level of knowledge with 
regard to the entire working of the immigration department 
shown by my charming and well meaning colleague across the 
way.
<P>
	I would like to ask an absolute plethora of questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Have you ever been at a 
hearing?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Many times I have been before the refugee 
board. I have appeared before it many times. Heaven knows I 
never thought I would find myself in the position-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> What is the question?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> This time is for questions or comments. I can do 
either, and this is a comment.
<P>
	I never ever believed that I would be in the position of 
defending Edmund Burke. It is a very difficult position for a 
Liberal to be in, to be defending Edmund Burke. I can only say 
that I studied Edmund Burke. Through his works I knew 
Edmund Burke. I would almost say in the sense one can be a 
friend of a literary person who lived 200 years before one that 
Edmund Burke was a friend of mine. To the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley East, through you, Madam Speaker, he is no 
Edmund Burke.
<P>
	At any rate, the number of 24,000 deportees has been batted 
around ad nauseam in the House. I just wonder if the hon. 
member across the way has a scintilla of an idea as to how many 
of those 24,000 have criminal records. The answer is very few, 
but I am sure the hon. member does not wish to be distracted by 
fact.
<P>
	May I also say that one should be careful in the realm of 
comment, with the greatest of respect to members on the other 
side, when talking about people who have not yet been tried in 
our criminal justice system, about guilt or innocence. The word 
alleged is a good word to throw around here. I am sure my 
colleague, the hon. member for Rosedale, who is on leave from 
the faculty of the University of Toronto Law School, would be 
happy to agree with me on that score. It is extremely unwise as 
legislators to throw around words about guilt or innocence 
before someone has been tried. If that were the case this 
legislature would not need to exist.
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley East said that he does not 
want us to spend any more money. That is admirable. As I 
understand it that is the Reform theory. Yet he thinks that we 
should be hiring all kinds of people to rush out and find these 
24,000 people. Yes, they are under deportation. Yes, they should 
be out of the country. But, again, the vast majority of them are 
not criminals.
<P>
	Does the hon. member understand how small a number of 
immigrants and refugees actually has criminal records, 
particularly when compared with born Canadians who have 
criminal records? Does the hon. member know the difference 
between immigrants and refugees? He tosses the two words 
around as if they were interchangeable. As my hon. colleague 
from Bourassa would agree with me, they are not the same. They 
are quite different.
<P>
	I am glad my whip is here. He may have to bring me water 
because I may faint from the criminal level of lack of knowledge 
that has been evidenced here by people standing and declaiming 
about things they know absolutely nothing about.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Rhetoric is what you got.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Can you spell it? Probably not.
<P>
	At any rate I want to say that if the hon. member can answer 
these questions, I would like to hear an answer instead of the 
nonsense that has been put forth about immigrants and refugees 
in this country from this member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, it was interesting after the 
verbal tirade and pontifications of the hon. member that she 
went on at some length to talk about the need for a proper trial 
and so on that she says that I have a criminal lack of knowledge. 
I guess she has tried and convicted me already. Maybe there is 
no point in answering.
<P>
	When it comes to the exact number of people of the 24,000 
that I mentioned earlier who have criminal records, I would not 
know. Say there is 10 per cent, say there are 2,500 cases serious 
enough for deportation. Certainly in one city the size of Toronto 
I would be alarmed at 2,500 people having criminal records 
causing them to be deported. That is cause for serious concern. 
The rest of course are also ordered to be deported and according 
to the government's own figures and facts no fewer need to be 
deported. It says that it is the one that has given the deportation 
orders. It is just that it does not carry them out.
<P>
	There is a sad part about this. There was a case a little while 
ago. Someone wanted to bring in a 14-year old girl from Fiji on 
a student visa and this is the gong show they had to go through. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9233"> 9233 </A></B>
<P>
They have to get the student visa which is the last step in the 
whole process. However that is what they are trying to get.
<P>
	These people put forward a net worth statement and had to 
prove they had an ongoing job, that they could support this 
student while here. They did that.
<P>
	Next they had to give a floor plan of their house showing they 
had a room for this girl when she got here. That was kind of 
insulting but they got the floor plan for their house and faxed it 
off to try to arrange for this student visa.
<P>
	Then they had to arrange for legal guardianship so that they 
could say they would be her legal guardian while she was in 
Canada on this student visa. They arranged for that.
<P>
	Next they would have to get permission from the school 
board. They arranged for written permission from the school 
board for the girl to attend.
<P>
	Then they received a fax saying that was not enough. They 
now have to have a transcript of the court decision that gave 
them legal guardianship. It was not enough that they had the 
paper. They now had to jump through another hoop and show the 
transcript.
<P>
	All this is safe. This is what someone is trying to do to legally 
bring someone in on a student visa.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> What is wrong with that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> There is nothing wrong with that. What is wrong 
with that is these people are Canadians by choice. They are 
relatively recent immigrants. All of their friends ask them: 
``Why do you bother? That is the legal way to do it. Why bother? 
Nobody does that when they want to get someone over. You just 
go through the refugee system and bring them in''.
<P>
	This girl should be here. I put a letter of endorsement on this 
girl's application. They reason she cannot come to Canada to get 
four years of senior secondary education is that the system is so 
screwed up that it is better to come through a bogus refugee 
system than it is through the legal means. That is what is wrong 
with this system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it certainly is my pleasure to continue this 
debate in the House today regarding Bill C-44, an act to amend 
the Immigration and Citizenship Act.
<P>
	Amendments have taken place in part because of public 
opinion, because of a need to address some abuses of our 
immigration system by criminals. Although the incidence of 
abuse is minimal, this bill will reduce the possibility for abuse.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I would like to spend some time on that process and on the 
statement I made regarding the use of public opinion. In this 
House public opinion emerges, is debated and is transformed 
into rules and regulations governing the behaviour and actions 
of the people, institutions, companies and so forth in this 
country. It is a very time consuming and costly process in a 
democratic society. If it were a dictatorial society decisions 
could be made instantaneously depending upon the whims and 
fancies of the dictator.
<P>
	So far all the rhetoric we have received from the Reform Party 
clearly indicates they have the absolute solutions to all the 
major problems that exist in the field of immigrants and 
refugees. It is a very strong and dictatorial approach to problem 
solving.
<P>
	Today the member for Calgary Northeast made two 
statements that all those who are in this House and those who 
made deliberations in the past have laughed in the faces of 
Canadians. He clearly indicated that Canada is an international 
laughing stock. The deliberations in this House of Commons 
both past and present at no time have deserved that type of abuse 
from the member for Calgary Northeast.
<P>
	I feel very strongly that the member should apologize not only 
to all the present members of the House of Commons but also to 
those of the past hundred years who devoted their time and 
energy to solving the problems in our society. Above all he 
should openly apologize to the people in the riding he represents 
because the House of Commons is not laughing in their faces. 
They are not laughing in the faces of all Canadians. They are 
demanding an apology from the member for the type of ridicule 
imposed upon members of Parliament who represented his 
riding in years gone by and who devoted their time and energy to 
make this a much better country. That is the kind of dedication 
we would like to see in this Chamber. That is what a member of 
Parliament of honour and nobility would portray in this House 
as he tries to enhance the lives of all Canadians.
<P>
	Yes, we do have problems in this country, but we will continue 
to search in a very positive and sincere manner for solutions to 
these problems. Problems emerge as people provide us with 
their opinions. Through studies and the multitude of strategies 
that we use in our communities the information flows and we 
have to make a list of priorities and deal with them using the 
resources we have, whether they be human or financial. The 
time factor is very important here in what should be dealt with 
immediately and what should be dealt with in the future. Long 
range and short range planning are critical as far as the 
deliberations of the members of the House of Commons are 
concerned.
<P>
	One problem we have that has been mentioned by members 
across is the problem of selection, the problem of screening 
prior to a refugee or an immigrant being accepted into this 
country. What actually takes place beyond the shores of this 
country when an individual puts in a claim to be accepted as a 
refugee or an immigrant?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9234"> 9234 </A></B>
<P>
	Contrary to what has already been presented by members of 
the Reform Party, for the viewing public as well as for members 
of the House of Commons I would like to clearly stipulate the 
process all potential immigrants and refugees must go through.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	All immigrants to Canada are screened in depth by officers for 
security and criminal concerns. Visitors are checked against 
Canadian indices and followed up if there are previous adverse 
records. Visitor applicants from high risk countries which may 
pose security or criminal concerns are subject to additional 
screening in Ottawa. There is a mandatory delay before which a 
visa may be issued.
<P>
	Contrary to what has already been presented by the Reform 
Party I would like to point out to all listeners that immigrant 
applicants abroad are requested for criminal purposes to 
produce a police clearance where such is available and reliable. 
In certain cases a secondary verification of this document takes 
place. The RCMP also provides support in verifying criminal 
record information in related matters.
<P>
	Another point is these officers in selected countries abroad 
also receive and gather information on selected individuals who 
are suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity. This 
information is used to prevent admission of such undesirables.
<P>
	I have just given a portion of the strategies used in order to 
glean and to screen the applicants who wish to come to this 
country.
<P>
	Most of the people who came to this country in the past and 
are here now are very good Canadians. They have chosen very 
wisely. They have chosen to come to the best country in the 
world. The vast majority of them turn out to be the very best 
citizens we have. They are extremely hard workers, dedicated 
and conscientious, constantly supporting the family unit, 
constantly honouring and abiding by those values that 
Canadians in general adhere to and support. They are not an 
army of criminals. They are not an army of potential thieves. 
They are not an army of potential deceivers.
<P>
	We have to be very careful how we address this problem and 
how we accept the data that is being presented by those 
opponents to the immigration acts, not only on Bill C-44 which 
is being presented, but on all those acts that have been presented 
and passed in this House of Commons in generations gone by.
<P>
	In support of what I have been saying, I would like to quote 
from the Toronto <I>Star</I> of November 6, 1994 where in a flippant 
manner an individual from the Reform Party has misquoted and 
used numbers and figures to serve a certain purpose. The 
purpose is suspect, the purpose is questionable. It states: 
``Reform MP Jim Silye has insisted that RCMP documents 
prove a total of 1,935 people were accepted as refugees without 
any prior screening. Only later did police discover they had 
criminal records''.
<P>
	However all indications from the RCMP, the documentation 
from immigration officials are that the statement is 100 per cent 
totally inaccurate. However it could have an impact in tainting 
the perceptions and tainting the opinions and attitudes of the 
people who had first heard it.
<P>
	What we did find out is that the number was used when that 
number of people were being processed and had been 
fingerprinted. We have to be very careful how we use figures 
that appear in the documents and in public.
<P>
	In my riding individuals approached me and were very 
concerned about the criminal element. The criminal element has 
been receiving a tremendous amount of attention in the media in 
the past few months. Every time a society, no matter whether it 
be Canadian or any other society in the world, goes through 
some negative process, a decline in productivity, in employment 
and so forth, in other words there is a recession or a depression, 
we will find without fail that immigration policies will be 
constantly attacked.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	Every time it happened in our society there was a scapegoat 
that took a tremendous amount of abuse and a great deal of 
unhappiness was generated in certain communities because 
people did not take the time to understand and be 
compassionate. They listened to the kind of rhetoric that we are 
getting from the Reform Party that does nothing but incite fear 
in the minds of individuals wondering what is going on and what 
the Canadian government is doing and so forth. They are 
frightened. They are afraid for their jobs and so forth.
<P>
	I could go on a great deal continuing with this debate but 
unfortunately time is running out.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member has 10 
minutes left on his time when we resume debate on Bill C-44.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMREFORM">SOCIAL PROGRAM REFORM</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
asked for an opportunity to comment on and criticize the answer 
given by the Minister of Human Resources Development in 
response to my question on December 6, 1994. I asked the 
minister how he could claim that his reform was supported by 96 
per cent of the population.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9235"> 9235 </A></B>
<P>
	This is called putting a spin on the figures. It is a very good 
example of the old saying that you can make figures and 
statistics say anything at all. The minister has turned this into a 
fine art. I carefully examined the results of the poll the minister 
used to support his statement, and I was very surprised when I 
found that the poll's originator, the Angus Reid group, reached 
conclusions that were sometimes the exact opposite of what the 
minister said.
<P>
	Before I give you some examples, I would like to make it clear 
that in the interests of authenticity, I will quote the results of the 
poll as written. This way, people can hardly accuse me of the 
kind of behaviour I did not appreciate in the minister.
<P>
	As my first example, I will quote question 4 which reads as 
follows: The federal government is proposing measures to 
reform social programs in Canada. Do you think it is a good or a 
bad idea?'' On December 5, the minister claimed that ``96 per 
cent of Canadians believe major changes have to be made 
in''-and here is the difference-``social policy''.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to remind you that the minister then 
accused me of misunderstanding. According to the minister's 
statement, we could expect 96 per cent of the people to answer 
yes to question 4. Surprise, surprise. Only 70 per cent of 
respondents thought it was a good idea. People thought social 
reform was a good idea but a comprehensive reform is a 
different story.
<P>
	Can someone tell me where the missing 26 per cent are 
hiding? Not among the 13 per cent who are undecided or the 17 
per cent who are opposed. I might add that the question to which 
70 per cent replied yes referred to a reform and not a 
comprehensive reform, as the minister claimed.
<P>
	Another flagrant example of inconsistency with the facts 
concerns Quebec's support for the federal initiative. The 
minister said that ``when the survey is broken down by region, as 
many people in Quebec support the social reform proposals of 
the government as in the rest of Canada''. This statement differs 
substantially from the authors' findings. Let me quote them on 
two issues. On page 7, they say that Ontario respondents were 
the most likely to say that programs should be completely 
revamped (64 per cent), while Quebec respondents were the 
least likely to give the same answer (44 per cent).
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I note a 20 per cent difference between the two provinces. Is 
that what the minister calls equality?
<P>
	My second quote is the following. On page 11, we read, 
concerning the proposed scheme for seasonal workers, that 
respondents from Quebec are much less favourable to these 
options; for example, 39 per cent of Quebec respondents agree 
with the amount of benefits paid being reduced beyond a certain 
number of applications, as opposed to an overall average 
support of 52 per cent, a 13 per cent difference.
<P>
	One last comment. It is not by overstating the importance of 
an alleged popular support that we will convince the people of 
the merits of these proposals. It would be much wiser to stick to 
reality and, this way, preserve our credibility. This comment is 
valid today and it will still be when the reform proposal is back 
on the agenda, as we now know that political considerations 
have prevailed over the need for reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this government has consulted extensively with 
Canadians in an unprecedented number of ways on whether and 
how Canada's social safety net should be improved.
<P>
	These consultations as well as a number of independent polls 
show a clear consensus across all regions on the need for reform. 
Canadians want change and they want it now. In one poll 96 per 
cent of Canadians believe that some change must be made to 
social programs. In another poll after being questioned on all 
key proposals almost two-thirds of Canadians felt the 
government is moving in the right direction.
<P>
	Support for the directions of reform has increased to 50 per 
cent in Quebec and has also increased in Atlantic Canada. 
During our consultations with Canadians over 600 
organizations, including women's organizations, appeared 
before the committee. Over 100,000 Canadians participated in 
other consultations including town hall meetings, seminars and 
completing workbooks. Women's groups held a separate 
consultation process, as did aboriginal groups. We welcomed 
their contributions to the debate.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member's concerns regarding 
proposals to modify the unemployment insurance program, it 
should be pointed out that while income testing is one option 
being considered, 70 per cent of women who claim UI are not 
frequent UI claimants and would therefore not be affected by 
this proposal.
<P>
	It should also be noted this government has taken concrete 
measures to address the concerns of female UI recipients. 
Recent changes to the UI program through Bill C-17 included a 
new 60 per cent dependency benefit rate for low income earners. 
To date nearly 78 per cent of claimants under this rate are 
women.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERNATIONALTRADE">INTERNATIONAL TRADE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on December 15, I asked the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food to tell us why the Canadian government let the 
United States unilaterally change the classification of products 
with a high sugar content. I should point out that, because of that 
decision, Quebec and Canada stand to lose 2,400 jobs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9236"> 9236 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister replied that Canada was opposed to the position 
taken by the United States and had made representations to the 
U.S. department of agriculture.
<P>
	For those who work in the sugar industry and who are trying to 
keep their job, these platitudes mean absolutely nothing. Since 
these changes occurred before the signing of GATT, the federal 
government should have taken action then. It should not have 
waited until it was too late and then use its commitments to 
GATT as an excuse.
<P>
	The minister also told us at the time that the Minister for 
International Trade was in touch with his U.S. counterpart to 
make the Canadian position abundantly clear, which was very 
reassuring at the time. It is nice to talk, but it is even better to 
act.
<P>
	Along with such evasive answers, the minister also promised 
that the best interests of Canadians and Quebecers would be 
protected swiftly and efficiently.
<P>
	It would appear that the lion has shrunken to a pussycat when 
confronted by the American giant, since it seems that the 
restrictive measures taken by the Americans have been in place 
since January 1.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	It is increasingly clear that Canada is the lightweight in these 
bilateral negotiations. The sugar issue will follow the red wheat 
and durum wheat issues on the list of good examples of the 
federal government's spinelessness.
<P>
	The federal government accuses us left and right of criticizing 
without making any suggestions. When I raised this issue last 
December, I strongly suggested that the minister submit the 
issue to the GATT panel. At that time, he replied that the 
Government of Canada would take all of the steps necessary to 
protect Canada and Quebec from measures taken by the 
Americans of which he disapproved. Since the government who 
is supposed to be protecting us is scared of its own shadow, we 
Quebecers have to defend ourselves, and there is not much time.
<P>
	Worse yet, we learned today in a Canadian Press report that 
the United States intends to challenge Canadian tariffs on dairy 
product, egg and poultry imports.
<P>
	Since we have lost the fight with regard to durum wheat, 
sugar, ice cream and yogurt, I fear for our producers and our 
processors. In one corner, the Minister of International Trade, a 
cocky little scrapper, and in the other corner, the American trade 
representative, Mickey Kantor, who knocks out our minister, 
our defender, our leader in the fight for our economic rights.
<P>
	The sugar industry has already lost 2,400 jobs and will lose 
several thousand more. That is exactly what the Liberals wrote 
in the red book: jobs, jobs, jobs. They were right in the sense 
that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but your time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to respond to the hon. member's comments tonight.
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member that the minister of 
agriculture and the Minister for International Trade have had 
numerous discussions with their U.S. counterparts during the 
Uruguay round of GATT and after that in order to try to resolve 
the issue of Canadian access to the U.S. market for sugar and 
sugar containing products.
<P>
	During those discussions the Canadian approach to the issue 
that remained outstanding was to seek a solution which would, 
at the very least, preserve existing levels of trade in sugar and 
sugar containing products. The minister made his concerns very 
clear when in December he said we regret that the U.S. has 
rejected this approach and implemented draconian measures.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture clearly expressed our 
government's disappointment with the U.S. and continued to 
seek a delay in the implementation of the U.S. measures against 
Canadian exports. He went on to say that the U.S. decision is one 
that has been and he could see would be inequitable and 
shortsighted on their part.
<P>
	The U.S. has proceeded with the reclassification of certain 
sugar containing products so as to make the access of those 
products to the U.S. more difficult or impossible. The effects of 
these changes has been to reduce Canadian access to the U.S. for 
sugar containing products and the market there for us.
<P>
	Officials are continuing to work with the industry and 
industry officials to develop a reliable estimate of the impact. 
We certainly have seen a worst case scenario and that has been 
quantified. However, these are not based on fact but mainly on 
hypothesis.
<P>
	As to the government's reaction, the minister will continue to 
consult with the industry and the provinces as to possible action, 
look at reviewing legal options and of course our preferred 
approach is a negotiated solution because we consider the best 
way to resolve these issues is to deal with each one on its own 
merits without trading off the different sectors against each 
other.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), a motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
