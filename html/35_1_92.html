	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to inform the House that in accordance 
with the representation made by the government under the 
provisions of Standing Order 55(1) I have caused to be 
published a special order paper giving notice of introduction of 
government bills. I now lay the relevant document upon the 
table.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My dear colleagues, I have the honour to lay on the table a 
copy of the reprint of the Standing Orders of the House of 
Commons, dated September 1994, which includes all 
amendments to the Standing Orders since the beginning of the 
session.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FULLEMPLOYMENTACT">FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon)</B> moved that Bill C-209, 
an act to provide for full employment in Canada, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, today I rise in this Parliament to 
speak to what I believe is one of the biggest issues facing each 
one of us here and one of the greatest responsibilities, jobs and 
job creation.
<P>
	We are still in double digit unemployment. There are still far 
too many people unemployed. It is time this government took 
direct action and accountability for unemployment levels.
<P>
	Bill C-209, an act to provide for full employment in Canada, 
will ensure that the government is as accountable for job 
creation as it is for deficit reduction.
<P>
	A full employment strategy means that all of the federal 
government's activities, managing interest rates and the dollar, 
dealing with trading partners, investing in new businesses and 
innovation, helping workers retrain, and every other aspect of 
federal economic and social policy are guided by the objective 
of achieving full employment.
<P>
	Full employment does not mean an unemployment rate of 
zero per cent. Economists estimate that it is generally 
considered between 3 and 4 per cent. It does mean that there is 
no permanent structural unemployment and that it is a set of 
precepts by which other policies should be guided. Full 
employment also does not mean that the government guarantees 
everyone a job. It means that the number of jobs available in 
public and private sectors is very close to the number of people 
active in the workforce.
<P>
	The objectives of a full employment policy have been proven 
over and over again in other countries to work very well in 
concert with proper labour market policies.
<P>
	A full employment economic strategy will build social justice 
with unemployment and underemployment reduced. The 
devastation of poverty and a lack of choices and opportunities 
are tragedies that characterize our present economic system, one 
that is clearly in failure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to explain, first of all, that this bill requires the 
minister to prepare a draft plan for the achievement of full 
employment in Canada and lay it before Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	The draft plan would then be reviewed by a standing 
committee of the House of Commons. The minister would 
consider the report and recommendations of the committee in 
the preparation of a final plan. The plan would be reviewed 
annually against the targets for achieving full employment, and 
the report on any adjustments necessary to meet the targets of 
the plan would be prepared within six months of the end of the 
year and laid before Parliament.
<P>
	I have quite a few recommendations on how this objective 
should be achieved-in fact, there are 22-but I will just 
describe a few. For instance, an environmental awareness 
program that would promote the goal of sustainable 
development through new environmental technologies, sewage 
treatment facilities and energy efficiency programs.
<P>
	It is therefore necessary to have an investment policy that 
includes the right to review and regulate foreign investment in 
Canada, a national investment fund that operates at arms-length 
from the government and an elimination of corporations' rights 
to deduct interest expenses from taxable income.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5786"> 5786 </A></B>
<P>
	A national policy on education that includes a national 
council on education which would examine all issues relevant 
to education.
<P>
	An important ingredient of this plan is strengthened support 
to existing social programs such as health care and the creation 
of new social programs such as a national child care program.
<P>
	It is also necessary to have comprehensive adjustment 
measures for workers such as the establishment of a mandatory 
job vacancy registry and job matching system through Canada 
Employment Centres and the establishment of adjustment 
committees for employees in positions where significant 
lay-offs are anticipated, to facilitate counselling, re-training 
and employment services for workers who are or may be laid off.
<P>
	It is necessary as well to provide for examination of the 
impact of all federal fiscal policies on employment, including 
the mandate of the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	These examples are all in the bill, and I think it is very 
important for a committee to consider the ways in which this 
part of the bill can be implemented.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the most important aspects of this bill is it will ensure 
that the government reports unemployment targets to the House 
of Commons as it now does with deficit reduction targets. By 
law the plan would be reviewed annually against targets for 
achieving full employment with adjustments required to 
meeting the targets of the plan to be reviewed within six months 
of the end of the year.
<P>
	The point of this bill is that the government must be as 
accountable for the reduction of unemployment as it is for the 
reduction of the debt and the deficit.
<P>
	There is a clear linkage between the policies of the 
government and the ability of our economy not to have a jobless 
recovery but to have a real recovery with jobs. Canadians who 
are now underemployed or unemployed would have work.
<P>
	When I speak of labour market policies there are a number 
that must be taken into account. For example, in recent statistics 
we see the largest increase in the number of jobs has been in part 
time jobs. Many people may wish to work part time but others 
work part time because they have no option. There must be 
policies in place to ensure that part time workers receive 
benefits and that they receive full recognition for part time 
work. Saskatchewan has brought in benefits for part time 
workers. The federal government and other provinces should 
follow that model.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Other adequate labour market policies are absolutely 
necessary. I would like to mention some of the 
recommendations which have come out of the labour movement. 
In particular, the Canadian Labour Congress addressed the issue 
not only of job creation but of the need to ensure that the existing 
work is more equitably  spread. Many people work many hours 
of overtime while others rest without employment at all.
<P>
	I would like to mention some of the recommendations of the 
Canadian Labour Congress. It specifically addresses the issue of 
how we attain full employment and the labour market policies 
which the government can put in place to facilitate that.
<P>
	For example, there is the reduction of standard weekly hours 
to less than 40 hours per week. In the past there was a huge battle 
about limiting work hours. There is a requirement for employers 
to keep a log of all hours worked and more stringent limits on 
overtime, both weekly and annually.
<P>
	We know many employers would rather pay overtime than to 
create a new job and take on a new employee because there is 
less book work and less hassle for the employer. We have to 
facilitate making it possible for the employer to do that. In some 
recent collective agreements, for example in automative 
manufacturing, a whole new shift with a number of new 
employees has been employed and other employees have 
reduced their overtime.
<P>
	The government should take the initiative in looking at those 
kinds of issues. Clearly in doing this we have to look at not 
simply reducing pay to workers. When looking at the work week 
and reductions in overtime and the accompanying labour market 
policies we must also ensure that benefits and other recompense 
are respected. Many kinds of these ideas are there. They can be 
acted upon by a government that really wants to deal with the 
issue and not simply speak about it.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly about the Minister of Human 
Resources Development's ongoing social policy review. It 
relates very closely to this plan for full employment. The goal of 
the review should be to make social programs more efficient but 
also more equitable. Accordingly the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in the context of his social policy 
review must consider adopting a comprehensive policy of full 
employment.
<P>
	Lower unemployment means a lower deficit. The two are 
inextricably linked. That is the purpose of this bill: to say that 
the government of the day must give equal emphasis to reducing 
unemployment as to reducing the deficit because they are 
inextricably linked.
<P>
	We do not need to cripple our social programs and 
marginalize the unemployed to reduce the deficit. That is like 
chopping up the furniture to heat the home. Let us start dealing 
with the fundamental structural problems of the bad economic 
policies we have seen pursued in this country.
<P>
	Let us also get rid of the myth that unemployment is free. It is 
impossible to reduce a budget deficit when there is widespread 
unemployment. Official direct costs of unemployment to 
government were $47.5 billion in 1993.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5787"> 5787 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Council for Policy Alternatives estimates the 
direct costs of unemployment at $109 billion for 1993 if we 
include unemployment insurance costs, lost salaries, additional 
UI premiums paid by employed workers, lost profits and lost tax 
revenues. Unemployment is not free: it is not free financially, it 
is not free in human terms, it is not free to communities and to 
families.
<P>
	If every unemployed worker had a job tomorrow, the federal 
government would collect some $5.5 billion more in taxes. It 
would spend at least $16 billion less in income support. High 
unemployment is a human tragedy, the federal government's 
most wasteful expense and its biggest unnecessary tax loss.
<P>
	Official unemployment is now at 10.3 per cent. Youth 
unemployment is at 16.4 per cent. More than one worker in four 
is now forced to draw unemployment insurance benefits at some 
time in the year and one in three exhaust these benefits before 
finding other jobs.
<P>
	Most recent statistics indicate that 42 per cent of workers are 
employed part time. Many of those are only employed 
seasonally. Only 20 per cent of working women hold full time, 
permanent jobs that pay more than $30,000 per year. Taken as a 
whole, only 31 per cent of all workers have full time, year round 
jobs that pay more than $30,000 a year.
<P>
	The 25-year trend of increased participation of women in the 
labour force has been reversed, especially for young women. 
More women have been pushed into part time jobs and 
outnumber men in these positions by almost three to one.
<P>
	The current government has continued to pursue the policies 
of the past, in particular, those introduced by the former 
Conservative government. These policies do not come to grips 
with permanent, structural unemployment.
<P>
	In this bill, I outline a number of ways that might be 
considered. There are many others: the labour market policies 
that I spoke to earlier; the kind of recommendations of labour 
bodies and other groups to working toward this objective.
<P>
	A clear commitment to full employment and to a strategy of 
full employment; building partnerships, setting goals and 
meeting them, putting tools in the hands of working people, 
protecting our environmental capital and understanding and 
rising to the challenges posed by the world economy; these 
should be the cornerstone of an economic policy.
<P>
	This bill would be one step toward that cornerstone. I urge the 
support of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege for me to take part in the debate on this 
extremely important issue. I would also like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for her work over a 
number of years. I think she has a well earned reputation of 
striving to better the lives of working Canadians.
<P>
	I paid attention to her comments. As a government, since the 
October 25 election, we have worked extremely hard in the past 
11 months to bring positive change to the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	No one in the House has a monopoly on the concerns of the 
number one priority in this country, which is job creation. That 
priority of jobs, of achieving employment growth, of ensuring 
meaningful, well paying jobs for all Canadians, is something 
that all of us, regardless of which side of the House we sit on, 
should be concentrating on.
<P>
	No hon. member, no one party in this House has exclusive 
interest in improving our economy. The government has truly 
created an environment where job creation can take place. We 
are committed to reducing unemployment and opening up the 
labour force to those individuals who want to participate in it.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The government has taken and is taking steps at this very 
moment to ensure that Canadian workers from coast to coast to 
coast have an opportunity to participate in rewarding and lasting 
employment. From the very beginning of its term in office it has 
been implementing a well laid out plan to promote economic 
growth and establish long term, rewarding jobs for Canadians. It 
has to be done in an orderly step by step fashion.
<P>
	We started rebuilding at the foundation. We have launched an 
infrastructure program in co-operation with the provinces that 
is addressing local needs. This infrastructure program is 
successful because it focuses on the local needs of the 
community. It speaks to the issue of effective partnerships, a 
model for all governments to follow.
<P>
	The $6 billion national program showed to Canadians that 
different levels of government, when they are focusing on the 
big picture which is to provide opportunity, to restore hope and 
improve the quality of life for Canadians, can work. 
Government can be a force for positive change and by 
facilitating the process of change and the process of building 
communities we can return to Canadians the feeling that 
something is getting done for their communities and for future 
generations.
<P>
	We are, through the infrastructure program, investing in our 
future. We are building our roads. We are building better 
communities. We are investing in those things that Canadians 
have called for and most of all-I underline this point-we are 
doing it in partnership.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5788"> 5788 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, we are working hand in hand with the 
Government of Saskatchewan to upgrade the province's rural 
roads over the next two years. This federal-provincial 
partnership will invest $30 million and will create more than 
500 full time jobs. That is not all.
<P>
	The spinoff from this project will result in hundreds of 
additional jobs for Saskatchewan. Residents in the construction, 
technical and professional trades will have opportunities to 
work instead of sitting in the unemployment lines.
<P>
	Those of us who represent the province of Ontario will 
understand the hurt and pain the residents have gone through in 
the recessionary years when their so-called Canadian dream 
slipped away. They question the future and what kind of future 
their children will have. We have established an infrastructure 
program in co-operation with the province of Ontario known as 
the Canada-Ontario Infrastructure Works. We estimate it will 
create approximately 37,000 direct and indirect jobs.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	These are facts and figures. They speak to the commitment the 
government has toward bringing back jobs, creating economic 
growth and, more important, giving back confidence to the 
people of Canada, confidence that was shaken during our 
recession.
<P>
	I can talk about other projects in the regions of York or 
Waterloo where investments have been made so that we can once 
again regain the strength required at the local and community 
levels to drive the economy and give confidence to the people so 
that we can push forward.
<P>
	These are fine examples of how partnerships can work, how 
we can foster a strong and productive partnership together. The 
government expects to create approximately 90,000 jobs for 
Canadians both on site in construction and off site in providing 
supply and services. Beyond that several thousand of more jobs 
will be created indirectly from the program's impact.
<P>
	That is not all. One starts by building the foundation. We 
addressed infrastructure. We then moved forward to strategic 
initiatives with the provinces. There again the theme is of 
partnership and regional concerns, bringing about the type of 
co-operation that is required if we are going to introduce a new 
way to govern.
<P>
	We have allocated $800 million strategic initiative funds for 
the next four years. This investment will enable us to build a 
Canada that is consciously job oriented and reflects a 
prosperous, enterprising society.
<P>
	The minister has already announced a number of projects 
under the strategic initiative programs. They include job link 
with the province of Ontario, a $50 million investment to help 
thousands of welfare recipients get employed. Is this not what 
governments should be doing, providing opportunities to people 
that historically have been trapped by the same system that 
should be helping them?
<P>
	We will be operating in 10 to 12 communities and job link is 
transforming existing programs into one co-ordinated system to 
help people move away from welfare into work. We want to get 
people off the welfare rolls and on to the payrolls of this nation. 
This is what people are asking for.
<P>
	We were all campaigning for the October 25 election. Every 
door we knocked on people were saying: ``Give us hope. Give us 
a job so that we can look to the future with confidence''. This 
example of job link with the province of Ontario speaks to that. 
It speaks to the understanding of a fundamental principle that 
government's role is to provide opportunities for people and the 
individual's role is to make the most out of those opportunities.
<P>
	If I may review, the government is moving into a social 
security review that will once again give to many Canadians the 
tools required so that they can compete locally, nationally and 
globally. We are working very hard to make sure that the dream 
of a job is realized from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to mention, although this will be underlined further this 
afternoon, that we are sitting today for the first time minus one 
of our colleagues.
<P>
	I was very pleased to start off the session with a debate on full 
employment. However, the debate taking place in the context of 
this particular bill, my pleasure turned to displeasure, to bitter 
disappointment as regards the nature of the provisions put 
forward by the New Democratic Party.
<P>
	A full employment policy, as anyone who has looked into the 
subject would know and as far as I am concerned, includes 
basically two main components: so-called macroeconomic 
policies concerning employment and policies at the regional and 
local level which, because of the ownership of the local and 
regional players, allow maximum job-creation benefits to be 
derived from national policy, whatever the nation, at the 
regional level as well as from a more local and regional policy.
<P>
	I would like to mention in passing, as time is short-but I 
hope we can come back to it later on-that Diane Bellemare and 
Lise Poulin-Simon, two university professors have looked into 
these matters extensively since the 80s in Quebec. They have 
worked so hard in fact that they influenced not only the central 
labour bodies, which they criticized in a way, but also 
management, which was also criticized, and governments to 
such a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5789"> 5789 </A></B>
<P>
point that in Quebec, we now have some essential tools such as 
the following.
<P>
	I will not address macro-economic policy, as it is Ottawa's 
responsibility. And in Ottawa, contrary to the government 
member's claims, concern for employment is not obvious to say 
the least. An infrastructure program was introduced. Fine, but 
we must also consider all that was not, and we will come back to 
this repeatedly over the course of the session. In spite of all the 
idle talk and the campaign promises, this government cannot be 
said to be concerned with employment.
<P>
	At the other level however-and it may be fitting to mention 
this here-the second component I referred to earlier is 
basically an involvement policy. Such a policy can, especially in 
Quebec but in other provinces also, as we will see, be developed 
at the local or provincial level.
<P>
	Let me read you two sentences. On what basis do Mrs. 
Bellemare and Poulin contend that micro-economic 
employment policy should come under provincial jurisdiction? 
First, provincial governments are at a definite advantage for 
political considerations when it comes to implementing such a 
policy.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the constitutional division of powers-and as far as I 
know the Constitution has not been changed, but, of course, it is 
convenient to forget this-gives the provinces considerable 
jurisdiction with respect to work and labour relations, education 
and training, and development of resources. And I would point 
out that it is Diane Bellemare and Lise Poulin-Simon who are 
saying this, not the Bloc.
<P>
	Secondly, there are cultural, linguistic and ideological 
considerations-to which, it seems to me, the sponsor of this 
bill could have been sensitive-which put the provincial 
governments in a better position than the federal government to 
implement a micro-economic employment policy effectively.
<P>
	It seems to me that what we are seeing here is the complete 
failure of the federal policy to achieve what one would expect of 
a full employment policy, that is economic, financial and 
budgetary policies at the macro-economic level from the 
government of the country. And having failed in that, it now 
wants to become involved directly and with all the necessary 
control over what is, in this Constitution-but I will say 
more-the very nature of a full employment policy, something 
which should be left to the provinces and to the regional and 
local levels.
<P>
	I would add that the current globalization of markets, which 
has not waited for the FTA or NAFTA, is forcing all countries to 
give the best of themselves to achieve an employment policy. In 
fact, it is at the level of the people, businesses, unions, groups in 
each of the municipalities, in collaboration with the level of 
government most closely concerned and with the closest access 
to the constitutional powers that the project and the 
implementation can be carried out.
<P>
	That is where it becomes easier when we know that we in 
Canada have not even been able during all these years to agree 
on manpower training, which is absolutely essential, and when 
the NDP bill does not refer in any way to what the provinces do 
better. That is true in any country. Why do at the federal level 
what would be done better at the regional and community level? 
Why? Because of a lack of confidence in the ability of our 
communities, our regions and, in the case of the Canadian 
Constitution, our provinces?
<P>
	There is plenty of goodwill and good intentions that I share. I, 
however, think that the means used are totally inadequate and 
cannot work in Canada under the current Constitution. But there 
is more than that. In Canada-and I think this will last for a long 
time given Canada's current geography-it is impossible for a 
full employment policy to be ``controlled, implemented and 
developed from Ottawa&quot;. The federal government must have 
employment-conscious fiscal, budgetary and financial policies, 
but it must let the provinces, the regions and the municipalities 
do what they do better, and give them the means to do so. At the 
present time, the means derive from the spending powers 
controlled by Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I would like us to re-examine this issue, but I am clearly very 
disappointed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I get into the main body of my 
remarks I would like to deal specifically with a couple of points 
that the member for Mercier made in her remarks.
<P>
	She talked about this motion not dealing enough with the 
macroeconomic factors in this equation of creating an 
environment for full employment and focused very much on the 
fact that all of these jurisdictions such as training and education 
be the exclusive jurisdiction of the province.
<P>
	I would like to remind the member for Mercier that trying to 
get the macroeconomic factors in the equation right is very 
tough to accomplish when there are members in this House 
whose constant barrage dealing with the dismantling of this 
country affects our markets in terms of the way foreigners invest 
in this country, which ultimately affects the rate of our dollar, 
which causes great stress on our deficit and debt reduction 
programs.
<P>
	If the member for Mercier is truly committed to getting the 
macroeconomic side of this equation in place, then I would ask 
the member to review the impact her party and its dialogue are 
having on that part of the equation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5790"> 5790 </A></B>
<P>
	To the hon. member who raised this motion, I agree that it is 
the most important issue facing this House of Commons today. I 
wish we could have this debate going non-stop around the clock 
until we grind this issue down and get a number of concrete and 
doable ideas on the table. I, like the hon. member, believe that 
this is the priority for all of us.
<P>
	We on this side of the House are trying to work in some 
concrete ways in addressing this problem. I think it is important 
for Canadians to understand that, because it is easy to create the 
perception in the public's eye that not a heck of a lot happens in 
Ottawa and in this House of Commons.
<P>
	We stated during the last election that the greatest hope for 
putting Canadians back to work rests with the small and medium 
sized business community. Not only on this side but all members 
have been working very hard in the industry committee on a 
study called access to capital for small business which 
essentially will challenge the banks to become more 
accountable in their actions toward small business.
<P>
	That report hopefully will be tabled in this House in the not 
too distant future for all of us to debate. Members from all 
parties worked on that report, not just for the last six months but 
during the summer. It is in its final edit stages. Canadians should 
know that commitment of challenging the banks, that report 
which we said in the last budget we would undertake, is very 
close to becoming a public document for all of us to debate. I 
think that is important.
<P>
	I would also like to remind Canadians that my colleague from 
Parry Sound-Muskoka worked all last spring with many other 
colleagues and they travelled every region of Ontario on an 
access to capital report. That report is in fact finished. It 
contains some fabulous recommendations. It is available to all 
Canadians. They just have to write to the office of the member 
for Muskoka-Parry Sound who has said repeatedly that he 
would be more than happy to send it out.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	In specific terms, small business needs capital if it is going to 
put people back to work. That is something concrete that we are 
working on.
<P>
	There is something else happening. I do not want for a second 
to suggest to the member for Yukon that what I am saying is 
enough. I do not think we are doing enough. I think we should be 
more accountable. It is important to show that we are doing 
some specific things.
<P>
	There is another thing we are working on in a very specific 
way. There is a joint Industry Canada-Finance Canada study on 
how to reduce the paper burden for small business. This is 
another reason why a lot of entrepreneurs have a feeling of 
frustration and are holding back. That study, which is being 
worked on, is something we must address in concrete terms.
<P>
	Another issue that Canadians want us to take on this fall 
especially as we head toward the next budget is the whole issue 
of tax reform. We have a system of taxation in this country that 
is inefficient, complex, and obviously not fair. I support many of 
the recommendations of the member for Yukon. She has talked 
about many of these issues over the last number of years. I 
believe that we have now reached a point in this House and in the 
country where Canadians are going to be pressing us harder than 
ever to deal with the whole issue of taxation.
<P>
	I believe taxation is an integral part of putting Canadians back 
to work. The harder you work, the more you make and the more 
you tend to want to invest or spend. The current tax system is a 
disincentive to investment and a disincentive to spending. In 
fact many of our best and brightest, our real achievers, are 
leaving our country. If they are not parking themselves offshore, 
they are parking their investment dollars offshore. Putting 
Canadians back to work and dealing with the very concrete and 
real numbers that the member for Yukon talked about in terms of 
deficit and debt costs cannot be done without dealing with the 
entire tax regime that exists in this country. That will be another 
one of our very important challenges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Let's get going on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Members are saying 
let's get going. It is the first day back from the summer recess 
and we are going. We have a tremendous turnout of interested 
members this morning. It is Monday morning and we are going 
at it. I am not asking you to be patient. In fact, I hope you keep 
pressing harder than ever. I think members are raising a very 
important point. This is the sense of urgency.
<P>
	I was working on a project this summer in the Toronto 
waterfront corridor. According to provincial studies-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> A casino.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Yes, a casino was 
included as one factor in the equation. It was only 2 per cent of 
it. Last week some municipal politicians were saying that we are 
too aggressive in our actions in trying to get this project going. I 
do not know how you can be too aggressive in trying to put 
people to work, especially when you come from a city where 
there are close to 400,000 out of work.
<P>
	That deals with my final point. We as members of Parliament 
have to understand the sense of urgency that Canadians feel. It is 
something that we really must address.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I know that in the private sector when times are tough you 
work two shifts a day. Sometimes you work six or seven days a 
week. Not only in this government but at all levels of 
government we should possibly consider setting up a public 
service 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5791"> 5791 </A></B>
<P>
arrangement where they work two shifts a day, seven days a 
week, not unlike the way members of Parliament work.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on this bill. I join the hon. member for 
Yukon in her sincere desire that no Canadian ever have to suffer 
the anxiety and the stress of being unable to find a good job with 
a good income sufficient to provide for themselves and their 
family. I commend her for her compassion and for wishing to 
devise a way to relieve this and other difficulties faced by all too 
many of our citizens.
<P>
	Unfortunately the measure she is proposing in the bill before 
this House today simply cannot achieve this ideal. It would be 
wonderful if people through their elected representatives could 
by putting the right words on paper eliminate difficulties and 
uncertainty in the economic, political and social spheres of our 
society. In my view it does not work that way. That view is based 
on observations of government actions both past and present, 
some in our own country.
<P>
	Creating a state bureaucracy which will somehow create jobs 
for everyone is certainly not a new idea. The well known slogan 
of the old Soviet Union was: ``From each according to his 
ability, to each according to his need''. What that led to was 
summarized in the typical black humour of the Polish workers 
who used to say: ``We pretend to work and the government 
pretends to pay us''.
<P>
	To suggest to Canadians that governments owe them jobs or 
are even capable of providing them with jobs in every case 
would be a cruel deception. This is particularly true for this 
government, already over half a trillion dollars in debt and 
spending $41 billion and rising every single year just on interest 
on that debt.
<P>
	The tax burden on working Canadians simply to sustain the 
present level of spending is already a crushing load. Where will 
the money come from to create the ministry of plenty envisioned 
in this bill? Governments have no money of their own. They 
must work with money taken from citizens. Even if they 
recovered some revenue in the form of taxes this proposal would 
still require an enormous additional expenditure in terms of the 
bureaucratic handling fee that would be made necessary by this 
new initiative.
<P>
	If government programs, spending, borrowing for more 
programs and increasing tax grabs to fund it all could give 
people jobs, there would be enough programs and spending in 
Canada to give every single citizen three jobs. It has not worked 
out that way.
<P>
	Since big government, big government programs and 
interference in the economy are what have brought us to today's 
fiscal mess I am frankly amazed that anyone would be 
advocating more of the same today.
<P>
	Allow me to outline some of the obvious flaws in this bill. 
Clause 3 of this legislative proposal calls for governments to 
give priority to the undertaking of sufficient measures to 
achieve full employment in Canada and establish programs that 
ensure that employment opportunities are available to all adult 
Canadians who seek work.
<P>
	These suggestions are vague and they are optimistic. The 
shortage of specifics with intent to achieve idealistic goals 
seems to infer that the government should spend tax dollars to 
create employment without creating wealth or economic growth 
to support it.
<P>
	It seems to me that we have tried these measures before in 
countless forms throughout our history without creating any 
possibility for long term employment. The most recent example 
is this government's initiative to assist unemployed Canadian 
youth. These programs amount to a redistribution of tax dollars 
to our young people in exchange for performing routine tasks. It 
does nothing to give them long term jobs and skills.
<P>
	The premier of Ontario tried to spend his way out of 
recessionary times during his first year in office. We know the 
results there. This type of mentality has already plunged Canada 
to the brink of fiscal collapse. Investor confidence has weakened 
and with it has come a loss of jobs and a shaky economy.
<P>
	High interest rates are another result of this type of 
government policy. The vicious spiral of government spending 
leads to a high level of taxation which in turn contributes to 
inflation which stifles entrepreneurship.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	The best way to create employment and thus achieve this 
bill's objectives is to eliminate government waste, remove 
barriers and regulations that hinder commerce, cut spending and 
reduce taxes. In this environment there would be a streamlined 
bureaucracy serving the real needs of Canadian entrepreneurs. 
Canadians would have more money left in their pockets to start 
and build businesses and there would be enough profit left to 
make their work and risk worthwhile. Only when individuals are 
prepared to risk their own capital can we expect to have a strong 
and vibrant economy.
<P>
	Studies have shown and indeed the hon. member opposite just 
mentioned that an enormous percentage of real long term jobs 
are created by a healthy small business sector.
<P>
	We need to get government off the backs of people and keep 
governments' demands from obstructing their dreams and work. 
There is no need to further encumber the people of Canada with 
yet another government department and still more regulations to 
stimulate employment.
<P>
	This bill also calls for a draft plan that will include an 
estimate of the number of jobs expected to be created in Canada 
as a result of the plan and a timetable for its implementation and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5792"> 5792 </A></B>
<P>
for the achievement of full  employment. This suggestion poses 
some very serious questions.
<P>
	First, experience has amply demonstrated that governments 
by their nature cannot be trusted to forecast the economic 
capacity of a free market. Their attempts to do so have only led 
to some type of a planned economy. I am sure we are all aware of 
the outcome of such strategies as practised in other countries.
<P>
	The omniscient role for government as advocated by this 
proposal would be best replaced by enhancing the resources of 
the private sector which has the most at stake. Other countries 
have recognized that economic decision making must be centred 
not on periodic pronouncements and decrees from a distant 
bureaucracy. This type of top-down policy would only cost 
Canadians jobs by stifling initiatives and creating obstacles.
<P>
	There is a need for government policies that promote 
competition and choice. This would foster a market culture 
predicated on efficiency and ingenuity. These in turn will 
generate more activity in the marketplace which will create 
more jobs. It would be of great benefit if government was more 
user friendly and more accessible. Canadians want more 
personal responsibility and less imposed government 
dependency.
<P>
	This bill's plan unfortunately seeks the opposite. Every able 
and willing Canadian should be able to find suitable 
employment but that can only happen when the nation's wealth 
is left in the hands of entrepreneurs, investors and business 
people rather than taken from them to be spent by bureaucrats, 
politicians and grant recipients.
<P>
	Clause 6 of this bill itemizes 22 regulatory protectionist or 
expenditure related measures which the sponsors hope will 
ensure full employment. Most disturbing of all is the 
consideration of the establishment of a department of full 
employment that would include a mandate to achieve full 
employment. It is almost incredible that as our fiscal crisis 
looms larger, ideas involving yet another increase in 
government spending and thus an increased tax burden are still 
being promoted.
<P>
	Still others of these measures would close doors to Canadian 
drugs and restrict our markets to imports. To tie this all together, 
an intricate web of new agencies would also be created to carry 
out the policies.
<P>
	What fascinates me is that there is no mention of where the 
funds would come from to realize these goals. This is one of the 
best examples of a recipe for disaster. We must instead 
strengthen co-operation between business, government and 
labour to ensure sustainable environmental development, the 
development of training programs which will meet the real 
demands of industry and work for tax relief and reform.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports a general program of expenditure 
reduction, not increase, leading to a lower level of taxation, a 
lower cost of doing business and a lower cost of living. We need 
to get the deficit and debt under firm control while reforming the 
tax system in  order to create a level playing field which would 
allow private initiatives to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	To this end we will work toward a simple, visible and flat 
taxation system. I was glad to hear the member opposite support 
that in the speech before me. Investment consumer confidence 
in a market economy are directly related to the cost of 
participation. Canadians should be allowed to spend their hard 
earned dollars as they see fit, not in funding endless government 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-209 reads like another attempt at a 
planned economy which historically has never achieved its 
objectives. This legislative proposal does not allow society to 
harness the initiative of individuals. It creates structure and 
dependency, trade, profit-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1) the order is dropped 
from the Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONACT">IMMIGRATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration)</B> moved that Bill C-44, an act to amend the 
Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act and to make a 
consequential amendment to the Customs Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, a warm welcome to my colleagues 
on all sides of the House as we get back to school, as it were, 
today.
<P>
	Whether our ancestors landed by boat in Montreal or touched 
down at Vancouver International Airport, we are for the most 
part a nation of immigrants. Of course there were people here 
before the boats and the planes arrived, but since the beginning 
Canada has been the rainbow for those looking for a new way of 
life, indeed a new lease on life, and Canada has not let them 
down for Canada has been a rainbow for those new hopes, of 
those new aspirations and of those new dreams.
<P>
	We must admit there is a bit of rust on that rainbow for a 
criminal element has infiltrated an immigration system that was 
built on hard work, hope, faith and justice. The actions of a small 
group of people are causing Canadians to question the very 
limits and the very merits of a system that has done much to 
build our nation as we know it. In short, the deeds of a few have 
cast a shadow over the reputations of many.
<P>
	Immigration has provided the very lifeblood of our country. It 
was the immigrants that carved our forests, worked in our 
factories, raised our skyscrapers in our cities and provided our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5793"> 5793 </A></B>
<P>
jobs. They did it yesterday. They do it today and we are 
confident they will continue to do it tomorrow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments to the Immigration Act that we are dealing 
with today in Bill C-44 are designed to help get the undesirables 
out of the system and put some of the gleam back in the rainbow. 
Abuse of the system by a few has been cause for alarm. While 
the numbers of those causing the problem are small, the damage 
they have done is large.
<P>
	We have read the reports, heard the stories, seen the pictures 
or maybe even attended a funeral. A criminal minority has used 
the immigration system to its own advantage. There has been 
slow enforcement and some of us have watched with growing 
anger while a justice and immigration appeals system was used 
as a stalling tactic to delay departure orders.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	The problem of immigration enforcement is not unique to 
Canada. It did not start with this government or even the 
previous one. Instead it is a worldwide problem. To the south our 
neighbour has ongoing and very well documented enforcement 
problems. When Cuban jails opened, for instance, Florida was 
inundated. Barbed wire and armed men guard the Rio Grande. 
Africa has witnessed war, pestilence and famine resulting in the 
vast migration of peoples. Only a tiny portion of that 
tremendous movement of people comes to our shore, but it is 
significant nonetheless.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Last year almost 110 million people in Canada came through 
primary inspection points at our points of entry. In 1993-94 
immigration officials examined over 3 million in detail, handled 
more than 100,000 immigration applications, conducted over 
30,000 investigations and removed at the end some 9,000 people 
from Canada. In 1993 at the same time we also admitted some 
81,000 skilled and/or business workers, some 24,000 refugees 
and reunited 134,000 people with their families.
<P>
	We cannot and should not dismiss what is happening as a 
global phenomenon or excuse it as inevitable when large 
numbers of people overwhelm a system. When even a small 
number slip through with false papers, lies or simple 
misdirection they can cause tremendous pain and suffering, not 
to mention a backlash on the entire immigrant and refugee 
community.
<P>
	It is a Canadian problem that demands a Canadian answer. 
Now is the time to face the issue and to provide Canadians with 
the answers.
<P>
	We have before us today an accountability session in a 
legislative form for both the government and members of 
Parliament on all sides of the House. A number of MPs, as they 
should, here today pride themselves on listening to their 
constituents. I hope they have been listening hard because I too 
have been doing a lot of listening. I know Canadians expect their 
members of Parliament, all members of Parliament regardless 
of their political affiliation, to move swiftly with this bill and 
get it right.
<P>
	I hear immigrants and refugees telling us and the government 
to stop that tiny minority of criminals from reflecting badly on 
everybody else. I hear police chiefs and police officers telling us 
and the government to change the law to ensure that it is the 
innocent that are protected, and not the other way around.
<P>
	I hear, as does my government, people from all across Canada 
telling us to prevent foreign criminals from infiltrating our 
country disguised as legitimate immigrants or legitimate 
refugees.
<P>
	If we do not deal swiftly and crisply with both the perception 
and the reality of abuses to our immigration and refugee system, 
the integrity of the entire process is in jeopardy. When drug 
dealers or other thugs slip through the cracks of the enforcement 
or screening net they discredit a program that has made Canada 
the envy of the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So it is up to us to fix it. We do not have to take the system 
apart. We do not have to stop having one of the most progressive 
immigration and refugee policies in the world. We simply have 
to fix the system and make it tougher for criminals to claim they 
are refugees and to prevent thugs from using red tape or 
muddled intra-government communications to extend their stay 
in Canada.
<P>
	When it comes to enforcement of immigration issues, we have 
to do a better job. The public expects better, the public deserves 
better, and the public will get better enforcement of immigration 
issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In a moment we can discuss how better enforcement 
procedures have already started to take place, but the 
amendments to the Immigration Act before the House are legal 
arrows for an enforcement quiver. The amendments help protect 
the true refugee and the average law-abiding immigrant should 
has no fear of Bill C-44. However the felon that has mistaken 
Canadian hospitality for a chance to loot the bill will find the 
doors to our country swing both ways. By strengthening the 
integrity of the system we will go a very long way toward 
restoring public trust and take ourselves further down the road 
toward building a better and a safer Canada. When the House 
approves these amendments I believe we will see a significant 
improvement in our enforcement procedures and the speed in 
which we can remove foreign criminals from our soil.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5794"> 5794 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The bill before us presents amendments in more than a dozen 
areas. I would like simply to touch on a number of them that are 
more significant in terms of their impact on the current system. 
Among those are amendments that would stop serious criminals 
from claiming refugee status simply to delay their removal from 
Canada.
<P>
	The legislation will put an end to the ridiculous spectacle, for 
instance, of an immigration and refugee board having to troop 
off to Kingston penitentiary to listen to a convicted murderer 
claiming refugee status. Average Canadians, average members 
of Parliament, know that is an abuse. However under current 
legislation the IRB is mandated and has no option but to respond 
to such a claim for refugee status.
<P>
	I submit, as does my government, our refugee laws were not 
put in place to promote that kind of a claim. Rather, those laws 
are there to protect the legitimate fears of persecution for which 
Canada has won a Nansen medal, the only country and the only 
people on the globe to receive that distinction.
<P>
	At the same time Bill C-44 will permit us to remove the most 
serious and dangerous criminal from a refugee process that may 
have already been commenced. If the system found either a 
serious act of criminality abroad or in Canada and the process 
had started the system was incapable of doing anything about it. 
Under Bill C-44 the amendments would provide that where 
warranted the system would be able to remove an individual 
from the refugee process and place the individual before an 
immigration inquiry to deal with the act of serious criminality.
<P>
	I believe this is a common sense change. The system is not 
designed to protect the serious criminal. Nor should it be built 
on incapability of reacting to information once it is discovered 
by our officials. The time and energy spent dealing with serious 
criminals slows down the response of the IRB to real problems 
facing real refugees. That is why we have chosen to act.
<P>
	When approved the bill will take away the power of the 
immigration appeal division to allow major criminals to remain 
in Canada on so-called humanitarian or compassionate grounds. 
I underline this is not a restriction of rights; it is more a matter of 
accountability. I also underline this is not an overreaction to a 
few isolated incidents. Instead it is a reality of the world in 
which we live. We should never forget the goal is to ensure that 
the interests of Canadians are protected.
<P>
	The public across the country wants some balance of the 
scales of justice in a certain sense, in a common sense and in a 
fair and equitable way.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	People want a sense of protection offered to those who seek it. 
At the same time, when someone contravenes that tolerance and 
crosses over the letter of the law, then there is a public that 
expects some kind of balance and some kind of accountability 
rather than a system that is indifferent to it, rendering a public 
that is frustrated, cynical and indifferent.
<P>
	The minister and the government and indeed Parliament must 
deal with the consequences of any decision to allow a serious 
criminal to stay in Canada for either humanitarian or 
compassionate reasons. I believe it is both appropriate and 
reasonable that the minister and senior officials of the 
department make that decision.
<P>
	The immigration appeal division will continue to have 
jurisdiction for all individuals on questions of law and fact. 
What we are trying to address is the accountability that the 
Canadian public demands of us and of its systems. As the law 
stands now, there is nothing to stop the citizenship process even 
though a person may be subjected to an immigration enquiry.
<P>
	If citizenship is obtained the person cannot be deported. Once 
again we have tried to reflect the feeling of the public that 
clearly this is not in the best interest of the system. The right 
hand must know what the left hand is doing in government. Why 
should a citizenship process continue to move blindly on 
without due recognition for an immigration enquiry which may 
or may not be serious?
<P>
	This bill automatically stops the citizenship process until the 
immigration inquiry resolves the matter for which that enquiry 
was caused. The bottom line once again is the protection of our 
interest and the safety of our country and Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Other changes mean that two summary convictions-in 
Canada or elsewhere-will make anyone ineligible to be an 
immigrant to Canada.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me stress that we are talking about crimes 
as measured by Canadian legal standards and not political 
persecution for what some foreign regimes might attempt to 
disguise as a crime.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-44 would also give immigration officers the authority 
to seize documents from international mail such as passports, 
driver's licences and credit cards which could and are being 
used to circumvent immigration requirements or forge 
documents. This amendment does not apply to domestic mail 
and is limited to packages weighing more than 30 grams.
<P>
	There is absolutely no question that the mails are being used 
to forward identity documents. We would expect the volume to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5795"> 5795 </A></B>
<P>
drop as soon as these amendments are passed. Last year in 
Toronto, for instance, about 70 packages containing status or 
identity documents were being located every week. In Montreal 
the volume was  approximately 10 packages. In Vancouver 
officials found roughly 25.
<P>
	This flows from a common sense application. Some months 
ago there was a <I>Globe and Mail</I> article that discovered officials 
from the Department of Justice telling officials from customs 
and immigration that they were in violation of the law for 
basically defending our borders through the interdiction of 
certain mail and fraudulent documentation.
<P>
	We have moved to bring the law up to speed in order to render 
the system more accountable to its citizens. The amendments 
will also allow arrest warrants to be issued for no shows at 
immigration hearings and will provide an immediate loss of 
permanent resident status with all removal orders and not some 
of them.
<P>
	It will also eliminate the possibility for any one person to have 
more than one refugee claim processed at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Why should that be any different? We have a good system and 
people should have one kick at that good system rather than 
taxing the system and taking away a place for another legitimate 
individual.
<P>
	The legislation will also authorize the minister or his officials 
to approve or reject requests for rehabilitation rather than 
having the matters go to a full cabinet. In plain language this 
cuts down the rubber stamp aspect of rehabilitation and treats 
each individual on their proper merits. This will be far more cost 
effective, cut back the time needed to make a decision and 
prevent the issue and the individual from getting buried in a 
much larger cabinet agenda.
<P>
	As I mentioned at the outset, there are other elements of bill 
C-44 that are very positive, valuable and worth supporting. I 
hope we will have an opportunity to discuss these issues not only 
in debate form in the House of Commons but with careful 
scrutiny in committee following second reading.
<P>
	There are also other elements to limiting abuse within our 
immigration and refugee network that do not fall under any act 
or legislation. In this regard I believe it is important for all of us 
to remember that C-44 should not be seen in isolation but 
instead should be seen as a part of a more comprehensive 
package of initiatives to try to come to grips with the minority of 
those who wish to abuse the right of the many. Some of the fixes 
simply mean bolstering internal procedures and changing 
priorities.
<P>
	Enforcement of immigration issues have been tightened and 
toughened in recent months. As always we remain cognizant of 
the rights of the individuals of due process upon which our 
society is firmly founded.
<P>
	Our government has already started to streamline its own 
administrative system. Immigration has speeded and 
strengthened its liaison with the correctional services of Canada 
so that foreign offenders will have fewer opportunities to stay in 
Canada after they have served their time in jail or prison. Once 
again common sense dictates. Why was it not in place years 
before now, that somehow immigration Canada was more in 
sync with corrections Canada so that when those individuals 
were released from our provincial or federal facilities they could 
be deported?
<P>
	Why is it that those individuals serving time in our 
penitentiaries who ultimately will be deported or served 
deportation orders enjoy day parole? That is an issue I have 
raised with the Solicitor General and with my colleague, the 
Minister of Justice. Again it flows from common sense. If there 
are individuals who are deportable upon completion of time in 
prison, why is day parole instituted for those individuals as 
well? They are not easing into the community. They are easing 
out of Canada. Therefore I question why day parole should be 
applied to those individuals.
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of Justice, has also made a 
commitment that the parliamentary committee when reviewing 
the Young Offenders Act as part of that mandate will also look at 
how the Young Offenders Act will apply to those young 
individuals within our country facing deportation. Again, this 
not a knee-jerk reaction but a studied reaction in this case 
together with the other issues that certainly will draw the 
attention of that committee.
<P>
	Enforcement is a priority of my department. It is not an 
obsession of my department, it is a priority; a priority that is 
roughly 10 per cent of our budget which translates roughly into 
$56 million for the year 1994-95.
<P>
	Our system for blocking the entry of criminals has been for 
the most part been vigilant and effective. Last spring a special 
operations unit was set up, targeting members of organized 
crime groups and geared to improving our ability to prevent 
them from entering Canada.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	For this purpose we have focused on Asian gangs, the triads, 
and the yakuza, as well as gangs from Russia and the Caribbean.
<P>
	I am sure members are also aware of the special joint task 
force involving immigration officials, members of local and 
regional police forces, as well as provincial and RCMP forces. 
They have operational units in Toronto, Montreal and 
Vancouver, and their prime directive is to remove foreign 
criminals from our midst.
<P>
	I believe that the concept of the joint force is the right 
approach, not because this minister or this government has 
deemed it so on July 7, but because in leading up to that decision 
we discussed the whole concept of the joint force with those who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5796"> 5796 </A></B>
<P>
knew best, the police officers and  police chiefs whose mandate 
it is to serve and protect us and our communities.
<P>
	I hope we have the patience for this force to be allowed to do 
its job and as I mentioned in Montreal last month to the police 
chiefs association there are two things that can endanger this 
type of joint force. One is jurisdictional squabbling which has 
not been the case, and I take my hat off to the four different 
forces that have converged in the joint forces. The second aspect 
is the whole thirst or appetite for what I would refer to as number 
crunching or bean counting. At the end of the day the mandate of 
this force is to get the job done, but also not to ask these 
professionals things that are also irresponsible of some of those 
who ask it of them in order to say how many did you get today, 
how many did you get this week, did you get them all last week.
<P>
	The mandate is a very difficult one for these individuals but 
they are professionals and they will get the job done. In the 
United States the joint force concept has run into problems for 
those two reasons. It is my hope, not for the short term but for 
the long term, that we allow this force to work and not only work 
in terms of removing the individuals that we all believe ought to 
be removed but also to render us through the experience and the 
information that they will get in how enforcement is best done 
and by whom.
<P>
	If the professionals come back and tell this Parliament that 
enforcement is more of a policing discipline and not an 
immigration one, then so be it. Let us answer the riddle once and 
for all but let us allow those professionals to do the job they are 
capable of doing.
<P>
	There may be other improvements that we can usher in to the 
system and one such recommendation for instance coming from 
some of the police chiefs is to permit judges to not recommend 
deportations at the time of giving sentence but to order 
deportations at the time of sentencing so that the system is 
leaner, so that the issues of that individual are all dealt with at 
the right time, and that there is full due process for the 
individual's counsel and lawyer to react to that judge's ordering 
of a deportation rather than recommending and then having it go 
back to immigration and before an immigration appeal division 
and so on.
<P>
	That will necessitate not a change in my act but a change in the 
Criminal Code. As parliamentarians we should be interested in 
this issue and prepared also to look at making the relevant 
amendments if we think those amendments will work and if we 
think those amendments are fair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There have been difficulties with some removals from Canada 
to some countries because of problems obtaining foreign travel 
documentation. Senior officials are dealing with this problem 
and it will be resolved soon.
<P>
	The immigration department is continuing to step up its 
international efforts to prevent undesirables from entering the 
country and is working closely with the RCMP and a number of 
foreign control authorities and in partnership with airlines.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having acknowledged the problem and having attempted to 
define the scope of the problem, there is certainly something 
else to be said. If we do not deal with these issues now in the 
light of day, there are those who would appeal to the darker side 
of our character and use the excuse of public safety to cloak a 
negative and hurtful agenda aimed at shutting off all 
immigration. I say and my government says that we cannot 
allow this any more than we can allow criminals to wipe their 
feet on our welcome mat.
<P>
	It is important that every one of us in this Chamber work 
toward exploding the myths surrounding our immigration and 
refugee process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yes, there are problems and I have just acknowledged what 
some of them are. But to those who claim that immigrants are 
bilking our welfare system, we have to say that this simply is not 
so.
<P>
	Statistics show that native-born Canadians are more likely to 
use the social assistance safety net than are immigrants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For those who fear we are in the icy grip of an immigration 
crime wave, we have to tell them and those individuals among us 
that this too is far from reality.
<P>
	A recent research paper prepared for a law conference at 
Carleton University in our capital said bluntly that immigrants 
were under represented in the criminal population. Researchers 
found that the so-called immigrant crime appeared primarily to 
be less serious crime. Social scientists say that a likely 
explanation for this so-called under representation among the 
criminal element is due in some part to the screening process 
that takes place before the immigrant arrives on our shores.
<P>
	I also know equally that it is difficult and sometimes 
impossible to compare the dull, dry figures from a research 
paper with the heartache and anger that comes with the story at 
the top of our supper time news. As parliamentarians we must 
stress again and again that there is a lot more to immigration 
than a news story about a thief in the corner store, as important 
as that is, to the safety of all our neighbourhoods and 
communities.
<P>
	Look over your back fence. What do you see? The chances are 
you see a neighbour who is an immigrant or is a son or daughter 
of an immigrant. I see the crime stories in my clipping service 
every day at 6.30 in the morning but I do not hear quite so often 
stories about people like Kim Loan Hua. Who is Kim? She is an 
immigrant. She came here penniless in 1979 as part of  the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5797"> 5797 </A></B>
<P>
100,000 Vietnamese boat people Canada received. She was one 
of those. She has now opened four restaurants in Toronto and 
employs over 20 people. Kim was a refugee and is now a 
Canadian entrepreneur.
<P>
	What about Shan Chandrasekar? He came from India. He 
overstayed. He obtained permission years ago to be able to stay 
legally in Canada and in the process founded a television 
network to serve the Canadian-Asian community.
<P>
	What does that say? It says that for every criminal named in 
the press with an immigrant tag we can give 10,000 cases of 
immigrants and recent Canadians who are anything but a 
problem for or a drain on the country and who despise the antics 
of troublemakers and the lawlessness of hooligans as much as 
anyone in this Chamber.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Are we courageous enough to say so? How about the guy who 
coaches your kid's little league? Some of our Nobel prize 
winners have been immigrants. Our novelists, opera stars, 
painters, politicians, teachers and even some of our best 
journalists were not born in this country.
<P>
	When we hear the word immigrant we should not 
automatically think crime. We also should not automatically 
think superstar either. Instead we should think of a neighbour, of 
a colleague, of a husband or a wife.
<P>
	When I met with the Canadian association of chiefs of police 
last month, I told them I expected speedy passage of this 
legislation. I reiterated that this morning because we must act 
decisively and expeditiously. The law must be changed quickly 
in light of the public concern for the well-being of our 
immigration refugee system.
<P>
	I am convinced that this legislation will go a long way in 
protecting those so close to us from the stigma of criminality 
brought on by a tiny minority who have slipped through the 
cracks. Madam Speaker and colleagues, let us get on with it and 
seal up those cracks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Madam Speaker, this is my 
first speech in the House today, after the summer recess. Before 
speaking to Bill C-44, however, I would like to congratulate the 
Parti Quebecois on its splendid victory on September 12, and 
also the new Premier of Quebec, Mr. Jacques Parizeau, a man 
with the stature of a true statesman.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate the 77 members elected for the 
Parti québécois, the 47 members of the Quebec Liberal Party 
and Mr. Mario Dumont, leader of Action Démocratique. Some, 
like myself, belong to the ethnic community.
<P>
	I will now speak in this debate on second reading of Bill C-44, 
which proposes to amend the Immigration Act, the Citizenship 
Act and the Customs Act. These amendments, according to the 
authors of the bill, concern 14 specific points. For instance, 
some changes will have the effect of stopping a person convicted 
of a major crime-that is, punishable by a maximum prison term 
of 10 years-in Canada or outside Canada, from claiming 
refugee status to delay his removal from Canada. Immigration 
officers will have the power to seize from international mail 
documents that could be used for fraudulent purposes. In the 
case of serious criminals, the Immigration Appeal Division will 
no longer have the power to allow appeals on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds.
<P>
	Grounds for appeals before the Immigration Appeal Division 
will from now on be limited to questions of law and fact. A 
person for whose arrest a warrant has been signed by the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Solicitor 
General of Canada, because he represents a threat to public 
safety, will lose the right to appeal.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Processing of an application for citizenship may be 
suspended, pending the outcome of immigration proceedings. A 
person convicted of two summary conviction offences-a minor 
offence punishable by a prison term of not more than six 
months-whether the offences were committed in Canada or 
outside Canada, may be prevented from immigrating to Canada. 
The minister, instead of the Governor in Council, will have the 
authority to approve requests for admission on the basis of 
rehabilitation, and the minister may delegate this authority to 
employees of the department. The obligation to conduct a new 
inquiry in the case of a person who has been ordered to leave 
Canada has been removed, so that a person loses permanent 
resident status as soon as he is ordered deported.
<P>
	We in the Bloc québécois agree with the general, underlying 
principles of Bill C-44, that is to say, the government has the 
right and a duty to protect Canada and all Canadians against 
criminals. We agree with preventing immigrants and claimants 
from taking advantage of Canada's reputation as a host country 
to leave their country of origin where they have committed 
serious crimes.
<P>
	We must eliminate or at least reduce the ways in which 
immigrant refugee claimants who have been convicted of 
serious crimes can stay in Canada legally.
<P>
	We agree with restricting the admissibility of convicted 
criminals. We must ensure that serious criminals who manage to 
escape removal are deported as soon as possible. In 1993, 
Immigration Canada deported 1,200 criminals; between January 
1 and May 31, 1994, 600 criminals were deported. This effort 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5798"> 5798 </A></B>
<P>
must be pursued for the safety of the people of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	We have many more questions and concerns regarding Bill 
C-44. This bill is an excessive response to certain problems and 
situations that have arisen over the past few months in Canada. 
It is the Liberal government's response to the strict, right-wing 
stand the Reform Party has taken concerning immigrants and 
refugees.
<P>
	The minister's speech today only confirms this shift to the 
right the minister and the Liberal Party have made. I have read 
the speech he had made as the Official Opposition Critic for 
Immigration. He was much more of a humanist back then. I 
endorsed his ideas and objectives in those days, but not any 
more.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has condemned and still condemns the 
murder of a young woman in a Toronto restaurant and that of a 
Toronto police officer. The unfortunate fact about these two 
murders is that they were committed by immigrants subject to a 
deportation order. The media gave far too much notoriety to 
these incidents.
<P>
	On July 7, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
launched a blitz to deport out of Canada some 600 criminal 
immigrants. To this effect, he set up a special task force of 
immigration officers and members of the RCMP and the local 
police, to identify, trace and hasten the expulsion of foreign 
criminals from Canada.
<P>
	Based on information from <I>La Presse</I>, this special task force 
has found, after going over the various cases, that only 90 of the 
600 immigrants with serious criminal records were in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	It also found that half, or 45, of them were already in jail. 
Seven of the 45 still at large had left Canada of their own free 
will. Of the 38 cases remaining, 5 have been resolved; three 
criminals had been arrested and deported, and the other two had 
been summoned before an immigration officer. As of July 19, in 
Quebec, there were only 33 cases pending and as we speak, I 
trust these too have been settled.
<P>
	The special task force was manned by 4 RCMP officers in 
both Montreal and Vancouver and by 12 officers in Toronto. In 
addition to creating this group, the Standing Committee on 
Justice is reviewing the question of how young offenders who 
are not Canadian citizens and who have been convicted of 
crimes should be treated. Finally, a memorandum of 
understanding was signed between the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration and Correctional Service Canada 
for expediting the deportation of foreign criminals.
<P>
	Again, we urge the government to take the measures required 
to prevent abuses and protect Canadians and Quebecers against 
criminals, but we cannot endorse Bill C-44 as it now stands.
<P>
	In our opinion, some provisions of this bill violate the Geneva 
Convention on Refugees as well as the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. Furthermore, it restricts without 
justification the mandate of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board.
<P>
	Unlike the Geneva convention, this bill does not distinguish 
between refugee claimants who have committed political crimes 
in their native countries and those convicted of non-political 
crimes. In determining refugee status, the first thing to be 
considered should be the nature and purpose of the offence, in 
particular whether it was committed for political or other 
reasons.
<P>
	On the other hand, there should be a certain balance between 
the seriousness of the crime and the danger to Canadian society. 
The Geneva convention, confirmed by Federal Court 
jurisprudence, states that this element of comparison must be 
considered.
<P>
	Professor James Hathaway writes that the seriousness of the 
crime must also be weighed against the possibility that the life 
or safety of a person sent back to his or her native country may 
be at risk. The bill does not address this aspect of the issue.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to prevent people convicted of 
serious offences for which a term of imprisonment of ten years 
or more may be imposed from claiming refugee status. This 
means that the actual seriousness of the offence will not be taken 
into account, which we think is unfair and arbitrary.
<P>
	In our opinion, the actual sentence imposed and not the 
maximum sentence should be considered. Every offence can be 
committed in a great variety of circumstances, some of which 
call for the maximum sentence while others only call for the 
minimum sentence. Our Criminal Code does not specify a 
minimum sentence for most offences. Therefore, a person could 
be convicted of a crime for which a term of imprisonment of ten 
years or more may be imposed without being jailed or fined.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	He would only be given a suspended sentence or put on 
probation. Despite all that, the minister can issue a certificate 
declaring that person to be a public danger, which I think is 
unfair and arbitrary.
<P>
	This situation could violate the Geneva convention. Indeed, 
the manual of the High Commissioner for Refugees says that in 
evaluating the nature of the crime allegedly committed, all 
relevant factors, including extenuating circumstances, must be 
considered. Do not forget that we are talking about refugees 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5799"> 5799 </A></B>
<P>
here, human beings for whom being deported to their country 
could be very dangerous in some cases and even fatal.
<P>
	Under the bill, many decisions that were made by the IRB will 
now be made by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
and his officials. Despite all the criticisms we have of the IRB 
and the mistakes it has made, I prefer that tribunal to be fully in 
charge of determining refugee status. It is a quasi-judicial 
specialized tribunal, whose duty it is to hear the parties. The 
minister's decision is purely administrative and often politically 
motivated. Thus, many decisions will be based solely on foreign 
policy considerations and the state of relations between Canada 
and the refugee claimant's country of origin. We think that Bill 
C-44 is a government attack on the IRB's independence.
<P>
	Obviously the minister did not like some of this 
administrative tribunal's decisions. So what does he do? He 
removes a large part of its jurisdiction. This is a blatant 
contradiction of the Davis-Waldman report, which the minister 
said reduced the need for him to intervene in the refugee 
determination process. Bill C-44 does the opposite and 
considerably increases the minister's involvement in this field. 
It prevents not only refugees but also permanent residents who 
committed crimes outside Canada from going to the IRB. This 
bill must be denounced, for it attacks one of the fundamental 
principles of our legal system, namely the right of appeal. It 
takes away the right to appeal to the Immigration Appeals 
Division for humanitarian considerations following a 
deportation order based on the commission in Canada or abroad 
of a crime punishable by ten or more years in prison.
<P>
	The Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to all. Basic 
rights to a fair and impartial procedure should also apply to 
foreigners. I agree with the position expressed by the Canadian 
Council for Refugees that refugees and permanent residents 
must be able to apply to the appeal division of the IRB.
<P>
	This bill is also contrary to the right of family reunification. 
In some cases, a person will be deported even though his whole 
family stays in Canada. It is really regrettable that this 
fundamental aspect of Canada's immigration policy, which is 
part of the program of the Liberal Party of Canada, is being 
attacked in this International Year of the Family. This might 
violate conventions signed by Canada, such as the convention 
against torture, the principles of the United Nations on arbitrary 
arrest and detention, the Geneva convention on human rights in 
wartime, the declaration on disappearance and missing persons, 
etc.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	In that context, the bill might also violate sections 7 and 12 of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom. I also oppose the 
provision which provides the right to search international mail 
and authorizes immigration officers to seize identification 
papers and other documents sent by international mail or other 
means, in an attempt to circumvent the Immigration Act. This 
could lead to abuse. It is to be noted that immigration  officers 
already have the authority to search those seeking to be admitted 
to Canada, as well as their baggage.
<P>
	The bill also authorizes immigration officers to request a 
warrant for the arrest of any person who does not appear at the 
meeting to which he was summoned. The police will arrest that 
person and his name will be filed at the Canadian Police 
Information Centre. Under normal circumstances, police will 
arrest a person only under the authority of a warrant delivered by 
a judge. We know that a person will often not show up because 
he moved and did not get the notification to appear. On 
September 13, I attended the National Conference on 
Immigration, in Ottawa. Working group no. 7, which was set up 
by the minister during the consultation process, looked at 
control and law enforcement, which are the issues dealt with in 
Bill C-44. Why did the minister not hold consultations before 
tabling this legislation?
<P>
	I am asking that this bill be referred for review by the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. Lawyers 
specializing in immigration law, as well as the organizations 
working in the field of immigration and with refugees, including 
the Canadian Council for Refugees, should have the opportunity 
to be heard by the committee. I am also very interested in 
hearing from the IRB. For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois 
will oppose this bill at second reading.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to raise other issues related to 
immigration and refugees. In Quebec, the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration closed four regional offices in July 
to concentrate all its services in a single centre located in 
Montreal. This decision must be strongly criticized and this is 
what we are doing today. We must oppose these closures which 
have resulted in lost jobs, in Quebec as well as in the rest of 
Canada. There is another problem I would like to mention, 
namely the new rates recently imposed by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration. Many people who were granted 
refugee status by the IRB are unable to pay $500 per adult and 
$100 per child to secure permanent residence in Canada. I made 
representations to the minister and his department in the hope of 
finding a solution to this problem but so far with little success. 
How can you demand immediate payment in the amount of 
$1,400 from a newly arrived family in a state of total despair and 
often without any money whatsoever?
<P>
	If I may digress for a moment, I would like to salute the 
employees of Ogilvie Mills Ltd, especially those of ethnic 
origin, who have been on strike since June 6 last. Located in 
Montreal, this mill manufactures Five Roses flour.

	Today, they are protesting on the Hill and I will meet with 
them later on. I take this opportunity not only to express my 
solidarity to them but also to ask the Minister of Human 
Resources Development to table a bill amending the federal 
Labour Code by including an anti-scab provision. Such a 
provision already exists in the Quebec Labour Code and is very 
successful.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As you well know, Madam Speaker, I came to Quebec in 1974 
following a military coup which took place in Chile on 
September 11, 1973. My wife, my two children, then five and 
three years old, myself and thousands of other Chileans were 
very well received by the people of Quebec who were 
profoundly generous. We worked and continue to work hard to 
ensure a better life for our children and our grandchildren and to 
make our contribution to the progress of this society.
<P>
	However, today I am profoundly sad because of this 
anti-immigrant sentiment in Canada and because of this 
anti-refugee sentiment in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is appearing in Canada as in rich nations all over the world.
<P>
	The contribution of immigrants to all sectors of the economic, 
social, cultural and even political life of this country is 
immeasurable.
<P>
	I am proud to have been elected, last October, to the House of 
Commons by a majority of francophones in Montreal-Nord, 
with the support of the labour movement and various 
ethno-cultural communities, twenty years after coming to this 
country. I am even prouder of the fact that my leader asked me to 
be our party critic for citizenship and immigration.
<P>
	I believe that this bill, even though it contains certain positive 
elements, will be perceived as linking immigration and criminal 
activities and will therefore exacerbate xenophobia and racism 
in Canada. Statistics clearly show that new immigrants are more 
law-abiding and that their crime rate is lower than that of 
Canadians by birth. This bears repeating.
<P>
	I ask the minister to immediately launch a comprehensive 
awareness and information campaign to apprise all Canadians of 
the facts regarding immigration including the benefits that flow 
from it, as well as the huge contribution immigrants have always 
made to this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to begin my evaluation of Bill C-44 by 
saying it is a small step in the right direction.
<P>
	For several years Canadians have been saying they have a 
deep concern about Canada's immigration system. These 
concerns have included the fact that many Canadians consider 
immigration levels to be too high. Other concerns are the skill 
and education levels of immigrants entering Canada and the 
effectiveness of the immigration department in enforcing 
government policy.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	If the Liberal government wants Canadians to place faith in 
the system and the elected officials who administer it then the 
government has a moral obligation to look at these concerns and 
to act in the interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	One of the chief concerns of Canadians in this area is the 
relationship between immigration and crime. In the past year 
there have been several high profile cases in which immigrants 
to Canada were involved in criminal activity which could have 
been avoided had proper action been taken. The result was an 
increased focus on the relationship between immigration and the 
criminal justice system.
<P>
	Confidential government documents leaked to the media 
revealed: ``There is a sense that the immigration program is out 
of control''. This is the public perception of Canadians who feel 
and again I quote: ``Immigrants need to be better selected''. 
Very clearly Canadians want to see changes in the way the 
immigration system in Canada operates.
<P>
	Perhaps not very surprising, this is the view that has been put 
forward by my Reform colleagues and I for some time. I believe 
this is because our party has a policy of first of all understanding 
the wishes and desires of grassroots Canadians. This means our 
party pays very close attention to what our constituents are 
telling us. They have been telling us for a long time now that 
they are losing faith in the immigration system because they 
believe it is being poorly administered and poorly enforced.
<P>
	I am pleased to see that the Liberal government is finally 
listening to the common sense solutions that the Reform Party 
has been putting forward on this issue for some time. As I 
mentioned before, I see the bill as a step in the right direction. 
But our party has chosen not to lend support to this bill for two 
main reasons.
<P>
	The first is that the legislation is not properly structured to 
keep immigrants with criminal backgrounds from entering into 
Canada's refugee system. The second is the fear that the Liberal 
government will use the passage of this legislation as an excuse 
to take no further action on the concerns the Canadian public has 
about the immigration process.
<P>
	This bill does take a step in the right direction. One of the 
elements of the bill which my party is in support of is that it 
empowers the senior immigration officers who are the first 
contact applicants have with the immigration system. The bill 
would allow these officers upon discovery of a criminal back-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5801"> 5801 </A></B>
<P>
ground to stop the processing  of an individual's application to 
enter into the immigration or refugee process.
<P>
	This will serve a number of purposes. It will save Canadian 
taxpayers money because they will not have to pay for the 
processing of cases which would be appropriately rejected in 
any case. It will save immigration officials time which can be 
better spent processing the claims of applicants without a 
criminal background. More time spent studying these routine 
applications means fraudulent claims are less likely to be 
approved, giving the immigration department more credibility 
in the eyes of Canadians. Finally, the measure makes the 
common sense move of protecting the Canadian public from 
foreign born criminals who want to come to our country. All of 
these are excellent goals.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this legislation does not go far enough to 
ensure they are achieved. The problem is that immigration 
officers are still not being given the tools to do their job. 
Officers now have the power to refuse to process applications if 
they discover a criminal background. At the same time, they are 
not being given the power to do background checks on those 
applicants. In fact it was recently revealed by a member of the 
Canada employment and immigration union that refugee 
claimants are not given security screenings before facing the 
refugee board. The proposed legislation gives the immigration 
officers necessary new powers but does not grant them the 
means to exercise them. An illustration of the problem was a 
news report by the Canadian Press published September 12. The 
report stated that there are very severe guidelines which restrict 
immigration officials as to what they may ask refugee 
claimants. The report also stated that this could mean people 
who should not get into Canada may be slipping past the 
immigration and refugee board.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Here are a few examples of those guidelines. Officials cannot 
request information from the immigration department about a 
refugee aside from identity papers and passports. This means 
officers cannot check statements made at a hearing against the 
claims made when the refugee first entered Canada. Officers 
cannot investigate claims through sources such as the police. 
Only board officials can now use public record sources.
<P>
	Officers may not press reluctant claimants for answers on 
particular issues because that could be perceived as being 
adversarial.
<P>
	The effect of this bill is to grant powers to officers without 
giving them means to exercise these powers. It would be like 
giving a highway patrolman the power to arrest speeders without 
allowing him to use radar to detect those speeders.
<P>
	This leads us to the second major reason why the Reform 
Party is opposing this bill. That reason is enforcement.
<P>
	One of the intentions of this bill is to detect problems early in 
a system so that deportation orders can be issued to those who do 
not qualify. However, as we have seen over the past year, there 
have been serious problems with those deportation orders.
<P>
	Several high profile cases have demonstrated that the issuing 
of deportation orders does not ensure removal. The numbers 
indicate that of 25,000 deportation orders last year, only 8,200 
were verifiably carried out. Despite the fact that 1,200 criminals 
were deported last year, 3,000 more deportable criminals 
disappeared and have not been found.
<P>
	Immigration enforcement officers are so overwhelmed by the 
sheer numbers of deportables that they are unable to execute a 
removal order unless the individual voluntarily turns up.
<P>
	In Toronto there are 30 enforcement officers charged with the 
execution of deportation orders or investigation of legal 
residency of 40,000 cases. More deportation orders will likely 
only increase the backlog rather than actually clear many more 
people out of the country.
<P>
	The greatest benefit of this legislation is that it would prevent 
some criminals from getting into the immigration and refugee 
system, but should the aim of the government not be a bit higher 
than this? A few simple changes could put some real teeth in this 
legislation.
<P>
	To begin with, how about granting more power to individual 
immigration officers? This would mean giving them the power 
to do background checks and giving them greater access to data 
banks. This could save Canadian taxpayers millions of dollars as 
well.
<P>
	If I understand correctly the intentions of the legislation 
before us today, the government is interested in adding an 
element of common sense to the process. This legislation is 
saying Canadians do not want immigrants or refugees with 
criminal backgrounds to come into this country.
<P>
	Why do we not give the immigration officers the means to 
find this out before their cases come before the immigration 
refugee board? It would save all involved time and prevent 
costly hearings which would only result in the dismissal of the 
application in any case.
<P>
	Another measure which would give this legislation teeth 
would be the beefing up of the enforcement of deportation 
orders. I am aware that in response to public pressure the 
minister did appoint extra staff to deal with this problem. Is this 
handful of extra officers really having an effect? The 
government needs to devote even further resources to staff and 
to the enforcement of deportation orders. Warrants should be 
issued so that the whole police network can enforce these 
immigration laws.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5802"> 5802 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	When 3,000 deportable criminals disappear into Canadian 
society in just one year, the potential for harm to the general 
public is tremendous. Justice cannot be served when the law 
cannot be enforced. If the deportation orders issued cannot be 
carried out then the immigration system has very little 
credibility in the eyes of the Canadian public.
<P>
	These are the two main reasons other Reform MPs and I 
cannot bring ourselves to support this bill. But do not get us 
wrong. We think the intentions of the bill are dead on the mark. 
We are very pleased the government is listening to Reform Party 
members and putting some of our ideas into effect. We have 
been listening to the Canadian people on this issue and we are 
pleased the government is finally starting to do the same thing.
<P>
	To be quite frank, my colleagues and I did consider giving 
qualified support to these measures. Our party believes the 
parliamentary system does not necessarily require opposition 
parties to always be adversarial. However, after scrutinizing the 
legislation we came to the conclusion that we could not in good 
conscience support the bill. We cannot give our support to 
legislation without teeth. If we fail to oppose this bill the 
government could claim to have dealt with the issue and simply 
moved on to other business. But the truth is that the Liberals 
have not dealt effectively with this bill. Their failure to do this 
could have terrible ramifications for the people whose interests 
we are elected to represent.
<P>
	This bill is definitely well intentioned but it does not go far 
enough. The Canadian public expects elected officials to deliver 
a lot more than good intentions.
<P>
	I believe I speak for the majority of Canadians when I say 
there are a number of problems with the current government's 
approach to immigration. The shortcomings of this particular 
legislation are just a small part of the larger problem. Quite 
frankly, public support for immigration policy in this country is 
at an all time low. Canadians have little faith in the current 
system and want to see changes made. This means that 
governments must stop serving special interests and instead 
make decisions in the interests of the country as a whole.
<P>
	There are four main areas of immigration policy which the 
government must reform if it is to win back the trust of the 
Canadian people. These four areas are: enforcement; the growth 
of the so-called immigration industry; economic self-interest in 
selecting applicants; and the unacceptably high immigration 
levels.
<P>
	I raised the topic of enforcement earlier in reference to 
deportation orders, but the issue goes much farther than that. 
When it comes to immigration there are many areas where the 
government has a policy to protect the needs and the interests of 
Canadians but simply does not follow through on enforcing this 
policy. An example is the breakdown of sponsorships.
<P>
	Sponsorship is one of the cornerstones of the government's 
current immigration policy. It consists of an individual in this 
country supporting an immigrant and vouching that the 
immigrant will not become a burden on the Canadian social 
safety net. Sponsorship is an excellent idea. It remains a key 
component in the success of many newcomers coming to 
Canada. Unfortunately, sponsorship is just one component of 
our immigration policy in which an enforcement component is 
almost entirely lacking.
<P>
	Mainstream media organizations such as the <I>Toronto Star</I> 
have been reporting on breakdowns in sponsorships for some 
time now but nothing has been done. What generally happens is 
that unable to find work, recent immigrants turn to Canada's 
social safety net rather than to the person who agreed to sponsor 
them. What are the ramifications of this? To my knowledge, 
very little is done to counteract this avoidance of responsibility. 
The end result is negative for all involved.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	For the Canadian taxpayer the promise of a productive 
contributing citizen is broken. It is replaced with yet another 
individual who will require the expenditure of already scarce 
government resources.
<P>
	For provinces and municipalities, it is yet another form of 
offloading from the federal government. Provinces and 
municipalities bear the brunt of providing services such as 
social assistance. When an immigrant sponsorship breaks down, 
the responsibility falls to the province. It is forced to take 
responsibility for a situation it had no hand in creating.
<P>
	The breakdown in immigrant sponsorship is especially an 
insult to the majority of immigrants who come to Canada, work 
hard to contribute to this country and remain true to their 
promise not to become a burden on Canada's social safety net. 
As is often the case, wrongdoing on the part of some members of 
a group results in the perception that the entire group is guilty.
<P>
	That is why the federal government must make the 
enforcement of immigrant sponsorships a priority. It would 
greatly raise the credibility of the immigration system in the 
eyes of the Canadian public. It would also honour the efforts of 
those sponsored immigrants who work to maintain their 
sponsorships and remove an unwelcome burden from all 
taxpayers, both those who came to Canada and those who were 
born here.
<P>
	Another area in which a lack of enforcement calls into 
question the credibility of the immigration system is business 
class immigrants. These are immigrants who have lived in this 
country because they have capital to invest and have promised to 
create new enterprises. This is another case where the 
government policy has the correct priority.
<P>
	This country needs the influx of capital and the enterprising 
spirit brought by business class immigrants. The problem is 
there is not a very stringent enforcement of these regulations. 
Promises of investment and new jobs  do Canada very little good 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5803"> 5803 </A></B>
<P>
unless they are acted upon. It is once again the case that 
immigrants are asked to keep a pledge but face very little 
reprisal if that pledge is not kept. Again the credibility of the 
system is called into question and the reputation of honest 
business class immigrants is sullied by those who fail to fulfil 
their pledges.
<P>
	It is understandable that immigration bureaucrats would not 
invest the time to look into these areas of immigration policy. 
After all, it would simply create more work for the agency's 
already overburdened enforcement arm.
<P>
	These are the words of one federal audit: ``Poorly run sector 
of the immigration department is what is ultimately responsible 
for carrying out government policy''. The August 1993 study of 
the enforcement branch obtained under the Access to 
Information Act portrayed the branch as racked by inadequate 
management systems, poor communications and inadequate 
safety for its officers.
<P>
	One of the key criticisms in this report was the procedures that 
stood in the way of officers getting easy access to 
unemployment insurance, citizenship and social services 
records. The report said that allowing immigration officers 
access to this information would facilitate enforcement 
activities and increase effectiveness. This is exactly what I was 
speaking about earlier. Immigration officers need to be able to 
access information on immigrants and potential immigrants and 
refugees in order to make the system work. This issue is almost 
entirely overlooked in the legislation we are debating now. It is 
one of the major reasons we could not bring ourselves to support 
it.
<P>
	One of the demands the Canadian public is making of the 
immigration system is that it be effective. In order to be 
effective the department must be able to enforce the policies it 
operates by. Failure to enforce these policies means a loss in 
credibility which is why so many Canadians are cynical about 
the immigration process.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	If the minister of immigration would like Canadians to once 
again have faith in this department, he must take steps to 
strengthen enforcement. This is not being done by the current 
legislation.
<P>
	If the government is going to re-establish the faith of 
Canadians in this country's immigration system, the second area 
it must make a priority in reforming is ending the support for the 
burgeoning immigration industry. I am talking about the 
bureaucrats, the lawyers, the academics and the social engineers 
who rely on a high immigration rate to either further their own 
careers or justify their own jobs.
<P>
	The people I am referring to here are not necessarily bad 
people. Often times they feel they are doing what is best for all 
involved. Unfortunately, however, they have ended up creating a 
system funded by taxpayers in which the primary benefits go to 
those who collect salaries and not to the immigration needs for 
the Canadian public as a whole. I am referring for example to 
immigration lawyers who are paid to try the cases of the huge 
backlog of refugees.
<P>
	The amount of money spent on these lawyers and on the 
commissions they appear before is astronomical. The cost of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board alone is $250 million a year. 
Think about that: one-quarter of a billion dollars for a system 
which deems only 15 per cent of refugees inadmissible to this 
country. To contrast this the Canadian government gives only 
$30 million a year to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, the organization responsible for caring for many of 
the 20 million refugees who currently exist on this planet.
<P>
	I ask members of this House which would be a more utilitarian 
use of this money: paying lawyers to spend countless hours 
preparing appeals of board decisions or providing fresh water 
and medicine to war ravaged refugees in Africa?
<P>
	I recognize there is a need for due process in the admission of 
immigrants and refugees to this country but I maintain there has 
to be a better way. This bill takes an important first step by 
stripping the appeal division of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board of its ability to overturn deportation orders on 
humanitarian and compassionate grounds. I suspect this will 
have little effect on the $250 million spent every year on 
hearings and appeals.
<P>
	I spoke to several constituents this summer who expressed 
their anger over the amount they correctly assumed this 
department must cost the Canadian taxpayer. Their common 
sense solution was to find a way to speed up the process to better 
serve the interests of genuine refugee claimants and immigrants 
and the Canadian public as a whole. The people I spoke with are 
not angry with immigrants. They are angry at the immigration 
system.
<P>
	The annual expense of this immigration industry to Canadian 
taxpayers has never been properly calculated but we can safely 
assume it is tremendous. It involves a myriad of expenses. What 
is the cost to the provinces of immigrants who use social 
housing? What is the cost of English as a second language 
programs in different school districts? Getting this type of 
information is difficult because the provincial and federal 
governments rarely share this data.
<P>
	What must be understood is that all of these expenses are the 
result of federal immigration policy. Therefore it is the 
responsibility of this House to consider these costs when making 
its decisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5804"> 5804 </A></B>
<P>
	I must again stress that the increasing anger of Canadians over 
immigration policy is not with the immigrants themselves. It is 
anger with the system that administers this policy in a way 
which is not in the best interests of Canadians as a whole.
<P>
	A big part of the problem is that Canadians see a large and 
rapidly increasing sum of money being spent on immigration 
programs at a time when funds are being cut back for health care 
and education. They are asking if this money is being spent 
unnecessarily. They have every right to ask without being called 
racist or small minded. I say this because proponents of the 
current approach to government policy often refuse to enter into 
a debate about these issues, preferring instead to attempt to sully 
the reputation of those who raise the issues in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Does Canada really need the immigration industry we have 
built up over the years? About 15 years ago Canada, along with 
other countries in the western world, was asked to respond to the 
plight of Vietnamese boat people. These were genuine refugees 
who because of their political situation were forced out of their 
homes.
<P>
	Canadians opened their doors wide to these people but in a 
very different way than we do today. Community groups and 
churches took it upon themselves to sponsor individual refugees 
and families. They made sure they had a place to stay, taught 
them English and French, and helped them integrate into the 
fabric of society. These immigrants in turn laboured to quickly 
adapt to their new home, learning English and French and 
furthering themselves through education and hard work.
<P>
	Today instead of community groups and churches we have 
subsidized housing and government sponsored language 
training. Instead of inviting immigrants and refugees into our 
social circles we stick them in downtown high rises and housing 
projects and ask why these groups have so much trouble 
adapting to the Canadian way of life.
<P>
	The only explanation is the growth of the immigration 
industry. It is a well intentioned and highly paid group of 
individuals whose own self-interests are reflected in the 
decisions they make for everyone. Proper enforcement of 
immigration policy and curtailing the growing immigration 
industry could go a long way toward re-establishing the faith of 
Canadians in our immigration system.
<P>
	A third and equally important consideration is ensuring the 
admission of immigrants to Canada is done with the best 
economic interests of the country in mind. Current statistics 
vary on how many immigrants come to Canada based on their 
ability to contribute to the country economically.
<P>
	In his column in the July 14 <I>Globe and Mail</I> Michael Valpy 
said: ``Immigration policy used to be selective. Now only 15 per 
cent of it is selective. The rest is  determined by family 
reunification and a policy of refugee acceptance that is the most 
liberal in the world''.
<P>
	The Canada immigration facts and issues publication put out 
by Citizenship and Immigration Canada noted: ``About 15 per 
cent of immigrants are evaluated for their potential economic 
benefit to Canada''. The same publication noted that over half of 
all immigrants, 55 per cent, were admitted either as family class 
immigrants or refugees.
<P>
	Quite frankly the government is giving too little priority to 
admitting immigrants to Canada based on their potential 
economic benefit to our country. This is especially disturbing 
because, as the government has often pointed out, we are now a 
part of a global economy and this is changing the nature of our 
economy at home.
<P>
	There is currently little demand for an abundant supply of 
unskilled labour. Education is now the key to the success of 
individuals. There is little opportunity for employment and 
advancement for anyone with less than a high school diploma.
<P>
	A good example of this point can be seen in my riding of 
Cariboo-Chilcotin, specifically in my hometown of Williams 
Lake. When I was growing up jobs were relatively abundant in 
the area as there were many mills, ranches and mines. A capacity 
for hard physical labour was often just as important as any type 
of education one might have.
<P>
	Today the area is much different. Employment is hard to come 
by if one does not have a proper education. The jobs once 
performed by a large payroll of semi-skilled labourers have now 
been replaced with machines and technology. On the positive 
side this has meant an increase in well paying jobs for highly 
skilled workers such as engineers, agriculturalists and 
technicians, and a better quality of life for those employed in 
these industries.
<P>
	In the past immigrants were drawn to Williams Lake because 
of the economic opportunities provided by resource based 
industries. However over the years less and less of these 
opportunities have been available.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The lesson to be learned from this experience as a parent and 
relevant to the debate we are having today on the topic of change 
to the Immigration Act is that the government must place more 
of a priority on attracting immigrants to Canada that have the 
necessary skills and education. I would suggest this be 
accomplished by reducing the number of individuals admitted to 
Canada as family class immigrants.
<P>
	A confidential report prepared for the immigration minister 
and leaked to the media suggests this very idea. It has 
recommended family class immigration be redefined to grant 
automatic acceptance only to spouses and children sponsored by 
Canadians or landed immigrants. I would suggest the shortfall 
made by reducing this category be replaced by immigrants that  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5805"> 5805 </A></B>
<P>
have the economic skills and education to make a greater 
contribution to this nation.
<P>
	We should also remember that family reunification here often 
means family disunification in the immigrant's native country. I 
am sure, Madam Speaker, you and other members of the House 
are familiar with the Statistics Canada report entitled Canada's 
changing immigrant population. The report noted how 
immigrants compared in many respects to native born 
Canadians. It found that a higher percentage of immigrants, 19 
per cent, than native born Canadians, 13 per cent, had less than a 
grade nine education.
<P>
	With the requirements of the Canadian economy changing to 
demand a stronger educational background in workers the 
government must place more of a priority on admitting people to 
this country that will be employable and competitive in our 
markets.
<P>
	Proponents of unbridled immigration would probably argue 
against this policy. They would suggest tight restrictions on the 
sponsorship of family class immigrants are unduly cruel and 
uncaring. I am sure they would also suggest that emphasis on 
attracting immigrants to this country based on their potential 
economic contribution would be crassly materialistic and 
greedy.
<P>
	I would say to these people that they are out of touch with 
current economic realities. Canada needs skilled workers if it is 
to remain competitive. By the same token what it does not need 
is further pressure placed on the social safety nets which are 
stretched to the breaking point at this time in any event.
<P>
	Grassroots Canadians have been telling the Reform Party for a 
long time that they would like to see more emphasis placed on 
admitting to the country individuals with job skills and 
education and less emphasis placed on admitting individuals 
with little to offer. If the minister hopes to restore the faith of 
Canadians in the immigration system, responding to these 
desires would go a long way toward doing this.
<P>
	Finally, I believe reducing current immigration levels would 
go a long way toward re-establishing the faith of Canadians in 
immigration policy and in the immigration system.
<P>
	Before I begin making my argument for a reduction in 
immigration levels I must point out that it has been the policy of 
the Reform Party for some time to pursue lower immigration 
levels than are the current Canadian norm. Our party policy, 
which is based on the wishes and desires of our members, states 
that current immigration levels should be reduced to 
approximately 150,000 people per year.
<P>
	Despite our opponents' attempts to label us as anti-immigrant 
we are in fact pro-immigrant. We simply believe current 
immigration levels are high and are not based on providing 
social or economic benefits to this country. It is clearly the 
desire of a majority of Canadians to see immigration to the 
country lowered from current levels.
<P>
	In March a survey commissioned by the federal government 
found that an unprecedented clear majority of Canadians, in the 
words of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> columnist, Michael Valpy, thought 
immigration levels were too high. As the same columnist noted, 
other research found the decision to set high levels was based on 
increasingly unrealistic economic expectations of immigrants.
<P>
	It is very clear the majority of Canadians would like to see 
lower immigration levels. By refusing to lower the 
government's current level of 250,000 people per year the 
federal government and the immigration minister are quite 
clearly denying the will of the people.
<P>
	I believe it is because of our emphasis on consulting our 
constituents that Reform became the first party in the House to 
pursue a policy of lower immigration levels. The government is 
beginning to see the wisdom of this approach. It is my sincere 
wish that the Liberal government and the minister of 
immigration soon alter their own policy.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Senior advisors working in the immigration department have 
recently recommended that immigration levels be reduced by 20 
per cent to 200,000. This information was contained in an 
18-page confidential report prepared for the minister of 
immigration. It notes that as a result of public consultations 
there was a sense the immigration program is out of control and 
urges that immigrants be better selected. Now that the minister 
has completed his tax funded study of public opinion on the 
issue of immigration I hope he will act on the knowledge he 
gained in the process.
<P>
	The minister and the Liberal Party have a distinct 
disadvantage in this regard. Unlike Reform they do not believe 
in voting with or in some cases representing the interests and 
opinions of their constituents. The Reform Party has a distinct 
advantage in this area. We truly believe in listening to our 
members and constituents and voting with their interests despite 
our personal stance. This means during times the Liberal caucus 
met to discuss how they felt Canadians should be governed the 
Reform Party was out asking those same Canadians how they 
wanted to be governed. This meant very early on the Reform 
Party knew very clearly what actions Canadian people wanted to 
be taken.
<P>
	I do not understand why the immigration minister and the 
Liberal government remain so irrationally committed to 
maintaining high levels of immigration. Canada continues to 
have the highest immigration level in the industrialized world. 
The result of this is that Canada has the highest growth rate in 
the west and ex-Soviet block at 1.4 per cent a year. That is a 
higher growth rate than Argentina, China, Thailand, Korea, Sri 
Lanka and Uruguay. This growing population requires an 
increased quantity of government provided services every year 
at a  time when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5806"> 5806 </A></B>
<P>
governments at every level are finding it difficult to raise 
sufficient revenues.
<P>
	One of the best ways to judge what should be our current 
immigration level is to look at the immigration levels in 
countries similar to our own. A good example would be the 
United States. Americans have long prided themselves on being 
a country which welcomes immigrants with open arms by 
saying: ``Give us your poor, your tired, your hungry''. Another 
common phrase used in describing the immigrant experience is 
the melting pot. This terms implies tremendous ability on the 
part of Americans to welcome and assimilate newcomers from 
different countries.
<P>
	The Canadian public has spoken loudly and clearly in its 
desire for lower immigration levels. I hope the minister 
recognizes that Canadians will continue to display a notable 
lack of faith in the government's immigration policy until those 
numbers coming into Canada are reduced.
<P>
	I am going to move a motion at the end of my speech, but I 
conclude by noting that in all decisions it makes regarding 
immigration, and indeed in all decisions it makes regarding any 
government business, the government must take into 
consideration the economic implications of its actions.
<P>
	We are a country of immigrants. Canada was founded and was 
settled for the most part by peoples from every nation on earth. 
The result has been growth and creation of a very spectacular 
country with a tremendous amount of history and 
accomplishment and an even greater potential ahead of it. 
However, our party would find it necessary to go much further. 
Consequently we find ourselves unable to lend unqualified 
support for the bill. Despite a number of appealing features it 
ultimately lacks the substance necessary to meet the needs and 
desires of the Canadian public.

teacher in Grenada looking for an opportunity for further 
education and self-development. In Grenada one goes overseas. 
Overseas means having money to do so.
<P>
	The Canada domestic worker program offered me the 
opportunity to work for one year with a Canadian family in 
return for landed immigrant status and life in Canada.
<P>
	I came with great anticipation and with high hopes. I looked 
forward to my responsibilities as a domestic because I saw them 
as a stepping stone to something better. I saw my initial job as an 
opportunity to support myself through honest work.
<P>
	I resumed my career as a teacher while earning a bachelor of 
arts degree and master of education from the University of 
Toronto. I became an elementary school principal and went on to 
chair the Metro Toronto Housing Authority, serving over 
100,000 people in the metropolitan Toronto area. Now I have the 
responsibility of serving the great constituency of 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore and working on behalf of the men, 
women and children who come to Canada to share identical 
dreams.
<P>
	I relate my experience as an immigrant because I want to 
place the provisions of Bill C-44 in their proper context. I want 
to make it very clear to everyone who is concerned about 
immigrants that the vast majority of people who come here are 
just like I am, with credentials, hard working and committed to a 
future in Canada.
<P>
	They may not come from Grenada. They may not look the 
same as me. They may have a different accent and they may 
cherish different customs. Most of us share identical dreams. 
We dream of making a better life for ourselves. We dream of 
building a better future for our families. We dream of crafting 
more challenging prospects for our children and we aspire to 
serve our communities.
<P>
	We want to contribute to the betterment of our 
neighbourhoods. We want to create conditions where our loved 
ones can thrive and prosper and last, but hardly least, we want to 
rid our streets of crime and violence.
<P>
	All of us have heard countless stories of successful 
immigrants to Canada. Even before Confederation was a gleam 
in the eye of Sir John A. Macdonald waves of newcomers swept 
into this land. Many were willing to do the most menial labour 
under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5807"> 5807 </A></B>
<P>
incredible conditions in order to scrape a living and to survive. 
Others were escaping persecution and seeking freedom. All 
were intent on building a new nation.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The examples abound. History has recorded the extraordinary 
contribution of immigrants from many backgrounds, races and 
cultures who have built this country. From the Montreal harbour 
to the Toronto skyline, from the building of the railways to the 
development of our prairie wheat fields, immigrants' labour 
helped to build Canada.
<P>
	Where are today's success stories? Are there no such success 
stories today? Are we now bereft of immigrants improving and 
enriching Canada?
<P>
	What I find distressing in this discussion is the lack of 
recognition of the continuing contribution of newcomers to this 
country. What I find disturbing is the emphasis that is placed on 
the negative, destructive aspects of the modern immigration 
experience. What I find unacceptable is the distorted impression 
that this lack of recognition and negative depiction of 
immigrants sometimes leaves in the minds of the Canadian 
public. Think about it.
<P>
	Where can we read of present day success stories? Where can 
we learn of the accomplishments and contributions of recent 
immigrants? Where can we find out about the achievements of 
newcomers? Not on the front pages of our newspapers. It is not 
standard news on the radio and it certainly is not the ordinary 
fare of television newscasts.
<P>
	If positive information ever appears it is on the back pages. It 
is a late radio filler, it is an afterthought buried deep in a 
television program on a low rating day. Apparently good news 
about immigrants is not a good enough sell. It is simply not 
marketable news, and because they are not glamorous, another 
more sensational picture of the immigrant experience receives 
the lion's share of the media spotlight.
<P>
	It is the minuscule minority of immigrants who operate as 
petty hoods that grabs the media attention and dominate the 
headlines. It is the small number of immigrants who enter the 
criminal world that captures the radio news clips. It is the tiny 
band of fraud artists who come here under false pretences that 
catches the attention of television reporters. A distorted public 
picture of modern immigrants is the unfortunate result.
<P>
	The real story, the whole story, is either too big or too boring 
for the tabloid headlines. The real story is really about hard 
working immigrants, entrepreneurs providing jobs and benefits 
to this country, immigrant students winning scholarships, or it is 
about immigrant scientists pioneering innovative techniques to 
alleviate pain and suffering. It is the negative story that most 
often dominates public reports and it is this information that 
confounds the public's understanding of immigration and its 
impact on Canada today. It is the kind of story we hear from 
across the way.
<P>
	I doubt very much that any of us can persuade the media away 
from the idea that bad news should dominate good news at every 
turn, or even now and then. What we  can do is change what is 
out there about immigration to report, and that is where Bill 
C-44 comes into play.
<P>
	Bill C-44 promises to play a pivotal role in diminishing 
opportunities for the minority of criminals who immigrate to 
Canada to steal, to deal, to intimidate, to extort, or even to injure 
and kill. Quite simply, Bill C-44 makes it easier for us to 
remove unwanted elements that none of us, whether we be 
descendants of immigrants, old immigrants or relatively new 
immigrants, want here in the first place.
<P>
	I would suggest that the changes incorporated in Bill C-44 
will not solve the problems of crime in Canadian society but it 
will help us accomplish our goal of preserving public 
confidence in Canada's immigration program. More than that, 
the measures in this bill will also help us rid our country of those 
people who have little interest in contributing to our society in a 
positive way.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	All our statistics show that newcomers are, if anything, more 
law-abiding than Canadians born here, even though the scanty 
minority of exceptions loom lopsidedly large in the public eye 
and in the media. As the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration explained to the Canadian association of police 
chiefs in Montreal this past August, his department has been 
directed to use three means of strengthening our enforcement 
activities; legislative changes, administrative reforms and 
closer co-operation with other law enforcement agencies to 
locate people who would abuse our generosity.
<P>
	At the same time, I was particularly pleased to see the 
minister declare that the Immigration Act will continue to serve 
as the foundation of our system. This act was amended with 
utmost care. It was altered only after it was determined that the 
amendments would both protect the public and promote 
continued public confidence in our progressive immigration 
policies at the same time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. parliamentary secretary but I have an announcement to 
make. She will have 10 minutes left at the end of Question 
Period.

Cariboo-Chilcotin is acceptable.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Mr. Speaker, as part of the 
annual meeting of the Canadian Association for HIV Research 
this summer, AIDS Action Now, a Toronto based AIDS 
advocacy group, organized a demonstration highlighting 
promising new AIDS research opportunities which are, in its 
opinion, funded inadequately.
<P>
	At that demonstration I was presented a petition with over 300 
signatures. Technicalities preclude the tabling of this petition, 
however the message it contains should be made public. It calls 
on the government to ``increase funding for AIDS research so 
that Canadian scientists can contribute to understanding the 
disease, improving treatments and finding a cure''.
<P>
	It also requests the government to ``make clear a commitment 
to long term, sustained funding of AIDS research at least 
proportionate to the HIV population base and Canada's relative 
wealth''.
<P>
	While members of the House know that the government has 
allocated significant funding for the national AIDS strategy, we 
must always strive to do more. We cannot forget that for too 
many Canadians it is a matter of life and death.

Randy Connors. Mr. Connors was one of many Canadian victims 
who contracted the AIDS virus following a blood transfusion.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	In fact, according to a recent study published by the 
Department of Health, nearly 1,500 Canadians, including 400 
Quebecers, have been infected by contaminated blood. This 
kind of negligence on the part of those responsible for Canada's 
blood supply system must never happen again. Already too 
many people have suffered as a result of a mistake that will cost 
them their lives.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
budget in February there has been growing concern in Calgary 
regarding the cost of the government's plan to transfer the Lord 
Strathcona's Horse and the First Service Battalion from CFB 
Calgary to CFB Edmonton.
<P>
	Initial government estimates placed costs at $23 million. 
However, the government has now admitted revised costs of an 
additional $21 million for construction and renovation. Another 
$30 million is likely needed to clean up existing ranges. The cost 
for defaulting on leases will probably be around $16 million and 
of course there are other costs.
<P>
	Recently released documents indicate that DND's primary 
rationale for this is to compensate Edmonton for the loss of three 
AIRCOM squadrons.
<P>
	I call on the minister to obtain an independent cost assessment 
in light of all new information and to hold this decision in 
abeyance until that time. A failure to re-evaluate this decision 
can only be interpreted as contempt for the intelligence and the 
money of taxpayers.

Quebec workers.
<P>
	The newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> reported that more than 22,000 
Quebecers had been excluded from the unemployment insurance 
system since the reform came into effect. In addition to the 
restrictive measures of the Conservatives, we now have those 
introduced by the Liberals, which will affect, and are already 
affecting, tens of thousands of Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	I want to ask the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
who is now preparing a thorough overhaul of the social safety 
net, to look behind the figures at all the people who are severely 
affected by the measures being taken here in Ottawa. Perhaps he 
will find the compassion which has been clearly lacking since he 
took over the department and launched the reform of the social

than $100 million.
<P>
	Canadians are alarmed. They are concerned not only for 
themselves and their futures but for their children and their 
grandchildren. But what of the government? How concerned is 
it? Not very apparently when it defines success as going in the 
hole another $100 billion over the next three years. Even if it 
achieves that goal, it has failed the people.

	I say to the government that it has an obligation to preserve

	I also want to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. 
Parizeau. I commend him for repeating his promise of a 
referendum within the next ten months, and I hope he will keep 
his word. In fact, I hope the referendum is held as soon as 
possible and that the question is clear and unambiguous. And 
when Quebecers have said no, once and for all, to the separatist 
option, I hope Mr. Parizeau and his followers will give up on the 
idea and forget about it, because, Mr. Premier Designate,

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a well 
known fact that lead is dangerous to human health because it is a 
poisonous substance. We have made some progress by 
eliminating lead from gasoline and paints but many other uses of 
lead continue, thus causing a threat to human health.
<P>
	In Canada lead is spread into the environment when a hunter 
shoots or an angler loses a fishing weight. When ingested by 
wildlife, lead is the cause of a slow and agonizing death. In the 
United States the use of lead shot for waterfowl was banned in 
1991. In Denmark and in the Netherlands the government 
banned lead in shots for all game and fishing weights.
<P>
	In Canada we have a long way to go in ensuring that lead does 
not enter the environment as in the case of imported children's 
crayons which will be the subject of another intervention soon.

Rosemary Speirs of the <I>Toronto Star</I>. I would like to take this 
opportunity to challenge the Liberals on this mock takeover of 
our turf.
<P>
	Indeed, during the past year the Reform Party has been 
effective in setting the national agenda. I ask, why is the 
government focusing constantly on deficit reduction, criminal 
justice and immigration? It is because Reform members have 
brought these issues to the forefront time and time again. 
Because of this debate Canadians are aware of the ineffective 
status quo system and are demanding changes.
<P>
	On closer scrutiny, these well informed Canadians will soon 
realize that these cosmetic changes have not changed the system 
fundamentally. The Reform Party would be delighted to see its 
policies being implemented. But please take the entire package, 
not just the label.

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Fundy region of my Carleton-Charlotte constituency 
endured great hardship in recent weeks. Not only was the wharf 
located at St. Andrews, New Brunswick devastated by fire on 
August 31, but the Labour Day weekend brought great winds and 
waves, destroying numerous herring weirs along the Fundy 
coast. Both of these tragedies will have disastrous effects on the 
economy of the region.
<P>
	The town of St. Andrews depends greatly on the tourism 
industry, the traditional fishery and aquaculture industry. 
Needless to say the loss of the wharf will damage these 
industries to a great degree.
<P>
	Likewise, the weir fishermen along the Fundy coast rely on 
their weirs to maintain the flow of herring to processors. The 
destruction of these weirs will shorten their season, throwing 
many out of work and bringing tremendous reconstruction costs 
to the weir owner-operators.

<P>
	The citizens of Saint John and most of the province of New

death of the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi. He was not in 
this House very long, but he made many friends here.
<P>
	He was a hard worker. He always turned his attention to the 
needy. On behalf of my party and the government, I would like 
to offer his son and his family our sincerest condolences. I 
would also like to take the opportunity to remind the public of 
what a member's life is like. The member is at least the third of 
my colleagues who has died in an automobile accident. After 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5812"> 5812 </A></B>
<P>
working for long hours weeks at a time, they died in car 
accidents on the way home. I am thinking of Mr. Fortin from 
Lotbinière and Mr. Lonsdale, a member from northern Ontario.
<P>
	In their criticisms, people too often forget that members of 
Parliament sometimes have impossible hours. They work here, 
have to return to their riding and come back to Ottawa. They take 
enormous risks. They are always criticized. Unfortunately, Mr. 
Péloquin died tragically. On behalf of my party and the 
government, I would like to offer his colleagues and his family 
my most sincere sympathy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first like to thank the Prime Minister for his 
deeply felt words about our friend, Mr. Péloquin, and members 
like him who died in similar circumstances.
<P>
	Gaston Péloquin, the member for Brome-Missisquoi, was 
our friend and his tragic death has greatly saddened his family, 
his constituents and his colleagues. He leaves behind his 16-year 
old son Pascal and his close friends, Denise and Gilles Duval, to 
whom he has entrusted his son. During his professional career, 
in education, in politics and in social life, Mr. Péloquin was 
always concerned for the most disadvantaged, those who are 
excluded and left behind. That is what motivated him to work for 
Haitian children.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	He was respected by all for his commitment to his 
constituents and his deep convictions for Quebec's full 
development. Everyone recognizes the work he did to serve his 
fellow citizens in the Eastern Townships and the determination 
he brought to the task.
<P>
	Mr. Péloquin was very human and modest, very giving of 
himself. The most important value for him was volunteerism. 
His great availability, his commitment of time and energy to his 
constituents, made him very well liked and many mourned his 
passing. He was very sorry about the difficulties facing the 
families of laid-off Hyundai workers in his riding. His concern 
and the comfort he gave them show his compassion.
<P>
	Quebec and Canada have just lost an honest, warm-hearted 
parliamentarian for whom it was difficult to accept the fate and 
suffering of others. Members will understand that because of his 
Haitian experience, he was particularly affected by the painful 
situation in that country. Shortly before he died, he was 
devastated to recognize on television someone he had known 
who had been killed by the military junta.
<P>
	Mr. Pélonquin's career was one of service for the good of his 
fellow citizens. First as a teacher, then as a school principal, 
missionary and member of Parliament, he was involved in many 
organizations. A committed believer, he dedicated himself to 
many religious and parish activities. His faith in young people 
and concern for their future were very important to him.
<P>
	Allow me to repeat the message which he always wanted to 
give to his fellow citizens, a message of tolerance, of openness, 
of respect for what democracy in Quebec and Canada will 
decide. On behalf of the members of the Bloc Quebecois, I 
extend our sincerest condolences to all those who are affected by 
this tragedy. Like them, we feel the emptiness left by the passing 
of Gaston Péloquin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
fellow colleagues, I was deeply saddened to learn of the tragic 
death of our friend and colleague, the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the first days of the new Parliament Mr. Péloquin and I 
developed a friendship that transcended our political 
differences. We agreed to maintain our friendship throughout 
the travails that lay ahead of us in Parliament. We both looked 
forward to enriching our own lives by learning more and sharing 
experiences with each other.
<P>
	Gaston was a gentle man, a person of character and resolve. 
He wanted to do right and on occasion was genuinely perplexed 
when his motives were questioned from a purely political 
perspective.
<P>
	Like many of us, Mr. Péloquin was a new member and we all 
did not get a chance to know him as a person. Had we had the 
opportunity to know Gaston, we would have learned of his life's 
work as a teacher, we would have known that he wrote a 
children's book and that he adopted a young Haitian orphan, 
Pascal, his son.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Perhaps the untimely death of our colleague will cause us all 
to give some thought to the bonds that unite rather than divide 
us, to think first of each other as individuals with hopes, dreams 
and aspirations, than as politicians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On behalf of the entire Reform caucus, I wish to express to 
Gaston's son, Pascal, our sincere condolences. Nothing we do or 
say now will lighten the burden of grief you bear today, but may 
you find peace in the certain knowledge that your father, Gaston, 
rests with those who are a force of good in this life.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada, Québec and Parliament are poorer for his passing but 
were enriched by his presence.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Official Opposition 
and my colleague from the Reform Party in expressing, in my 
own name and on behalf of our Party, our sorrow at the passing 
of Mr. Gaston Péloquin.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5813"> 5813 </A></B>
<P>
	Previous speakers have already noted some of his 
achievements. I must admit that I did not get to know Mr. 
Péloquin very well. In fact, I believe the first time we ever met 
was on the floor of the House and we did barely more than 
exchange greetings.
<P>
	Nonetheless, I have realized like everyone else, as we set 
aside our partisanship under the present circumstances, to what 
extent his life brought a ray of hope. Like my colleagues, I was 
greatly impressed by his contribution in the field of education, 
by his colleagues' tributes which, incidentally, were very 
touching, and also by his personal commitment. At this time 
when coincidentally we are witnessing extremely important 
events taking place in Haiti with regard to the stakes of 
democracy, Mr. Péloquin, by the way he lived his life, reminds 
us that there are among us individuals who are prepared to take 
very concrete action. As a matter of fact, the wish was expressed 
that in his memory donations be made to charities for Haitian 
children. I realized then how much of a difference his life will 
have made for these people.
<P>
	As Mr. Péloquin's riding was next to mine, I had the 
opportunity to hear personal accounts of those he rubbed 
shoulders with and I can tell you today that these people had 
only good things to say about him, his work and his great 
sincerity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness that I rise today in this House to pay tribute to a 
colleague and a friend whose loss affects us all. The accidental 
death of our colleague Gaston Péloquin is a terrible blow to his 
son, his family, his friends, his constituents and to us all. Quebec 
and Canada have lost a member of Parliament who was honest 
and very dedicated to the cause in which he believed above all. 
Gaston Péloquin, who was elected to this House in October 1993 
as the member for Brome-Missisquoi, did his job with loyalty. 
He defended his constituents' interests with his usual 
determination and paid special attention to the needs of the 
poorest. We all recognized his legendary availability to these 
people. His approach to politics never raised any doubt about the 
sincerity of his personal convictions.
<P>
	He always believed in Quebec and was never afraid to 
denounce the injustices suffered by Quebecers. I knew Gaston 
Péloquin personally for many years. He was a warm and 
endearing person, as I realized while touring the Eastern 
Townships during the 1993 election campaign. We spent several 
days travelling through five ridings. Gaston was the leader of 
the group informally set up in the motor home of his friend Jean 
Bégin. He took pleasure in doing his job well.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	I shared an apartment in Hull with Gaston for 10 months 
during the last parliamentary session. We had many 
opportunities to confide in each other. His always lively 
comments and well-expressed ideas showed him to be 
extremely sensitive. The closing of the Hyundai plant  was a 
striking case in point. I saw all the efforts that he made in this 
matter so that families would not lose their livelihood. He was 
very sorry for these workers when this plant closed, but he had 
done all he could. As a former teacher of English as a second 
language who maintained a lifelong interest in education, he 
very often talked to me about the school he headed for two years 
in Haiti. He shared the Haitian people's problems and human 
misery, and he was very proud to bring back from that country 
his son Pascal who is now 16 years old and had become his main 
reason for living.
<P>
	Gaston Péloquin leaves a big void that will be hard to fill not 
only in the House of Commons but also in the riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi. On behalf of Bloc members and the great 
region of the Eastern Townships, I offer our heartfelt 
condolences to his son Pascal, his family and his friends. We 
share with them the sorrow of losing a loved one. Goodbye, 
Gaston.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is in my role as chairman of the industry committee 
that I had the opportunity to work with Gaston Péloquin during 
the winter and spring of 1994. As you know, Mr. Speaker, more 
often than not committees conduct their work in a non-partisan 
fashion. We are removed from the media and the atmosphere is 
very different from the one during question period, for example. 
Mr. Péloquin participated in all our proceedings on the 
financing of small and medium-sized businesses. He was 
assiduous and his comments were always serious and well 
thought-out. He was interested in every aspect of our review, 
whether it was the relationship between banks and small 
businesses, the mandate of the Federal Business Development 
Bank, or the role of the Superintendent of Financial institutions. 
Before entering politics, as was mentioned earlier this 
afternoon, Mr. Péloquin made a career in teaching. He was a 
single parent with an adopted child, Pascal, who is now 16 years 
old. I attended Mr. Péloquin's funeral in Cowansville and was 
able to see how much he was loved by his colleagues from the 
education sector because of his dedication, his generosity and 
his sense of humour.
<P>
	Again, I want to express my sympathy to his son Pascal, to the 
other members of his family and to his friends, including the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> On behalf 
of all my colleagues from the New Democratic Party, I want to 
express my sincere condolences to the friends and relatives of 
Gaston Péloquin, and particularly to his adopted son Pascal.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to talk to Gaston on several occasions 
and I found him to be a man of compassion and integrity who 
was very concerned by the plight of the poor and the vulnerable 
in our society. Even in his maiden speech in this House he 
referred to social programs and, in particular, to the rights of 
handicapped people. A strong believer in an independent Que-
<P>

<B><A NAME="5814"> 5814 </A></B>
<P>
bec for  many years, he was also very devoted to the well-being 
of his constituents of Brome-Missisquoi.
<P>
	This is a terrible loss for them, for us his parliamentary 
colleagues, and especially for his family. We will all miss him.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As I said earlier today, we have lost one of our 
number. I think we should remember we have only one life to 
live and if we can do something for someone, for our neighbour, 
we should always do it as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	Colleagues, it being 2.35 p.m., Question Period will go until 
3.20 today.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after nine years under a Liberal government, last 
Monday Quebec elected a Parti Québécois government, whose 
main objective is to achieve the sovereignty of Quebec. The 
federal government should realize this instead of hiding its head 
in the sand, as was obvious from the speech made yesterday in 
Quebec City by the Prime Minister before the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce.
<P>
	My question is this: Does the Prime Minister really think his 
offer to co-operate with the new government in Quebec is a 
credible one, when at the same time, his stubborn insistence on a 
centralist approach in the proposed overhaul of the social safety 
net is causing a major confrontation, not only with Quebec but 
with other provinces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
would make better sense to wait until the minister's plan is 
tabled in the House, instead of using the kind of epithets we have 
heard from the hon. member. We have had an election in 
Quebec, and the people wanted a change of government. But I 
know what people want. They want governments to work 
together to create jobs and bring about economic recovery, to 
ensure that the most vulnerable members of our society are 
protected. That is the purpose of our proposal, and I hope the 
Government of Quebec, like the other governments that have 
indicated they want to co-operate, will be prepared to 
co-operate in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, would the Prime Minister agree that the best way to 
ensure genuine co-operation-the kind he has so fulsomely 
extended to the new government of Quebec-is to start by 
respecting the jurisdiction and responsibilities of Quebec, 
instead of trying to encroach further in this area through his 
minister's program for  social reform which is a blatant attack 
on Quebec's constitutional positions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have not seen the final version. I wish the Leader of the 
Opposition would show it to me. I have not seen it. In other 
words, he does not know what he is talking about. He should 
wait and see what is in the document.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Once the document is ready it will be available to everybody. 
It will be a discussion paper. I have discussed that with the 
premiers. They know we have a problem in this field and it is 
something which needs to be modernized and adapted to 
changing times. I am surprised the Leader of the Opposition 
wants to keep the status quo.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the benefits of politics is that you lose your 
naïvety, and when you stop being naïve, you understand the 
ulterior motives of a government that, in fact, is no longer trying 
to hide its determination to use this overhaul of the social safety 
net to save money and divert resources away from the pittance 
the needy are receiving now. They even admitted that the basic 
objective was to save money so that the Minister of Finance can 
balance his accounts, which are a disaster.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister very sincerely, based on a 
concern for co-operation, as he himself said, whether we should 
take him seriously when he tells Quebecers that he wants to 
co-operate with the new government on job creation, and I want 
to ask him whether he realizes that he should first promise to 
transfer to Quebec full jurisdiction over manpower training, 
which would save a lot of wear and tear on the neediest members 
of our society. Is the government's real position not that this is 
just one of Quebec's whims?
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the way government and federalism works, the central 
government is allowed to take money from people who are well 
off, including people who work in fields where there are jobs, 
and use it to help those who do not have that opportunity and 
who need training.
<P>
	In our country, unemployment levels vary, and we take money 
from the people who work to give it to people who do not work. 
This has no connection with language but is directly connected 
to the need to help people who are unemployed to get more 
training so that they can have the dignity of work. That is the 
purpose of this reform, and we will discuss with the provinces 
how it should be managed, but we must not create a situation 
where the federal government is completely out of the picture 
and the principle of redistribution of wealth is eliminated in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5815"> 5815 </A></B>

country. That would have a very  adverse effect on the poorer 
provinces and regions of this country.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, serious 
allegations have been made during the summer putting in 
question the integrity of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service, better known as CSIS.
<P>
	CSIS has allegedly used an informant to set up a Canadian 
racist group. The same informant is also alleged to have 
infiltrated the entourage of the Reform Party leader.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Given the seriousness 
of the situation, does the Prime Minister think it is acceptable 
for CSIS to infiltrate a democratically formed political party, 
collect information on the CBC and the Canadian Jewish 
Congress, and contribute to the foundation of a Canadian racist 
group?
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister consider that this is right?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is talking about what so far simply are 
allegations, some of which have been categorically denied by 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	All of these allegations are being looked into by the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee which is an independent body 
created by this Parliament and operates at arm's length both 
from the government and from CSIS. I think we should wait to 
see its report. In the light of that report we will be prepared to 
take any necessary action on the basis of these allegations, if and 
when they are proven.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Solicitor General not agree that the best way, in fact the only 
way, to shed all the light on CSIS's alleged actions would be to 
set up a royal commission with real powers so that we can find 
out exactly what CSIS did?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I want to observe that we are dealing with allegations about 
things that may have happened before this government took 
office.
<P>
	The second point I want to make is that the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee in my view is something like a 
permanent royal commission with a permanent mandate to 
review the activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service. The Security Intelligence Review Committee is set up 
by order in council. It has full authority to question people, to 
examine documents, to do all the things a royal commission 
would do but  focused on the activities, alleged or otherwise, of 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	In my view this Parliament in creating the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee has in effect responded to what 
the hon. member is talking about. We have the equivalent of a 
royal commission looking into the allegations in question.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister responded to the first question by the Leader 
of the Opposition which affects the national unity issue by 
saying things he has said 100 times before.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Given the circumstances, surely a better and more vigorous 
response would have been for the Prime Minister to declare his 
intention to make Canada as attractive as possible to all 
Canadians by balancing the budget, by offering tax relief, and by 
changing social programs to make them both affordable and 
more decentralized. These are the hallmarks of good 
government, not the half measures that are being introduced in 
the House.
<P>
	What new and bolder steps is the Prime Minister going to take 
in the cause of national unity to balance the budget, cut taxes and 
fix our social safety net?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to congratulate the Leader of the Reform Party 
on his promotion to the front row.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I am very glad the member 
for Calgary West had the humility to change seats with the 
member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	The member is right. The best way to keep the unity of the 
country is to have a good economy. That is exactly what we are 
working on at this time. When he looks at the results he will see 
that 265,000 new jobs were created since we have been in 
government and we have known a 6.4 per cent growth in the last 
quarter.
<P>
	If we were to follow the Reform Party economic recipe we 
would immediately create a huge recession in Canada. If we 
were to take $40 billion out of the economy in one shot there 
would be twice as many unemployed as at this time. We do not 
want to go to the right wing doctrinaire solution or to the left 
wing doctrinaire solution. We will go the proper Liberal way, the 
balanced way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5816"> 5816 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister's reply will not strengthen support for the 
federal system because the standards of his government are too 
low and his timetable is too long.
<P>
	Producing a social program discussion paper is not good 
enough when the public wants action. Fixing our deficit target at 
3 per cent of GDP is not good enough when our national debt is 
at 71 per cent of GDP. National unity will not be achieved unless 
the Prime Minister sets higher standards for his ministers and a 
shorter timetable.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister commit to raising his government's 
standards with respect to social reform and fiscal reform and 
accelerating his timetable for bringing in those reforms?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we were very prudent when we ran in the last election. We put 
everything in writing in the red book. So far it is working very 
well and we do not intend to change our goals.
<P>
	Three per cent of GDP for the level of deficit in relation to 
GDP is a very ambitious goal. It is the one selected by all 
countries in Europe as the normal goal for European countries 
and none of them at the moment has achieved that.
<P>
	We will achieve it. As we said and as promised, at the end of 
the third year of our mandate we will be at 3 per cent of GDP. It is 
written in the red book; it will be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a fear that history is repeating itself. Members that have 
been around the House and have observed it for a long time 
know governments that get elected, have a mandate and do not 
use it to make fundamental changes in the first year, ones that 
squander their political mandate on half measures, never end up 
getting the job done.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister not use his political capital to 
make major fiscal and social reforms now instead of frittering it 
away on political half measures?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have to consult with the provinces in order to achieve reform. 
The son of a former premier who, I might say in passing, 
accepted a seat in the Senate says that we should not consult with 
the provinces. What kind of country does he want Canada to be?
<P>
	We will have to consult with the provinces. We will do that. 
There will be measures in the House and reform will be 
achieved, but we prefer to do it with the collaboration of the 
provinces. The minister has spent a lot of time with ministers so 
far. The document will be tabled in the first week of October.
<P>
	We will have other discussions with the public through the 
House of Commons. Legislation will come next year and you 
will be satisfied.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the chairman of the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee, Jacques Courtois, appeared before the 
Sub-Committee on National Security. When committee 
members asked Mr. Courtois about the allegations relating to 
the infiltration of the Reform Party, he refused to answer, saying 
that at CSIS he had learned to never say yes or no. That is a fine 
example of the transparency awaiting the parliamentary 
sub-committee responsible for shedding light on these 
allegations.
<P>
	My question is for the Solicitor General of Canada. Does he 
consider as acceptable Mr. Courtois's deliberate refusal to 
answer the parliamentary sub-committee's questions relating to 
the allegations involving CSIS?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As a general rule the questions asked in 
committee are the work of the committee. Perhaps, if the 
question could be rephrased to make it a more general question 
directed to the Solicitor General, it would be acceptable.
<P>
	The question relates directly to the work of the committee and 
I would rule it out of order. I would ask the hon. member to 
rephrase the question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will rephrase my question: Can the Solicitor General 
of Canada assure this House that this matter will be clarified 
once and for all and that the review committee will give clear 
and precise answers to the questions we asked during committee 
meetings?
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under the rules of the House I am not in a position to comment on 
proceedings in a committee before the committee has reported.
<P>
	However I want to say that under the law adopted by 
Parliament the Security Intelligence Review Committee has

	We should not jump to conclusions about the way the Security

promised to have a report by the month of October. We should 
pass judgment on its work only after we have seen it and had a 
chance to assess it.

department and its activities instead of the committees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is obviously on the same wavelength as 
Jacques Courtois as he does not answer yes or no, even in this 
House. Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister. By 
answering this way, does the minister not lend a little support to 
CSIS's way of operating and prevent the Sub-Committee on 
National Security from doing its job in this matter?

want to assist the hon. member by giving him a categorical and 
clear answer. Yes, I will carry out the responsibility imposed on 
me by the CSIS act as passed by Parliament. I have no authority 
however to direct the chairman of the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee about the way he and his committee do their 
work. I am sure they are very conscious of the responsibility 
they have undertaken in accepting appointments to the 
committee. I am sure they are capable of following the 
proceedings of the House.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in his last budget the Minister of Finance announced that 
Canada's debt would increase by 20 per cent or $97 billion over 
the next three years. He has planned to do that. Such an increase 
is the highest in the history of Canada for any three-year period.
<P>
	Now the news is that even this target will not be met and that 
the debt at the end of three years will be $10 billion to $16 
billion above the $97 billion already planned.
<P>
	What will the Minister of Finance and his government do 
about this frightening problem of a runaway deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, before answering I should like to 
congratulate my colleague on having been named one of the two 
co-critics. If it takes two I am a critic on ten. In all sincerity I 
should like to congratulate him on his appointment.
<P>
	Certainly I congratulate him on the fact that he has moved to 
the front benches. I must say I find it amazing, knowing this 
particular member, that he has moved a little closer to the centre 
of the political spectrum.
<P>
	The answer to the question is that the assumption upon which 
it is based is simply not well founded. The accumulation of past 
deficits and the fact of compound interest, as the member knows 
full well, have led to the tremendous increase in debt. Indeed 
had the party opposite, heaven forbid, been in office we would 
have had this compound interest effecting this tremendous 
increase in the debt. I hope the member understands that.
<P>
	In any event the member asked what the government was 
going to do. Let me simply cite the Prime Minister yesterday. 
We are going to hit our targets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance recently announced 
that the ministry was planning the taxation of RRSPs in order to 
hit those targets.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Finance whether this is true 
or whether the people of Canada who are already overtaxed can 
expect him to cut spending instead?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, no spokesman for the 
Department of Finance made that statement.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. We learned with 
relief yesterday that an agreement had been reached between 
Washington and the military junta in Haiti that allowed the 
peaceful landing of a multinational force to restore democracy 
in the country and thus enable the democratically elected 
president, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to return.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	Here is my question: Was the minister informed of the terms 
of the agreement between Washington and the military junta 
and, if so, can he tell this House what they are and when 
President Aristide is to return to Haiti?
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the Canadian government, I would like to 
say how happy we are at the turn events took, at the lack of 
bloodshed that could have resulted in the death of many 
Haitians.
<P>
	There is no doubt that we must pay tribute to the efforts of the 
American special envoys who have managed, at the very last 
second, to convince the military to abdicate. It seems obvious to 
me that this last-minute agreement that averted the military 
action called for under United Nations resolution 940 provides 
that the military will not only have to hand over power, but also 
allow members of the multinational force that should land in 
Haiti within hours to gain control of the situation and bring 
about the speedy return of president Aristide.
<P>
	One major factor to take into account is that under Governors 
Island arrangements, one legislative measure must be passed to 
provide for the general pardon of the military and another one to 
provide for the division of powers between the military and the 
police. In our view, it would be important that the proposed 
legislation called for in the original Governors Island agreement 
be implemented as soon as possible by the Haitian Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Canadian government intend to contribute actively to the forces 
that will be put together to garantee the safety of civilian 
populations upon the return of President Aristide and, if so, what 
will this contribution consist of?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had the pleasure of meeting President Aristide last 
week, at which time I reiterated that the Government of Canada 
was firmly committed to providing him with support whenever 
he requests it, to help rebuild his country at the democratic, 
social and economic level. We are confident that, as soon as he is 
back in Haiti, president Aristide will ask for support, 
large-scale participation, from Canada. I can assure you that we 
will be ready to respond to his request and will do so most 
positively.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is also 
for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Last week the minister committed personnel and money, lots 
of money, toward the rebuilding of Haiti. I believe the Canadian 
people need to know more about that plan. They need to know 
what the costs are going to be, what our commitment is going to 
be, and how long we are going to be there.
<P>
	Also as parliamentarians we need to know if we are going to 
be discussing this in detail in the House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to remind the hon. member that Canada supports 
the UN resolutions with regard to Haiti. Indeed, we support the 
Governors Island agreement which calls  for the sending of 
Canadian police forces to Haiti to train the Haitian police forces. 
This is a well known commitment by Canada. We are anxious 
and eager to fulfil this commitment. We will be following 
through as soon as the circumstances allow our police to go 
there.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Second, we have approved the UN resolutions, which will 
allow-in the second phase of the implementation of resolution 
940 of the United Nations-the involvement of military 
personnel under the auspices of the United Nations. This has not 
yet been realized. When this second phase takes place, we will 
then respond.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In the interest of brevity, we would ask all 
members to have very brief questions and very brief answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the red book it 
says that we can be assured we will not be U.S. camp followers. 
Yet the minister makes a trip to Washington on Thursday and 
comes back with our plan.
<P>
	Can the minister assure us that we will now take the lead and 
work with the OAS and the UN in a leadership role regarding the 
solution to the Haiti problem?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very intrigued by the question of the hon. member 
because I thought I heard his leader on television a few days ago 
expressing a different point of view. I want to assure the House 
that Canada has an independent position which we have clearly 
expressed inside and outside the House with regard to Haiti.
<P>
	We believe we can play a more independent, separate role 
than others because of the privileged position we have with the 
Haitian population. Certainly under the auspices of the UN, we 
could give leadership in playing a very constructive role.
<P>
	I hope that in the near future the House will allow us to have a 
debate on the matter in order to permit members of both sides of 
the House to express their views in this regard.

Minister of Health. In a press conference held last Monday, the

serious control problems at the Red Cross centre in Toronto?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for her question. First of 
all, let me reassure Canadians by saying that the inspections 
carried out by the FDA were the result of a change in its own 
policies and were not brought about by problems in the way the 
blood supply is handled in Canada. It is a question of 
harmonizing various policies, since the regulations differ. We 
are working with the FDA and will continue to do so in order to 
achieve harmonization. Our blood system in Canada is as safe as 
any in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Supplementary

took action to inform other centres of the serious deficiencies

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will repeat my answer once more.
<P>
	The inspections that were carried out were the result of a 
change in the policies of the FDA. They were not brought about 
by any problems directly affecting our blood system here. Our 
blood system remains one of the safest in the world and we 
continue to do everything possible to improve it.

	For many people autumn means the arrival of the game 
hunting season. These people are concerned that the proposed 
gun control legislation will include provisions such as central 
storage, seizure of hunting weapons and possible expensive

<P>
	Does the minister have any words for these many hunters to 
calm their worries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
address the issue.
<P>
	In the weeks since the House adjourned in June I have spent 
time crossing Canada, visiting every province but one-and I 
will soon be there-to meet with Canadians and to discuss 
directly with them the issue of firearms and their regulation. I 
have met with dozens of groups, with hunters and anglers, with 
wildlife federations, with shooting clubs, with target shooters 
and with a variety of others who have an interest in firearms.
<P>
	Among other things, I have tried to reassure them that the 
government is keenly aware that hunting is not only a long 
tradition but it is an important economic activity for many 
regions of Canada and that the proposals we will bring forward 
later this year will reflect not only the need for a safe society and 
a strong criminal justice system, but will also respect the 
legitimate interests of hunters, farmers and those who use 
firearms for subsistence.
<P>
	The proposals we are now preparing will reflect the legitimate 
interests to which the hon. member referred.

immigration, to require security bonds from sponsors of 
relatives and eliminate automatic citizenship for the children of 
refugees.
<P>
	We would like to acknowledge that the minister has 
recognized the merits of our party's initiatives and we would 
like to ask him when these very good ideas will be put into place.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Come on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> There are lots of good ideas in that little red 
book, by the way.
<P>
	We had an unprecedented eight-month consultative process 
which was rich with ideas, rich with the participation of 
Canadians from all walks of life and all regions. That is one 
important strand that certainly will impact on the ultimate 
decision that our government and this House will make in the 
levels announcement that must be made by law before 
November 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, poll 
after poll shows overwhelmingly that the majority of Canadians 
agree with the minister's department that immigration is out of 
control. Another document from the minister's department 
released earlier this summer actually agrees with that position.
<P>
	When will the minister stop holding out as one of the last lone 
defenders of a policy that a vast majority of Canadians and even 
his own officials see as being out of touch?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly better than being out 
of mind.
<P>
	That report was one of many where various departments in 
their policy directives certainly reflect on the things that were

	Canadians are looking for and deserve improvements in how 
immigration is being managed and we have begun to deliver on 
that. In fact this morning we discussed Bill C-44. I hope the

question is for the Minister of Finance. According to Statistics 
Canada, the unemployment rate rose by 0.7 per cent in Quebec 
last month and now stands at 12.2 per cent. In spite of a slight 
economic recovery, given the increase in population, Quebec 
still needs 210,000 jobs to reach its pre-recession level of 
employment.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Finance, who recently claimed to be 
waging a world economic war, modestly try to create jobs by 
taking concrete recovery measures instead of pursuing his 
policy of laissez-faire?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, since we took office, we 
have not only expressed a desire but also a capacity to improve 
the employment situation in Quebec. In fact, as we have seen in 
the last quarter, this is why economic growth has been 
strengthened since the election. During the last quarter, the rate 
of real growth in Canada was 6.4 per cent, the highest among the 
G-7 countries. I want to tell the hon. member that, in Quebec 
alone, we have created 77,000 jobs since we took office. This is 
a record over such a period of time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Finance realize that, at this pace, it will take at least 
three years just to reach the pre-recession level of employment, 
given the increase in population? Under the circumstances, is 
the minister prepared to give a boost to job creation by 
immediately reducing UI contributions, since there is a surplus, 
as the official opposition has been requesting since the minister 
himself raised these contributions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first initiative taken 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development was to 
announce that UI contributions would not only be frozen but 
reduced.

previous government, is a very serious impediment to job 
creation. Consequently, we will correct the problem.

managers throughout the government had illegally stashed $61 
million in bank accounts to be spent at their whim without the 
purview of Parliament.

while their departments blatantly break the law and stash that 
money in bank accounts without approval?

we do not sit idly by even if it is in matters that were undertaken

is a serious issue. I want to have this matter thoroughly 
investigated and in fact that is under way. I made an 
announcement to that effect earlier today.

the internal auditors in the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services are looking further at the matter of 
Canada Communication Group. We will get to the bottom of this 
and will take the appropriate corrective action. We will report 
further to this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to

by. However, the Auditor General pointed this problem out to 
him in 1992.

	The deputy comptroller general in our department has issued 
very clear guidelines to various departments that Treasury 
Board rules and regulations must be followed. The deputy

	In the last eight months this government has taken 
extraordinary conservation measures to halt the destruction of 
fish stocks on both coasts. These measures include shutting 
down entire commercial fisheries, standing up to the Americans 
on the west coast Pacific salmon treaty, and even convincing the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization to have a moratorium 
on straddling stocks on the nose and tail of the Grand Bank.
<P>
	Since NAFO is meeting again this week in my riding of 
Dartmouth to decide on next year's fishing plans, will the 
minister stay true to his course? What position will he be taking 
to the table to ensure that those stocks which are still perilously 
close to extinction are going to be protected?

arrangements, and (<I>c</I>) what proportion of the total costs of each arrangement is 
administrative?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> (a) The key 
elements of the $170* million seniors strategy have now been 
combined under a single administration in Health Canada to 
improve co-ordination among the components and ensure more 
effective management of the overall strategy. All elements of 
the strategy establish annual priorities in consultation with other 
federal programs and with stakeholders to ensure the most 
effective use of the funds. All elements of the seniors strategy 
will be evaluated by the end of the strategy to determine their 
effectiveness in meeting their intended objectives.
<P>
	(b) There are two elements of the seniors strategy which 
provide contribution funding. These are the seniors community 
programs (new horizons, seniors independence program and 
ventures) and the seniors independence research program. 
These programs all have clearly defined objectives, program 
criteria and comprehensive review processes. All funded 
projects are governed by an agreement between the project 
sponsor and Health Canada which contains details of financial 
obligations, record keeping, reports on progress and 
achievements and related matters. Projects are monitored 
throughout their lifecycle by Health Canada staff by various 
means including onsite visits and completion of progress 
reports. At the end of funding all projects must complete a basic 
evaluation and financial accounting report.
<P>
	(c) Based on the allocation as originally approved in the 
seniors stategy, the proportion of administrative costs to 
program costs is 13 per cent for the seniors community 
programs and 18 per cent for the seniors independence research 
program. The estimated administrative costs for the seniors 
community programs and for the seniors independence research 
program are based on the approved strategy funds and predate 
the merger of the seniors directorate.
<P>
	* Treasury Board approved a $170 million, five-year seniors 
strategy in April 1993. There was a small A-base for certain 
components (new horizons program and the national advisory 
council on aging). This A-base is estimated at slightly less than 
$51 million over the five-year period. These two amounts total

<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister </B><B>of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> The light 
support vehicle wheeled (LSVW) is the replacement for the 1 
1/4 ton trucks built by General Motors. The LSVW is being 
produced by Western Star Trucks Inc. (WSTI) with a contract 
cost of $224.3M.
<P>
	The LSVW has undergone one of the most comprehensive and 
thorough test programs ever undertaken by the Department of 
National Defence (DND) with a wheeled support vehicle 
system. Throughout this testing, as problems were identified, 
WSTI developed solutions and fully validated those solutions to 
DND's satisfaction. Because of these problems, the LSVW was 
judged to have failed the initial reliability, availability 
maintainability and durability (RAMD) tests conducted by DND 
in Canada. To validate the final modifications, WSTI was 
obligated to conduct a second set of RAMD tests at its expense 
at a test site fully acceptable to DND.
<P>
	To avoid delays in fielding the LSVW, it was necessary to 
change the test site to the Nevada automotive test centre (NATC) 
because snow conditions in Petawawa masked the test track 
terrain, in effect reducing its severity. The testing carried out at 
the NATC was more severe than that encountered in Canada. 
Furthermore, to thoroughly prove the modifications, operation 
was skewed so that the largest percentage of testing was over 
severe cross-country. The terrain at the NATC is rugged and 
temperatures varied considerably. The NATC is a top-notch test 
facility with a worldwide reputation which has tested some 
1,000 systems for the U.S. Department of Defense and major 
vehicle manufacturers. It is noteworthy that the LSVW has 
undergone more testing over more varied and more demanding 
conditions than any other wheeled army vehicle. This testing 
was continuously supervised by three to four Canadian forces 
engineers and technicians.
<P>
	RAMD has done its intended job of identifying problem to 
permit the Canadian army and the manufacturer to fully debug 
the equipment prior to final production. As a result of this 
second test by NATC, all modifications were proven out and the 
vehicle was found to be fully acceptable.
<P>
	The contract to NATC was paid for and managed by WSTI.

<P>
	In the meantime the Department of Health has undertaken an 
extensive consultation process with the provinces, territories 
and the health community concerning the design and 
implementation of many of the elements of our overall strategy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The Department of Health expects to present its proposals in 
the near future. Once the most effective and targeted strategy is 
finalized, funding for the various components will be allocated.
<P>
	Also, resources for 349 additional RCMP officers to perform 
anti-smuggling duties were approved as part of the 
government's action plan to combat smuggling. This means that 
there are now to be approximately 700 RCMP officers doing 
anti-smuggling work, doubling the number of officiers working 
in the area previously.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATIONACT">IMMIGRATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-44, an act to amend the Immigration Act and the Citizenship 
Act and to make a consequential amendment to the Customs 
Act, be read the second and referred to a committee; and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I give the floor to the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. I believe she has 
10 minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada's immigration program has 
contributed to a sense of Canadian identity and prosperity for 
more than 125 years.
<P>
	Our challenge, as we consider Bill C-44, is to preserve public 
support for our immigration system, support that is essential if 
we hope to maintain the humanitarian traditions that have 
earned Canada respect around the world.
<P>
	We must appreciate that the trust of Canadians is undermined 
whenever abuse, fraud, criminality raise their ugly heads. Quite 
naturally, failure to satisfactorily address the minority of cases 
of fraud and abuse will erode public confidence. It will inhibit a 
serious and reasoned discussion of immigration. If this happens, 
our future as a generous, open nation is in jeopardy.
<P>
	That is why the provisions found in Bill C-44 are so 
important. When Canadians are confident that the provisions of 
our immigration program are enforced effectively, fairly and 
without prejudice or favour, they will continue to support a 
progressive approach to immigration.
<P>
	Today there are only four countries around the world that 
receive immigrants in significant numbers. The four countries 
are Canada, Australia, the United States, and Israel, which is a 
special case. By almost any measurement, Canada ranks near the 
top in receiving immigrants and accepting people fleeing 
persecution. A major reason we have been able to respond with 
such  generosity to migration needs and international crises is 
because we have carefully maintained public support for our 
broad objectives.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Canadians have demanded with reason that their immigration 
and refugee systems be not only fair and effective but also well 
managed. Once assured, Canadians have generously supported 
Canada's commitment to meet our international obligations 
even in the present unsettled economic times.
<P>
	That is why the measures in Bill C-44 are so important. This 
bill pragmatically balances principles of fairness and tolerance 
with the principle of respect for the rule of law. It is an astute and 
sensible response to a situation that demands action. It closes 
the loopholes that unscrupulous people have exploited and gives 
our enforcement authority the tools to remove the lawbreakers 
who would abuse our system and our society.
<P>
	In closing I would like to emphasize that Bill C-44 is not 
about revenge or punishment. Instead it is about preservation, 
preservation of the tolerance for diversity. The government is 
dedicated to the integration and preservation of ethnic cultures 
in Canadian society. We have continued to see this great country 
as richer because of the contributions immigrants have made 
and continue to make in Canadian society.
<P>
	We will continue to promote and preserve ethnic cultures in a 
united and tolerant Canada. Bill C-44 will play a critical part in 
the preservation of the ideals that we hold dear.
<P>
	In speaking in support of Bill C-44, I urge all members to 
consider the importance of the measures within the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
several questions for my colleague. In particular I have several 
quotes that I picked up from her speech.
<P>
	In this day and age when we talk about immigration we 
sometimes get confused about what the intent of the issue is. 
Many sources in the Reform Party have said that we are not 
adverse to immigration, albeit we think there should be lower 
levels. That is a good issue for debate at any time in any country.
<P>
	However, in many cases we are talking about the 
problems-and I will speak a little later on this-that we are 
having with refugee boards and so on. I hear the hon. member 
say we are dealing with petty hoods. The Liberal party has this 
tendency to downplay what are the problems with the criminal 
element in the refugee system that are getting through the 
bureaucracy and coming into Canada. These are not petty hoods 
we are talking about. These are hard core criminals in some 
cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5830"> 5830 </A></B>
<P>
	When this party talks about how to deal with these individuals 
we are told things like: ``Well, it's only a few. It's only a 
minority''. We have to look at the Canadian victim, the 
Canadian citizen.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on how many criminal 
element refugees we get in this country. What makes it a 
majority? What makes it a significant number? When is the 
government going to start dealing with that problem? There are 
a lot of victims in the wake of some of these individuals. The 
government has to look at this. I would like a comment on what 
constitutes something serious.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the member should be 
presenting the kind of statistics that he is asking for on the 
nature of the crime, the nature of violence and other acts 
committed by immigrants in our various communities.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The member also seems to be confused about the issues. On 
the one hand he says that we should do this, that we support this. 
On the other hand, he seems to be arguing against himself. It is 
important to note that what we see on the front pages of our 
newspapers on a daily basis is that the criminal acts committed 
by people who come into the system and people who abuse the 
system are not massive numbers of individuals.
<P>
	The intent of Bill C-44 is really to ensure that the loopholes 
that allow those individuals in and the process by which we get 
the individuals quickly away from our shores, are the issues that 
are important for this discussion. There are so many other things 
that the member should want to deal with but chooses to make 
the connection between refugees and criminality or immigrants 
and criminality. To continue to put the two together all the time 
seems to me to be doing a disservice to Canadians who are 
contributing members of this society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's remarks. 
Being a fellow Toronto member, I realize how much she has 
been seized with this issue. We spend about 70 per cent of our 
time dealing with matters relating to immigration. It is very 
important that we get this bill right.
<P>
	The minister in his remarks this morning said that a criminal 
element has infiltrated the department of immigration and that 
we were going to clean up that criminal element and make some 
constructive amendments to this act.
<P>
	What I am concerned about is the following. What happens to 
the legitimate claimant who might, as he or she is going through 
this process, run into one of those types who the minister 
described as the criminal element and that person feels that he or 
she gets unfair treatment? What will we do during this debate to 
make sure that there is also an accountability within the 
officialdom in the department of immigration?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me in reading the 
bill that the intent is really to take away the discretionary powers 
that are presently in the system.
<P>
	When there are clear rules, when there are clear guidelines, 
when there are administrative processes that ensure that an 
individual acts in a specific fashion, those measures take away 
discretionary powers and what could be considered ways of 
dealing with individuals in a fashion that could be called unfair.
<P>
	It is important to say that the situation we see in urban 
Canada, the situations that the hon. member refers to in terms of 
Toronto, the situations in which we could use, as the member 
across the way objected to, the terminology that they are really 
an element of a minority group of people whose activities are 
considered nothing more than hoodlum, whose activities could 
be considered nothing more than destructive not only to 
themselves but also to their community and society in general.
<P>
	It is important that in looking at Bill C-44 we ensure that we 
support this so that fairness is in the system, the rules are clear, 
the procedures are laid out and there are members of the 
department and those who deal with the criminal element know 
precisely how to act.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore 
on her speech. I have some concerns and I was wondering if the 
hon. member could briefly answer a few of them for me.
<P>
	We all know that Canada is the envy of the world. The bill 
deals with serious criminals. It tells them specifically that they 
cannot come to Canada which I think is a move in the right 
direction.
<P>
	If we are the envy of the world and if we have the ability 
within our immigration system to choose the best people to 
come to our country, ones who are willing to abide by the laws of 
Canada, why would we say we will not allow people in if they 
have committed a crime that would warrant a sentence of 10 
years or more in Canada? Why are we allowing any criminals 
into the country? It seems ludicrous.
<P>
	I heard the minister mention the word accountability several 
times in his speech. This is not accountability. This is not what 
Canadian people from coast to coast to coast are asking for. 
They want law-abiding people to come and live in our country 
without this ridiculous nonsense of 10 years.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, to say that we 
allow criminals to come into the country and not to differentiate 
between conventional refugees is how the discussion gets into 
the emotional arena.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5831"> 5831 </A></B>
<P>
	Immigrants go through police checks and all kinds of 
processes before they are even allowed to complete 
documentation. To roll everything together and to say that we 
are doing what we are asking for or what the member is asking 
for is to make certain kinds of judgments. We are the envy of the 
world, the number one country in which anyone would choose to 
live. We find it is an avenue most individuals outside our 
borders would like to enter.
<P>
	It is also important to note that at this point in time we are not 
just an open system where anyone who wishes may come here. 
Too often we hear being tossed about across the way that the 
system is such that anyone may come here. There are guidelines. 
There are rules. There are things within the system. We need to 
be able to differentiate between refugees, people who are 
fleeing, people who are coming to our shores as a result of 
international agreements, and people who are coming here as a 
result of family reunification, support systems, applications and 
other things. We roll so many things together that the discussion 
becomes almost confusing.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions or 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois, I will attempt, at this 
second reading stage, to highlight some questions that Bill C-44 
raises. But before doing so, I would like to discuss the 
philosophy underlying the legislative amendments that we are 
debating today.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced in 
June that he intended to make considerable amendments to the 
Immigration Act in order to, and I quote: ``take all measures 
necessary to prevent abuses and to protect the Canadian public 
against criminals''.
<P>
	We are very pleased with that. Nobody, and least of all the 
members from the Official opposition, would blame a 
government for trying to protect its citizens. So, the ministerial 
position is that immigrants and people claiming refugee status 
cannot use Canadian laws or Canada's reputation as a 
welcoming country to escape their own country when they have 
committed serious crimes or to commit new crimes here. We 
agree with that measure.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We also recognize the importance of a quick and efficient 
enforcement of deportation measures if we are to prevent 
criminals from committing other crimes. Thus, there is in this 
House a rare and remarkable unanimity on the objective, that is 
the protection of Canadian citizens. However, as nothing is ever 
perfect, we will reserve our judgment for now on the means 
chosen by the government for reaching that goal. Many issues 
are not quite clear to us yet. For example, we wonder about the 
seriousness of criminality and the link between crime and the 
immigration process. We also question the motivation behind 
government's actions.  Finally, we would like to see the 
proposed means analyzed thoroughly.
<P>
	First of all, let me reassure my colleagues of the House and 
tell them that I share their indignation towards the crimes 
committed daily in Canada and in Quebec. All our efforts should 
be directed to abolishing, or at least reducing crime.
<P>
	On the other hand, I do not feel it would be appropriate to take 
into account the public response to criminal acts, and 
particularly violent crimes, in order to adopt repressive and 
unjustified legislation. The question is of interest and deserves 
our attention.
<P>
	Every day, in this House and outside, we hear detailed 
descriptions of crimes. We also hear about people denouncing 
the increasing criminality in our society. And then, some people 
make a connection between criminality and the immigration 
process. What is the reality?
<P>
	Even if people have the feeling that the crime rate is 
increasing, such is not the case. It has been demonstrated in a 
study on victimization published by Statistics Canada. That 
document states that the possibility of being a victim of 
aggression or theft was the same in 1993 as in 1989. Moreover, 
another study from the same agency called <I>Statistics on 
Criminality in Canada, 1993</I> concludes that for the second year 
in a row, the crime rate established by police organizations went 
down in 1993. In fact, the 5 per cent reduction from one year to 
the next was the largest since we began collecting statistics on 
crime, in 1962.
<P>
	The author of the study, who is the senior analyst for the 
policing program, explains that the very violent crime rate is 
slightly lower whereas a slight increase in less violent crimes 
was noted as well as a reduction of about 6 per cent in property 
crimes.
<P>
	Therefore, we can see, in spite of popular belief, that there 
was no increase in the crime rate. As I said, I do not want to 
trivialize criminal acts, but simply set the record straight. I 
think, however, that we would be justified to ask ourselves why 
people feel that way. We can perhaps find the answer in the 
importance given by the media or the politicians to some 
individual cases.
<P>
	Let us go back now to the subject of the debate, that is 
criminality among the immigrant population. An Angus Reid 
opinion poll published in June examined the perceived 
relationship between ethnic origin and crime rate. The results 
were interesting.
<P>
	First, the pollster noticed a significant difference between the 
western and eastern parts of Canada. In Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan, 58 per cent of those polled saw a relation 
between a person's ethnic origin and criminal activities. This 
proportion dropped to 36 per cent in the Atlantic provinces. So 
there is a considerable geographic difference.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5832"> 5832 </A></B>
<P>
	Another difference was perceived in the way men and women 
see the issue. While 56 per cent of men associated ethnic origin 
with criminal activity, only 45 per cent of women agreed. The 
division is almost the same between seniors and people under 
35, that is 55 per cent compared to 46 per cent.
<P>
	While the perceived association is well established, could it 
be mistaken? Such is the conclusion of Mr. Derrick Thomas, 
senior researcher for the Citizenship and Immigration 
Department.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Last year, Mr. Thomas published the results of research he had 
done on the relationship between ethnic origin and a tendency 
towards criminality. He found no proof that such a relationship 
exists. On the contrary, immigrants, who last year represented 
20.2 per cent of Canadians, accounted for only 11.9 per cent of 
people in detention or on parole. This is a significant difference, 
and compels us to reject any attempt to link immigration to 
crime.
<P>
	At this time, it is proper to remind the House that the minister 
of that same organization is the very one who wants to impose 
new standards with the express objective of preventing abuses 
of the system by immigrants.
<P>
	Another point also deserves some consideration: the 
immigrants' level of education. Experts generally agree that 
socioeconomic conditions can sometimes be criminality 
factors. So, the poor with a low level of education are more 
likely to increase the crime figures. Yet, according to Statistics 
Canada, more immigrants have university degrees than 
individuals born in Canada-3 per cent more. Moreover, 
immigrants who arrived between 1981 and 1991 had more 
schooling than immigrants who arrived before 1981.
<P>
	From all these figures, we can draw the following 
conclusions: first, there is no real link with the perception that 
the crime rate is increasing in Canada. Second, there is no link 
between immigration and crime; on the contrary, immigrants 
commit fewer crimes than people born in Canada. Finally, if we 
are to believe that the more people are educated the less they 
commit crime, immigrants will be less and less represented in 
crime statistics.
<P>
	As was already said, we wonder about the underlying motives 
for these legislative amendments. Is the government trying to 
put to rest the fears of the public? We know these fears are real. 
Indeed, according to the Angus Reid poll mentioned earlier, 82 
per cent of the respondents believe our justice system is not 
strict enough. English Canadians rated crime as their second 
biggest concern, immediately following unemployment and job 
creation. In Quebec, however, crime rated much lower and only 
came after economic revival, education and social services.
<P>
	Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to mention how Quebec society is 
distinct, even in this area. This high percentage shows how 
much the public fears for its own security. The government took 
note of it and has introduced, since its coming to power, several 
pieces of legislation to strengthen the rules concerning 
criminals.
<P>
	Fine. However, we have to ask ourselves if this is the most 
efficient way to curb crime. Since socio economic conditions 
are an important factor, we are entitled to wonder if real 
measures to create jobs would not be more appropriate. We are 
entitled to wonder if the direction taken by this government is 
not more political than functional. Why, indeed, is nothing done 
to ensure that young people can find jobs when they get out of 
school? Why is nothing done to provide poor families with 
decent housing? Why is nothing done to really ensure women 
are safe in our society?
<P>
	The issue of women is very important here. Women whose 
security is often threatened know that the threat does not come 
from immigrants or young people. But the government is 
attacking these two categories of people. There is a problem 
here and it raises some questions.
<P>
	We are also questioning the measures proposed to meet the 
objectives of protecting the public and preventing abuse. Bill 
C-44 focuses on four main subjects: crime among refugee 
claimants, the contraband of immigration documents, the right 
of appeal and the processing of claims coming from 
rehabilitated persons. For each of the problems identified, 
measures are proposed whose final purpose is to screen out 
persons who committed serious crimes or who try to abuse the 
system.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, we agree that the laws 
must be respected. However, the means proposed by the minister 
to promote that need a closer look.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	We think that some of these need to be seriously re-examined 
to see if the government is not trying to kill a fly with a sledge 
hammer. First of all, it wants to limit access to our refugee status 
determination process so that a person who has been convicted 
of a serious crime in another country will not be able to apply for 
refugee status.
<P>
	At first glance, this restriction seems logical. Nobody wants 
Canada to become a haven for criminals. But it raises some 
questions. Some experts in immigration law have expressed 
concern over this restriction, particularly in light of the Geneva 
Convention on Refugees.
<P>
	We think that the bill will need to be seriously examined in 
order to ensure that Canada respects the spirit and the letter of 
the Geneva convention. Other questions have been raised 
concerning the right to appeal the Immigration and Refugee 
Board's decisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5833"> 5833 </A></B>
<P>
	Another provision that could be a problem is the one 
concerning documents. Immigration officers will now be able to 
seize and open all documents and objects suspected of being 
used for fraud, and this will be possible anywhere in Canada. 
The first question that comes to mind immediately is the 
possibility of a violation under the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
	How will this new provision be received by the courts? How 
will they receive the reversal of the burden of proof in clause 18? 
We know that the courts have a tendency to resist legislative 
provisions in which a person is presumed guilty. Will the 
Minister not have any other solutions to reduce trafficking in 
immigration documents?
<P>
	How do we justify seizing items without even trying to define 
their nature in any way? Those are, briefly put, the questions and 
concerns raised by Bill C-44. We do know that the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigrations will take them up 
one by one in order to improve this piece of legislation.
<P>
	However, by way of conclusion, I would like to remind this 
House that all these legislative amendments seem to draw their 
first motivation from isolated cases such as that of Mr. Gayle, of 
Toronto. The objective pursued by the Minister is to ensure that 
criminals are not welcomed into Canada. Foreign criminals will 
be turned away and immigrants and refugees who commit 
serious crimes in Canada will be deported.
<P>
	But we will have to deal with more contentious cases like 
those where a person has been living in Canada since childhood. 
Will we expel to his or her country of origin a person who does 
not have that country's citizenship? Surely not. How can we 
seriously think that a person who came to Canada at the age of 
three and is now an adult still has links with his or her country of 
origin? How will the courts apply such a policy?
<P>
	We agree that the security of Canadian citizens must be 
protected. However, we believe that we have first of all to 
determine what is the source of this threat to security. We then 
have to determine what are the most efficient and the most 
respectful means to be adopted in order to protect citizens and to 
welcome people in need, a category to which bona fide refugees 
undoubtedly belong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont):</B> Mr. Speaker and dear 
colleagues, the bill before us is an ideal opportunity to show 
Canadians that we take their interests to heart and that we abide 
by our electoral commitments.
<P>
	I want to speak here not only to members of our government, 
but also and more particularly to members of the opposition. 
Since this bill was introduced, practically not a week has gone 
by without the media mentioning the immigration issue one way 
or another. Headlines are not heartening, because our system is 
not judged on its achievements but on its failures. That is 
unfortunate, because our system has its successes and  plenty of 
them. For each case of fraud or crime that makes the headlines, 
thousands of cases of successful integration go unreported.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Most of the refugees and immigrants who live with us are so 
well integrated that nobody notices them. I do not need to give 
any examples. Just look around you.
<P>
	The owner of your favourite restaurant, your daughter's 
computer instructor, your cousin's husband or your dentist, for 
example, may well be immigrants, but you probably do not 
notice it any more. Canadian society is often compared to a 
cultural mosaic, and I think this is confirmed in our everyday 
life. When you meet all these people, ask them what they think 
today of the cheaters and criminals who make the headlines.
<P>
	When a person has left his country to start a new life, when he 
has started from nothing to build a future for himself, when he 
has finally succeeded in carving a place for himself in society, it 
must be insulting, to say the least, to be associated with someone 
who has committed criminal acts and who, in so doing, shows 
that he has no respect whatsoever for the country which 
welcomed him.
<P>
	This explains why this bill is so important and so dear to our 
government. Of course, we must ensure that no one flouts our 
laws and our immigration system. But, more importantly 
maybe, we must protect the reputation of all decent people, 
those same people whom we represent, whatever our political 
affiliation.
<P>
	Some will say that our bill goes too far, that it could be 
detrimental to refugees and immigrants acting in good faith. 
Others will say that it is too little too late, that it will not stop 
criminals from entering into Canada and staying here. Our 
government expects such criticism. However, as a responsible 
government, we had above all to avoid going to extremes, and I 
sincerely believe that we have succeeded in doing so.
<P>
	Of course, the law must be merciless for cheaters and 
criminals, but it must not penalize those who are most in need of 
our help. The measures we are debating today are aimed at a 
very small minority of individuals. If we had the slightest doubt 
that they could be harmful to people acting in good faith, we 
would not go ahead with this bill, that goes without saying.
<P>
	On the contrary, what could be most harmful to them is not the 
measures we are debating today, but the actions of a few 
criminals. Unfortunately, one instance is enough to tarnish the 
reputation of all refugees as far as some Canadians are 
concerned. One instance is enough to lead other criminals to 
think Canada is wide open.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5834"> 5834 </A></B>
<P>
	We do not want to give the impression that immigrants and 
refugees are a threat to the security of our country. That is not 
true, and that is why now, as my hon. colleague said before, 
immigration is not the responsibility of a department of public 
security but a Department of Citizenship and Immigration. We 
want to show that we can be open when warranted but 
uncompromising when necessary.
<P>
	We are prepared to open our doors to those who really need 
our help, not to just anyone. First of all, we must prevent 
criminals from claiming refugee status or appealing decisions 
by the IRB.
<P>
	The system for recognition of refugee status was not put in 
place to delay deportation measures. We know what is going on 
out there, and we have no time or money to waste on criminals.
<P>
	We also want to use this bill to deal with the problem of 
multiple claims for refugee status.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Anyone can make a mistake, and some claimants may assume 
that if they move, they have to submit a second claim. That we 
can understand. However, some people think they can confuse 
the authorities and delay their removal by submitting two or 
more claims. We must also be able to seize certain documents 
which those who cheat the system send by international mail. 
Immigration officers need additional tools to be able to do their 
job satisfactorily, and we, as a responsible government, intend 
to give them those tools. Customs officers must be able to search 
the mail and seize any forged documents they find.
<P>
	We must also prevent criminals from taking advantage of 
legal loopholes. For instance, immigration officers can arrest a 
person who violates the Immigration Act, but in some cases, 
they cannot issue a warrant so the RCMP can arrest that person. 
In this area, we need all the help we can get. If cheaters set up 
networks, we must have the tools to deal with them.
<P>
	Finally, we believe that the minister is still the best judge of 
whether dangerous criminals should be admitted to Canada on 
so-called humanitarian grounds. This makes sense, since in the 
final instances, the minister has to live with the consequences of 
his decision to quash a removal order which concerns a criminal. 
Under the bill, this authority will rest with the minister in the 
best interest of all Canadians. We believe that these new 
provisions are fair and equitable. To those who find that this bill 
does not go far enough, I say: tell us, tell Canadians who else 
should be included in this new legislation.
<P>
	I know a few who would undoubtedly have a list as long as 
your arm of people to send back for reasons which I would call 
arbitrary. This is not the purpose of the government. As I said 
before, we are not extremists. This bill deals not with the 
number but with the kind of people to be deported.
<P>
	We are going after people who defraud our social services and 
criminals who truly pose a threat to our security and that of our 
police forces whose job it is to protect us. The processing of 
citizenship applications is suspended pending the outcome of 
the immigration inquiry. People who have nothing to hide will 
have nothing to fear. Their application will not be turned down, 
its processing will only de delayed. People subject to an 
exclusion order, who had already been accepted as permanent 
residents, will lose that status. Up to now, this applied only to 
people being deported. It will no longer be true under the new 
bill.
<P>
	To those who say that our bill goes too far, I say: Canadians 
are good-hearted but not weak-hearted. We would do a 
disservice to everyone, including bona fide refugees, by letting 
things drag on forever. No matter which side of the House we are 
on, each one of us represents Canadians who expect us to act 
now and in their best interest. They also expect us to take the 
necessary steps to enforce our laws. They are quite willing to 
open their doors to the victims of the various disasters which 
devastate our world, but not to criminals. They also expect that 
the efforts and resources that we spend to welcome refugees 
benefit those who need them most. The days of time and money 
being consumed by a handful of wrongdoers are gone forever. 
Canadians expect us to implement a trust-worthy immigration 
policy. To this end, we must show them that we know the 
difference between wright and wrong. In fact, we must show 
them that our government is a responsible one.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Our government has decided that it needed the means to 
respond to the expectations of Canadians. Bill C-44, presently 
before the House, is the one from which we expect the most. The 
measures we propose are aimed at providing specific solutions 
to specific problems.
<P>
	This is not a bill prepared in a hurry, without any distinction 
between the majority of true refugees and immigrants, and a 
minority of abusers and criminals. Why go to such lengths for 
ten, twenty or a hundred unscrupulous individuals? Simply 
because one is enough to end the life of a person, ruin the lives of 
his or her family, upset their friends and relatives, and harm a 
whole cultural community. This is the objective of some of the 
measures in the bill.
<P>
	The shock wave is being felt from one end of the country to 
the other, it reaches the ordinary citizens, as well as their elected 
representatives and their police forces. Who is to blame: 
society, you and me, our police? No, the culprits are the ten, 
twenty, or hundred individuals that we should expel without 
delay. If we do not do it, Mr. Speaker, ten, twenty or a hundred 
more will come in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5835"> 5835 </A></B>
<P>
	As you know, our government is convinced of the value of 
immigration for Canada. We believe that Canada should 
preserve its reputation of openness towards refugees, but we 
also believe that our policy towards immigrants and refugees 
should be strictly controlled in order to protect all Canadians.
<P>
	I will conclude by comparing these abusers and criminals to 
the weeds that very often, not to say always, invade our gardens. 
They very quickly encroach on the space reserved for the 
vegetables we intended to grow and, when the time to harvest 
comes and the weeds have taken over, we wonder whether we 
should not have kept the lawn. Let us not deprive ourselves of 
the fruit we could harvest. Let us pull out the weeds that are 
trying to take root and let us make sure that we have the tools 
necessary to take care of our gardens. This is the way to build a 
better Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech of my colleague from Outremont and I 
think that many people of immigrant origin will be very 
surprised at the tone of this speech, which seems to be 
anti-immigration. He tells us that ten or a hundred people cheat. 
Do you think it is worth passing a very controversial bill to solve 
five or ten cases that could have been solved administratively, 
without the need for a very controversial bill which is criticized 
by immigration lawyers, by the Canadian Council for Refugees 
and by the churches?
<P>
	You mentioned mail from abroad. Customs officers will be 
able to examine such mail. Immigration officers will be able to 
seize such mail. Who will say, ``We will open this letter and not 
that one''? Do you not think that there will be abuses? 
Throughout the world, the mail is inviolable. How could you go 
so far as to allow ordinary officials who are not judges and not 
trained in law to seize mail? Can you answer me?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, listen, we are in Canada, in a 
society that is called free and democratic and we are also, first 
and foremost, in a society of law. I think that the bill before this 
House reflects the intentions of a responsible government.
<P>
	As you know, some people in society demand the most 
extreme things on one side or the other. Of course, in this case, 
some people would not have wanted us to legislate and others 
would have wanted us to pass draconian legislation.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	This Liberal government has chosen a middle way, a solution 
that we call reasonable. I am surprised that my colleague seems 
to be shocked by this reasonable solution or seems to find the 
measures that we are taking extreme. On the contrary, the 
measures we are taking are meant above all to protect as well 
those who apply to Canada as a land of refuge so that they can 
join the great Canadian family.
<P>
	As I said in my speech, often a single instance of 
misbehaviour or a single criminal act is enough to tarnish or ruin 
the reputation of a whole community. As the member for 
Outremont, I must say that many new Canadians live in the 
western part of my riding and I am particularly proud of them; 
they have integrated very well into Canada and they are well 
integrated in Quebec and in their community; they live 
peacefully. From being with them, I know how fragile the 
reputation of these communities is, unfortunately.
<P>
	I am glad-and I am pleased-to join the minister of 
immigration in promoting this bill by which people who really 
need Canada's help as a welcoming country, a land of refuge, 
will be able to find a fair and equitable society that can receive 
them well, a country of refuge that can screen out what I would 
call undesirables at its borders.
<P>
	I do not fear abuses, far from it. I am still a little surprised that 
my colleague from Bourassa said that we are letting ordinary 
officials decide. I want to tell you, Mr. Nunez, that since my 
election on October 25, I have had the opportunity to frequent 
what we call public servants and I can tell you that in many cases 
they are extremely competent people who see things much better 
than you or I do. I am glad to give them a little more power, 
provided that it is not used arbitrarily, and the Minister of 
Immigration has been very careful about that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Let the hon. member for Outremont be 
reminded that hon. members are not to be referred to by name 
but rather by the name of their riding. I know that this is our first 
day of sitting, and that he will give due consideration to this 
matter in future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to speak on this bill today. This subject has 
been of interest to me over the last several months. Today I am 
going to speak about a particular case I have been involved with, 
a fellow by the name of José Salinas Mendoza and when I am 
through I think everyone will be quite appalled at what goes on 
in this country. Prior to talking about Mr. Mendoza, I should 
comment on some of the previous statements I have heard today.
<P>
	Once again I am hearing comments that this is a very small 
minority of the intake into this country and of course it is. This 
Liberal government has taken in 250,000 to 280,000 immigrants 
a year. While we disagree with that high a number, we do not 
disagree with the basic fundamentals of immigration in our 
society. It seems every time we raise this kind of issue the 
government comes up with statistics and demographics to show 
it is such a small minority so why bother with it.
<P>
	It reminds me of a discussion I had with a parole board 
member not too long ago. I actually called for the resignations of 
several parole board members after they let an individual out on 
the streets when he was supposed to be incarcerated for six 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5836"> 5836 </A></B>
<P>
years. He was released after  about 16 months and then 
proceeded to bludgeon somebody to death in our community.
<P>
	On calling for these resignations I received a phone call from 
an individual whose response was that in that region there was 
an 83 per cent success rate. I told him that was commendable but 
the facts were that I deal with the failure rate. The victims come 
to my office. There are victims all over this country. I wish we 
could get off the discussion of the success rate and the rest of it 
is a minor issue because that is not the case.
<P>
	Today the minister said we have a good system. We do not 
have a good system. It has flaws in it. So fix it.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Today the minister said that we have a tiny minority, a handful 
of criminals. The problem is that we have a serious, serious 
problem with that tiny minority of individuals who are 
disrupting law-abiding Canadian citizens. The minister said he 
is listening to his constituents. I think he is listening to the 
Reform Party because we are going to push and push and push 
again until it is changed.
<P>
	Today the minister asked why this system was not in place 
before now. We should ask the Liberal government. It brought it 
in. Wake up over there.
<P>
	We also have to ask where this legislation deals with the 
independence of the immigration adjudicators and how we deal 
with the independence of the refugee board. As I go through the 
José Salinas Mendoza case they are going to find they are too 
independent for their own good and they are going to have to be 
held accountable. It is the same as parole boards.
<P>
	When we talk about the deportation of individuals, where 
does the legislation address the fact that people like Charles 
Dennis Martin were deported and escorted out of Canada nine 
times? Does the legislation address that? There are a lot more of 
them. This is only one and again he was in my community.
<P>
	What about cases that are currently under way? Is this 
retroactive? There are many people in this system who are going 
through time and time again, hearing after hearing. We will 
cover that again in a moment.
<P>
	While it is nice to talk about immigration and its positive 
influence on Canada I want to talk about the negative influence. 
One of those negative influences is José Salinas Mendoza who 
arrived in Canada from El Salvador in 1988. From February 22, 
1989 until November 1992 he had 12 serious criminal 
convictions in this country including assault, resisting arrest, 
sexual assault, and on and on the list goes.
<P>
	On September 23, 1993 a 19-year old young lady in my riding 
was raped. This young lady was convinced to have the charges 
stayed on the condition that Mr. Mendoza be deported and he 
was. He was escorted out of Canada. End of story?-not quite. 
On April 18, 1994, just a few short months later, Mr. Mendoza 
was back at the Douglas border crossing just outside Vancouver. 
He announced  himself as a refugee into Canada this time 
around. The immigration officials processed his application and 
the story starts again.
<P>
	Unfortunately the young lady in my neighbourhood virtually 
bumped into this fellow in a grocery store shortly afterward. She 
had not even been given the courtesy by immigration officials or 
anybody else of being notified that he was back in Canada after 
being deported. Why is he even back in Canada after being 
deported? Why do we not say: ``Get out. We have already 
deported you once''? Maybe it is going to be like Charles Dennis 
Martin who was escorted out nine times.
<P>
	Mr. Mendoza was arrested. His first hearing was on May 13 
this year. He was told to report for another hearing on June 17.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	By the way, all taxpayers should know that the people at the 
hearings are immigration adjudicators, an interpreter for Mr. 
Mendoza, a lawyer who I believe is paid by legal aid, a refugee 
hearing officer at refugee hearings and, at the request of the 
criminal, an individual from the United Nations as an observer. 
They are all paid with taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	Two days after his arrival and two days after this young lady 
saw him again in a grocery store, the RCMP advised her that he 
is back in the country. A friend of mine asked me to help. On 
June 17 I attended an immigration hearing at which Mr. 
Mendoza from El Salvador was considered a danger to the 
public. He was incarcerated pending a refugee hearing on 
August 18. This is a fellow who had already been booted out of 
the country. However, his lawyer appealed that decision to have 
him incarcerated as a danger to the public and brought in a new 
immigration adjudicator who seven days later let him out on the 
street.
<P>
	What do we have now? We are into our third hearing on this 
fellow after he has been ordered deported. He is allowed to roam 
our streets. He has 12 prior convictions and an outstanding 
charge of sexual assault or rape.
<P>
	On June 22 of this year he appeared in Matsqui court on 
relayed sexual assault charges. He was not ordered into custody. 
On June 24, I say again, he was released. On June 17 the hon. 
minister of immigration came out on his white horse to 
Vancouver and said: ``I'll intervene in this. We'll take charge''. 
We have not seen hide nor hair of him since. This is a question he 
will be asked here this month.
<P>
	On July 5 we did a little research on this fellow. We found that 
a person involved in last year's election campaign of the failed 
Liberal candidate of North Vancouver who donated money to the 
Liberal Party was appointed by the minister of immigration to 
the refugee board. This individual is a past lawyer for José 
Mendoza.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5837"> 5837 </A></B>
<P>
	What is happening here? Who gets appointed to refugee 
boards? Who gets appointed as immigration adjudicators? 
Liberal political hacks are the people who get appointed. What 
are their qualifications? Are the qualifications that we give 
money or we help the party? What are the qualifications? Is it 
who you know or how good you are at it? It happens all the time. 
Look at the last three senators, senators until age 75. It is who 
you know in the Liberal Party, is it not?
<P>
	Let's move along. We had amendments to the Immigration 
Act in direct response to the issues that Reform has been 
bringing out. The presentation of the Liberal Party is: ``Listen, 
don't worry too too much about this small issue over here. We 
have to think about the big picture of immigration. You have to 
think about both issues, the good people and the bad people''.
<P>
	August 18 was the date for the refugee hearing for Mr. 
Mendoza.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I found out that an application is going forth to have it closed 
to the public. I filed an application to have it open to the public. 
Instead of having a refugee hearing on August 18, we have a 
hearing to determine whether the public should be allowed in the 
hearing. Now we are getting ridiculous. We are already into the 
third hearing and this will be the fourth for this fellow.
<P>
	The meeting again had eight people involved in it who were 
paid by the taxpayer. Before I was allowed into this hearing, I 
had to sign a document that said that I would not tell anything 
about what was going on on the inside. I signed it to get in. Once 
I signed the document, I got some documents back. One was a 
complaint from Mr. Mendoza and his lawyer that I had some 
information on him that I should not. It was a complaint to the 
privacy commissioner. Now I am under investigation by the 
very person who should not be in the country in the first place.
<P>
	I checked with the privacy commissioner's office and was 
told yes, I would be investigated. I said: ``Yes, maybe I will but 
you will do it in public, not behind closed doors''. Then I 
checked with the refugee board and said this. ``I got these 
documents after I signed the gag order. Can I show this to 
people? Can I show them what the charges are?'' ``No, you 
cannot''. No, I cannot. I am not allowed to defend myself but he 
can. Why should I not be able to?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> You are just an MP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I am just an MP.
<P>
	I had our immigration critic come to the refugee hearing but 
he was not allowed in. He was told to get out. When I got into the 
meeting at nine o'clock in the morning a summons was tabled to 
make me a witness to that hearing and future hearings.
<P>
	I found out that if I was a witness I could not attend the whole 
hearing. Therefore they got me out. I said that I needed some 
counsel. I was given 20 minutes in Vancouver to get it. This is a 
federally constituted refugee board. I went outside and gave our 
critic 25 cents and he was then my counsel inside. They were 
now stuck with the two of us in there and we were not moving 
out of there.
<P>
	These hearings went on three times and there is another one 
coming up. We thought we would have one hearing to determine 
whether the next hearing could be in public but we found that we 
had three separate hearings. One, the minister of immigration 
filed an appeal on the decision that one of the second 
immigration adjudicators allowed this fellow out on the streets. 
That is going to occur September 28.
<P>
	There is another one on November 3. That is a criminal court 
case for the sexual assault of the young lady. It is a separate one. 
On November 14 our Reform critic and myself will still be 
battling to get the public involved in the exercise.
<P>
	The members on the other side sanctimoniously talk about 
how good the system is working, how well it is working. These 
people are a very small minority. Is this accurate? The members 
over there had better wake up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Ask the question. I don't understand a damn thing 
you are saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The comment I get from a 
Liberal member over here is he does not understand a damn 
thing I am saying. He is absolutely right. He does not understand 
what I am saying. The system is not working. Get it through your 
heads. This is an industry that is feeding on itself.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I do hope I have some questions because I am looking forward 
to a little debate on this with this weak minded Liberal group 
here. Let us go back to the basics. Let us go back to the 
fundamentals.
<P>
	This individual has had far too many taxpayers' dollars for the 
good of the Canadian taxpayer. He does not deserve it. For 
anyone with 12 criminal charges who has been deported from 
this country to walk back in and have a young lady hiding and 
cringing is wrong. It is wrong to be spending dollar after dollar 
after dollar on this kind of exercise. We are sick and tired of it 
and we are not going to take that any more.

	Pursuant to Standing Order 38 I must advise the House that 
the question that will be on the adjournment debate this evening 
is the following: the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona-transportation subsidies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say I 
had trouble following the arguments of the member for Fraser 
Valley West as to why he would not support Bill C-44 which 
attempts to deal with some of the abuses that occur.
<P>
	What we heard today from the member for Fraser Valley West 
is typical of the Reform Party. It is typical because all of last 
year we heard how there was a tremendous crisis and that the 
crime rate was going up dramatically. We heard it every day here 
in the House of Commons from the members of the Reform 
Party only to find out that crime has actually gone down.
<P>
	This is typical. They want to take the worst possible scenario 
and bring it forward in this House. I think it is totally 
irresponsible. It is playing on the fears of Canadians. Why do 
they not talk about the contributions of immigrants to this 
community? Why do they not talk about the immigrants in this 
House who are contributing, as many of them are? Why does he 
not talk about them? Instead they want to take the worst possible 
examples, and this is the worst kind of politics of fear that you 
can have.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> They should be more responsible in ensuring 
that we get the true picture of the reality instead of painting 
distorted pictures about immigrants who contribute 
tremendously to Canadian society.
<P>
	The minister by bringing forward Bill C-44 is acting 
responsibly to ensure that where individuals are abusing the 
system they are dealt with in a constructive way, and I applaud 
the minister for bringing this forward.
<P>
	Instead of hearing constructive suggestions from the member 
opposite he wants to give the most extreme examples, not to 
highlight the reality of it but to distort what the reality of the 
situation is. Knowing the riding that he comes from, I would 
think he would act in a much more responsible way, as expected 
by his constituents.
<P>
	If he is truly interested in contributing, he will support Bill 
C-44, go along with the government side and get this bill 
through as quickly as possible so we can deal with abuses that 
exist. We have to recognize that that is a very small number 
when you look at the total number of immigrants that come into 
this country, immigrants who contribute and work very hard. In 
his own riding they are contributing to the farming community 
which is very dominant. The faster we can get this through the 
better so that we can deal with some of his concerns. I am sure he 
will see that through.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
discouraging when we get comments like those. I made a point 
of prefacing my remarks today by saying that we agree 
immigration is healthy. We agree with it.
<P>
	I come from a community with a lot of immigrants. However I 
was talking about what we do not agree with. It is necessary to 
bring to the attention of this group here the problems involved in 
the refugee process. Yes, the bill goes some way toward that but 
there are still problems. I laid them out. I know the hon. member 
does not understand but that is what gets Liberals elected 
nowadays. They do not understand things.
<P>
	Let us not cloak the issue of serious criminal immigrants in 
the country under the positive aspects of immigration. There are 
some serious concerns and they are in virtually every riding. I 
can assure the House that José Salinas Mendoza is not the only 
one in my community. In the wake of these it is not only one 
criminal immigrant. I have already said this guy has 12 criminal 
convictions. There is a string of victims. There are all kinds of 
them.
<P>
	There is not much sense in talking further to the people over 
there. They have a majority government. They will put through 
what they want to put through. They will leave out the tough 
aspects as they did on the Young Offenders Act. There has not 
really been any toughness in anything they have legislated 
including the budget.
<P>
	I tell them to go to it. We will see them in the next election. 
Then we will talk some real turkey on who is doing better, them 
or us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Is it 10 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I have to address this point 
about 10 per cent in the polls. I do not know who draws the polls, 
but I can assure them that if they take a little walk where I come 
from they will not even be on the map. They will not even be on 
the list of who is in a poll. They should not tell me about how 
they are doing. They are not doing so well in a lot of aspects. 
These laws they are trying to write here are weak. They are 
poorly motivated.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> A point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Did the hon. member use the word laws 
or was it another word that is unparliamentary? If it was the 
second I would be grateful if he would withdraw it. Was it laws?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, what was I 
supposed to have said?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It was a four-letter word beginning 
with <I>l</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I thought I said laws.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5839"> 5839 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thought the hon. member was using 
the word laws. Am I correct in that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Yes, that is right.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. The word of an hon. 
member is always taken.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to be able to speak today in support of the legislation to 
amend the Immigration Act.
<P>
	Let me start by saying that it is interesting to hear the 
comments of the opposition. On the one side we are becoming 
heartless by going too far and on the other side we are not doing 
enough although at least we are listening. The bill is a balance 
struck between the two, dictated by common sense and the 
comments of concerned Canadians, and will cure situations like 
the one presented by the hon. member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	In its very essence this is what Canadian democracy is all 
about. It is fairness and protection for all including the 
immigrant and the refugee. It is about swift justice for criminals 
that threaten our system. The legislation is about balance, 
fairness and justice. The bill will help deal with those few 
hoodlums with guns and knives that want to subvert our 
immigration and refugee policy.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Nowhere in the legislation will we find that the government 
has heeded the voices of reaction that would have us bar our 
doors and shutter our windows to the world because of the 
misconceptions of some and violence of a few.
<P>
	Make no mistakes. We do not listen to those voices and we 
will not listen because we know our immigration and refugee 
policy has been just and sound. We know from what others 
around the globe tell us that Canadian policies are often seen as a 
beacon of hope in a world of gloom and doom. Bill C-44 is 
meant to keep that light shining.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I first came to Canada as an immigrant, I found a free 
society in which each member was respected and immigrants 
considered as pillars of society. Canada is a huge country where 
more people die than are born. This means that the 
responsibility rests with the immigrants to provide Canada with 
the numbers required to ensure the efficiency of our society. In 
return, these immigrants must be guaranteed a dignified life and 
a future for their children, with the assurance that crime is not 
the norm but the exception in this country.
<P>
	Our immigration policy is envied world-wide and has ensured 
Canada a dynamic and courageous immigration, one which has 
played a major role in building our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are committed to maintaining a progressive immigration 
policy. We have seen the benefits it has brought this country. 
Immigrants create jobs. They do not take them. Immigrants are 
not likely to depend on welfare or to commit crime. We know 
that to be a fact. Statistics prove it time and time again.
<P>
	We can also see other facts. Criminals have slipped through. 
Crimes have been committed. Compared to the thousands or 
indeed millions that come to Canada every year, those that 
commit crimes are in the minority. However the fact that they 
are small in number does not diminish the horror of some of 
these crimes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As soon as this bill was introduced in the House of Commons, 
we started receiving comments from members, journalists, 
immigrants, refugees, citizens. We received letters, faxes, 
telephone calls. This goes to show how much interest was 
generated by this matter of great importance to everyone. This 
interest made it necessary to introduce changes to give a sense of 
security to our citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The legislation is designed to root out criminals that have 
subverted our immigration system and broken our laws. There 
can be no equivocating on the issue because it quickly boils 
down to respect for Canadian law and protection for truly needy 
refugees and honest immigrants.
<P>
	The minuscule number of criminals that have crept into the 
immigration system like thieves in the night do not make 
minuscule headlines when they go bad. It is those dreadful 
deeds. We have all seen the pictures and we heard our colleague. 
They start an erosion of trust in an immigration system that has 
served the country well.
<P>
	If people feel they cannot trust a system they will not support 
it. If people feel a system is open to abuse or misuse they will 
turn their back on it. The government equates immigration with 
nation building. Immigrants built the country. They built our 
railways. They worked in our factories and broke sod for farms.
<P>
	Because nation building is a process that never stops we need 
an immigration policy that is both progressive and effective. 
That in itself is a good reason for fighting to maintain public 
trust in the integrity of the system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must get rid of the criminal element. We must do so 
intelligently and without undermining the underlying principles 
of our immigration policy. As we know, all hon. members 
believe in the principles of confidence, honesty and justice, and 
I know that all of them wish the law to be changed to regain 
public confidence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5840"> 5840 </A></B>
<P>
	On examination, we see that the proposed changes cannot be 
rejected. Some would want more drastic changes, but this would 
be against the philosophy of our government as well as that of a 
majority of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Can anybody really fault a proposal that would prevent 
serious criminals from claiming to be refugees to delay their 
deportation? I think not. We have a system to help refugees, not 
serious criminals.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	How about a proposal that allows us to seize documentation 
from the mails that would be used to defraud our immigration 
regulations? I cannot find fault with that and I do not think too 
many people would either.
<P>
	The bill smoothes out a number of glitches and bumps in old 
legislation that gave criminals a place to hide. For example, 
immigration officials currently have the authority to arrest 
someone who violates immigration laws, but they cannot issue a 
warrant for other agencies such as the RCMP to arrest that 
person.
<P>
	Under our present system the immigration appeal division of 
the IRB can overturn removal orders against serious criminals 
on humanitarian grounds. However the minister alone must deal 
with the consequences of these decisions. The minister alone is 
the one entrusted with ensuring the interests of Canadians are 
protected. Therefore the minister should have the authority to 
make the decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The criminal element is not acceptable and premeditated 
crime must be punished for our protection and for the sake of 
justice. For too long, Canada has been a haven for the criminal 
element which often misused our country's all too flexible laws.
<P>
	That is why liaison was established with the Correctional 
Service of Canada to help rid us of criminals immediately after 
their have served their sentence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There have been management changes at the immigration 
appeals division which should improve efficiency and 
effectiveness in decision making. We are also making sure that 
IRB gets the information it needs involving war criminals, 
patterns of fraud or multiple identities.
<P>
	The legislation before the House does not deal with removals 
and some might see that as a flaw. I would caution those who 
think that way to remember that we have targeted foreign 
criminals for a quick exit through a joint police-immigration 
enforcement effort.
<P>
	Members are well aware of the special joint task force 
involving police from a number of forces and immigration 
officials. This task force is targeting serious criminals for 
removal and operational units are working as we speak in 
Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to ask those calling for more drastic changes 
to reflect on the fact that our immigration policy has served us 
well and should not be abolished. Of course, when we have 
economic problems, we try to find causes for these problems. 
We do not think about the fact that the economic crisis is a global 
problem. We respond right away by calling for an end to all 
immigration. We must, of course, solve existing problems as 
quickly as possible but this does not mean that we must close off 
our borders. Canada is the only country in the world with vast 
empty spaces and even if we closed off our borders, we could not 
stop immigration. We can only limit it and strengthen the laws 
controlling it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is interesting to note that in the research paper presented at a 
Carleton University law conference last year-and the same 
research was mentioned earlier by the minister-researchers 
noted that under our system immigrants are granted legal status 
and have access to the legal system. Illegal immigrants on the 
other hand become accomplices or victims of gangs because 
they cannot appeal to legitimate authorities.
<P>
	The research paper also noted: ``Tougher immigration laws 
might well drive more people into the arms of smugglers and the 
gangs''. Of course we do need to be tough on abuse and those 
who manipulate our system and the intent of our laws. We must 
send a clear message that those who violate our laws will have to 
pay a price.
<P>
	We are not a government that will punish the innocent just to 
get at the guilty. We have no intention of making people who 
really deserve Canada's protection pay for the actions of a small 
criminal element. We will not tar all refugees as criminals 
because we know they are not. We are not people who have the 
intention of labelling immigrants and refugees as security risks.
<P>
	One of our first actions as a government was to take 
immigration out of a department christened, and unjustly so, by 
our predecessors as the department of public security and put it 
in a department called citizenship and immigration where it 
rightly belongs. We will fight with our every breath to prevent 
the word immigrant from becoming a synonym of the word 
criminal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Look at the members of this House. As you can see, there are 
very few native people. All the others are new arrivals. They are 
immigrants themselves. They are the sons and daughters of 
immigrants. They are the descendants of recent immigrants and, 
as you know, this diversity represents the reality and the wealth 
of our country.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	By proposing these amendments, the minister tried to 
eliminate current abuses in the system. He also wanted to 
indicate to the criminal element taking the place of real refugees 
and immigrants that crime is not acceptable.
<P>
	This government's commitment to progressive immigration 
is reinforced by this bill. We think we can have both a 
progressive policy and an aggressive strategy supporting the 
integrity and credibility of our policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill addresses real problems with real solutions. The key 
to success is balance. As we have done for generations, we can 
continue to welcome immigrants and refugees to help continue 
building our nation. As soon as this legislation is proclaimed we 
can tell those few who exploit Canada's generosity that in the 
land of the maple leaf they have nowhere to hide.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues in all parties to recognize the importance 
of this legislation and give it speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member for Vancouver East will probably be interested in 
having the House know, she and I occasionally share time 
together on a radio commentary show on CBC out of Vancouver. 
I have grown to respect her and her qualities as I have with many 
people not only in this House but in Canada. They have come to 
Canada and made this country great. They have contributed to 
this country. I stand very firmly behind the people who have 
done exactly that. They come to Canada to make it the great 
country that it is.
<P>
	Would the hon. member not agree there are some people in 
Canada, again a small minority I am sure, who might want to 
equate immigrant to criminal or refugee to criminal. The 
member spoke of confidence. I wonder if she would agree that 
by having more precise laws, by having a better law than the one 
we are currently debating, by having a law that has more teeth 
which would do away with the abject abuses that our member 
from Fraser Valley West was talking about, would accomplish 
exactly what she and I want to achieve, that is, to be able to say 
truly that people coming to Canada are coming to build Canada, 
make it stronger and a better place for all of us to live.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel that this law has the teeth 
that are required. We cannot put together a state that has too 
strong a police force and are in control of everything.
<P>
	What we have now are laws that cannot be implemented in the 
right manner because we do not have the system. The 
immigration law in Canada is very generous. I have been in 
other countries and by comparison Canada has an extremely 
generous law. It is so generous that we have people who come 
and fall through the cracks.
<P>
	Every democracy has its pitfalls of course because democracy 
is difficult. It can be uncomfortable at times but it is a system 
that works. We have to have the element of freedom that we have 
to give to the people who come to our shores.
<P>
	At the same time we have to have control because people who 
come and say that they are immigrants should be checked right 
away. If they are not immigrants as they say, they should be sent 
away. If there are any problems with their past, they have to be 
sent away again.
<P>
	When I came to Canada in 1966, I was asked certain things: 
``Is anyone in your family insane? Are you insane? No, then you 
can go to Canada. Did you commit any fraud? Have you ever 
been to jail? Has a member of your family ever been to jail? No, 
then you can go''. At the time, we were coming for six months.
<P>
	At times it is really difficult to understand what the system 
has become and that is why I have faith in this bill. It can do the 
trick without becoming too stringent and too severe. That is not 
our style. That is not Canada.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the speech made by the hon. member for Vancouver 
and found it to be somewhat ambiguous and contradictory.
<P>
	On the one hand she welcomes immigrants in a very 
compassionate way, but on the other hand she fully shows why 
this bill is unacceptable for several reasons. In my opinion, this 
legislation goes against the traditional policies of the Liberal 
Party. I remember that the Liberals were opposed to the 
sometimes excessively right-wing policies of Mr. Valcourt, 
Mrs. McDougall and other former ministers. Why play these 
little games today? You do not agree that there is a real problem 
in Canada, but I see it. There has been some abuse and there are a 
number of criminals. This is not an exaggeration; it is not a 
right-wing answer, but there is currently an economic crisis in 
Canada and this is the worst possible time to legislate on 
immigration. Why not wait until the public opinion is not so 
sensitive to this issue? Then we will be able to be more rational 
about the whole issue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, if everyone was honest we could 
do it. Let me just give you an example. If your son was killed by 
someone who came to Canada as a refugee, that person would be 
a refugee but also a criminal and I think you would have a 
different opinion. I have seen too many tragedies and I continue 
to see tragedies. The problem is not with immigrants. I myself 
am an immigrant and I have a lot of respect for immigrants. I 
know what it means to be an immigrant. If someone is honest 
and comes to Canada as a refugee, then there is no problem. That 
person can certainly come here. However, if a person is not 
honest our society must have a system to keep that person from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5842"> 5842 </A></B>
<P>
coming in, otherwise  there could be serious problems and even 
tragedies. We witnessed such a case in British Columbia.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Briefly please, the hon. whip for the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That is caucus co-ordinator.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask the hon. member a question about the levels of immigration. 
Currently the Liberal government targets 250,000.
<P>
	It has been shown throughout the year that this stretches and 
puts strain on the bureaucracy and a lot of the various 
classifications. Because of that there has been a lot of abuse by 
the criminal element, a lot of abuse under family dependency 
programs, a lot of abuse of the immigration business program. 
The department cannot catch them. We may appear to be 
attacking and criticizing and I agree we should stress the fact 
that our immigration program is a good one. However, we 
should look at the numbers.
<P>
	Does the hon. member feel there is any merit in either putting 
a freeze on the immigration program for a while or reducing the 
numbers from 250,000 to 200,000 so that each and every one of 
these good programs we have can be controlled? In theory they 
are all great. But in actual practice there are some elements that 
are being incorporated into the program where the immigrants 
themselves are getting a bad reputation and it is not fair.
<P>
	Like the member I am a first generation immigrant. I like to 
see immigrants come to this country, be happy to come here and 
be treated with respect. Because we are on this program of high 
numbers for whatever reason, the integrity of our immigration 
policy needs to be restored for the protection not only of 
Canadians but the very immigrants themselves. Does she not 
feel there is merit in addressing the numbers of immigrants that 
are being allowed into this country and reducing them even by 
50,000 or 60,000 people?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, briefly I would offer 
congratulations to both members for being promoted.
<P>
	The minister is going through this series of consultations and 
it is clear that there is some concern about numbers. The 
numbers are being looked at. Again as I said in my speech it is 
marvellous to have immigrants, but we also have to give them a 
future and we have to give a future to their children.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	We are trying to get our house in order and through 
consultation we will know what the numbers will be. At this 
point I do not have any idea. It would be a real shot in the dark.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to rise on this first day of our return to 
Parliament in what I feel will be a very historic session. We in 
the Reform Party will be here to make sure the government 
keeps the train on the tracks during this period.
<P>
	Over the summer I had the opportunity to hold a series of town 
hall meetings in my riding. After those meetings it became quite 
evident that immigration is a priority in my riding. I know that 
members throughout the House have heard concerns from their 
constituents as well about immigration. I am certainly glad to 
see that Bill C-44 is moving toward fixing the problem. 
Unfortunately it has not gone far enough.
<P>
	In addressing Bill C-44 I feel it is vital to stress the 
importance of immigration. It is one of the cornerstones of 
Canadian society. Cultural diversity has and will continue to be 
beneficial to our nation. Immigration provides us with an 
increased global awareness and has been integral to the 
development of Canada. We must take a constructive approach 
and work together to solve the many immigration problems, not 
just criticize, which unfortunately is all too easy.
<P>
	We are considering a bill which the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has proposed, apparently to correct the all too 
numerous shortcomings and failures in our immigration system 
left by decades of ill-conceived, misguided Liberal 
immigration policy.
<P>
	The bill would never have seen the light of day if Reform 
members had not presented the minister almost daily with an 
ongoing litany of outrage and complaints by the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	We have an immigration system that is clearly almost as out 
of control as the $600 billion debt. The government has finally 
conceded that Canadians in every part of the country are fed up 
with an inadequate and confusing immigration policy that has 
allowed thousands upon thousands of unworthy immigrants into 
this magnificent land, a policy that has blatantly ignored the 
interests of the people.
<P>
	What are the priorities for accepting immigrants into Canada? 
First, family reunification is a policy that has been so badly 
abused that it accepts people with no thought of whether they 
will be beneficial members of our society. The reunification of 
families should be a consideration, one of many in assessing an 
application, but not the main priority. Immigration quotas call 
for the largest single group of immigrants, some 111,000 or 45 
per cent of the total, to be admitted from this class.
<P>
	In addition, 11 per cent of immigrants or about 28,000 people 
will be refugees. In far too many cases these are people who just 
show up on our doorstep. We have no choice, due to our laws, but 
to grant these people a hearing, a process which can take up to 
three years. During this time of overburdened taxpayers, who 
foots the bill? The taxpayer foots the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5843"> 5843 </A></B>
<P>
	Way down at the bottom of the priority list is what the 
immigration bureaucrats call the economic class, in other words 
the fortunate few who have the financial resources to purchase 
their way into the country. Who says Canada is not for sale?
<P>
	Whatever happened to the hard working, self-supporting 
immigrants who built this country, people who were admitted 
because they deserved to be here? Whatever became of the 
people who had the skills the country needed, who had dreams of 
freedom and self-sufficiency, who had the initiative and 
courage to make their own way in a brave new land? That 
Canada of 127 years ago depended on a sturdy, skilled, hard 
working immigrant to develop and prosper and to populate our 
empty lands. That they were successful is apparent in the 
prosperous, safe, free country in which we live today. Many here 
in this House have descended from these early immigrants. My 
grandfather was from Scotland, my grandmother was Irish and 
my wife's parents are from Italy. They came to Canada and they 
contributed. They raised children. They were and are 
law-abiding Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Today our needs have changed. Our economy no longer needs 
pioneers but rather computer experts, investment bankers, 
electronic engineers, experienced business people and traders, 
technicians, skilled trades people and educators. One thing has 
not changed. We need people who are ready to take the risk of 
moving to a new land, ready to seize opportunities, to move and 
develop some still empty spaces. We do not need those who have 
come to exploit or drain our social services, and we certainly do 
not need criminals.
<P>
	Since that Liberal heyday of the seventies when Trudeau and 
his obedient officials opened the floodgates to immigration, 
based not on the needs of the country, not on selectivity or high 
standards, but on some seemingly intangible set of feel good 
principles, Canada has been on a backward slide. The Canadian 
public demands a tougher approach as to who we admit into this 
country, but this government shows no real intention of doing 
this or of listening to Canadians.
<P>
	I have received letters in my office and I know each and every 
member in this House has received letters from constituents 
complaining about the immigration system. I would like to read 
a brief excerpt from a letter received the other day from a 
gentleman in Summerland, British Columbia. He writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our current immigration system is overlooking our social services, 
education, health services and policing. We believe we should be good to those 
we allow in, but we should not be seen as easy marks by any immigrants. There 
are so many deserving people who want to come to Canada and be good citizens. 
Why should we have the patience with those who are not willing to obey our 
laws? If we are tough but fair, we will do far more good overall.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is noteworthy that Bill C-44 deals specifically with 
provisions which decide not whether criminals will be admitted 
as immigrants, but which ones. I put it to you that no criminals, 
none, should be admitted to Canada, period, not as an 
immigrant, not as a refugee, not even as a visitor-none.
<P>
	A report drafted by senior advisers in the immigration 
department for the minister says that many Canadians think the 
immigration program is out of control and that major changes 
reflecting public opinion are needed. There is a sense the 
immigration program needs fixing. It urges that immigrants 
need to be better selected.
<P>
	I further submit that all immigrants to this country must 
respect the laws and contribute their fair share. Any slip, any 
criminal conviction, should be grounds for deportation.
<P>
	It is a privilege for people to be allowed to come to Canada to 
live, a privilege much sought after by many from other countries 
all over the world, even by people from developed nations.
<P>
	Canada and its immigration policy have become the laughing 
stock of the world. It is no secret it is far too easy for criminals to 
come here. We are not even checking to ensure the people we do 
admit are not criminals. As a result, the people of Canada have 
been subjected to increasingly violent crimes. The bitter irony is 
that even when these criminals are apprehended and dealt with 
by our courts and even when deportation orders are issued, our 
immigration officers are impotent to deal with them, to send 
them out of the country, to ensure they never darken this land 
again. Oh, no, they simply file an appeal of the deportation order 
and disappear into the woodwork.
<P>
	All of us have seen the devastating and deadly effects of this 
inept system. Now the minister with this sadly flawed 
legislation hopes to lull Canadians into believing this 
government actually intends to do something. Canadians will be 
fooled no longer.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The minister is proposing that we actually allow criminals 
into Canada simply because the crimes they committed would 
not earn a maximum sentence of 10 years in this country. 
Clearly, this is sending the wrong message. A criminal is a 
criminal. Those who commit small crimes can be inclined to 
commit more heinous ones. In what way does Canada or the 
people of Canada benefit from having criminals here? The only 
immigration policy that will work is one that allows people into 
this country solely on merit.
<P>
	In a letter to me dated August 29 the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration states: ``Protecting Canadian society from 
criminals is a top priority for me and my officials''. Having the 
minister guard our gates against criminals is like having a fox 
guarding the hen-house.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5844"> 5844 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians are far from gullible and will not tolerate this Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde approach. Canadians of all stripes are 
demanding that the law get tough with criminals. That will 
prove to be an impossible task if we continue to import law 
breakers. We should bar all criminals. I will repeat that. We 
should bar all criminals, without exception. Canadians do not 
want an invasion of criminals. Canadians do not need terrorists 
hiding here and plotting violence in other parts of the world. 
Canadians do not need street gangs or the additional stress on 
our already struggling social programs.
<P>
	Canada is also nearly bankrupt so how can we afford to admit 
these people? Before any immigrant steps onto Canadian soil, 
before they leave their native land, have their criminal record 
checked with all the resources at our disposal. I have been told 
that immigration officers are prohibited from checking criminal 
records through Interpol. Why?
<P>
	Immigration officials have told me it would bottleneck the 
application process to check whether refugees have a criminal 
record. Then let it be bottlenecked. I say it is far better than 
having even one Canadian murdered or having violence erupt in 
the streets or making our own citizens live in fear in their own 
homes, their streets or their playgrounds.
<P>
	What about immigrants who commit crimes while in Canada? 
Again, our Liberal created policies and laws have forgotten the 
sole reason for their existence. It is not to concern themselves 
with the welfare of the criminal and his or her family. Our laws 
were made to protect Canadians. The criminal should have 
thought of the hardship he would cause his family before he 
broke our laws.
<P>
	If found guilty of a criminal act in Canada, anyone who is not 
a Canadian citizen should be put on the first plane out of the 
country. It would be simple enough to carry this out directly 
from the courtroom to deportation. Let the offender have the 
right to appeal. Everyone should have the right to appeal, but let 
it be from some other country, perhaps his country of origin, not 
in Canada and not for the taxpayers to pay the final bill.
<P>
	In my peaceful riding of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt 
we have a particularly repugnant fellow, a landed immigrant 
who feels no particular need to respect this country's laws. He 
scorns our courts. He laughs at our law enforcement officers. 
This man eluded a murder charge on a technicality in our courts. 
Currently he is being tried for a string of burglaries, a crime he 
has served time for previously. He has a record as long as your 
arm, Mr. Speaker, and perhaps as long as all of our arms and a 
deep and abiding contempt for the citizens of our land. He has 
been ordered deported by immigration officials but he has 
exercised his right of appeal.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	This man is a criminal. He has had a second chance and then 
some. Where is the compassion and the consideration for the 
innocent people who are his victims? Logic dictates that there is 
not even the remotest chance of his rehabilitation, yet we keep 
him here at the taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	This individual is a burden on this country and will continue 
to be so. Why should Canadian taxpayers have to spend some 
$40,000 a year to keep this foreign national in our prisons? This 
person should be on the next plane back to his homeland where I 
understand the law takes a sterner view of this type of criminal 
conduct. Why are we not sending him home? Let us do it. Send 
him home.
<P>
	This unacceptable situation is the end result of the current 
laws, laws that originated to a large measure with a Liberal 
government. The proposals before us are more of the same. It 
appears on the surface to be a step in the right direction. We are 
tired of hearing that. It is like the old saying: You cannot get 
there from here. The government knows this proposal will be 
almost impossible to enforce. It will be spun around and 
distorted by lawyers and judges and the immigration 
bureaucracy will find a way to thwart it. After all, this is the way 
the government deals with these matters with Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast to coast have called loud and 
clear for tougher measures. This bill does not address the ills 
and dangerous inadequacies of immigration. It does not have a 
clear mandate for the Immigration and Refugee Board which 
increasingly acts as a law unto itself. It does not solve the 
problem of a department that cannot enforce its own deportation 
orders. It does not even have reliable knowledge of how many 
deported criminals and undesirables remain in this country. It is 
a typical Liberal answer to a problem: doing too little far too 
late.
<P>
	This government, the minister and his colleagues, have 
exhausted the patience of the people of this country. Canadians 
are raising a hue and cry. Not only the people of the west but all 
Canadians demand that the minister do his job.
<P>
	We Reformers have presented our proposed amendment to 
this bill and urge all members of the House to support it. This 
Reform amendment is what Canadians are telling us to do. It is 
time to start listening and not just pretend to listen. The ministry 
is out of control. The immigration department is out of control 
and Canadians will not pay the price for the minister's 
mismanagement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very closely to the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. That is one of the most 
beautiful areas in British Columbia which I often have an 
opportunity to visit. I try to get there every  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5845"> 5845 </A></B>
<P>
summer. The lake and the fruit trees make it a very beautiful area 
indeed.
<P>
	I commend the member. He has made some important 
comments about immigration being very important for Canada 
and how immigration is very important for the economic 
development of this country.
<P>
	He also talked about the pioneers. I can share some of his 
feelings because my own grandfather came here in about 1906. 
Luckily there was not a Reform government then. Otherwise he 
might have been deported because he did not have the skills or 
education. He was an uneducated man but he wanted to start a 
new life. He came to Vancouver, British Columbia after 
travelling extensively throughout the world. He obviously was a 
very smart man. He picked the right place to stay. I share in some 
of the comments of the hon. member as well.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I would like to say that in immigration there is a balanced 
approach. One of the areas the member talked about is family 
reunification. I think it should be known that when you look at 
the total immigration to this country, the percentage of family 
reunification has come down. It is actually reduced from what it 
was in the 1980s.
<P>
	The members in the Reform Party have often brought up the 
situation of family reunification. It is about families coming 
together. I am very surprised that the Reform Party, with its 
stand on the family and how important it is to have a strong 
family situation, would be against bringing families together. I 
am really surprised considering how often the Reform members 
speak out about how important the family unit is, how important 
the support system is. Now I hear that they do not think that 
family unification should be looked at.
<P>
	In fact, instead of bringing families together, instead of 
bringing the mothers and fathers together, they want to keep 
them apart. They do not want to bring them here. They want to 
set up barriers for them. This is quite surprising considering 
their stand on having strong families and how important that is 
in terms of reducing crime and support. I am very surprised.
<P>
	In the area of refugees, Canadians are compassionate. I 
remember the refugees from Uganda. I know many of my people 
who were refugees from Uganda. They have contributed 
substantially to this economy. I can name lists of people who are 
now judges or now chair of major companies and so on who 
came here as refugees.
<P>
	We did it as humanitarians but they have contributed 
substantially to our economy. If the hon. member wants to get a 
list of the many people who have come and who have 
contributed, particularly those refugees from Uganda, I would 
be happy to provide that.
<P>
	The immigration policy has a balance. It says we want to bring 
families together. I am sure that the Reform people want to keep 
families together. About 45 per cent of all immigrants to this 
country are into family reunification in order to bring families 
together.
<P>
	Then of course there is the economic class. There are 
entrepreneurs who want to start businesses here and want to 
develop our economy. We want to give them an opportunity to 
help create jobs. I am sure that the hon. member will say it is 
important to create jobs. It is important to make sure that 
Canada is working. It is important that Canada be competitive 
with the rest of the world. We do need entrepreneurs.
<P>
	There is another matter I want to raise because the member on 
the other side has talked about it extensively. That is the crime 
factor.
<P>
	I have a case in my riding, and I would like the member to 
respond to this, where a gentleman was deported because he 
assaulted someone. This gentleman has a wife and two children 
in Canada but he cannot come back. Imagine what they are going 
through because he assaulted someone.
<P>
	I would like the member to tell us whether we should keep that 
person out of the country forever, away from his wife and two 
children. Should we say because this person assaulted someone 
he should never be allowed to come to this country to join his 
wife and two children? I would like the hon. member to address 
that and indicate how we should respond to that wife and those 
two children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. They are very interesting.
<P>
	I am not a judge nor a jury but I can comment. Maybe the 
person who committed those crimes should have thought very 
carefully about the consequences for his wife and children 
before he considered the crimes. I think it is reasonable to ask 
that we be responsible for those types of things.
<P>
	If he is after reunification with his family maybe that is an 
item for his country of origin to deal with and not a particular 
problem for Canada in this case.
<P>
	With regard to family reunification which the hon. member 
briefly touched on, I would say that the Reform Party does very 
much stand for the principles of the family.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	We do not have a problem entirely with family reunification, 
but I think it has gone a little bit too far. We are talking about 
family reunification for adopted children and children of 
adopted children. It goes on and on with cousins. Where does it 
end?
<P>
	Family reunification in the close knit family is fine, but the 
laws in this country take it a little bit too far in my opinion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5846"> 5846 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member if he 
has actually read this bill. I ask that question because during his 
remarks today he seemed to be talking about the fact that we 
were going to continue the flaw in the existing act that talks 
about criminals having access to our refugee determination 
system.
<P>
	The minister stood in this House earlier today and highlighted 
that provision in the act that is being amended. I want to quote 
for the member. That is very important because the member is 
leaving a perception in the minds of Canadians that we are not 
dealing with this. ``No immigrant and except as provided in 
subsection (3), no visitor shall be granted admission if the 
immigrant or visitor is a member of any of the following classes: 
have been convicted in Canada under any act of Parliament of a 
summary conviction offence, other than an offence designated 
as a contravention under the Contraventions Act, and there are 
reasonable grounds to believe have been convicted outside 
Canada of an offence that, if committed in Canada would 
constitute a summary conviction offence under any act of 
Parliament.''
<P>
	That is a specific amendment to the act. It is a very big 
improvement. I know the constituents in my community applaud 
that kind of amendment. I cannot understand why the Reform 
Party would stand up in the House today and suggest to 
Canadians that we are not amending that portion of the act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have read through this particular 
piece of mumbo-jumbo. It is a fact that in this bill we are saying 
that we will take criminals as long as they have not committed a 
crime that has a sentence of 10 years or more. That is what this 
bill is doing.
<P>
	Why would we do that? Why would Canadians in their right 
minds say: ``We know criminals are bad and we will not accept 
you if you have murdered somebody. We will not accept you if 
you have done a few other things that would have a sentence of 
10 years or more in Canada; but if it is less than 10 years, if you 
have just broken into houses-''
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Twice and you are out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> They can do it twice in Canada? I see. Clearly, this 
is not what Canadians have been asking for. Why are we 
admitting people with criminal records at all? They should not 
be allowed in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to take part in this important debate on Bill C-44, an 
act to amend the Immigration Act. The proposed changes will 
expand the government's authority to deny serious criminals 
access to the refugee determination system and will simplify the 
procedure for excluding from Canada persons who have 
previously been deported.
<P>
	At the same time, the bill in its balanced approach to solving a 
serious problem of criminals, though few in number, assures 
Canadians that Canada will continue to welcome legitimate and 
law abiding immigrants as full partners in the Canada of today 
and the future.
<P>
	Indeed this bill means a great deal to me. My wife and I came 
to Canada as immigrants 26 years ago. Our four sons were all 
born in Winnipeg. We have all been very proud to call this 
country our home.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	There are a number of other honourable colleagues in this 
House who chose Canada as their home and I would like to urge 
them in particular to take part in this debate because it is 
important to bring experience as well as compassion and 
intellect to our discussions of Bill C-44.
<P>
	Firsthand experience is one of life's great teachers and we 
who have been through the immigration experience know of the 
urgent need to protect the integrity of the system that we have.
<P>
	I want to relay to members the sense of unease I have felt of 
late when discussions turned to the topic of immigration policy. 
Recently, when listening to open line shows, talking to people 
on the streets or opening the morning mail I have detected an 
anti-immigrant sentiment in some of the comments.
<P>
	It is not difficult to see where this comes from. There have 
been too many stories about criminal acts committed by 
immigrants. There have been too many tales of people who 
laugh at our laws or use the system to their own advantage. The 
anger is directed at those who have abused or who would abuse 
our system and our generosity. But sometimes that anger spills 
over and it hurts everybody, all of us.
<P>
	We know there are a number of abusers, the criminals in our 
midst, although we do not know the exact number. By all 
estimates the number is small compared to the large numbers of 
honest, law-abiding immigrants in this country. But we also 
know that in our society acts of violence or crime are relayed 
over the airwaves far faster and further than acts of kindness and 
greatness. In other words, the actions of a few criminals can 
reflect badly on the good work of the many.
<P>
	Of course this is wrong, of course this is unfair and of course it 
should not happen. But it does. In Winnipeg, my city, 
immigrants are angry when they hear stories about the few who 
thumb their noses at the laws of the land. We need to make sure 
people do not abuse our immigration and refugee system or 
break our laws. We need to stop the abuse and we need to root 
out the few who are making life difficult for the many.
<P>
	When cheaters abuse the generosity of Canadians or when 
thieves or murders try to pretend they are refugees, we and this 
government should say to them: ``Enough is enough''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5847"> 5847 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality is that they are not only stealing from the Canadian 
taxpayer. They are also stealing from would-be immigrants and 
refugees who really need our help. There is a limit to the 
resources and energy that can be expended on immigration and 
refugee matters and when some of those resources and energy 
are squandered on felons and cheaters, it clearly takes away 
from those who truly need our help.
<P>
	Bill C-44 will ensure that the immigration and refugee system 
provides the best possible protection for those who really need 
it. I know there will be people all across Canada in the 
immigrant community and elsewhere applauding this fair and 
balanced legislation. In fact, if this government had not moved 
now to fix the system, there was a very real possibility that 
citizens' trust in it would dissolve.
<P>
	We need to have the support of all Canadians so we can 
maintain a sensitive and fair immigration policy. After all this 
policy has been key to the success of our country. There is a lot 
in this legislation to recommend to my colleagues across the 
floor. The fact that the bill will prevent serious criminals from 
claiming refugee status or from appealing a decision to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board as a way to stall their removal 
from Canada is very important.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	I must stress that we are talking about serious criminals. We 
are talking about people who have been convicted of a crime 
either in Canada or abroad that would be punishable in Canada 
by a minimum of 10 years in prison, or of anybody the minister 
believes poses a serious threat to the public and to the security of 
the nation.
<P>
	Bill C-44 also gives immigration officers the legal authority 
to seize documents sent through the international mail that 
could be used to forge identity papers or circumvent our 
immigration laws. Customs officers already search 
international mail and already bring such documents to the 
attention of immigration officials. However under the current 
law the immigration officials cannot do anything about these 
documents. The legislation will fix that problem once and for 
all.
<P>
	All of us in the Chamber know that when loopholes exist there 
is always going to be somebody who will try to take advantage 
of those loopholes. That is another reason why the bill is 
necessary. It removes those loopholes. For example, 
immigration officials currently have the authority to arrest 
anyone who fails to appear before a senior immigration officer 
as required, but they cannot issue a warrant authorizing other 
agencies such as the RCMP to arrest that person. The legislation 
when passed will allow warrants to be issued so police across 
Canada can help to find suspects wanted for violating our laws.
<P>
	This strategy for ending abuse of the system outlined by the 
minister earlier today impressed me with its fair and balanced 
approach. Admittedly some critics have complained the 
amendments do not go far enough. On the other hand there are 
complaints that the government is too tough and too harsh. 
When we hear those two extremes I think it is safe to say that we 
have struck a delicate balance. We can be tough and make it very 
clear to those who would abuse our laws that they will not be 
tolerated in Canada. At the same time we are being extremely 
careful not to destroy the very system we are trying to protect.
<P>
	As we look for criminals we must make certain that we do not 
punish the innocent. This is like giving antibiotics to a patient 
with a serious bacterial infection or administering 
chemotherapy and radiation to a patient with cancer. We just 
give the dosage sufficient to cure the infection, control the 
spread of cancer or cure it if feasible, and not too much 
treatment so as to endanger the life of the patient himself or 
herself.
<P>
	The minister has made it abundantly clear that the people who 
deserve Canada's protection, those who are fleeing war, famine 
or persecution, will not have to pay for the wrongs of a few. We 
must continue to remember that for the most part the people 
immigrating to Canada today are the nation builders of 
tomorrow.
<P>
	I am very proud to say that immigrants have added a lot to the 
Canadian way of life. They built the railroads and tilled the great 
prairie farms. Today some of our most prolific artists and 
performers, distinguished educators, politicians, public 
servants, inventors, manufacturers and scientists are 
immigrants. We should never lose sight of their invaluable 
achievements. We should never let the crimes of a few paint a 
false portrait of all immigrants.
<P>
	Most Canadians recognize the positive side to immigration. 
Many Canadian families can trace their roots back to an 
immigrant who landed here to start a new life. These positive 
facts are well documented and understood. Therefore it is very 
important that public faith and trust in the immigration and 
refugee process be reaffirmed. If people turn their backs on what 
we have built, if they lose confidence in the system that we had, 
it could take generations to gain it back.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	I believe this timely legislation will go a long way to 
reaffirming that faith and trust. The bill will permit those who 
arrive and strengthen the social, cultural, political and economic 
fabric of our nation to continue to wear their immigrant status 
with justifiable pride.
<P>
	In conclusion I urge members to give passage to the 
legislation without delay.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
understand the government's, the Liberal Party's strategy of 
letting Liberal members of ethnic origin defend a bill that is 
considered to be anti-immigrant by an important part of the 
population.
<P>
	I must tell you that Canada's crime rate has gone down in 
recent years and that the crime rate among immigrants is lower 
than that among Canadians who were born in this country. I 
repeat, the crime rate among immigrants is lower than that 
among Canadians who were born in this country.
<P>
	This bill could be declared unconstitutional in several 
respects because, in my opinion, some of its provisions violate 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the 
Geneva Convention on Refugees. How can the hon. member 
justify these drastic provisions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill is a very balanced one. 
It has been so balanced to ensure that it withstands the challenge 
under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and sees to it that it 
fulfils our obligation under the Geneva convention. I can assure 
the member who is still worried that the bill will stand those 
tests.
<P>
	I was taken aback when the member tried to insinuate-and I 
hope he did not mean it but he said it-that the government has a 
strategy to get ethnic Canadians to debate the issue. Irrespective 
of origin Canadians are Canadians by any definition. I must tell 
the member as a matter of fact that I was not sent by my 
government to debate the bill. I spontaneously volunteered to 
debate the bill even before the parliamentary recess.
<P>
	To impute that motive is unconscionable in the Chamber and 
to impute that ethnicity is to be taken into consideration to me is 
the highest order of parliamentary obscenity. I hope the hon. 
member did not mean what he said and I am prepared to accept 
an apology.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I applaud very 
much the comments and responses of the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North.
<P>
	I stand on a point of clarification. I believe there has been 
some misunderstanding on the benches opposite with regard to 
the question of indictable offences and summary conviction 
offences under the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the member addressing a question or 
comment to the member who just spoke?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> No, Mr. Speaker. I was addressing a comment to 
the House to clarify a point. We are looking at two different 
things here. We are looking at apples and oranges, the apples 
being those people who applied for landed status as immigrants. 
In the particular case with regard to criminal convictions, if they 
are summary conviction offences there are those that are 
punishable by a minimum of six months. If they are indictable 
there  are those that are punishable by five years. Mr. Speaker, 
you would probably know this better than I would, but I think 
five years is the low end of the scale for indictable offences.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	The question with regard to those crimes punishable by 10 
years relates only to those within the refugee stream. That is tied 
to a United Nations convention to which we are a signatory. I 
hope that helps. Indictable offences per se run the gamut. It is 
not a 10-year thing. It does not relate to landed immigrant 
status. It relates to the refugee process and it is part of the UN 
convention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask the hon. member who just gave his presentation the same 
question I asked the previous member.
<P>
	There is evidence in the past year that current levels of 
immigration are putting a stress and strain on the bureaucracy 
and all the good programs that Canada has which people love to 
apply and come to Canada for as the hon. member indicated his 
family did.
<P>
	Does he not think there is some merit, any merit at all, in 
looking at the system and our levels of immigration which are 
currently at 250,000 people? In our opinion it is at least 50,000 
too high. It is unmanageable. We need to control it a bit better. It 
would preserve the integrity of our immigration system. It 
would restore confidence in the minister of immigration and I 
am sure the hon. member would dearly love to see his reputation 
stay at a good level.
<P>
	Most important, it would also help and protect immigrants 
who come here to give their best to this country. Immigrants 
send their children to school, but because of high numbers and 
the reputations that some of the bad apples bring to the system 
they go to school and are discriminated against. They are called 
names. They come home and they cry.
<P>
	This is not what we brought them to Canada for. This is not 
what they applied to Canada for. Those are the things we have to 
try to improve within the system. That is what we are trying to 
get across here.
<P>
	We are not against immigration. We are for immigration but 
we are for numbers at a speed and at a level that we can control 
things. We cannot control a car going around a 90-degree corner 
at 150 miles an hour. They should reduce the numbers to control 
it better.
<P>
	Does the member who just gave his speech see any merit in 
looking at the numbers and reducing them for better control?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I am pleased to note that he welcomes immigrants to 
the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5849"> 5849 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to numbers the question was put to the Canadian 
electorate no less than in October 1993. The Canadian electorate 
made a decision by putting the Liberals into government that the 
level was a reasonable one.
<P>
	When we look at the problem we have to look at the two sides 
of the equation. If we do not have enough resources to manage 
the 250,000 one possibility is to reduce the number. However I 
would suggest there is another better alternative and that is to 
increase the resources to absorb our commitment to the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to be involved in a debate that has engaged people's 
thinking as much as this one has. It is a very healthy sign that we 
are looking at the merits and the particulars of what we are 
trying to do here.
<P>
	The motion before us opposes Bill C-44 on the grounds that it 
does not prevent the screening out of applicants for refugee 
status or for permanent landing when those applicants have 
criminal histories or may be the perpetrators of violence.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	This is as opposed to true refugees who are so often and often 
have been the innocent victims of violence.
<P>
	Those on the opposite side of this House who have risen to 
speak on this motion and to Bill C-44 have argued that Bill C-44 
does permit the screening out of undesirables. They argue that 
Bill C-44 does have teeth and that we are misguided in our 
attacks on this bill.
<P>
	It is easy to understand why they would argue that the bill 
does go far enough, but this bill would not clean things up. This 
bill does not strike at the heart of the problem and does not deal 
with the real workings of the refugee determination system in 
Canada. One could say that it is a refusal to face facts about just 
how badly our immigration and refugee systems have gone 
wrong. We hear a lot of defence of the system across the way.
<P>
	There is no excuse for this refusal and no excuse for the 
inability or the unwillingness of this government to face those 
facts. The shortcomings of the immigration system and our 
refugee determination system have been given wide publicity 
since the Reform Party began pointing them out.
<P>
	The media has widely reported our exposing of deportation 
backlogs that cannot possibly be dealt with by the existing 
enforcement resources in Canada. It has been reported that 
refugees who are members of genocidal regimes who have 
caused death and despair in their native countries are now 
happily residing, often at taxpayer's expense, in Canada. They 
have reported, after we exposed them, refugee admittance 
guidelines that actually invite undesirables to make a refugee 
claim in Canada.
<P>
	The government knows about these scandals. It is feeling the 
heat from these scandals. The people of Canada are better 
informed than ever about what is really happening in the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration and polls are 
reflecting their anger and dissolution.
<P>
	In response to that outrage and concern, government hastily 
put together a package of response that it claims will take care of 
the problem. It claims that this package of reforms will stop 
riff-raff from calling Canada home by preventing refugee 
claims being made in prisons and will stop the immigration 
appeals division from overturning deportations, something that 
the IAD has become all too notorious for.
<P>
	These so-called reforms are nothing more than long overdue 
common sense. However, they fall so far short of the mark of 
affecting any real fundamental and significant change to a 
system that so desperately needs it that we cannot support the 
bill.
<P>
	I urge support not only by my colleagues in Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition but also by the members opposite for a motion 
to stop this bill and force, finally, real reconsideration of the 
way Canada handles its immigration and refugee systems.
<P>
	The minister wants us to believe that Bill C-44 is a cure for 
the massive haemorrhage in Canada's immigration and refugee 
systems. Bill C-44 offers nothing more than a few band-aids 
and for that reason it must be rejected. For that reason we cannot 
allow the people of Canada to be duped into thinking that they 
are getting real reform here, that things will actually be better 
after this bill passes. They will not.
<P>
	Nothing significant is going to change and I will tell members 
why. The first element of this legislation, the element touted by 
the minister as being the most significant change, is one that 
would prevent criminals in Canada from making refugee claims 
in order to delay their removal from Canada. That is a good idea. 
I cannot understand why it was not done long ago.
<P>
	The idea of immigration and refugee board members going 
into a prison to hear refugee claims is patently absurd. The 
government would have us believe that this is somehow going to 
prevent criminals from making refugee claims when it will not. 
We know how many criminals apply for refugee status from 
Canadian prisons or while they are on parole. That is easy 
enough to keep tabs on.
<P>
	We have no idea whatsoever of how many criminals who have 
committed their crimes abroad seek refugee status and are 
successful each year. We have no idea.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	It is easy enough to prevent someone who is already residing 
in Canada, especially in a Canadian jail, from making a last 
ditch attempt to remain in the country. It is not quite as easy to 
prevent those who have criminal backgrounds from entering the 
country in the first place,  not that it is impossible. Other 
countries have extensive refugee background checks before they 
hear a refugee claim and make a determination. Why do we not? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5850"> 5850 </A></B>
<P>
We do not because the immigration and refugee board and its 
supporters tell us that we are not allowed to, that it would be a 
violation of our commitment to the United Nations convention 
on the status of refugees. Of course that is sheer nonsense but it 
is a popular tune that continues to be sung again and again.
<P>
	It has been revealed to us by people intimately associated with 
the refugee process that this year the IRB has been giving orders 
to refugee hearing officers forbidding them to do background 
checks of any kind whatsoever prior to doing a refugee claim. 
They have issued orders preventing refugee hearing officers 
from using Interpol or even getting in touch with the RCMP or 
CSIS to investigate those refugee claimants of whom there is 
serious suspicion of criminal activity, guerrilla or terrorist 
backgrounds, or even genocide. As hard as it is to believe that is 
the fact.
<P>
	Bill C-44 appears to be a bill that will take care of the 
problems when it does not even address them. What good does it 
do to make changes to rules governing the hearing of a refugee 
claim preventing those who have committed crimes in Canada 
from making claims when we welcome those who have 
committed crimes, even crimes against humanity, from other 
countries?
<P>
	It is true that we are welcoming these sorts of people. In fact 
the IRB is going one step further. Not only are guerrillas from 
Latin America, double agents from Bolivia, and high ranking 
members of brutal totalitarian regimes allowed to make a 
refugee claim in Canada, once they do make that claim they are 
fast tracked through the system.
<P>
	The Reform Party proved that this summer. We provided the 
documents written by a member of the minister's own 
department circulated by the immigration and refugee board and 
forced upon refugee hearing officers that spell out that those 
who fit the categories just mentioned do not even need to go 
before a full three member refugee panel. They get expedited. 
So far this year over 3,500 refugee claimants have been 
expedited in this manner.
<P>
	How many of those claimants were criminals, terrorists, 
guerrillas or war criminals is not known. We may never know 
because the IRB with the full blessing of this government and 
the current minister has stripped its refugee hearing officers of 
the power to do even the most basic background checks. That is 
absurd and outrageous but it is happening.
<P>
	While it may be a good first step to prevent hearing officers 
from hearing refugee claims in prisons it is far more imperative 
that the entire system, the entire process of refugee hearings and 
determinations be changed.
<P>
	The Canadian interest is not being represented in this process 
and that is why it has gone so dreadfully wrong.
<P>
	The second major element of this legislation deals with the 
prevention of the IAD, the immigration appeals division, from 
overturning deportation orders based on humanitarian and 
compassionate grounds.
<P>
	That too is common sense but raises a troubling question. I am 
sure I do not need to inform this House that the IAD is a branch 
of the IRB, the immigration and refugee board, and that this 
board is populated by the same appointees as the IRB. The same 
people who are mandating that guerrillas, double agents, et 
cetera, be welcomed to Canada are also refusing to enforce the 
deportation orders of those we happen to catch up with.
<P>
	The same people who want to fling the doors of Canada wide 
open have been refusing to enforce the laws of Canada for those 
who make it into the country. Now Bill C-44 comes along and it 
would take the power to overturn some deportation orders, not 
all just some, away from these appointees.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Instead of slightly curtailing the power of these people to 
allow violent offenders to stay in the country, we need to 
re-examine the very role of the IRB. Do we need such a board of 
political appointees accountable to no one? Who are they 
working for? Whose interests are they serving? What are the 
priorities of the government when it comes to immigration?
<P>
	The government has two choices right now. The first choice is 
to align itself with the appointed members of the IRB, the 
members of the immigration industry and the refugee advocates 
who say that we need to keep the IRB the way it is, that we do not 
need major reform in the system and that the interest of 
Canadians must be, and I stress they have actually said they 
must be secondary to the interests of immigrants and refugees. 
The interests of Canadians come second.
<P>
	The government could align itself with the overwhelming 
majority of Canadians who feel that immigration policy and 
even refugee policy should first and foremost work in the 
interests of Canada. Immigration and refugee policy while being 
compassionate, balanced and legal must clearly be seen to 
protect the interests, the security, the health and the safety of 
Canadians. That is the reform we really need and it is time the 
government looked after its duty to Canadians.
<P>
	Bill C-44 does not reflect the willingness of the government 
to truly protect the interests of Canadians. Bill C-44 is 
stop-gap. It is a band-aid and it almost entirely maintains the 
status quo. The status quo does not deserve to be maintained. 
Canadians deserve better. Thus we cannot support a weak and 
ineffectual bill like this.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5851"> 5851 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me make one last appeal to my colleagues opposite. I 
know that the Reform Party is not the only party that has been 
hearing the cries of Canadians for immigration reform. I know 
that the Reform Party is not alone in receiving hundreds and 
hundreds of letters and calls from across the country, but 
especially from Ontario, which decry immigration policy and 
demand change. They have been hearing those calls too. Do the 
people, largely the constituents of your ridings not deserve 
better than window dressing? Do they not deserve better than 
stop-gap measures? They want real change. They want a better 
system that protects Canadians. Let us give them that.
<P>
	Let us vote against Bill C-44, start over and change the way 
that Canada does business when it comes to immigrants and 
refugees. Let us give Canadians a system that really works not 
just for immigrants and refugee claimants but for Canadians too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to say to the 
member that I thought her remarks were substantive and 
constructive. I listened to her attentively. The member gave me 
some insight I had not been exposed to before.
<P>
	I am a member from Ontario, from downtown Toronto and we 
hear the concerns expressed about the immigration policy. Our 
minister is also from Toronto. Does she not think it would be 
more constructive in advancing this debate if some of those 
ideas that she talked about today are addressed in committee 
where the minister has said he would listen to some amendments 
being proposed rather than to try to kill the bill even before-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, after a bill is drafted it is very 
difficult to get it substantially changed in committee. I believe 
and the hon. member opposite would know as well as I do, 
perhaps better because he has been in the House longer, that it is 
very rare for a bill to be substantially changed when it deals with 
a whole system, a whole process of dealing with a government 
department.
<P>
	I really think it would be better to look at this from square one 
rather than trying to tinker with a bill that has already been 
drafted.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. It is now 6.30 p.m.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSPORTATIONSUBSIDIES">TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
June 7, 1994, I asked a question of the Minister of Transport 
having to do with transportation subsidies. At that time I 
expressed my concern to the minister about a speech he had 
given and which I had subsequently read. I felt the minister had 
given undue attention to the way in which the rail sector in our 
transportation system was subsidized.
<P>
	Having gone through the speech, I noticed he was making a 
general argument about the subsidization of our transportation 
argument, but every time he gave an example it was from the rail 
sector.
<P>
	I rose at that time to complain about this singling out of the 
rail sector, asking the minister to make sure that whatever he did 
or whatever he planned for our transportation system-it is still 
unclear at this point exactly what he does have in mind-that he 
not operate on the basis of this bias that he had revealed in this 
speech with respect to the rail sector.
<P>
	Not surprisingly, of course, as ministers are wont to do, he got 
up and assured me that he would take everything into account. I 
still have that concern. It is something I want to follow up today.
<P>
	Subsequent to that question, the minister has said a great deal 
about other elements of our transportation system, particularly 
with respect to airports and the commercialization plans that he 
has for the air sector as well as other transport sectors.
<P>
	A lot of Canadians see through this. They see behind the word 
commercialization basically the same consequences and the 
same agenda as what the previous government used to call 
privatization.
<P>
	There may be some fine difference between 
commercialization and privatization, but I am sure it is a 
difference that will be lost on the people who either lose their 
jobs or whose wages are reduced and whose standard of living is 
consequently reduced when the jobs they used to have go from 
the public sector to the private sector and they no longer receive 
the same benefit that they received before.
<P>
	As with so much of this privatization, commercialization, 
deregulation, free trade, et cetera, a lot of this is simply an 
agenda for reducing the incomes and the standard of living as a 
consequence of a great many Canadians who over the years have 
come to be paid decently in the public sector and for that matter 
in the private sector.
<P>
	What is happening now in so many ways is that these well paid 
working Canadians are on the hit list. They are the working 
middle class whose wages are being targeted for reduction. I 
would like to say that when the minister takes into account the 
relationship between the various transportation sectors, he 
ought to take into account the views of my constituents.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5852"> 5852 </A></B>
<P>
	He wrote me a letter at the end of June saying that he wanted 
to know what my constituents feel. I can tell him what my 
constituents feel. They feel that the minister should take 
whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we have a healthy 
rail sector in this country.
<P>
	When he does that and when he is doing that, he should take 
into account the way the trucking industry is subsidized, not just 
through the financing of public highways, but by the people who 
work in the trucking industry. One of the characteristics of the 
trucking industry and one of the reasons why it has been able to 
be so competitive with railways-using that awful word 
competitive which hides a great many injustices-is that its 
average hourly wage is so much lower.
<P>
	Why is it more? It is a result of deregulation. Anyone with the 
capital to finance a few trucks has the ability to set up a trucking 
business and to operate almost free of governmental constraints 
and regulations. There is this downward pressure on wages. 
Therefore many people who used to expect to make a decent 
living in trucking or for that matter in a great many other 
industries no longer have that expectation.
<P>
	One of the ways in which various transportation modes are 
being subsidized, but particularly in this case, trucking, is 
through the wages of the people who work there. I can say on 
behalf of the people who work in the rail sector in my riding, 
whether they work for VIA, CPR or CNR, they do not want to 
subsidize the rail sector by reducing their wages but that is 
exactly what is being asked of them now.
<P>
	I hear it in the minister's voice when he says: ``Well we don't 
want to go ahead with the VIA cuts but it depends on the labour 
negotiations''. The minister is deliberately trying to set up the 
employees of VIA and other railway employees as the 
scapegoats for whatever cuts he is already planning to make. I 
urge him not to scapegoat those employees. They are trying to 
hang on not just to a way of life but to a way of life for all 
Canadians, that is to say a way of life in which working 
Canadians are able to be well paid.
<P>
	The agenda which this government is following is the same as 
the last government's. It is an agenda which means that the 
middle class will disappear. The wages people were paid on the 
railway and in other organized industries will disappear. We will 
have a fragmented society. A few people at the top, the minority, 
will make a lot of money while more and more people at the 
bottom will make less and less all the time as a result of 
so-called competition, deregulation, globalization and all of the 
other things I have come to despise since I came to this place.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thank you to the hon. member who 
knows he got a little more than the four minutes one is supposed 
to get. We ought to give the same extension to the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me say nothing could be 
further from the truth that our agenda is that of the previous 
government. There is a lot of difference between 
commercialization and privatization, but that is for another day. 
This government does not intend to attack workers or force on 
anyone a loss of income or lower standard of living. It is about 
building a national, integrated, efficient, affordable 
transportation system taking all modes into account. As I said, 
that is for another day.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona raised the issue of 
transportation subsidies. He expressed some concerns that the 
rail industry would be unfairly affected by a review of subsidies. 
I am glad to have the opportunity to address his concerns and 
assure him and the House of Commons that any review of 
transportation subsidies will be balanced and will ensure that all 
modes are treated fairly.
<P>
	Transportation subsidies currently affect every mode. As an 
example of subsidies received by modes other than rail, almost 
80 per cent of freight subsidies in Atlantic Canada are received 
by motor carriers. Further, as mentioned by the Minister of 
Transport in his speech in Thunder Bay on June 3, the federal 
government subsidizes ferry services by approximately $160 
million and ports and harbours by $100 million each and every 
year.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's concerns about hidden 
subsidies. Indirect subsidies account for almost $700 million 
spent by the Department of Transport. One example of such a 
service is the provision of navigational aids provided by the 
coast guard.
<P>
	In the coming months the government intends to review all 
options for dealing with inefficient subsidies. Transport Canada 
is in the midst of exploring possibilities for commercialization 
of many activities that could be better achieved by other means. 
The exercise will not be targeted at specific modes but rather 
will attempt to eliminate existing distortions.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the Minister of Transport is 
clearly aware of the situation in the rail industry and that the rail 
sector will not be singled out. The objective is to provide 
Canadians with an efficient, integrated, affordable 
transportation system where the costs now imposed on 
taxpayers are borne as equitably as possible by the users.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
The House therefore stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
