<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ)</B> moved that Bill C-374, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code and the Customs Tariff 
(prohibited toys), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, this is the first time since I was elected 
to the House in 1993 that I have introduced a bill.  I 
introduced this bill, but it was inspired by people in my 
riding, who took up this fight.  I will describe this later in 
greater detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first explain what the thrust of this bill is before 
talking about a broader problem, namely the violence our 
children are exposed to on a daily basis in society at large. As 
lawmakers we have to ask ourselves whether we provide the best 
possible framework to regulate this whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my bill is to ban the manufacture, importation, 
marketing and sale of toys with instructions—and this is the 
significant point—that clearly encourage violent behaviour. I 
make this distinction because the toy might appear innocent 
enough, but the instructions are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happened to one of my constituents who bought a 
doll, more specifically a troll, for her children. 
At first glance, on the shelf, the toy was quite appealing, and 
there did not seem to be a problem.  Then one day she saw the 
instructions accompanying the doll, which said “To keep your 
troll happy, beat it, shut it up in the dark, deny it all 
possible happiness” and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the problem begins, because it is totally bad 
taste.  It is inappropriate even and unacceptable that this sort 
of message accompanying toys should appear on the market without 
impunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, a person faced with this situation would react first 
by saying “That must not be legal.  I am going to find out”. 
Ms. Ayotte, who is a resident of my riding, therefore checked 
around and finally discovered that it was a perfectly legitimate 
practice and nothing prevented it. 
That led her to give thought to the greater problem of violence 
in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to my bill, which concerns toys specifically. 
However, I would like there to be a much broader debate than 
just the focus of my bill, because the problem of violence is 
much broader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill aims to introduce a prohibition in the Criminal Code, to 
create a criminal offence for these kinds of instructions.  I 
will read the description of Bill C-374 in the summary 
accompanying it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to prohibit the sale to persons 
under the age of eighteen years, the offer for sale in a place 
to which persons under the age of eighteen years reasonably have 
access or the importation into Canada of a doll together with a 
label or writing urging any person to mistreat the doll or cause 
it to suffer injuries or degrading acts, or the packaging of 
which contains such a label or writing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the word doll included in the bill?  It was included 
because words have meaning in our language, and the word “doll” 
means an object with a human form.  So, obviously, the link is 
even more direct when a person is encouraged to inflict injuries 
on or treat in a degrading manner an object with a human form.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably far more can be done. My approach is aimed at banning 
this practice, using a specific example.  I am sure, however, 
that a number of improvements can be made to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be broadened to encompass all toys, although the point 
needs to be made that a toy per se may be relatively 
inoffensive.  The problem lies far more with the use a child is 
invited to make of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the action taken by some people in my riding, 
Mrs. Ayotte, who has five young children, set up a team, with 
community support.  The university provided researchers. 
She started up a petition, which has taken on the form of a 
giant jigsaw puzzle, and which people were invited to sign to 
indicate their wish to see society take steps to decrease the 
violence with which our children are confronted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the petition initiated by Mrs. Ayotte has been signed 
by 400,000 people.  The puzzle-petition, which has turned into 
the project “Joue-moi la paix”, has been exhibited on two 
occasions, one of them before this House.  Unfortunately, when 
they came to put it together in front of parliament, it was 
election time, and most MPs were unable to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also assembled in the riding of Rouyn—Noranda, and at that 
time all necessary steps were taken to get it into the record 
book, as it is the biggest jigsaw puzzle ever put together in 
the world. 
In the updated version of the <I>Guinness Book of Records</I>, the 
biggest puzzle in the world is associated with the “Joue-moi la 
paix” project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of Rouyn was in attendance. So was our bishop, Mgr. 
Jean-Guy Hamelin. A large number of citizens came that day, which 
became a day of celebration in Rouyn-Noranda. They came to sign 
this puzzle, if they had not already done so, or to see it being 
assembled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group had a much loftier goal than my bill, and it conducted 
much broader research. In the process, some became more 
knowledgeable. Mrs. Ayotte met with officials from the 
Department of Justice to submit her project to the government, 
asking that steps be taken to reduce the number of violent 
stimuli to which children are confronted on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not be concerned about the violence shown through 
video games and on television? A debate was held in the House on 
this issue. A petition signed by a large number of people was 
also initiated by a young woman, following a tragedy that had 
triggered a debate on the violence shown on television. The 
government followed up on this to see if additional measures 
should be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only think of recent events in our society. The tragedy 
that occurred in Denver, Colorado, where two young men entered a 
high school and killed several of their fellow students, is 
still fresh in our minds. The same thing happened last week, in 
Alberta, where a young man was killed and another injured 
because teenagers entered the school with weapons. It was 
terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there is no legislation, regulation or measure that 
can guarantee us protection from this sort of catastrophe 
indefinitely.  Far from it.  However, particularly in light of 
recent events,  we should ask ourselves if we are doing all we 
can as individuals, as parents, and also as members of 
parliament, as the lawmakers of our society.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be glad that there has been much less overall violence in 
Quebec and in Canada than in the United States, for instance, 
but we are not isolated from trends that originate there and 
eventually come our way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research showed that most of the toys I mentioned originated 
in the United States, but they still end up in our stores.  With 
the way companies operate, and distribution networks and free 
trade zones, the marketplace takes in all of North America, the 
whole world.  It is not true that, because they are made 
somewhere else, we are completely free from them. 
They end up in our businesses and they have an impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the dawn of new phenomena such as the Internet or satellite 
TV, we will have less and less control over these things, in the 
near future.  We will not be able to deny people direct access 
to American channels.  We will be able to regulate less and 
less. It will come directly on the computer, which will be 
hooked up to the TV.  People will make their own choices about 
what they want to watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do?  I would like to have the Standing Committee on 
Justice consider not specifically the focus of the bill but to 
consider what we can do.  Can we do something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are experts in the field. 
We have seen a little more of this with the events in Colorado 
and Alberta, in the information programming on television and in 
all sorts of public debates.  Questions have been raised, 
phenomena discussed.  There are people who are experts in this 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is a child really influenced growing up in this environment? 
Maybe yes, maybe no.  I do not claim to know for sure.  I think 
it does have an influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not debate the matter with these experts, who will give us 
their opinion.  It seems to me we study enough things here, for 
a question of such importance to be studied, particularly after 
the recent events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Avoiding demagoguery and remaining realistic, I am not trying to 
tell the government that what I am proposing is a magic 
solution, far from it.  This is not a simple or easy issue.  We 
can never be fully protected from phenomena or actions that are 
violent, gratuitous, incomprehensible and unexplainable. 
They result in individuals feeling so desperate and aggressive 
that they can go as far as killing others.  This kind of 
occurrence can never be completely prevented.  It will probably 
never be fully understood, either, but there are a certain 
number of things that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within my very specific bill, it seems to me that what I am 
asking for is not unrealistic. 
Moreover, when a toy, which may be merely totally tasteless in 
itself, also comes with instructions which, as the bill says, 
urges any person to adopt a violent behaviour or commit 
degrading acts, appropriate action must be taken against those 
behind the marketing of these toys.  We are not talking of 
disproportionate penalties to be made part of the Criminal Code. 
The bill speaks of maximum fines of $25,000 for manufacturers 
and, in very serious cases, a sentence not to exceed six months. 
This would not be the first time penalties would be applied, 
but it would not be a bad thing to send a message to those 
tempted to make money from such gadgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message would be: “In Canada, the Criminal Code contains 
provisions that prevent you from doing that, so take care”. 
Public pressure will always be very useful. 
The companies that will be judged negatively by the consumers 
because they sell such products will suffer the consequences. 
The vast majority of people find this unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this measure would make it illegal to do such things. 
The price to pay would be very high, not just in terms of the 
fine imposed, but also because of the negative publicity that 
would follow. If this bill became the law, it would be a 
deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I should point out one thing. I am not saying 
that this is the sole responsibility of government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parents—I myself am a young parent—we have a responsibility to 
our children. The best guarantee against all this is certainly 
the way we approach these issues with our children. The family 
setting, friends and the environment in which children grow are 
more effective than most laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, it is appropriate to start a debate on this issue and to 
expand it to allow people to express their views on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, my bill was not selected as a votable item. This 
means that, at the end of this hour, we will have heard nice 
speeches but little action will be taken. 
I am hoping this bill can be reviewed by the Standing Committee 
on Justice. The committee could, of course, conduct this review 
on its own terms, but the best guarantee would be to make the 
bill a votable item in the House, so that it would be referred 
to a committee between second and third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking all the members of this House—even though this is not 
very appealing, since it only launches the debate—to give their 
unanimous consent to put this bill to a vote after debating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the unanimous 
consent of the House to make this bill a votable item? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-374, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Customs Tariff, 
would provide for a new criminal offence of selling to a minor or 
offering to sell in a place accessible to minors or to import any 
doll that comes with a label or packaging which urges any person 
to mistreat the doll, cause it to suffer injuries or degrading 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill would further define doll as including a 
model of a troll or a model of an imaginary creature with a human 
shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would create a summary conviction criminal offence with 
a maximum penalty of $25,000, six months in prison or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, the hon. member's bill is aimed at a product which 
he believes, and I understand many of his very concerned 
constituents believe, desensitizes children to violence and 
fosters violent behaviour among children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is commendable that more and more people are now linking 
products that society offers and the environment that we have 
created to potential actions of our children and youth.  For 
example, I think of our laws on gun control.  I hope that more 
people start thinking of these connections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the hon. member's concerns about the many depictions of 
violence in the media and other aspects of our lives.  I recall 
when, as vice chair of the justice committee in the 35th 
Parliament, we actually tabled a report dealing with those very 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the criminal law is a very blunt instrument 
which carries harsh penalties and procedures.  It should be 
employed to deal with conduct that causes or threatens to cause 
serious harm to individuals or society.  However, it should only 
be used where other social control means are inadequate or 
inappropriate. I would suggest that neither are present to the 
degree necessary to create a new criminal sanction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member opposite really suggest that fighting dolls 
represent a possible threat to individuals or society in a 
similar magnitude as the social and individual harm which is 
caused by drugs, theft, guns or violence against people?  I think 
it is the relative situation here, although I understand the 
premise of what the hon. member is attempting to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dolls such as the one the hon. member is concerned about are 
really just one aspect of a larger issue.  Other forms of social 
control are perhaps more appropriate for helping our children 
deal with the images and the invitations to violence and 
aggression which these products sometimes suggest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are daily exposed to depictions of violence in all 
forms in the mass media, from TV to movies to books.  It is a 
serious component of many of the video games and websites that 
are now popular with children.  Children's games sometimes 
revolve around fighting, chasing and killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member want the Criminal Code to make it a crime 
to have a G. I. Joe doll or to play cops and robbers?  I am sure 
he does not. 
Parents make choices around those issues.  I made choices with my 
children and I am sure that all of us should be making those 
choices.  It is simply not reasonable to think that addressing 
the availability of one kind of doll will have an effect on 
children's tolerance and reaction to violence.

affect the outcome?  Can we prove this?  Can we prove it to a 
criminal burden of proof?  That is a little different.  It is a 
high burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know by observing children that they often damage their toys. 
This is activity which happens in homes and schoolyards. However, 
I wonder whether we want to relegate it to criminal activity. If 
we do then we have limited some of the freedoms we enjoy. There 
is freedom of speech even in commercial labelling.  Any law which 
directly or indirectly regulates labels or packaging could 
violate some of the freedoms that are guaranteed by our Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one area.  It is an area that in some ways we already 
overcome when the threat is serious enough.  There could be those 
instances and there are many times when we should be acting.  We 
certainly act when toy products affect physical safety.  We 
have regulations to deal with those situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen the product described by the hon. member, but I 
am sure the message is rude.  It is not something that most 
people in Canadian society would want to see.  However, in this 
society we have freedom of choice in what we buy for our 
children.  Dolls are usually bought by children, with their 
parents' money, under parental supervision.  There are ways we 
can choose products for our children or limit choices, just as 
there are ways we can choose to let them watch any amount of TV 
and any programming or to limit those choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that parents do these things because how we 
handle our children in the early years in our homes affects the 
outcome.  I am certainly a supporter of more protection and 
social support for children, especially in the early years of 
life.  However, even when there are parents in the home, I think 
there are safeguards and more resources we could use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what this bill is about.  This bill is specifically 
about creating a new criminal offence.  I think what we really 
have is not a criminal situation but a very important social 
situation that needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home I sometimes hear music on compact discs which causes 
me to say “Get that out of here.  I don't want to see you ever 
having this kind of trash”.  I do trash some of those compact 
discs because they are not appropriate.  They are more than rude. 
They use language and incite behaviour that is not found in 
Canadian values.  That is the role of a parent and that is a role 
which we should support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is criminal activity, then obviously the criminal law 
is appropriate.  That is where there are violent actions. 
However, we are talking about a doll and the labelling on the 
doll.  I think the concerns of the hon. member and his 
constituents are very well intentioned.  I could certainly 
support doing something in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a technical difficulty.  The section in the Customs 
Tariff to which the member's bill applies no longer exists. 
However, there is another section that is comparable, so it could 
be corrected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, the criminal law is a very serious tool. 
Environmental and social controls and actual social resources do 
far more to address the problems for more people.  A bill that 
narrows it down to one toy at one point in time will not fix the 
problem.  It would certainly be a token acknowledgement that 
there is a problem in a lot of areas around certain products, but 
a lot of these products are still and will remain legal.  They 
have some protections under charters when we get into some of the 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member opposite for bringing this debate 
forward because I think it is worthy of an hour's debate.  I do 
not think we should be going beyond that when our committees in 
the House have already deemed something not to be votable.  I 
think that is the fair way and that all of us should play by the 
same rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This scenario does not reach a threshold where a criminal 
offence of such magnitude should be there, although I commend and 
see the logic which started this process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to participate in the debate on Bill C-374 introduced 
by the hon. member for Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for this most worthwhile initiative and for 
bringing before the House an issue with such profound 
consequences for our children.   At the outset I would like to 
say that the work of the member's constituent, Mrs. Martine 
Ayotte, should be acknowledged.  Mrs. Ayotte has collected some 
26,000 signatures in her petition to parliament to have this 
product in question censored.  Mrs. Ayotte is a responsible and 
courageous individual, and we commend her for her bold 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The toy we are debating about today is the warrior troll. The 
purpose of toys is to bring enjoyment, joy and a smile to the 
faces of their owners.  Toys are also effective tools for 
education and often challenge our imaginative and intellectual 
capabilities.  They reflect society's moral and social values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this warrior troll represents the direct opposite of 
what we are trying to foster: a caring, loving, honest and 
tolerant society.  At a time when all parents seek the wisdom and 
strength to properly raise and guide their children to wholesome 
development and moral living, we have a corporation selling a toy 
that is intended to foster and promote violence.  This toy 
attacks the foundation of law-abiding citizens who seek peace and 
harmony, not violence and destruction.  Allow me to tell the 
House a little about this warrior troll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that I will dispel any notion this is a harmless 
little toy with no psychological consequences.  The toy in itself 
is not bad.  It is the instructions and the series of commands 
recommended by the manufacturer that are harmful.  In short, 
these instructions call for the child to beat the warrior troll 
each day.  One is never to feed this toy.  One is supposed to 
keep this creation in a dark place that gives off a foul odour. 
Finally, the instructions recommend that the child never show 
this monster any love or affection.  Is that what we want our 
children to learn? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when youngsters and society in general are yearning 
for affection and love, we want our children to own a toy that 
promotes these basic, positive human traits.  Shame on the 
inventor and the corporation that is marketing this toy.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is truly sickening is that the instructions go on to reward 
this behaviour by stating that the warrior troll will gain 
strength and be ready for battle and defend the owner.  Let us be 
honest about it.  This toy is intentionally being marketed as a 
tool to teach violence, neglect and hatred.  Are our children not 
exposed to enough of this negativity in society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate this worthy initiative I cannot help but be 
reminded of the tragic events in Littleton, Colorado, and Taber, 
Alberta.  If ever this world needed proof of the destructive 
effects of allowing our children to view, read and emulate people 
of violence or violent acts then Littleton and Taber surely come 
to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are memorial services taking place in Taber, 
Alberta.  It is heart wrenching to witness the pain and suffering 
arising from the tragedy which took place there.  I do not wish 
to say more.  It is very painful.  At this time let me extend my 
deepest and sincerest condolences to members of the family of 
Jason Lang.  We share their pain and grief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like thousands of parents I have a child who is about to enter 
high school.  The events of the past few weeks have made me more 
than a little apprehensive about the safety of my children at 
school.  I can only pray that our children are spared the hatred 
and violence that is plaguing our society.  As parents and 
parliamentarians in Canada we have a sacred responsibility to 
protect our children from those people and from those products 
which promote hatred and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member opposite for whom I have great respect. 
She acknowledged that there was a social problem, but she did not 
say what is supposed to be done.   At least we have a bill that 
is addressing an issue and something will be done.  The member 
acknowledges that there is a problem but that is all she said. We 
know that if we do not do anything it will carry on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can make a statement today by supporting Bill C-374.  Bill 
C-374 would prohibit the sale of this doll to anyone under the 
age of 18.  It would also prohibit the offer for sale of this 
doll in a place to which persons under the age of 18 would have 
reasonable access.  This bill would make it illegal for the doll 
to be accompanied by labelling calling for it to be subjected to 
degrading acts and mistreatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of our young Canadians, I call upon the House to 
support Bill C-374. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
very much appreciate the opportunity to rise in the House today 
to speak in support of Bill C-374 as put forward by the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill coming forward at this time provides us with a very 
important opportunity to talk about youth violence and some of 
the causes of youth violence in society.  Having listened to the 
government member and the Reform Party member, it is fair to say 
that all members of the House share a very deep concern about the 
nature of violence in society.  The consequences that we see in 
communities like Taber, Alberta, or in Colorado are very tragic 
and devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is also about a very specific bill that has come 
forward.  It gives us an opportunity to do something that is 
concrete.  I congratulate the hon. member and his constituents 
who have worked so hard to bring the issue forward. It is amazing 
that 400,000 people signed a petition calling on the House to 
support the bill.  This is something not to be put aside. 
That is an incredible amount of support in the community.  It 
speaks to the very deep concern of people about what is happening 
in society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard, the bill would not ban toys.  The issue is not 
toys.  According to the bill, where there is production, 
marketing or sale of various toys and where the use that is being 
encouraged through written instruction is actually something that 
is violent, that would be prohibited under the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very common sense approach.  It is something we should 
all be supporting.  This is a concrete step we could take in the 
House from a legislative viewpoint to deal with the vast array of 
products on the market that are available to young people and 
children.  In this specific instance there are actually 
instructions that are condoning, encouraging and supporting a 
very negative and violent use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be supported.  One of the issues coming from the 
bill is the question of social responsibility by the 
manufacturing industry of children's toys.  We are talking about 
a multibillion dollar industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents want to do the right thing.  Their kids are subject to 
massive overload in advertising and are asking to have this toy 
and that toy.  Most parents try to do the right thing in terms of 
monitoring these products, of trying to figure out whether they 
are toys or games that are suitable and appropriate for the age 
of the child and whether or not they are violent. Most parents 
and most communities feel absolutely overwhelmed by the barrage 
of stuff on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget we are talking about a marketplace.  We are 
talking about companies that basically are making massive profits 
as a result of peddling and marketing toys such as the ones being 
described today and their attached instructions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very serious issue of social responsibility in the 
manufacturing industry of children's toys.  If the bill were 
approved, or if the issue were sent to the justice committee, it 
would go some distance in saying to that industry that we expect 
a measure of social responsibility.  It is entirely unacceptable 
to be marketing toys which encourage children to be violent and 
to deny feelings of care, love and responsibility which they 
learn from their families or communities.  Children are faced 
with very conflicting messages in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A primary responsibility in the House in terms of the 
legislation we enact is the protection of our children.  We value 
that as a society.  It is not just about freedom of choice or 
freedom of speech.  It is about protecting children and saying 
that the marketplace has run amok.  The marketplace is now 
dictating and selling products in such a fashion that it is 
contributing to a lot of confusion, a lot of mixed messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government member raised a question as to whether or not this 
kind of product would actually lead to violence against people. 
We are talking about toys for sure, but does it lead to further 
violence against people?  That is the same issue that is being 
raised by the member who put forward the bill.  That is why the 
member is suggesting it should go to the justice committee for a 
proper debate about issues of violence so that we can look at 
some of the underlying causes.  That has to include the products 
available on the market and the way they are marketed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is very much in support of the bill and 
very much in support of the debate taking place, in particular at 
the justice committee, given the tragedies of the past week where 
communities and families are grappling with the senseless 
violence which takes place around us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a responsibility to be reflective, to step back and 
ask, “Where can we begin to put this picture right”.  There is 
a legislative and a community response to how we develop healthy, 
strong communities and how we involve children in our society by 
ensuring that there is no social isolation which I think is one 
of factors that is beginning to emerge with the tragedy in Taber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see programs that have been cut to the bone.  I remember 
having a conversation with one of my colleagues who was telling 
me about the level of suicides in her community in New Brunswick. 
She said there were no youth preventative programs available and 
no youth drop-ins.  The kids had nowhere to go.  All these issues 
are linked.  We all understand that they are linked but it is 
sometimes hard for us to actually figure out how specifically we 
can begin to address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not put aside the opportunity that is being presented 
today in the House.   We should actually move forward with this 
kind of initiative and not just see it buried on some dusty shelf 
as a private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the bill today and continue discussion of it in the 
justice committee because of the importance in terms of the 
debate that can flow from that on how we can deal with products 
on the marketplace.  We want to ensure that there is adequate 
regulation so that children's toys are not used for a violent 
purpose.  We do not condone nor encourage behaviour that is 
violent in terms of how kids interact with inanimate objects, 
with their peers, with other children or within their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would support the hon. member if, in his closing remarks, he 
chooses to seek the consent of the House for this matter be 
referred to the justice committee for further debate.  We believe 
it is a very important initiative.  We owe it to the 400,000 
people, who took the time to think about this issue, to not let 
debate die on the bill.  Something useful and beneficial can come 
out of it.  It may well be an amendment to the Criminal Code or 
some other option, but it is something that should be supported.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise before the House to debate Bill C-374, an act to amend 
the Criminal Code and the Customs Tariff with regard to 
prohibited toys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my hon. colleague from the Bloc, the member for 
Témiscamingue, for recognizing the inherent dangers that exist 
within the labelling of some products that are readily available 
to very young and impressionable children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill focuses primarily on the labelling of dolls, 
it does raise important questions about all labelling in general 
and the effects the labelling could have on our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface, it would seem that the information contained 
within the labelling of dolls could not possibly be detrimental 
to our children.  However, nothing could be further from the 
truth.  Certain labels could realistically create subliminal 
messages that negatively influence the perception some children 
have in regard to what constitutes acceptable behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impetus for creating the bill originated from the efforts 
of one concerned citizen who happened to purchase a toy for her 
child only to discover that it contained within the instructions 
messages encouraging violence.  Not only did the instructions 
encourage violence, it suggested that violence would make the 
child happier and more powerful in our society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is violence everywhere in our society.  Evening television 
abounds with examples of how we are influenced by it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more disturbing is the age of those committing acts of 
violence.  Increasingly, they are under the age of 20. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-374 speaks to a broader issue of the prevalence of 
violence in our society.  Everywhere one turns, children are 
being bombarded with messages that effectively state that 
violence is an accepted means of resolving one's problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look around to see that violence is depicted 
just about everywhere.  For years now the motion picture industry 
has been competing against each other to see who can recreate the 
most realistic special effects depicting violent acts within our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many television programs are also helping to accentuate the 
prevalence of crime in major cities.  The portrayals of these 
crimes are so realistic that it is sometimes hard for some 
children to differentiate between what is real and what is 
fiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that our young people are influenced by what 
they see on television.  The Colorado tragedy is proof of this. 
The method used to commit the murders bears a strong resemblance 
to a film seen in theatres. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in Colorado is truly appalling.  I would like to 
offer my heartfelt sympathy to all those who were affected by 
this tragic event.  This massacre was followed by another high 
school attack on two teenagers in Alberta that left one young man 
dead and another seriously injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Details of such vicious attacks are becoming far too prevalent. 
Canadians used to believe that these terrible crimes were 
confined to big cities in the U.S.  However, the shooting in 
Alberta and the terrible torture and murder of Reena Virk in B.C. 
have opened our eyes to the reality that our youth are 
increasingly turning to violence to resolve their differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in crime is why the PC Party and Canadians as a 
whole have been calling on the Minister of Justice to amend the 
1984 Young Offenders Act to make it tougher on those who insist 
on pursuing a life of crime.  Canadians are sick and tired of 
seeing violent young offenders getting off virtually scot-free. 
Canadians want the government to start focusing greater attention 
on victims.  They want their rights recognized and protected, 
just as much as the system presently protects young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1998, the justice minister unveiled a new youth strategy 
to renew the 1984 Young Offenders Act.  During meetings with 
provincial justice ministers, the federal minister heard her 
counterparts demand tougher legislation that would respond to the 
demands of society.  Calls included lowering the age of 
application of the Young Offenders Act for serious violent crimes 
from 12 to 10 years of age and providing for easier transfer of 
cases involving serious offences to adult court from youth court, 
instead of a general reduction of the maximum age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party endorsed measures to make the act tougher on youth 
crime.  Led by our party's justice critic, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, a former crown prosecutor who 
witnessed the lives of many of the victims of youth crime, we 
fought hard to convince the government that tougher legislation 
was needed to help protect society.  Besides lowering the age of 
application of the Young Offenders Act from 12 to 10 years of 
age, he strongly supported giving judges more power to impose 
mandatory treatment or therapy on troubled youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that changes to the Young Offenders Act will fall 
far short of what Canadians expected and what the country needs 
to help reduce the prevalence of youth crime within society. 
Therefore, it is important that as elected officials we continue 
to pressure the government into accepting its responsibility of 
protecting Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-374 will not eliminate youth crime.  However, it could 
help to prevent young children from being exposed too early to 
violence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I again congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Témiscamingue, as well as Ms. Ayotte, who took her petition far 
and wide to educate us to the danger found on the labels of 
children's dolls.  Bill C-374 is a good initiative and I urge all

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to debate this bill, which I know fairly well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together with my Bloc colleague, the member for Témiscamingue, I 
met with Mrs. Martine Ayotte at the very beginning, when she 
started her petition and her giant puzzle. She wanted to raise 
the awareness of politicians, but mostly she wanted to find out 
what they thought of this kind of toys. She was interested in 
the Bloc's position, and more specifically its justice critic's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the start she got the unwavering support of her 
federal MP in this matter, but she wanted to know what a member 
of the Standing Committee on Justice thought of her petition and 
giant puzzle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not repeat what has been said so far on the issue. It can 
easily be summed up as follows: a woman realized that in Canada 
in the 1990s you can purchase a toy with instructions inciting 
young people to violence. These instructions were aimed at young 
children. Teenagers do not play with trolls, young children do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how vulnerable young children are. The instructions said 
“To make your troll happy you must beat it up, throw it around, 
lock it up in the dark without food, and so forth”. This will 
make a troll happy. Is this the kind of instructions we want to 
give children in Canada? Of course not. I can see that all the 
representatives of the opposition parties are against this kind 
of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is allowed and legal, one must wonder if is it normal 
that in a country as advanced as ours in every respect, toy 
manufacturers, merchants, and stores are allowed to market toys 
inciting children to violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a five or six-year old does will stay with him all his life. 
We know that at that age, at five or six, children are very 
vulnerable and impressionable. If they are told that to make a 
toy happy they must mistreat it, they might eventually come to 
believe this is the way to behave when they grow up. This is 
unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's bill introduced by the member for 
Témiscamingue deals with dolls. It could have included video 
games, board games, violent movies and so forth. 
But to respond to the request of one person in particular, Mrs. 
Martine Ayotte, the member specifically restricted its scope to 
dolls, more particularly trolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What member for Témiscamingue and I are asking its that the 
House unanimously agree to make this item votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to make this bill 
a votable bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to see—I must point 
this out for our audience because it is not clear—that the 
Liberal MPs are the ones refusing to give consent for this bill 
to be votable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. members for London West, Calgary 
East, Vancouver East and West Nova, for having expressed their 
opinions.  I particularly thank the NDP, Reform, and 
Conservative members who have supported the bill, and in 
particular the idea of expanding the debate to encompass an 
examination by parliament of the entire issue of the violence 
faced by our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there will be no vote on this bill, the issue will not get 
to committee by that means.  I hope that the members of the 
justice committee—the majority of them from the party in 
power—will take it over and address this issue, which has become 
so terribly timely.  We cannot continue to do nothing and to not 
examine this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the two or three minutes I have left, I also wish to thank 
Mrs. Ayotte and all those in her region, in all of Quebec, and 
in all of Canada, who have supported and encouraged her.  I want 
her to know that today is far from being the end of the matter. 
We took an hour to discuss it here in the House today, but 
things will not stop there.  I will continue to focus my 
energies on trying to persuade my colleagues in the House that 
we must do something. 
I will also encourage members of the Standing Committee on 
Justice to initiate the consideration, discussion and public 
debate of the issue of the violence children are subjected to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to respond to the Liberal member, who spoke, 
raising legitimate questions.  Is the Criminal Code the most 
effective way?  Care must be taken when the Criminal Code is 
used.  I am very open to this sort of criticism.  This is why we 
want a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think we have to create a criminal offence. 
Obviously, offences under the Criminal Code are not all the same 
sort.  And they are punished differently.  The fact that they 
come under the Criminal Code does not mean they are judged the 
same way.  Nevertheless, they are criminal offences.  Then there 
are degrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look closely at the fact that a number of business are 
aiming their marketing directly at our children.  We have to 
react when these marketing strategies focus on behaviour we 
consider unacceptable in society, such as violence.  We do so 
with anti-smoking campaigns, where we fight to ensure that young 
children cannot have access to tobacco products, and with good 
reason.  We must do likewise to prevent companies from directing 
at young people messages inciting them to violence and 
encouraging them to use these products and to behave this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who still have doubts and are saying “No, we must not 
act”, we put the following question. 
One can rightfully argue that children are also influenced by 
their parents, their family, their environment and other 
factors, which are not necessarily regulated by the government. 
But are the members across the way sure that all available means 
have been used? Are they sure nothing more could be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any doubt in our minds, then we should continue the 
debate and expand it to include the general public, which has 
something to say about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank and congratulate Mrs. Ayotte and her group, all 
the stakeholders who supported her, including those who 
sponsored and financed the representations, the university that 
provided the research staff, and all those who were involved—I 
will not name them, because there are many—and those who 
supported this initiative, including the hon. members from the 
various political parties who spoke to the issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope further consideration will be given to this issue and 
that action will be taken. We should go the extra mile and hold 
a broad public debate to find out whether the federal government 
is using all the means available to it to try to further 
restrict these messages of violence to which our children are 
confronted on a daily basis.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC)</B>  moved: 
<A NAME="LINK14">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government 
to develop a new national shipbuilding policy to support the 
revitalization of the Canadian shipbuilding industry by 
maintaining and advancing the degree of excellence and the 
technologies for which Canada is historically renowned, given 
that Canada has the longest coastline of any nation in the world 
and that historically Canadians are among the finest shipbuilders 
in the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the 
hon. member for Burin—St. George's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new shipbuilding policy is a pan-Canadian issue.  Shipyards 
are located across Canada, in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I and Newfoundland. Many ridings 
from coast to coast in Canada, including my riding of Saint John 
in New Brunswick, are suffering from the lack of leadership from 
this government on the very important issue of a national 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice in the past six years the Liberal Party of Canada passed 
resolutions at its 1993 and 1998 national meetings stating that 
it considered shipbuilding to be a priority and that it was going 
to establish a new, modern, national shipbuilding policy.  We are 
still waiting for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has let the industry slide to the point of near 
extinction in Canada.  Many shipbuilding companies are on the 
verge of shutting down without a policy from this government to 
bring our industry to a competing level with our competitors 
around the world.  How can a Canadian shipbuilding company 
survive when our ships end up being almost twice the cost of 
those built half a world away? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not winning contracts.  Just to give hon. members an 
example, if Saint John Shipbuilding does not land a contract 
soon, it will be closing its doors.  Saint John Shipbuilding is 
the most modern shipyard in the world, but it will have no 
choice.  It has bid on over 50 contracts around the world and it 
is unable to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian shipbuilding at its peak employed almost 12,000 people. 
It is not unrealistic to think that the number of spinoff jobs 
was around the same, for a total of 24,000 people across Canada 
employed, happy, contributing to the tax rolls and the economy 
and contributing to their communities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now at its lowest point, the Canadian shipbuilding industry 
employs roughly 4,000 people across the country.  Again, the 
number of spinoff jobs is about the same. Through this 
government's lack of initiative, approximately 20,000 people are 
out of work.  This is simply not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the days when the government was in opposition the 
Minister of Industry was the transport critic.  Many pieces of 
correspondence, of which I have copies, were sent to the 
shipbuilding industry members by the transport critic, now our 
Minister of Industry.  He claimed that the issue of a revamped 
modern shipbuilding policy was an utmost priority.  This 
sentiment was echoed by the current Prime Minister when he was in 
opposition.  I quote from one of those letters. The Prime 
Minister when in opposition stated “It is safe to say that most 
people recognize that something needs to be done to create a much 
more competitive shipbuilding industry”. Today where is the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberal Party membership voted in favour of 
developing a new national shipbuilding policy.  In 1993 the 
Liberal Party became the government.  It was being given the 
chance to make the changes that it for so long decreed as 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly the sentiment of the government changed. In further 
correspondence with members of the shipbuilding industry the 
current Minister of Industry started to change his tune.  He 
stated “Your proposals were insightful and creative; however, to 
implement these would require the dedication of significant 
resources which are not presently allocated to shipbuilding”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national shipbuilding policy was no longer on the top of his 
agenda nor on the top of the agenda of this government. 
It was relegated to the bottom of the list apparently, because 
after six years of being in government, no sign of a modern 
national shipbuilding policy has been seen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the Liberal promise of change?  Need I ask?  It 
has gone to the same black hole with other Liberal promises from 
the red book, just like the GST, the helicopter situation and the 
Pearson airport deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last Tory government considered national shipbuilding to be 
a priority and developed many initiatives to promote our skill in 
this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canadian patrol frigate program produced 
thousands of jobs in Atlantic Canada and Quebec through contracts 
that produced 12 new frigates.  This program brought worldwide 
attention to Canada's capability to design, integrate, test, 
construct and manage large projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in 1991 we awarded 12 maritime coastal defence vessels for 
the Canadian navy, designed and built here in Canada.  The 
contract for the MCDVs created a steady flow of work into the 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following is from experts and is in today's Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other countries, the Canadian military has no dedicated 
transport ships necessary to move equipment overseas.  It must 
either rent commercial vessels to go to a conflict area or hitch 
a ride from its allies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC government in its time was in an era of fiscal 
responsibility and had to reduce total transportation subsidies. 
However we took the steps to ensure the viability of the 
shipbuilding industry because of the many positive spinoffs to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the current Liberal government to recognize the 
importance of a national shipbuilding policy and to develop it 
immediately so that people will still be working in our shipyards 
across the country at the turn of the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In discussions with members of the shipbuilding industry, we 
have determined what the industry requires in order to survive. 
There are four things: one, exclusion of new construction ships 
built in Canadian shipyards from the present Revenue Canada 
leasing regulations; two, provision of an improved export 
financing and loan guarantee program similar to the title XI 
program in the U.S.; three, provision of a refundable tax credit 
to Canadian shipowners of shipbuilders who contract to build a 
ship or contract for conversion with change of emission, mid-life 
refit or major refit; and four, eliminate the one-sided aspects 
of NAFTA which allow the U.S. to sell new or used ships duty free 
in Canada yet absolutely prohibit Canadian access to the U.S. 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government today to live up to the promises the 
Liberals made to get elected and form the government in 1993 and 
again in 1998.  The Liberal government adopted resolutions, as I 
have stated, that this situation with shipbuilding would be 
rectified. The Liberal government has not followed through and 
the people are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These highly skilled workers will have to leave this great 
country of ours and find work in the U.S. if we do not get a new 
national shipbuilding policy immediately.  I say that because 
they came up from Louisiana, U.S.A. to my riding a month ago and 
offered jobs in the United States to 200 men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make sure these people can stay in Canada to raise their 
children on Canadian soil and be proud to be among the best 
shipbuilders in the world, please let us all work together in 
this House.  Let us develop this new shipbuilding policy with 
this end as our goal for our people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard the member opposite 
speak about shipbuilding and some of the things the previous 
government did. I did not hear anything about the Jones act in 
the United States when her party decided to throw in the cards 
from Canada and did nothing about changing the Jones act.  Maybe 
the member could address why the member opposite did not do 
anything about changing the Jones act and allowed the 
protectionism in the U.S. to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are asking for changes 
in the Jones act.  The Liberal government has been in power now 
for six years.  The Liberals see the problem. It was not a 
problem when we were in government because we were supporting 
shipbuilding.  We gave the frigate program.  We gave the program 
to Halifax and to B.C. as well, all across this country.  But if 
they do not change the Jones act, then there should be an act to 
protect the Canadian shipbuilding industry.

I congratulate the member for Saint John on her motion and 
speech, which echo Bloc Quebecois sentiments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would tend to agree with the parliamentary secretary. 
I think that the Mulroney government did not have enough time 
to implement certain solutions.  It had begun to propose a 
rationalization of shipyards and had approached all provincial 
governments with shipyards in Canada. Quebec took action.  We 
had three major shipyards, one in Sorel, one in Longueuil, and 
one in Lévis, and all operations were shifted to Lévis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know why the maritimes have not fully 
rationalized shipyards. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when we were in power we 
did not rationalize the industry.  The industry rationalized 
itself at a time when the demand for ships was in decline.  Our 
government continued to provide assistance and support to the 
industry.  We invested $60 million in capital improvements in the 
port of Vancouver, which allowed Vancouver to become an 
internationally recognized maritime centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian patrol frigate was the largest federal program ever 
awarded.  The original contract for six frigates in 1983 and the 
additional six in 1987 went to the Saint John shipyard.  The 
frigate program brought worldwide recognition of Canada's 
capability to design, integrate, test, construct, manufacture and 
manage large projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal Party was in power it gave the first contract 
for the first six frigates to Saint John and Quebec.  Then we 
came into power and we gave the six frigates contract to Saint 
John.  There are companies in the country which are hoping and 
praying that once again the government will bring in a national 
shipbuilding policy.  There are trained people, manufacturers and 
so on waiting for this policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
applaud my colleague from the neighbouring riding of Saint John 
for the efforts she has put forth on a consistent basis, not just 
during this mandate of 1997 but during her first mandate between 
1993 and 1997.  She knew it was imperative to have a viable 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for her efforts.  I also point out to the 
parliamentary secretary that Canada has benefited from a rules 
based trade regime such as NAFTA and the FTA.  This does not mean 
that we have stopped fighting for our shipyards, and I know the 
member for Saint John will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Once again, Mr. Speaker, I have to say 
that in today's society when we are running to become a member of 
the government in the House we cannot make false promises any 
more.  Our people across the country are educated people and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but 
her time has run out.  I understand the member is sharing her 
time with the hon. member Burin—St. George's who has 10 minutes 
for his speech and 5 minutes for questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to second the motion put forward by my 
colleague from Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Fundy—Royal said, we have been trying to 
raise the issue of the shipbuilding industry in the House of 
Commons over the last number of months because there is a crisis 
in that industry.  As we speak a campaign is being organized by 
the marine workers union and by the CAW across the country to try 
to have some impact on the federal government, in particular the 
industry minister, and to impress upon him the need for a new 
shipbuilding policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry and the ship repair industry are 
presently dying a slow death in Canada.  If the government does 
not implement some new fiscal measures, we will see the situation 
worsen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 there were some 12,000 people employed in the 
shipbuilding industry in Canada.  In 1996-97 those numbers had 
dropped to approximately 5,000.  In 1998 it was down to 4,000 as 
my colleague from Saint John mentioned in her address.  That is a 
significant drop.  The shipbuilding industry provides very good 
jobs and well paying jobs for the people employed in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipyards and ship repair centres are located across the country 
in some of the areas hardest hit economically.  We could talk 
about Atlantic Canada, Quebec and British Columbia.  We need all 
the economic stimulation we can get in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we have brought forward this motion.  We are trying 
to get the support of our colleagues in the House of Commons. 
This matter goes beyond our own constituencies.  I have a 
shipyard in my constituency of Burin—St. George's located at 
Marystown.  It is a great economic stimulator for the Burin 
peninsula and for the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the motion goes beyond our own parochial needs.  It 
talks about the need for a national shipbuilding policy. 
Shipbuilding is a very important industry.  It does wonders for 
us economically by creating employment.  All we are asking is for 
the industry minister to attach some priority to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However he refuses to meet with the major players in the 
industry.  He refuses to meet with the unions that are 
spearheading this campaign.  Why does the industry minister have 
such a closed mind on this issue when just last week he hastily 
arranged a summit of the NHL franchises in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pro sport and pro hockey as I am, and my background speaks 
volumes about that, how can the industry minister so hastily 
arrange a hockey summit to talk with the owners of NHL franchises 
in this country that are struggling because of our situation 
compared with that of the U.S.?  We are paying our players in 
U.S. dollars.  We are a small market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet he refuses to deal with the major shipbuilding crisis.  One 
of the main problems is the competition from the U.S. which 
builds new ships and repairs them and sends them to Canada, but 
we are not allowed to return the favour and send ships to the 
U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the industry minister not treat shipbuilding in the 
same way he is treating hockey?  The shipbuilding industry is 
certainly as important to the country as our NHL franchises. They 
are important as well.  That is my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Saint John has highlighted very well some of 
the fiscal measures we would like to see the government 
implement.  No one is asking for direct subsidies.  The industry 
minister, time after time when he has risen on the issue in the 
House, keeps talking about subsidies.  No one is asking for 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for fiscal measures which will level the playing 
field for the shipbuilding industry in the country, level the 
playing field with the U.S., with the European countries and with 
the Asian market so that we at least have a fighting chance to 
bid on work and obtain work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move an amendment, seconded by my colleague from 
Chicoutimi, before I conclude my remarks this morning: 
<A NAME="LINK19">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word “develop” 
the word “immediately”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Saint John alluded to a number of fiscal 
measures which we would like to see the government implement such 
as a loan guarantee program and tax credits.  Changes have to be 
made to taxation laws for vessel leasing, and trade and tariff 
policies need to be reviewed.  May I be so bold as to suggest 
that they need to be revised to provide a level playing field for 
the Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to raise the profile of this important issue in 
parliament.  There are still 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in the industry 
in Canada today.  There is potential to double or triple that 
number and provide good paying jobs in all regions of the country 
where shipbuilding is present.

consider most important for the shipbuilding industry, for 
employment and for economic stimulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The amendment is in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the 
member for Burin—St. George's.  He indicated that the industry 
minister refused to meet with the association and the 
shipbuilding industry.  The minister reported to the House once 
before that he met with the shipbuilding association and the 
industry executives from New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than trying to mislead the Canadian public, the member 
should indicate the minister reported to the House that he had 
met with them.  The member's statement is totally incorrect.  As 
an hon. member he should withdraw it and insert that the minister 
met with the association and executives from New Brunswick, 
Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia last March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I did make any 
incorrect statement to the House about the minister and his 
meetings with representatives of the shipbuilding industry, I 
would certainly withdraw it.  The information I had was that he 
refused to meet with representatives from the Atlantic provinces. 
Maybe I did not get the information correctly, and I apologize 
for that if I did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not interested in playing petty politics.  This issue is 
too important to be taken up with what I said was correct or 
incorrect.  It is too important for the parliamentary secretary 
to rise in his place and talk about a government with which the 
voters of Canada dealt six or seven years ago when they voted out 
the Conservatives and elected the Liberals.  That is not what it 
is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been in power now for six years.  In 1993 they 
became the Government of Canada. It is time for the parliamentary 
secretary, the minister and others over there to recognize they 
are now the government of the country.  Canadian taxpayers and 
people involved in the shipbuilding industry in Canada expect 
them to make decisions for the benefit of the shipbuilding 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no good going back to Mulroney, Diefenbaker, Trudeau, 
Laurier, Pearson and others.  People in Canada want the 
parliamentary secretary, the minister and the government to make 
decisions which will improve the shipbuilding industry in Canada 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I really do think that the federal government is very 
concerned about this issue, but I would like to ask the member, 
though, do the provinces not have a role to play in this.  Should 
the provinces not be active in helping out these industries which 
are indeed in their territories? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I meant to make that 
reference in my remarks.  There is a very important role for 
provincial governments to play in revitalizing and regenerating 
the shipbuilding industry.  They cannot be let off the hook, but 
it is the federal government and the industry minister which must 
take the lead role.  We must have a new national shipbuilding 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a member of a provincial government in Newfoundland 
and Labrador we entered into a trawler replacement program with 
Fishery Products International Limited.  We built offshore supply 
vessels on spec at the Marystown shipyard.  As a provincial 
government we were very proactive in the shipbuilding industry in 
creating employment in one shipyard in Marystown on the Burin 
peninsula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are possibilities for provincial governments to get 
involved.  Only last week the auditor general said in his report 
that we do not have enough patrol vessels to enforce our 
fishery's policies and regulations.  There is a place for 
provincial governments to play a role, but the major role and the 
most important government is the government of which the hon. 
member is a member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, is it 
not true that representatives of the shipbuilding industry have 
stated to the hon. member that if Revenue Canada excluded 
Canadian built ships from leasing rules as it does for furniture, 
computers, rail cars, autos and vans, they then would be able to 
be competitive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, indeed, the industry 
has indicated that to me, and my colleague has alluded to the 
four or five measures that the Canadian shipbuilding association, 
the marine workers union and the CAW want.  I want to go on 
record again as saying, yes, that certainly would level the 
playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize enough that no one in the shipbuilding 
industry, whether it be the people who own, manage and operate 
the yards, or the unions, is asking for direct subsidies from the 
government.  They are not asking for subsidies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I want to assure the 
House that the usual discussions have taken place with 
representatives of all parties.  Therefore, I believe you would 
find consent for the following motion: 
<A NAME="LINK24">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of the present debate on today's 
Opposition Motion, all questions necessary to dispose of this 
motion be deemed put, a recorded division deemed requested and 
deferred until Wednesday, May 5, 1999, at the expiry of the time 
provided for Government Orders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Saint John 
is right to point out that shipbuilding is a long and honourable 
tradition in Canada.  It is an important part of Canada's marine 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the shipbuilding industry employed 5,400 Canadians and 
had total revenues of around $625 million.  Canada's current 
strength is in building high quality, relatively small vessels, 
such as ferries, icebreakers, tug boats, fishing vessels, 
excursion craft and so on.  We are also internationally 
competitive in commercial ship overhauls and mining platforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many regions of Canada have shipbuilding companies.  Activity on 
the east coast has recently centred on the construction of two 
container ships, two offshore vessels and tugs, the refit of one 
oil rig, the manufacture of oil rig components and various 
commercial repair work.  The industry in Quebec has been involved 
in upgrading one oil rig, constructing tugs and doing ship 
overhauls and commercial repairs.  The Ontario industry is 
currently active in the reconstruction of three bulk carriers, 
the conversion of two ships into one self-unloading ship and 
commercial repairs.  The primary construction activity in B.C. 
has been the three high speed ferries, but the industry is also 
active in the construction of smaller ferries and in commercial 
and government ship repairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health of the shipbuilding industry concerns four regions 
and seven of Canada's ten provinces.  The Government of Canada 
recognizes the importance of the industry.  It has a shipbuilding 
policy that benefits the industry and acknowledges that taxpayers 
want to stop business subsidies.  This policy includes an 
accelerated capital cost allowance of 33.3% for Canadian 
shipbuilding.  Many other industries would not mind having that 
type of capital cost allowance write-off.  The policy includes a 
25% duty on most non-NAFTA ship imports, domestic procurement on 
a competitive basis for all government shipbuilding and ship 
repairs, a favourable research and development tax credit system, 
including the technology partnerships Canada program, as well as 
Export Development Corporation financing for commercially viable 
transactions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, after consulting with the industry, we extended the 
pay back period for this financing from eight years to twelve 
years.  In fact discussions with the Export Development 
Corporation continue in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also add that one of the major contributions the 
government makes to the competitiveness of our shipbuilding 
industry is through the facilities of the National Research 
Council.  In Saint John, NRC's Institute for Marine Dynamics 
offers R and D programs in ship design and advanced navigation 
systems, ice structure and wave structure interaction, and 
innovative concepts in such areas as underwater vehicles and 
recreational craft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not alone in supporting the 
shipbuilding industry in this country.  Two provinces have come 
forward with programs to foster shipbuilding in their 
jurisdictions.  Nova Scotia has a shipbuilding loan guarantee 
program similar to Title XI in the United States.  The program 
consists of loan guarantees up to 87.5% of the buyer loan, with a 
maximum $80 million to be guaranteed at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March Nova Scotia announced that it will provide $47.5 
million in loan guarantees to Secunda Marine of Dartmouth for the 
construction of two supply vessels for the Terra Nova offshore 
oil project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has also stepped forward with a program 
for the shipbuilding industry.  Quebec will provide a 50% subsidy 
on the direct labour costs of the first ship built in a series or 
converted into series.  The subsidy may be as high as 20% of the 
ship costs, with the subsidy decreasing to zero over the first 
four ships.  Quebec has also provided income tax exemptions on 
the foreign income of Quebec mariners and has reduced the capital 
tax for owners of new ships operating internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite have been calling for similar subsidies to 
be provided by the federal government.  I would ask them if they 
would be prepared to offer similar subsidies to every other 
industry in Canada that must meet the test of tough international 
competition.  Some say that shipbuilding is an exceptional case 
because other countries subsidize their industry so heavily.  The 
Bloc in particular wants Canada to match the kind of subsidies 
provided by European countries and the United States.  What it 
neglects to say is that even if we tried to match these subsidies 
dollar for dollar there is no guarantee nor even a likelihood 
that foreign buyers would turn to Canadian ships instead of ships 
from their own country or region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international market for ships is much more complicated than 
that.  It is not just a case of who offers the best price or who 
puts more of a burden on their taxpayers so they can offer a good 
price.  In the case of the United States, for example, the Jones 
Act of 1920 prohibits non-U.S. boats from taking part in domestic 
U.S. commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is participating in the OECD and WTO 
negotiations to eliminate subsidies and remove the barriers that 
impede the ability of our shipbuilding companies to compete 
internationally.  We offer generous tax and export support.  We 
are continuing to meet with industry representatives to fine tune 
the programs now in place and ensure that the industry takes 
advantage of them.  That is a more realistic response to the 
challenges faced by the Canadian shipbuilding industry than the 
spend thrift proposals we have heard from the opposition parties 
to date.

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it cannot be said that the parliamentary secretary does not care 
about the shipbuilding industry.  There is a shipyard in his own 
riding.  I met with him during the summer.  He is worried about 
the industry, but he seems to be the only Liberal that is.  He 
is unable to convince his colleagues to do what the shipbuilding 
industry and unions would like them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is stopping the Liberal Party from holding the shipbuilding 
industry summit Liberal candidates promised during the 1993 
election campaign?  They were talking about the following year, 
1994, but five years have gone by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be dismissed as an election promise but, more recently, 
members of the Liberal Party from the maritimes also called for 
something to be done for shipbuilding, for a good policy to be 
developed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, just recently, the Liberal premier of New Brunswick, Mr. 
Thériault, criticized the Minister of Industry's attitude.  The 
minister always says that he has a good policy but, if it is as 
good as all that, why is the shipbuilding industry operating at 
only 40% of capacity? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question and I also thank him for his tour last year of my 
area to review shipbuilding and to understand the shipbuilding 
industry in Ontario, which is not only in southern Ontario but in 
the Ottawa area as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind him that we do not want to get into a subsidy 
shipping war because of other countries.  We have heard over and 
over “not a subsidy”.  However, when we get down to reviewing 
proposals it becomes a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested in proposals, as long as they do not involve a 
subsidy campaign.  I am willing to meet with the member, as I 
have before.  However, let us understand that the Export 
Development Corporation, in conjunction with the member for 
Fredericton and a representative of the shipbuilding industry in 
New Brunswick, met to discuss the EDC's financing and over time 
it changed from eight to twelve years.  They are still meeting 
on an ongoing basis to discuss various other alternatives.  That 
is the way it should be done, sector by sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Lévis mentioned the premier of New Brunswick, to 
whom I have written in objection to his comments that there is no 
shipbuilding industry in Ontario and that if there were, maybe 
there would be interest.  I immediately wrote to him so that he 
could understand the shipbuilding industry across Canada.  I do 
not believe he understood that the shipbuilding industry exists 
from coast to coast to coast.  I am interested in how he would 
proceed from there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
caution the parliamentary secretary to be far more judicious in 
his comments in terms of the use of the words tax incentives 
versus subsidy.  Revising Revenue Canada leasing regulations is a 
tax incentive.  It is not a subsidy in any way, shape or form. 
He can ask the finance minister or the secretary of state for 
finance.  It is a concrete initiative which was tabled by the 
industry, the premiers, labour, shipowners and shipbuilders, who 
all agree that it is not a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of our motion comes from Liberal Party policy 
conventions of 1993 and 1998.  Did the parliamentary secretary 
support it at those conventions?  If he did, will he support it 
when it actually comes to a vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I had discussions 
with members across our country on shipbuilding.  My comments 
there were the same comments as here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to understand all aspects of the shipbuilding 
industry.  Before we know it, when people talk about the various 
items, it becomes a subsidy.  The important thing is that if 
there is to be an initiative we must back the initiative down. Is 
it a subsidy in the end or is it not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion before 
the House, put forward by the member for Saint John and seconded 
by the member for Burin—St. George's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that the motion is empty and meaningless and would 
compel the Liberal government to do essentially nothing to help 
the shipbuilding industry that it is not already doing through 
the discredited technology partnerships Canada program and the 
failed research and development tax credit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address both of those issues further, but I would like to 
first address what the Reform caucus had hoped for with this 
motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped to introduce an amendment to the motion.  While I 
know this is no longer possible, I would like to read the motion 
into the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government to develop a new national 
shipbuilding policy that includes broad based tax relief for all 
Canadians and a commitment to pursue better access to 
international markets, particularly American markets, through 
equitable trade liberalization. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amended motion would have called on the government to 
specifically address high taxes as the primary cause for low 
productivity and slow economic growth in the shipbuilding 
industry.  It would have addressed the unfair trade practices 
exempt under NAFTA which effectively exclude Canadians from 
participating in a $1.1 billion U.S. shipping market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I would like to take the time later in my speech to 
address the issues of taxation and the serious problem of 
inequality with the U.S.  However, to ensure that the members of 
the House understand the Reform Party's position on the motion, I 
will quote from the Leader of the Official Opposition. He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Official Opposition believes that tax relief and the 
expansion of Atlantic Rim trade are the keys to job creation in 
Atlantic Canada, and we will vigorously represent those views on 
your behalf in parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition made these remarks, which are 
embodied in the proposed amendment, on October 16, 1998.  The 
remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition are not that much 
different from the remarks made by the hon. member for 
Fundy—Royal in 1997 when the Tory motion on shipbuilding was 
debated in the House.  The member insisted he was not interested 
in subsidies but deregulation and improving Canadian access to 
international markets, in particular U.S. markets.  Therefore, 
the motion would have been consistent with the Tory shipbuilding 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My questions for the Tory members of the House are:  Why does 
the motion not address the issue of high taxation; and, why does 
it not address the important issue of trade barriers and trade 
discrimination? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Broad based tax relief for all Canadians is needed to ensure 
that shipbuilding and all other Canadian industries survive.  It 
is that simple.  It is so simple that even the Minister of 
Industry is beginning to understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief is not part of the Tory shipbuilding plan.  The 
Tories have consistently called for loan guarantees similar to 
those provided by the United States which has several federal 
assistance programs.  Financial assistance is provided in the 
U.S. through the federal ship financing program, capital 
construction fund program and the maritime security act.  Loan 
guarantees force the taxpayer to take on a financial liability 
that banks and venture capitalists consider to be too risky. This 
is an unacceptable burden placed on taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shipbuilding Association of Canada argues that there has not 
been a single default under the U.S. federal assistance program. 
This begs the question:  If default rates are this low, why does 
the government need to provide incentives for banks and venture 
capitalists to provide capital for shipbuilding projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is real competition in the financial service 
sector so that banks are compelled to compete for medium and high 
risk loans.  Lack of competition in the Canadian financial 
services banking sector has made banks complacent about funding 
any medium to high risk ventures.  Furthermore, broad based tax 
relief would leave more money in the pockets of Canadian 
consumers and entrepreneurs.  This would lead to greater savings 
and higher corporate profits which can then be reinvested into 
the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the members of the Progressive Conservative Party not 
care enough about tax relief, particularly tax relief for 
Atlantic Canadians, to make it part of their shipbuilding plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of access to international markets for Canadian 
shipbuilders, the Reform Party supports the pursuit of equitable 
trade liberalization policies as an essential part of our 
industrial policy.  In this instance, we are very concerned with 
what appears to be unfair trade practices with the United States 
with respect to the 1920 Merchant Marine Act currently exempt 
from NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly known as the Jones Act, 
legislates that cargo carried between U.S. ports must be carried 
aboard ships that are U.S. built, U.S. registered, U.S. owned, 
U.S. crewed and repaired and serviced exclusively in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation was exempt from NAFTA and without amendment it 
effectively prevents Canadian shipbuilders from building a ship 
that could be used in the United States' domestic trades while 
allowing U.S. shipyards the right to sell to the Canadian market 
new or used ships and barges duty free.  The legislation 
effectively excludes Canadians from participating in a $1.1 
billion shipping transportation market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be completely forthright in this debate, I believe 
the members of the House must also recognize the provisions in 
place currently protecting the Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Canada's Coastal Trading Act, the owner of a ship built or 
purchased abroad must pay a 25% tariff to have it flagged 
Canadian and operate in Canadian domestic trade.  Also, the 
Canadian government policy dictates that government fleets must 
be renewed and repaired in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we must recognize these trade barriers, it is clear that 
they do not cause the same material damages to the U.S. 
shipbuilders as the Jones Act does to the Canadian manufacturers. 
Canadians must appreciate, however, that trade liberalization 
efforts will bring these protectionist government policies under 
closer scrutiny.  We cannot call for freer trade and then also 
call for protectionist policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer this point to my colleagues as a word of caution. Canada 
has many barriers to trade and the Liberal government looks like 
it will continue to violate the spirit of global trade 
liberalization.  We must be aware of this before we tackle trade 
disputes like the one I have just addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks by saying that the Tory motion 
succeeds in that it brings attention to the need to address the 
lack of Liberal vision for the shipbuilding industry.  Sadly, it 
makes no specific policy recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the plus side, there is nothing in the motion that is 
outwardly objectionable to Canadian taxpayers because there is 
nothing in the motion at all.  Although it fails to address the 
primary cause of our deteriorating shipbuilding industry, which 
is high taxes and unfair trade practices, the motion before the 
House has the qualified support of the Reform caucus. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the last presentation 
by the member opposite.  I am glad that he brought up the area of 
the Jones Act, an early 1920's act.  I know that he is a small 
businessman and has experience negotiating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do away with the Jones Act, there was an opportunity 
during the trade negotiations, including NAFTA, to hit that 
straight on.  By Canada giving up cards and not getting the Jones 
Act straightened out, it leaves us no choice but to go into the 
OECD and WTO negotiations with an item that needs to be discussed 
and moved forward.  The Jones Act should really have been tackled 
by the previous government when it had the Canadian cards to be 
able to discuss that item.  I would be interested in the hon. 
member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member 
for his comments and his brief question. I know that within the 
industry committee the hon. parliamentary secretary is always 
open to discussing various issues.  Shipbuilding has been one 
that has come up on the table which we have been looking at and 
planning to deal with in the future.  Hopefully, we will be able 
to address some of the issues in the Jones Act that were left out 
during past trade discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of blaming past governments or looking at past records, 
especially when it comes to shipbuilding, we should be looking at 
ways to make shipbuilding more competitive and become an industry 
that can survive on its own.  We should start moving away from 
areas of subsidies, such as the technology partnerships Canada 
program.  Right now the World Trade Organization is ruling that a 
lot of subsidies are illegal.  We must look at ways to get the 
shipbuilding industry moving through tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the issue of tax credits, we basically have some 
of the highest tax credits in the country for the shipbuilding 
industry when we look at our R and D and tax breaks.  However, we 
still have the lowest spending per capita when it comes to the 
shipbuilding industry, specifically in the overall basic R and D 
spending and investment in those areas, even though we spend a 
fair amount in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to address those key problems.  I think trade 
liberalization is the key, but we must also balance that with tax 
policies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member says that our motion does not include any recommendations 
to correct the situation.  If he had listened to my presentation 
he would know that we brought forth the recommendations that we 
are asking the minister to look at.  These recommendations come 
from the shipbuilding industry, not from us.  The people building 
the ships are the ones who know what has to be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have a problem with the exclusion of new 
construction ships built in Canadian shipyards from the present 
Revenue Canada leasing regulations, when one looks at the fact 
that Revenue Canada excluded Canadian-built ships from the 
leasing rules but allowed those rules to apply to office 
furniture, computers, rail cars, autos, vans, trucks, everything 
but ships?  The workers are telling us that if they could have 
this it would give them an opportunity to compete around the 
world and would put 24,000 people back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the issue of the 
recommendations, I know the official opposition would have been 
happy to see within the motion some of these recommendations 
coming from the industry so we could see exactly where the Tories 
wanted to go with the motion.  That is really all we were asking 
for.  We know the spirit of the motion is a positive one and that 
is why we are supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue raised by the hon. member, the official opposition 
has always been committed to creating fairer tax incentives for 
everyone.  We obviously want a simple tax system that would be 
more competitive and equitable to all industries in being able to 
write off certain parts of their industries that deteriorate in 
value and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I know the hon. member is concerned about that 
specifically with the shipbuilding industry, we in the official 
opposition have said that is something we would look at right 
across the board.  Although shipbuilding is one of the more 
important industries in the area the hon. member comes from, we 
know there are various industries across the country where 
inequalities within the tax system cause them to be less 
competitive.  That is what we would like to address across the 
board.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government to develop a new 
national shipbuilding policy to support the revitalization of 
the Canadian shipbuilding industry by maintaining and advancing 
the degree of excellence and the technologies for which Canada 
is historically renowned, given that Canada has the longest 
coastline of any nation in the world and that historically 
Canadians are among the finest shipbuilders in the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment was introduced to add the word “immediately”. And a 
good thing. Back in 1993, after the general election, when the 
Liberal Party was fresh from the opposition, I remember hearing 
the Prime Minister's current executive assistant say on TV that 
we absolutely needed a national shipbuilding policy, and that 
sometime in the coming year, that was in 1994, a summit on the 
future of shipbuilding in Canada should be held because the 
situation was urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally a summit would involve representatives from the 
shipbuilding industry. In terms of numbers, shipyards, small and 
big ones, account for 4,000 jobs. At one point, however, the 
industry employed up to 12,000 workers. A summit would also 
involve people for the shipping industry as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who makes up the shipping industry? Shipowners, of course, and 
sailors. People who tow boats in harbours, and shipping 
companies. Even today, they represent 40,000 workers. This is no 
small industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what my colleague from the Reform Party just said, 
the shipbuilding industry is not exclusively located by the 
Atlantic ocean or on the St. Lawrence, in Quebec City. There is 
the Pacific Ocean out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we consider how interrelated the entire industry is, goods 
are also shipped by ship, as far as Thunder Bay.  The western 
grain producers ship from Thunder Bay to other countries, in 
Europe and elsewhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “national” is not superfluous in this case, as the 
national interest is at stake.  It is a national transportation 
mode, like rail, road and, of course, air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But which one of all these industries costs the least per tonne? 
The maritime shipping industry.  Which is the most economical, 
the most environmentally sound, the most accident-free, and the 
one in the past that was most respectful of the environment 
because of the gross tonnage of each vessel?  The maritime 
shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I told the hon. member for Saint John, and as the motion 
states, we have the world's longest coastline. 
We also have the St. Lawrence Seaway, which goes as far as the 
tip of Lake Superior, and constitutes the longest navigable 
waterway in the world.  This should be a considerable plus for 
Canada.  Navigable waterways may be one of the greatest natural 
resources we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the St. Lawrence is far more than that.  It is 
the backbone of Canada's economic development.  What does it do? 
It carries freight right across Canada from the port of Halifax 
to the markets of the U.S.  From the Great Lakes, freight 
travels down the Mississippi and the Missouri to other water 
routes in the heartland of the major world market the United 
States represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations again to the Progressive Conservative Party 
for choosing shipbuilding as the topic today. 
That enables us to show that this is a truly national issue, 
more than just local interests or a fight against seasonal 
unemployment.  It is strategic and vital economic development. 
Often in government, here in Ottawa, officials and politicians 
live in—I was going to say their shell—their own world and often 
forget the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that it is a traditional industry, outdated, a lame 
duck.  But when people know about it as I do or as does the 
member for Saint John or the parliamentary secretary, they know 
it is not the case.  The parliamentary secretary knows too that 
in shipbuilding, they are as technologically advanced as in the 
aerospace industry.  A ship has as many computers as a plane, 
even more.  Navigation is by satellite, in the same way. 
The qualifications required for jobs are the same too.  It is 
not an outdated field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take two minutes to talk about the situation 
worldwide.  What is happening in the world?  There are Asian 
shipyards, where ships are subsidized as much as 30%.  This is 
wrong.  European shipyards get a 9% subsidy, and the small ones, 
16%.  We must speak out against this.  Canada is complaining 
about it through the OECD, but as the United States opposes this 
policy, what do the European countries do while the OECD tries 
to convince the Americans to support this policy?  They 
subsidize their shipyards.  We are not saying that, no one here 
is saying that.  Here we talk about tax measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what are the Americans doing?  There is the Jones act, and 
also title XI, which is a program for shipyards specifically. 
Finally, I drew on this for the financing program, which is 
exactly 87.5%.  That is exactly what the Americans do.  There is 
nothing scandalous about this.  This is what they do.  When it 
comes to refundable tax credits, this is what Quebec does.  I 
weigh my words carefully when I say refundable.  These are not 
subsidies.  The parliamentary secretary has studied the leasing 
measures in depth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is obviously a little shaken by our arguments or the pressure 
exerted by us or by the union front all across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are doing something worse that is detrimental to 
us. They do not allow Canadian shipbuilders to enjoy the same 
benefit as their American counterparts, who are not charged 
anything. The fact that shipbuilding was excluded from the free 
trade agreement is a national tragedy. Not many members knew 
about this, but it is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If shipbuilding had been included in the free trade agreement, 
and considering the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, the 
contracts signed by Canadian shipyards would be incredibly 
lucrative. But this cannot be changed through legislation. 
Negotiations are required to make changes to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would need a summit, as the Liberals had planned in 1993. 
However, six years later, in 1999, they seem to have forgotten 
all about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A coalition of unions was organized across the country. A large 
number of Canadians signed postal cards, which the Prime 
Minister will soon receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no longer just the Bloc Quebecois member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière whining alone in his corner, but all 
the opposition members, with the exception of the parliamentary 
secretary, because there are only Liberals in Ontario. But where 
there is a shipyard, the riding is represented by a member of 
the opposition. Given their small majority in the House—only five 
members more than all the opposition parties put together—they 
should do something about this issue, because the two-year 
deadline is drawing near.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pay tribute to my hon. colleague. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer he worked hard on this bill. He will table a private 
member's bill this week or next week. This legislation will 
require the support of the members from all the provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to compliment his efforts and ask him about one 
particular initiative.  The free trade act has been very solid 
for this country in terms of augmenting our trade. That is beyond 
dispute.  However, given that the Jones act was exempt, even 
though we got a pretty good deal for the country in general, 
would it not be a decent idea for us to say to the Americans that 
we should develop some kind of bilateral accord for developing 
certain types of ships so we could get some market penetration? I 
would recommend perhaps shipshape drilling hauls where they are 
having a capacity problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should begin an initiative sector by sector by going after 
certain types of ships as a starting point.  Would he agree that 
is a good initiative in beginning to break down the trade 
barriers? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to 
clear something up.  I presented Bill C-493—it already has a 
number—on April 15.  I have been seeking members' support ever 
since.  This week, I am already close to the 100 signatures I 
need to have the bill introduced for debate more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the idea of a court, that would be consistent with what I 
said earlier about a summit, or negotiations with the United 
States.  It is one suggestion that could be made as part of the 
negotiations to have Canadian shipbuilding included in the free 
trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that, at the time, it was the United 
States that wanted shipbuilding excluded.  The Progressive 
Conservative government of the day could not persuade them 
otherwise. They have two associations, one representing the 
seven or eight largest shipyards, and the other representing the 
others, and one of the two associations would not budge. 
At the time, the Republicans controlled the Senate and Congress 
and the idea was therefore defeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by thanking the member for Fundy—Royal, the 
member for Saint John, and the New Democratic Party members for 
their excellent co-operation and their devoted efforts on this 
issue.  Reform Party members were initially hesitant about a 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we all put the national interest first, perhaps the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry will at last 
be able to convince his colleagues to adopt a truly national 
shipbuilding policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate my colleague from 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for his most interesting speech on 
shipbuilding in Canada, and in Quebec in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed that, since it boasts one of the world's 
finest rivers, Canada could have a shipbuilding industry.  It is 
a leading edge industry.  Maritime engineers have told me that 
we in Canada possess certain advantages for the development of a 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague whether he has projected 
figures for job creation and wealth that would be generated by 
the development of a shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer very briefly, since 
I do not have a lot of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MPs who joined together to discuss this matter say that we 
would have to get back to the 10,000 to 12,000 job level we had 
in the past.  At the present time, we are operating at only 40% 
of capacity.  These are well-paid jobs, but no more so than in 
other countries.  We are competitive.  Even in constant U.S. 
dollar levels, wages here are no higher than elsewhere, with the 
exception of Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing is the economic fallout of those jobs. 
In the export sector for instance, the number of jobs that would 
be created in Canada would be fourfold. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this motion.  It 
is a very important motion so I am going to read it again. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government to develop a new national 
shipbuilding policy to support the revitalization of the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry by maintaining and advancing the degree of 
excellence and the technologies for which Canada is historically 
renowned, given that Canada has the longest coastline of any 
nation in the world and that historically Canadians are among the 
finest shipbuilders in the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has been very well crafted and it says a lot.  It is 
important that all of us give serious consideration to it this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly there is a need for a national shipbuilding policy. 
I say that in all sincerity.  Many times I have questioned the 
government with respect to a shipbuilding policy and I have often 
got back the reply that we do not need a policy, that we already 
have a policy. Yet, this policy seems to be long forthcoming.  I 
requested a copy of the policy quite some time ago through the 
standing committee.  I was told that it would be made available 
but I have yet to see anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government has is not a shipbuilding policy per se but 
a mishmash of little initiatives here and there which it can 
remotely tie into the concept of shipbuilding and it calls this a 
policy.  What we are looking for when we talk about a national 
shipbuilding policy is something that is very clear and concise, 
that sets a sense of direction and gives hope and optimism to the 
people who work in the shipbuilding field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ships have been sailing between Canadian ports for many years. 
We believe firmly that they should be built in Canada, crewed in 
Canada and serviced and repaired in Canada. 
We know that the U.S. has the Jones act which ensures this for 
its industry, but we in Canada for some reason seem to want to go 
in a different direction.  We do not want to ensure a sound 
industry for our citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 31, 1996 there were 2,589 ships on order around the 
world.  Yet shipbuilders on both coasts of Canada sit idle.  One 
has to ask oneself why this is so.  When there are so many ships 
being built around the world, why is it that in Canada, which has 
been historically known for its shipbuilding and technology in 
that regard, the shipyards are idle? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. provides generous long term loan guarantees for buyers. 
There are many other initiatives it takes to ensure the industry 
survives in that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 29, 1990 the right hon. Prime Minister, while he was 
in opposition, wrote a letter to the marine workers federation in 
which he said “It is safe to say that most people recognize that 
something has to be done to create a much more competitive 
shipbuilding industry.  The government should now, as they should 
have done long ago and indeed as they promised to do, take steps 
to alleviate the problem”. The Prime Minister wrote that when he 
was in opposition. We heard quite a different story today from 
the government side in terms of what has to be done and the 
importance of doing something now to maintain this industry and 
to help it survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment in this industry has plummeted from 12,000 workers in 
1990 to fewer than 5,000 in 1996.  I would venture that today it 
has probably gone even lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it in this day and age when there is so much unemployment 
we cannot do something positive to aid people to find the 
necessary work to feed their families and look after themselves? 
Coastal communities are facing economic stagnation and chronic 
unemployment.  We see it in the fisheries industry. Now the same 
thing is happening in the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at ways of making sure the shipbuilding industry 
survives and picks up.  We can bring in tough environmental 
standards, such as calling for double hulls.  That would create 
employment and work within this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note that the Liberal red book in 1993 called for provisional 
funds for the shipbuilding industry.  Today we do not see 
anything happening in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers in August 1997 unanimously passed a resolution 
aimed at helping the Canadian shipbuilding industry become more 
competitive on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more recently we had a meeting here on the hill with the 
shipbuilding industry, the workers, management, the associations 
and so forth.  All the parties except the government joined with 
these people to look seriously at what could be done to help this 
ailing industry, what could be done to put men and women back to 
work, and what could be done to ensure that our children had a 
secure future in the Atlantic provinces and on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves, what is the problem?  Perhaps part of 
the problem is that the majority of the members on the government 
side come from a province where they do not appreciate the 
importance of our marine industry, where perhaps they do not 
appreciate the importance of shipbuilding to the Atlantic and 
Pacific areas.  This may be part of the problem.  We know 
certainly that where there is a will and an understanding, there 
is a way to resolve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the equipment and the skilled workers. This is the 
important point.  We have a battery of workers who are skilled, 
willing and able and wanting to work.  Nowadays people are 
criticized far too often for being on the welfare rolls as people 
who do not want to work, who have no industry, no ambition or 
whatever.  This is not the case with the shipbuilding workers. 
They have indicated over and over again that they want to work. 
They want to be productive members of society. They want to put 
into reality their experience, technology and skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the equipment and we have the workers, but do we have a 
government with the will to stand up for Canada's shipbuilding 
industry?  No.  If we did have such a government, we would see 
this industry moving forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national policy should include such things as loan guarantees, 
fixed and comparable interest rates, long term amortization, and 
regulations to ensure that ships that are delivered to or from 
Canadian ports are subject to Canadian rules on health, safety 
and environmental standards.  This is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding personnel and the people involved in the 
industry whom we met with made it very clear that they are not 
looking for any handouts.  They do not want handouts.  They want 
to contribute their skills in a meaningful way to help this 
country move forward. Those individuals are sincere when they say 
that.  We know these individuals and we know them to be 
honourable people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason it appears the government has a distrust of the 
shipbuilding industry and the people involved in it.  The 
Liberals are constantly saying that they cannot subsidize the 
industry, that they do not want to do this or that.  I assure 
everyone this is not what these people are asking for.  All they 
are asking for is a fair chance, a fair opportunity to put 
forward a program that they know, based on their experience, will 
work and help make Canada a more productive society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the workers but unfortunately we do not have a 
government with the will to help them.  Many countries have 
shipbuilding and industrial strategies and policies.  For 
example, the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Korea 
and China all have their specific shipbuilding industry policies. 
Is Canada so backward that we cannot match these countries and 
come forward with a strong policy of our own to ensure work for 
our citizens?  I would say we are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some leadership to be shown by the government to give 
this matter its due consideration.  The government should work 
together with the industry, work with all those who are 
interested in supporting the industry and make sure we move 
ahead.  We know that where there is a will, there will be a way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was 
brought to my attention that the present Minister of Finance said 
“I fought to have my ships built in Canada but was unable to 
convince the government of the need for an aggressive 
shipbuilding policy and if we are not going to do that, we cannot 
be a factor in commercial shipping”. The present Minister of 
Finance stated that he had his ships built in Brazil because 
Canada does not have a national shipbuilding policy whereby we 
can be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Prime Minister when in opposition said that we have 
to have a new national shipbuilding policy, that we have to keep 
that resource going.  The present Minister of Industry when he 
was a critic kept saying that he was for a national shipbuilding 
policy.  Now he says it is not part of his agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member on his presentation and I thank 
him for it.  Does he see any support whatsoever from the present 
government sitting in the House of Commons today for a national 
shipbuilding policy to put our people back to work, to give them 
their dignity and to make us competitive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I have to 
answer the question in the negative. I do not see any hope with 
the present government that we will move ahead on this issue 
unless there is a drastic change in events and a drastic change 
in the government's opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member has rightly indicated, statements have been made 
in the past.  When people were in opposition they said one thing 
but then suddenly they took a different approach when they became 
the government. Time and time again I have said it is very 
important that if we as politicians are going to have any 
credibility with the people who elect us, we must not be 
hypocritical.  We must not say one thing and do another. We must 
not make promises while we are in opposition and do something 
different when we are in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to look strongly at its past statements and 
live up to those statements and move this issue forward in a 
positive way.

I thank the member for Halifax West for his remarks.  I 
understand his concerns about shipbuilding, because, in his 
region, a lot of people work there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not share his pessimism over the impossibility of 
influencing the government to change its policy and its current 
attitude.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see positive signs at the moment.  By way of example, the 
four opposition parties seem to support the motion by the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three main unions representing shipbuilders in 
Canada are in agreement.  They even agree with their employers 
at the shipbuilders' association.  Shipowners agree.  All the 
provincial premiers agree.  The Liberal Premier of New 
Brunswick, who will be calling elections soon, agrees.  At their 
latest convention, the members of the Liberal Party managed to 
vote a resolution in favour of having a policy on shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must watch my words, but the Minister of Finance's situation 
is rather unique, and he does not dare go too far ahead, being 
himself involved in the sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not share my colleague's pessimism and I would 
like him to react to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that important things are happening, but it is thanks to 
the opposition, not the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly that we should be optimistic and we should 
look forward to something happening on a positive basis.  The 
hon. member before asked me whether I felt there was any hope the 
government would address this problem adequately.  I have to be 
quite honest.  While we in the opposition would like to see some 
changes and see something positive take place, I have seen very 
little encouragement come from the government side that it is 
going to move in a very real way to make the shipbuilding 
industry a viable industry for the people in Atlantic Canada and 
on the west coast.

extremely well represented in the maritimes. These people help 
us raise our awareness of this major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing new in this morning's motion. Remember last 
election campaign. In 1993, and that is not yesterday, the 
current government had promised it would abolish free trade. We 
knew this was a hare-brained promise, but to win votes one tends 
to go overboard sometimes. So the current government had 
promised to roll back the free trade agreement. How ridiculous. 
As we know, our exports have increased from $90 to $250 billion 
thanks to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is now in a sound financial position, it is 
partly because of the free trade agreement negotiated by the 
former Prime Minister of Canada, but also by our current leader, 
Joe Clark. Incidentally, the Liberals had promised to tear up 
the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to fight this kind of talk during an election 
campaign. I remember the debate on free trade. Everyone was 
opposed to free trade for reasons that were partly based on 
demagoguery, and in the 1993 election campaign, the Liberals 
promised to abolish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another broken promise was to scrap the GST. We knew that it did 
not make any sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During an election campaign, when demagoguery prevails, it is 
very difficult for rationality to take over. In the end, the 
Liberals were elected. There was however a few measures 
contained in the red book with which I agreed. I think our 
government colleagues will be pleased to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their red book, the Liberals made an interesting commitment 
regarding shipyards. I would have liked them to live up to their 
commitment, but they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals did not make good on many of their commitments. 
Obviously, with free trade, the GST generating $22 billion in 
revenue, $31 billion in additional revenue from the surtax, and 
$25 billion taken out of the employment insurance fund, it is 
easy to fight the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we in the Progressive Conservative Party raise issues like 
shipyards, the government always gives us the same line “You 
left us with a deficit of $42 billion”. The problem is that the 
Liberals had left us with a debt of $200 billion. Before we came 
to office, the debt had increased elevenfold, from $18 billion 
to $200 billion, in ten years. Under the Progressive 
Conservative government, the debt increased twofold, from $200 
billion to $400 billion, over a nine year period. During that 
time, we adopted progressive measures such as the GST, the free 
trade agreement and the tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the topic of shipyards, the members for Saint John, Burin—St. 
George's, and Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière as well, gave some 
quite excellent speeches. Attacks on the Progressive 
Conservatives are always the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative government was not responsible for 
rationalizing shipyards.  Shipyards were rationalized by the 
industry itself, but I am pleased to mention some measures for 
which the Progressive Conservatives can take credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the importance of the sector, we created a maritime 
transport co-operation group.  We invested $450 million annually 
in the maritime, land and air transportation sectors, including 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invested $60 million to improve the port of Vancouver. 
It has become a world renowned shipping centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that I would be splitting my 
time with the member for Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Patrol Frigate Program is an extremely important 
program.  Through it, Canada has built up an international 
reputation in the design, integration, testing, construction, 
development and management of large-scale projects.  The 
expertise we have built up, thanks to the initiatives of the 
Progressive Conservative government, make it possible today for 
us to be increasingly effective.  We are calling on the 
government in power to allow our shipyards to compete on other 
international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible for us to compete with European shipyards right 
now, because they have support measures of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 
even 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot compete on the American market.  It is a very captive 
market, with controlled zones.  There is a complete ban on 
potential outside markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are even certain that the majority of government 
members will vote in favour of the motion. 
This was one of their most important election promises in 1993. 
I am sure there are not many colleagues on the government side 
who have forgotten the proposal to develop a national 
shipbuilding policy which would allow Canada to compete with the 
Europeans, the Americans and the Asia-Pacific countries to take 
advantage of the technological expertise that we have developed 
in our shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House of the work done by all political parties, 
with the exception of this government, and namely by my 
colleague from St. John, the members of 
Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, Burin—St. George's and all the 
others who have met with people from this industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government cannot be listening to recommendations that came 
out of all those meetings held just before the holiday season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we want to use this day—not by dealing with 
farfetched issues that are out of touch with reality—for the 
benefit of the thousands of workers who are forced to fight and 
compete with other shipyards across the world, which benefit 
from tax privileges granted by their respective governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we would like the government to support the motion 
and act on its 1993 campaign promise to give Canada a tax policy 
that would allow all our shipyards to be competitive on the 
world scene. Furthermore, considering the technological 
expertise that we developed and the high value our shipyard 
workers can add to their finished products, we want the 
government to support the initiative proposed in the motion 
before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important for the Bloc Quebecois, for the Reform 
Party and for the NDP. There are today tens of thousands of 
vessels for sale in the world that need repairs and we do not 
want our local shipyards to be penalized compared to shipyards 
in other countries where the governments take their 
responsibilities. 
In 1993, the Liberal Party promised all Canadians that Canada 
would have a tax policy that would allow its shipyards to be on 
a level playing field with shipyards all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted, in supporting the motion, to remind my 
colleagues across the way that we read their red book very 
carefully. One of the few rational promises contained in that 
book was to give Canada a shipyard policy that would compare to 
what exists around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew that the red book promises did not make sense: abolish 
the GST, abolish free trade and change the helicopter package 
that had already cost Canadians $600 million. We ask the 
government to be reasonable and to adopt today's motion. 
We do not want a dramatic change in the way the government 
manages the country. All we want, is for it to support our 
efforts to give Canada an exciting new policy for the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not know if the fact that the Liberals are not questioning 
the party that brought forward this motion in favour of a 
shipbuilding policy this morning is a sign of openness on their 
part. I hope it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to react to a remark made by my colleague from 
Chicoutimi, to tell him that I do not always agree with him. 
Sometimes, in the political arena, it is normal to be in 
opposition, to have democratic debates, and so on. On the issue 
of commitments, a Liberal member opposite said they were made in 
1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a candidate in 1993 and I recall very clearly watching on 
television the Liberal candidate for Quebec City, who is now the 
Prime Minister's chief of staff, when he said “We will adopt a 
shipbuilding policy, hold a summit in the following year, and 
put in place concrete measures to revitalize the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry”. That is all I wanted to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Chicoutimi has had experience in the previous 
government. 
Does he think it would be possible, if the government really 
wanted to do it, to renegotiate the free trade agreement to 
include shipbuilding? Canada has been in favour of its inclusion 
since the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that, with all that is being done in the 
WTO and the OECD, the United States might be open to the idea of 
including shipbuilding in the free trade agreement? If so, does 
he think it would be a good thing, considering the weakness of 
the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar, and does he 
agree with me that Canadians shipyards could benefit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière for his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this is certainly an item that ought to be on the agenda 
of multilateral negotiations, unless all countries negotiating 
merely decide to say “We will continue, each in our own areas, 
to fully support the industrial sector shipbuilding represents”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot ask that of our local yards.  We will try not to be 
too partisan in this matter.  At the present time, our 
shipyards' inability to compete costs thousands of direct and 
indirect jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is bidding, how can we compete with others, such as 
the Asia-Pacific region, when their subsidies may account for 
more than 30% of the value of a project? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Europe too, they can be as high as 16% of the value of a 
project. 
When there is a 15% to 30% difference right off the bat, it is 
impossible to compete.  That is why all parties, including the 
government party, ought to show some open-mindedness.  We would 
be in favour of broader discussions with all stakeholders in 
this industry.  The government and the four opposition parties 
must arrive at a consistent policy, one which would enable us to 
take proper advantage of the expertise we have developed for 
meeting needs anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that this could result in a tremendous 
boost.  Many jobs could be created in this industry. We are not 
asking for any special privileges.  We want our shipyards to be 
treated on an equal footing with other shipbuilding industries 
internationally. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to discuss a very important issue which 
is critical from an economic development perspective for the 
region of Atlantic Canada and, I would argue, for Canada.  We are 
talking this afternoon about the issue of the survival and the 
overall competitiveness of a very fundamental industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Reform Party said earlier that he was 
unsure about why we did not table any specific initiatives in the 
question we put forth.  I will share with him some of the 
rationale for why we chose that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording in the question we chose today is the same policy 
initiative that was accepted and agreed upon by the Liberal Party 
of Canada at its policy conferences in 1988 and 1993.  I would 
wager that many members who are sitting in the House today and 
will be sitting in the House come vote time actually voted for 
the very same initiative when they were before their own 
membership.  I could not figure out why in any shape, way or form 
these members would vote against the same initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  There is no reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  There is absolutely no reason, as the 
member for West Nova has just pointed out to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting forth some initiatives, some financial 
initiatives, some tax incentives, to provide the industry with a 
more level playing field. There has been a lot of discussion that 
we cannot compete with the subsidies that exist in the Koreas and 
the Chinas.  My comment is so what.  We do not care.  There are 
other markets we can chase down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competing with some countries that have subsidies of up to 20% 
or 30% of the cost of a ship is not a market we are interested in 
anyway.  Those markets have ships with high steel content and low 
amounts of mechanical outfitting.  That actually means they do 
not have sophisticated, high tech, cutting edge navigational 
equipment.  They do not have systems in terms of the high tech 
industries such as shipshape drilling hauls which would be used 
in offshore exploration or drilling in that regard.  Those are 
the kinds of ships we can be competitive with.  Our labour is 
competitive in that regard.  The only thing that is not 
competitive is our tax regime, plain and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe fundamentally that the role of government is to do two 
principal things when it comes to industry.  The first is to 
provide it with sound viable access to markets.  That means 
physically in terms of rails and roads and trade regimes as well. 
This is something I would like to discuss in the next few 
minutes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the government has to provide is an 
internationally competitive tax regime.  The initiatives that 
have been put forth have been agreed upon by an unprecedented 
number of individuals in our society.  The shipowners association 
is on side.  The shipbuilders association is on side.  Labour is 
on side.  In fact, in 1997 at St. Andrews, New Brunswick all 10 
premiers voted for the development of a national shipbuilding 
policy with fundamental principles that the federal government 
must and should pursue.  To date I am very sad to say that action 
taken by the federal government essentially amounts to nil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No pursuit.  Zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  There is no pursuit.  We have heard 
comments as to why the Jones act was exempt from the free trade 
agreement in 1988 and 1993.  That is the kind of rhetoric that 
has been put forward.  Everybody in the House understands that 
the free trade agreement is the fundamental cornerstone of our 
economy today in terms of augmenting our trade with the 
Americans.  We have over $200 billion worth of trade with the 
Americans.  Previously it was only $80 billion.  However, we were 
not able to get this one particular industry into the trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in power for over six years.  It has not 
once taken the opportunity to look at improving this.  Rather, it 
has put the blame on the previous government.  Not once has the 
government said that it would be a very good initiative to set up 
a trade component sector by sector.  The parliamentary secretary 
mentioned that it is imperative that we take a sector by sector 
approach.  Why do we not set up a trade component, go to the 
Americans and negotiate a bilateral accord on certain types of 
ships?  Maybe they would be drilling rigs.  Maybe they would be 
ocean going tugs.  We have not taken an initiative to penetrate 
the Jones act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline very briefly what we are considering because my 
colleagues have done a fabulous job in terms of the initiatives 
put forward by my friend and colleague from the neighbouring 
riding of Saint John, the member for Chicoutimi and the member 
from Lévis.  There are a number of members who really believe 
this is something we need to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to develop a loan guarantee program similar to the 
American title XI, which has been in effect since 1936.  Do 
members know how many loan defaults there have been since 1936? 
Since 1936, under this very prudent criteria, with the federal 
government guaranteeing the loans, there have been zero loan 
defaults.  Absolutely none.  Why are they scared to look at 
something that works and implement it in our country?  I know 
there are people listening to this at home and in the House who 
cannot fathom why that initiative has not been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Reform agrees with me that this country is 
overtaxed.  Why do we want to tax an industry so that it has no 
chance of competing?  What we are advocating is to revise the 
Revenue Canada leasing regulations concurrently with accelerated 
depreciation.  That would lower taxes.  We do it for rail cars, 
computers, trucks and other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues again:  Why would they not want to take that 
initiative if it is done for other industries?  What do they have 
against this cutting-edge, high tech, modern industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should revise Revenue Canada leasing regulations to make 
them similar to the title XI loan guarantee program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the government a bit of credit in this regard.  It 
has taken some steps with respect to the Export Development 
Corporation.  However, I would argue that it should look at doing 
that for the domestic market as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about the need to have a bilateral accord in terms 
of the Jones act.  This comes down to three fundamental 
principles.  First, we have to be able to establish a 
marketplace. 
The marketplace is threefold domestically.  The ships which exist 
on the Great Lakes today are aging and will be need to be 
replaced or refitted.  We need to ensure that we have a 
competitive indigenous industry to take advantage of those 
opportunities.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second market would be to go after a bilateral accord with 
Americans, which I just pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we could compete with the EU if we provided the 
appropriate tax regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point, which I cannot fathom, comes downs to political 
leadership.  This is not a debate about what needs to be done; 
this is purely a debate about who is going to get the job done. 
The Minister of Industry should be an advocate for this industry. 
If he does not want to be the quarterback, then I suggest he 
step aside and let someone take over who actually cares about the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am suggesting that the Minister of Industry step aside and let 
the Prime Minister be the quarterback of this initiative so that 
he can bring the Minister for International Trade, the Minister 
of National Revenue and the Minister of Finance on side to get 
the individuals in this industry working by opening markets, 
lowering taxes and re-establishing the industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
last speaker, who referred continuously to the example of rail 
cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member opposite is suggesting that the same 
arrangement for leasing rail cars be brought in for ships and 
that the accelerated rate for shipbuilding be reduced from 33.3% 
to 10%.  Is that what he is suggesting so that leasing could be 
applied? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. parliamentary 
secretary and I worked collaboratively and had very co-operative 
debates on this issue back in October 1997.  I will admit that he 
has a sincere interest in terms of advancing this file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for the commitment of the government as a 
whole to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not even going to argue what particular initiatives have 
to be taken.  We have put forth some very constructive 
suggestions and we are challenging the government to say “This 
is what we are capable of doing”, as opposed to “This is hands 
off.  What we have now in terms of our national shipbuilding 
policy, in terms of tariffs, in terms accelerated depreciation is 
all we are going to do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as rail car initiatives are concerned, whatever is 
competitive for the rail car industry should be afforded to the 
shipbuilding industry as well.  However, it has to be done by 
revising Revenue Canada leasing regulations concurrently with 
accelerated depreciation.

that it engage and do something with the industry.  We have put 
forward four initiatives.  The government should show the people 
that it is sincere about addressing this issue.

Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to inform the House that 
Millbrook, a village located in the riding of 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, will be celebrating the 150th year 
of its agricultural fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agricultural fairs were first established to provide service and 
education to the second and succeeding waves of settlers.  It was 
where they acquired needed supplies, livestock, seeds and the 
knowledge of how to gainfully put them to use.  The Millbrook 
fair has taken this concept and used it to become one of the most 
successful agricultural fairs in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are special times for the community as we near the

Speaker, this is an e-mail I received today from a frustrated 
Canadian job creator: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As small business owners, my wife and I employed 15 people in 
various permanent, seasonal and part time roles in 1998.  Of 
those 15, it was known all along that 11 of them would be working 
for four months or less.  Several were students, had no other 
employment during the year and hence would never be eligible for 
employment insurance benefits.  Nevertheless, we deducted a total 
of $856.52 as EI premiums from these individuals, matched by 
$1,199.13 from our business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be no mystery that the reason the EI program is 
running a surplus is because recent changes have made it more 
difficult to qualify for benefits and because premiums are 
collected from people who will never be able to qualify.  This is 
unfair, unjust, a drain on the private sector and on the poorest 
households in our country.

is World Press Freedom Day.  Established in 1993, this day serves 
as an occasion to recognize the extraordinary sacrifices made in 
the struggle for free expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year's theme, violence against journalists, highlights a 
serious problem in many countries.  Last year, 27 journalists 
were murdered in the course of their duties, among them the 
former editor of the <I>Indo-Canadian Times</I>.  Journalists have 
faced arbitrary arrests, threats, aggression, harassment and even 
torture.  Currently, at least 117 journalists are behind bars in 
25 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, freedom of the press is a right guaranteed by section 
2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  We sometimes 
take this freedom for granted, but we must never forget its 
importance to our democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we call on governments everywhere to respect their 
commitments to press freedom, and especially those who still deny 
their citizens access to a fully free press.

journalists.

themselves had little understanding of the implications of the 
treaty and who were intolerant of legitimate concerns raised by 
the Liberal opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to put off consideration of the treaty in this

was not ready to face parliament with the details of what has

</I></B></P><P align=left>The limitation on access to the charter of rights and freedoms, 
the undermining of neighbouring treaty claims, the creation of a 
new unaccountable tier of government and the end of the public 
fishery are all issues which must be resolved before this treaty 
becomes part of our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty provides that there can be no amendment without the 
consent of the Nisga'a, a significant derogation of the 
sovereignty of Canada.

communication, which is understanding—understanding between 
world powers, generations, parents and children and employers

communicating, which first and foremost is the art of

I have to assume the Prime Minister does not do his own taxes. If

creep of the government and the increased CPP premiums.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Again

They are being taxed to death and they do not want to hear these

that is the least we can do and we will continue on that track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that when we took office we inherited a $42

<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

give Canadians tax relief after it spent billions and billions of

care and education funding.

expressed fears that this growth hormone may be linked to

thousands of young Canadians have left colleges, universities, 
technical schools and other institutions across the country 
looking for summer work.  A lot of them depend on the federally 
sponsored summer study work projects.  However, one problem is 
that the moneys have not been allocated.  Many of the programs 
are supposed to start today and many started last week, but no 
funds have been allocated, at least in the western part of 
Canada.

ask the Prime Minister once again:  If the shipbuilding policies 
that the government currently has in place are so good, why has 
the employment level in coastal communities where there are 
shipyards plummeted to barely one-third of what it was 
previously?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today the people of Taber, Alberta, are mourning and the 
people of Canada are mourning with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House, in homes and workplaces and in schools across 
Canada the terrible events of last week have been in the minds 
and hearts of millions of people: the loss of young Jason Lang, 
the injury of another young student, the violation of the 
sanctity of a school in a proud community, a place where young 
lives should be developed, given hope and promise, not snuffed 
out, not scared; a place to build dreams, not live nightmares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not a violent people and yet our lives are too often 
punctuated by such tragedies: the massacre at the École 
Polytechnique a decade ago and now the tragedy in Taber. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The loss of a young life is never easy to understand or accept. 
Such a senseless act can never truly be explained.  And the loss 
and emptiness it leaves behind can never be filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we can do is show our support and our solidarity and share 
the pain and the grieving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the family of Jason Lang, whose father over the past several 
days has shown us the meaning of true bravery and generosity, to 
all the families who have been touched by this tragedy, to the 
people of Taber, the whole of Canada is with you.  You are in 
our thoughts and our prayers.  Your loss is the loss of all of 
us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Taber 
tragedy cuts very close to my constituency and to me personally. 
I know a family whose daughter was just a few feet away from the 
shooting.  Her life has been changed permanently.  She is a girl 
who knew the disturbed boy who lashed out.  She felt the fear and 
she heard the shots.  She went to school that day expecting 
safety.  She left the school in tears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her statement to other kids her age is revealing: “Maybe we 
need to be nicer.  Then this might not have to happen”.  It is 
wonderful to see how this tight knit community has banded 
together without blame, recriminations or fault finding, and the 
family of Jason Lang forgiving, even as it grieves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From another friend who knew Jason well comes the following 
quote: “Jason was such a nice boy.  He believed in God and he 
showed it.  This was a young man who lived like a Christian”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Taber mourns, my friends who live there mourn.  As Taber 
mourns, I personally mourn.  As Taber mourns, every Canadian 
family mourns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
were deeply saddened and troubled last week by the news of the 
shooting in Taber, which left Jason Lang, a 17-year old student, 
dead and another student of the same age seriously injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know by now, this tragic incident at W. R. Myers High 
School was the work of a former student, barely 14 years old. 
This only adds to the tragedy and our bewilderment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always hard to understand the reasons for such actions. It 
is just as painful, if not impossible, to know how to interpret 
them. 
The easy way out, of course, is to say that violence breeds 
violence. Yet how can we explain that a small peaceful community 
in southern Alberta would have to go through such a tragedy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should avoid drawing easy parallels with what happened in 
Littleton, Colorado, a couple of weeks ago. Others go back 10 
years to the tragic events at École Polytechnique, in Montreal, 
although the social problems at the roots of that tragedy were 
quite different. Nonetheless, the pain of the grieving families 
in Alberta is just as real and deep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main lesson we must learn from such events is the need for 
soul-searching as individuals and as a community. We must analyse 
our collective and individual behaviour, and wonder what impact 
it has on society in general and young people in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore wonder about the roots of violence, about our 
ability to deal with the distress of many young people and about 
the role to which we confine them in our society. We must 
reflect on the despair that afflicts too many young people and 
on the inadequate answers provided by the governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we put the accent on rehabilitating young people or on 
imposing coercive measures that only alienate them more? The 
answer is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this day of the memorial service for Jason Lang, I want to 
offer to his family and friends, on behalf of all my colleagues 
from the Bloc Quebecois, our sincere condolences in this most 
difficult time. I also wish Shane Christmas a speedy and full 
recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our thoughts are with you and with all the families in Taber and 
Alberta.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party we join with all members in a 
profound expression of sympathy and grief to the community of 
Taber at its loss, a loss that is shared across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the family of Jason Lang, we can only begin to understand the 
horror and tragedy of the loss of a young and promising life.  To 
the family of Shane Christmas, we wish for hope and strength that 
this young man will come through both physically and emotionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions and we in the NDP like all Canadians 
want to find answers to prevent the senseless violence that 
occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we grieve surely we must also struggle to find the means to 
channel violence and social exclusion in our society into a 
strengthening of our communities so that young people are not 
marginalized and left feeling lost but are part of a genuine 
human family that fosters respect, understanding and dignity for 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Taber have bravely demonstrated to us all the 
strength of their community to cope, to understand and to begin 
to heal.  Their loss can never be forgotten. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, less than 
a week ago the nation was sent into a state of shock over hearing 
about the random shooting at the W. R. Myers High School in 
Taber.  Sadly we also received word that one of the young men, 
Jason Lang, had passed away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, a family, a community and a country are burying one of 
their own.  On this sad day I would like to call on all Canadians 
to look into their hearts and to say a prayer for the family that 
is suffering.  These families, especially the Lang family, will 
live every day with the pain of this event.  It will become an 
ache that they will learn to deal with but know will never 
subside.  Through their daily lives they will carry the spirit of 
Jason with them in all they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Jason's father Reverend Lang stated a few days ago “it is 
like a piece of your heart is gone and it will never come back”. 
The Bible states blessed are those with a pure heart because 
they will see God.  Today Reverend Lang stated that Jason has 
definitely seen God.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The country has seen the strength and courage of one family 
dealing with the utmost pain, and today we are witnesses to a 
wounded community healing itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the memorial service today Reverend Lang said “Jesus is 
weeping with this community today”.  Not only is he weeping. 
Jesus is asking us to look at our lives and see what is really 
important to us.  We must open our hearts to one another and we 
must learn to love.  We must not hate and we must not allow hate 
to take over our schools and make them a breeding ground for 
other such incidents to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prayers of the country are with the Lang family and the 
community of Taber, Alberta.  I ask my colleagues today to stand 
for a moment of silence and a wee prayer for all of them, the 
families of Taber and the families of Colorado.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 202—<B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs explain why Canada, which 
has been a member of the Organization of American States since 
1990, has not yet ratified the American Convention on Human 
Rights? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  A 
key human rights instrument in the Organization of American 
States (OAS) system is the American Convention on Human Rights 
convention or ACHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Canada can ratify a human rights convention, we must 
ensure that we are in a position to live up to the commitments we 
would undertake by ratifying it.  Since 1991, consultations have 
been conducted with federal, provincial and territorial officials 
to assess compliance of federal and provincial legislation with 
the convention.  The review process has been complicated by the 
vague, imprecise and outdated language used in the convention. 
Many provisions in the Convention are ambiguous or contain 
concepts which are unknown or problematic in Canadian law.  More 
importantly, many provisions of the Convention are inconsistent 
with other international human rights norms, making it difficult 
for us to comply with both the ACHR and those norms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of example, the ACHR would preclude prior censorship, and 
therefore would conflict with Canada's international obligations 
to suppress hate propaganda and child pornography.  The ACHR 
would preclude the extradition of nationals, and therefore would 
conflict with Canada's extradition obligations and our 
obligations to co-operate with international criminal tribunals 
or the future international criminal court.  Serious concerns 
have been raised that the unusual wording of the ACHR provision 
on the right to life may create a conflict with charter rights. 
The ACHR contains a right of reply to innacurate or offensive 
statements in the media, which is not known in our law and may 
conflict with charter rights.  The ACHR guarantees equality 
before the law but does not contemplate affirmative action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ratify the ACHR at present, a very large number of 
reservations and statements of understanding, SOUs, would be 
required.  However, Canada's position with respect to 
reservations to human rights treaties is that reservations should 
be few in number and limited in scope.  We are concerned that 
ratifying the ACHR with a large number of reservations and SOUs 
would be contrary to this position and would undermine our 
efforts to dissuade other states from ratifying human rights 
treaties subject to sweeping reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until such time as the concerns with respect to reservations and 
SOUs expressed by both levels of government have been 
satisfactorily dealt with, Canada will not be in position to 
ratify the ACHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are already entitled to bring petitions to the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights alleging human rights 
violations.  Therefore, even without ratification of the ACHR, 
Canadians already benefit fully from the inter-American human 
rights system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 217—<B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which corporations, individuals, or consortiums have expressed 
an interest in purchasing the Prince Mine owned by the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and Minister 
responsable for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  On March 29, 
1999, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, DEVCO, advertised 
nationally its requirement for financial advisory services in 
respect to the sale of its assets.  The closing date for 
proposals was April 27, 1999.  It is expected that Devco will 
engage a financial advisor in early May.  At that time, the 
financial advisor will begin preparation of an information 
package for prospective purchasers.  Private sector interest in 
Devco's assets will only be known after the information package 
is available and bids have been received.

<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to begin by paying tribute to the hon. member for 
Saint John whose motion we are debating today.  She is 
undoubtedly very committed to supporting an industry which is of 
importance to her community.  I want to say to her that 
although I cannot accept her motion, I share her desire to see 
this industry, like others, flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge the work of my parliamentary 
secretary, the hon. member for St. Catharines, who has this 
industry in his riding in Ontario.  He has worked closely with 
me to gain an understanding of the challenges facing shipbuilding 
in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry which is a small but important 
component of Canada's overall marine industry has a long, rich 
tradition in this country, not only in the Atlantic provinces 
but also in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.  In 1997 the 
shipbuilding industry in Canada employed roughly 5,400 people and 
had total revenues around $625 million.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's current strength is in building high quality relatively 
small vessels such as ferries, icebreakers, tugboats, fishing 
vessels, excursion craft and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Activity on the east coast has recently centred on the 
construction of two container ships, two offshore vessels and 
tugs, the refit of one oil rig, the manufacture of oil rig 
components and various commercial repair work. The industry in 
Quebec has been involved in upgrading one oil rig, constructing 
tugs and doing ship overhauls and commercial repairs. The Ontario 
industry is currently active in the reconstruction of three bulk 
carriers, the conversion of two ships into one self-unloading 
ship and commercial repairs. The primary construction activity in 
British Columbia has been the three high speed ferries, but the 
industry is also active in the construction of smaller ferries 
and in commercial and government ship repairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the domestic market, one of the main opportunities 
for Canadian shipyards particularly in Ontario and Quebec has 
been the need to replace the Great Lakes fleet.  These ships are 
now at an average age of 30 years or three-quarters of their 
estimated lifespan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian companies currently have foreign contracts to upgrade 
one drilling rig, refit another, manufacture oil rig components 
and perform commercial ship overhauls. Canadian shipbuilders are 
also attempting to penetrate the international supply boat 
market.  Exporting is a sign of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the international playing field has 
restructured recently and that in many ways it is not level. 
Foreign governments provide subsidies to their shipbuilding 
industries; Canada does not.  I understand that when some of the 
unions met recently with my colleagues in the Liberal Atlantic 
caucus, they provided a table which shows that it costs less to 
finance a ship if subsidies are provided. I cannot argue with 
that, but they did not show the full picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsidies are not the only factor that gives world leaders their 
competitive edge. There are other contributing factors such as 
labour costs, aggressive pricing practices, shipbuilder national 
loyalty and the development of large integrated companies that 
build ships for their own use, to name a few such factors. They 
also did not accurately portray what Canada does do for the 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of federal policies in support of shipbuilding, 
let us start with what we know.  For Canada to remain in the 
shipbuilding industry, we must export.  This is an industry for 
Canadians in which they must succeed in global markets because 
our domestic market is not big enough.  International 
competitiveness is the key.  It is a competitiveness moreover 
that must come at a time when there is a substantial overcapacity 
in shipbuilding around the world.  The OECD predicts that by 2005 
the overcapacity could reach 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current federal shipbuilding policy is consistent with our 
approach to other industrial sectors.  It is also one of only a 
few industries to benefit from specific comprehensive government 
initiatives.  Essentially there are three elements to this 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have made a commitment to use Canadian shipbuilders 
for the renewal, repair and overhaul of government fleets.  We 
will continue our policy of domestic procurement for all federal 
ships and repairs where it is possible to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have a 25% tariff on all NAFTA foreign built ships 
over 100 tonnes entering Canadian waters, with the exception of 
fishing vessels over 100 feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, between 1986 and 1993 we spent $198 million on an 
industry led rationalization process, money given directly to the 
industry.  The industry itself decided it was necessary to reduce 
its capacity so the remaining shipyards could survive and remain 
competitive. The structure of the Canadian shipbuilding industry 
has changed dramatically due to this rationalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government of Canada has several other key 
initiatives to support this sector.  There are tax measures 
available to shipowners in the form of an accelerated capital 
cost allowance on new ships built in Canada.  Purchasers can 
write off the entire cost of a ship 100% over four years. 
Bearing in mind that the average life of a ship is somewhere in 
the order of 40 years, this is a very accelerated rate of 
depreciation and it gives rise to a deferred tax item on balance 
sheets of companies.  This exceeds the 15% declining balance rate 
afforded foreign built vessels.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilders are also encouraged to keep pace with new 
technology through the research and development tax credit 
system.  This system provides over $1.3 billion in annual 
assistance to research and development performing companies in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through government institutions, there is financing availability 
to this sector, like any sector, for commercially viable 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as I have already mentioned, the Export Development 
Corporation can provide financing for export sales of Canadian 
products, including ships.  In 1998, the EDC improved its 
financing terms and conditions for shipbuilding.  The financing 
term increased from eight to twelve years and the interest rate 
now matches the commercial rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier today in question period, the EDC ship 
repair financing vehicle, a further change to the EDC offering 
for ships, and I quoted Peter Cairns, president of the 
Shipbuilding Association of Canada, who said “It is a really 
good initiative, beneficial to the whole industry nationwide”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say that it was a “significant step in the right 
direction in an area where Canada has a lot of expertise”.  He 
says “The tool could be a key factor for attracting shipowners 
who do not necessarily repair in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry may also apply under the enabling 
technologies element of the technology partnerships Canada 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the role of the federal government is not to 
reinstate a tool of the past and in the process get into a 
subsidy war with other countries.  Like many other OECD 
countries, Canada is out of the subsidy business.  Rather, our 
role is to level the field by continuing our efforts to eliminate 
foreign subsidies and to remove market barriers. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the question that comes up regularly here is whether Canada 
should pay the same subsidies as these countries.  My response 
is a categorical no.  I will give five reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, these subsidies would be very costly, and it is not up to 
Canadian taxpayers to foot this bill.  Second, if we were to 
start subsidizing shipbuilding, there would soon be calls to 
subsidize other Canadian industries.  Third, there is no 
guarantee that these subsidies would make Canadian-built ships 
more attractive to foreign buyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that most ship buyers prefer to buy domestic. 
Price is only one consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, such subsidies are contrary to current international 
trade trends.  The Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, the World Trade Organization, and several other 
international organizations are calling for an end to subsidies 
for shipbuilders.  The European Union is trying to eliminate 
subsidies among member countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, Canada has strongly urged the elimination of such 
subsidies. 
We cannot call for the end of shipbuilding subsidies for our 
trade partners and use these subsidies to prop up our own 
industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the shipbuilding industry in Canada does not 
receive subsidies does not make it unique.  No other industry 
receives support in the form of direct subsidy programs.  It 
follows, therefore, that if the shipbuilding industry were to 
receive subsidies, other industries would want to receive the 
same types of benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Topping-up would be at a considerable cost to Canadian taxpayers 
and would not eliminate the substantial overcapacity that 
currently exists in the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiating down is a complex and difficult issue that cannot be 
solved in the short term.  However, to defend our domestic 
industry, we will continue to try wherever possible, such as 
through the OECD and the World Trade Organization negotiations. 
We will also continue our efforts to encourage the United States 
to update the 77 year old Jones Act in line with NAFTA and WTO 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have described the role of the federal government to ensure 
that the shipbuilding industry can compete globally; its policy 
and its continuing efforts to reduce market distortions. However, 
as in other sectors, economic development in shipbuilding is a 
shared responsibility among various players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role to be played by the provinces.  The regional 
development agencies provide general economic development support 
programs which provinces complement with targeted measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces can set up various programs and policies to supplement 
the federal package and to customize solutions to their own 
needs.  Nova Scotia and Quebec have already done this.  Nova 
Scotia has a shipbuilding loan guarantee program similar to the 
U.S. title XI program, and Quebec has a subsidy program.  If 
shipbuilding is a priority for them, other provinces can follow 
this example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, the shipbuilding industry also has a role to 
play.  For example, it can be more responsive to the market by 
going after new market opportunities, aggressively upgrading and 
retooling its technology and diversifying into related markets. 
It can improve productivity through training.  It can also 
explore synergies between shipbuilders and shipbuyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is clearly not the only player. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I believe in dialogue with all industries. My 
parliamentary secretary, members of my staff, my officials and I 
have met and listened to representatives of the shipbuilding 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes members of the opposition like to exaggerate for 
effect, but I know they would never want to mislead.  Contrary to 
press reports, I want to say categorically that I have not 
declined a meeting with any stakeholder in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a shipbuilding policy and recognizes 
as well that Canadian taxpayers want to stop business subsidies. 
I have encouraged the industry to work with the Departments of 
International Trade and Finance within the context of that 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will fulfill its role by continuing its 
efforts to eliminate foreign subsidies and to remove market 
barriers.  However, the provinces and the industry also have 
roles to play.  Provinces can supplement the federal support 
measures with their own programs.  Shipbuilders can adjust to 
market conditions and find the best market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some progress has already been made.  It should be built on in 
order to ensure the continuing viability of this rich and 
historic industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows that the shipbuilding industry and its 
representatives have been to see us as they have been to see him. 
One of the things they want us to ask the minister to do is to 
give new construction ships built in Canadian shipyards exclusion 
from the present Revenue Canada leasing regulations.  They wanted 
four things, but felt that if only that one thing could take 
place it may put them in a position to compete.  My shipyard in 
Saint John has bid on over 50 contracts but cannot compete in any 
way, shape or form as it is today.  They are saying that if they 
got just that one thing maybe they could compete and put their 
people back to work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in this case I am really 
speaking on behalf of the Secretary of State for Financial 
Institutions who has charge of this.  The issue with respect to 
leasing rules really compares the leasing rate with the rate at 
which depreciation is permitted.  Currently, Canadian built ships 
are entitled to be written off very rapidly over four years for 
100% of the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks at the leasing of assets, generally speaking, the 
rate of write-off is much slower than that.  The comparison to 
railway cars is often used as an example.  It has a 10% declining 
balance.  In other words, one never actually writes the whole 
thing off.  It goes down very gradually over a long period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To combine those two benefits of being able to write off 
everything over four years, not being willing to move from that 
formula, and to put on top of it the ability to lease the asset 
thereby essentially transferring the rapid write-off to another 
taxpayer, is something that would cause a precedent that other 
industries would be very interested in.  It would be very 
expensive.  I think to date the industry has not made a 
persuasive case as to why those two tax advantages should be 
combined uniquely for this industry.

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Industry said he met with members of the 
shipbuilding association, to which the management of Canada's 
nine largest shipyards belong. Their brief, which dates back to 
1996—and they still stand by it—mentions a number of 
considerations the minister or the parliamentary secretary 
talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four points on which they insist, and the minister did 
not respond, in particular with regard to the implementation of 
an improved export funding program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, some assistance is available through the Export Development 
Corporation, but the minister said himself that Nova Scotia felt 
the need to implement such a program, and it is nothing new 
since the minister knows about Title XI in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone here agrees. We do not have to talk about subsidies. 
Nobody is asking for that. We want tax measures and loan 
guarantees just like those available in the United States. We 
are not talking here about the Jones act. We are talking about 
Title XI, a program that provides guaranteed loans at lower 
rates, just like in the aerospace industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the minister the opportunity to respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not true because there are 
no loans for domestic sales in the aerospace industry. The EDC 
supports export sales. That is exactly what it is there for. It 
is called the Export Development Corporation. There is no 
program that supports domestic sales in any industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that several industries would like to have a program 
that supports domestic sales, but such a program does not exist 
at the moment. In Nova Scotia and in Quebec, the provincial 
governments decided to provide that kind of support, but there 
is no such program at the federal level, and I think it could 
create a precedent that would be quite costly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology has been paid for by Canadian taxpayers.  The 
difficulty is that the Australians are now coming to Canada to 
basically get the design, take it back to Australia and build it. 
The Department of National Defence is giving away that design. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding feel this is a Canadian designed boat. 
It is a good boat.  Why are we not building it in Canada?  Why 
would we export our technology and give it to somebody else when 
we can build it in Canada?  We are exporting Canadian jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know the answer 
to that question.  I certainly would share the member's concern 
if the design is Canadian, if it is a product that we could be 
making and exporting.  I would like to get some of the details 
and I certainly will look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the member that various agencies, including EDC and 
our trade representatives abroad, are very keen to support 
manufacturers of Canadian boats so that they have the same 
success in foreign markets as other manufacturers.  I look 
forward to receiving information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know 
the minister is concerned about not getting into the subsidy war. 
That is not where the world economies are actually headed.  I 
concur with him on that particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are initiatives we can take that are clearly not from a 
subsidy driven perspective.  I will point out a couple of them. 
One is that he could talk to his colleague in international trade 
and commission a very small team of maybe two or three persons to 
actually work on establishing some form of a bilateral accord 
with the Americans with respect to penetration into the U.S. 
marketplace on certain types of ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be on the Gulf of Mexico where there are some troubles 
in terms of drilling rig apparatus or shipshape hauls that we 
have developed for the Terra Nova project.  There is something we 
could do from a very task oriented perspective and leave it 
there, let it work and let it hammer it out.  That is one 
initiative I would point out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he made a comment that Revenue Canada leasing 
regulations combined with accelerated depreciation could be a 
very expensive initiative.  Given that there are no ships made 
today whatsoever using this formula, creating some economic 
activity and some tax revenue is certainly better than no tax 
revenue.  I argue that we cannot afford not to do it.  If we 
combine that with the fact there are social costs to the 
individuals who will be without work and whom we may actually 
have to support in a different initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording we chose today is the exact wording tabled under the 
Liberal Party of Canada's policy initiative.  I would be very 
surprised if there were not members on those backbenches and even 
in cabinet who supported that initiative.  Why would the minister 
not support this initiative today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member misses the 
point that it would be expensive in that it creates a precedent 
for other sectors.  In other words, if there is to be both 
leasing and rapid write-offs provided for ships, why would it not 
also be provided for rail cars, for example? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we go down that path we effectively opt into a regime of 
assigning depreciation to other taxpayers on other kinds of 
assets.  Maybe there is an argument to be made for that.  Perhaps 
there could be. I am sure the secretary of state would be willing 
to hear it, but the member has to appreciate that this is not 
something we can necessarily isolate to ships.  If we are to do 
that, we had better be prepared to entertain proposals in other 
sectors as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to trying to find with the Americans some narrower 
exemptions from the Jones act, I can presume to speak on behalf 
of my colleague in saying that we are quite prepared to work with 
the industry if we can target areas where we might be able to 
make progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this debate is very interesting from the point of view of the 
motion that was tabled.  I want to read the motion and try to get 
some understanding and appreciation of what the Tories are 
looking for.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls on the government to develop a new national 
shipbuilding policy to support the revitalization of the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry by maintaining and advancing the degree of 
excellence and the technologies for which Canada is historically 
renowned, given that Canada has the longest coastline of any 
nation in the world and that historically Canadians are among the 
finest shipbuilders in the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whilst we were debating that I tried to understand exactly what 
it was that the Tories were looking for.  I go back to asking 
what is the Tory policy.  Since they were in government for 10 
years they must have an articulated position on this issue but I 
cannot find it for the life of me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time I doubt very much if members of the unions 
involved, in particular the Marine Workers Federation of Atlantic 
Canada, would be all that pleased to be looking for policy at 
this point.  I think the marine workers are looking for action. 
After all, we have lost a fair number of workers from that 
industry in the last number of years.  Over the 1990 to 1996 
period total employment within Canada's shipbuilding and repair 
industry has declined from 11,984 to 5,566 workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hardly believe we are in the House of Commons today, with 
that kind of record in the shipbuilding industry, looking for 
more policy.  What we should be looking for, and what the Tories 
should have been going after, is some things that will increase 
productivity.  I will talk about those in a moment.  From my 
perspective they would have been better off providing the House 
with a better motion, something that would create some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Minister of Industry talk about some of the things 
that were going on.  I agree with him that the international 
playing field has been restructured.  We acknowledge that the 
playing field is not equal due to the subsidies in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about federal policies: that we must export 
more, that international competition is stiff and that there is 
overcapacity in shipbuilding.  While that may be the case there 
are still some answers and some resolutions that can be made.  By 
the way, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Edmonton East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the accelerated CCA, the capital cost allowance 
write-off over four years.  The minister is correct in saying 
that is not only an accelerated write-off but in fact a very fast 
write-off. 
Most assets today are either depreciated on the basis of the life 
expectancy of the asset or on the basis of a certain percentage. 
This particular write-off of four years is a benefit to the 
industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are research and development tax credits in the system. As 
the minister said before, the Export Development Corporation has 
loans that are very close to commercial rates.  All these things 
are in place and should be encouraging growth in the shipbuilding 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we ask ourselves, if these things are in place and 
all of these things have occurred, why the industry is not 
expanding but actually contracting.  A broad based tax relief for 
all Canadians and Canadian industry is one of the major 
impediments to the expansion of the shipbuilding industry.  Most 
Canadians are coming to the conclusion that we do not have a 
revenue problem in the country.  It is an expenditure problem. It 
is the spending of our money in the wrong places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories say we need some relief, some loan guarantees and 
more taxpayers dollars in the system.  I just do not think they 
are accurate.  Accelerated capital allowance, the research and 
development tax credits and the Export Development Corporation 
loans at lower rates are what we need and on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tory motion actually speaks to what the party is looking at. 
First, it does not seem to have a policy.  Second, it is counting 
on the government to look at policy when it is not policy that is 
needed.  It is tax relief.  Third, without that party over there 
talking about tax relief we will pick up the charge on that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what is necessary, loan guarantees force the 
taxpayers to take on a financial liability that banks and venture 
capitalists consider too risky.  That is true.  We need to get 
back to the point where industry is confident about expansion.  I 
know it is a change of thought and a change of process, but the 
only real way that can be accomplished is for the government to 
seriously consider broad based tax relief.  Without that, I am 
afraid the answer to this problem will not be in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister also said, there are more players in this 
exercise than just the federal government.  There are the 
provincial governments.  The Government of Nova Scotia has a 
shipbuilding guarantee program.  There are other players and the 
shipbuilders can look at how to be more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, while all this discussion is going on, marine workers 
are asking why the Tories are talking about more policy and why 
the government is saying that what it is doing is great and 
things are coming along.  That is not the case.  We should be 
saying to marine workers and to shipbuilders that effectively now 
we will take the surplus funds we know are in the federal 
government and do constructive things like tax reduction.  That 
is what is required.  That will help to move this industry along 
as well as many other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say it any better than that.  That is what the bulk of 
Canadian citizens are looking for today.  They do not want any 
more subsidies.  Loan guarantees mainly put the liability back on 
the federal government.  It is time to look at the tax relief 
Canadians need not only as an industry but as individuals.

been saying, that subsidies are out of the question. Everyone 
agrees on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned tax breaks. This is what people want also. Usually 
the Reform Party refers to tax breaks as incentives. However a 
refundable—I stress refundable—tax credit, which is one of the 
measures Canadian shipyard owners are asking for, is important 
because it is an incentive that kicks in after the work has been 
completed. 
Therefore, it makes it possible to build something that 
otherwise would not have been built. It brings in tax revenues 
as well as creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the Reform member agrees with this 
kind of measure. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it could be a measure that 
is looked at, but the member will have to convince me that there 
is a big difference between that and accelerated capital cost 
allowances which in effect serve the same purpose.  If one works 
better than the other, I am certainly not opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things are required to help this industry today: tax relief 
and the expansion of the Atlantic rim trade.  If both of these 
issues were looked at carefully and quickly by the federal 
government, we could see some changes in the industry.  As 
mentioned in the motion put forward by the Tories to develop a 
new national shipbuilding policy, I think we are beyond that 
request and well beyond that as a solution.  It is not policy we 
need.  We need broad based tax relief in some form or another. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I found my colleague's remarks very interesting in light 
of the need to have some defined policy on this important issue 
particularly for the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague was born and raised in the Atlantic 
provinces and has roots there and visits there regularly. Would 
the member expand on what he sees the need would be for 
government policy and public policy that would assist the 
industries in Atlantic Canada in growing and in providing the 
jobs and income that are needed in that part of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, policies are necessary to 
expand Atlantic Canada.  The shipbuilding industry is only one 
part.  One of the policies is to keep government out of it.  I 
have seen nothing but interference in many areas in Atlantic 
Canada.  We could talk about the gas exploration industry, 
mining, and the oil industry. Most industries in Atlantic Canada 
have been funded to the point where many of them were economic 
loss leaders. The best thing we could ever do in developing a 
policy for Atlantic Canada is to get government out of it and get 
industry into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see problems now with Devco.  Problems are already starting 
with Voisey's Bay.  There are difficulties with the gas industry 
and the interference by the federal government re-routing the 
pipeline. Every time those folks touch something in Atlantic 
Canada it goes wrong and ends up being a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My solution is to get government out of it.  Let Atlantic Canada 
grow.  It has more resources and more potential than many other 
parts of the country.  Atlantic Canada's biggest detriment to 
expansion and progression is government.  That is where the 
answer lies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the motion proposed by the hon. member for 
Saint John.  This is a votable motion as should be the case in 
most activities in this House whether initiated by the government 
or as is the case here, by an individual member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting this motion.  My comments will serve to 
demonstrate how two parties with supposedly different political 
outlooks can arrive at an agreement as to an outcome.  Where we 
have disagreements is with respect to the specific processes by 
which mutually agreed upon outcomes can be arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this motion the hon. member seeks the approval of this House 
to call upon the government to develop a new national 
shipbuilding policy to support the revitalization of the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry.  The member asserts in her motion that 
historically Canadians have been viewed as among the finest 
shipbuilders in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion addressed here today involves an assumption that our 
current shipbuilding industry is in a somewhat spent state and 
hence requires revitalization. This would rank well in the annals 
of understatements.  There is also in the hon. member's motion an 
implicit view that the shipbuilding excellence and related 
technological advancements associated with Canadian shipbuilding 
are both in peril.  I am in agreement with these views as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been able to develop a degree of familiarity with 
Canada's wartime marine history.  I, along with the member for 
Saint John, have been a staunch advocate of the position of our 
merchant marine veterans who seek equivalent recognition, 
benefits and compensation for denial of equality relative to 
their wartime service in defence of Canada.  Twelve thousand men 
and women served. Over 70 ships were sunk out from under them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think of the history of Canada, the history of its ships 
comes easily to mind, the <I>Bluenose</I> being the most famous of 
Canadian ships.  In my own family history, at the turn of the 
century Captain Richard Goldring sailed a commercial schooner 
aptly named the <I>Maple Leaf</I> from Port Whitby, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in speaking of the nature of shipbuilding in modern day 
commerce we are talking about ocean-going supertankers and mega 
passenger vessels of such size they cannot be accommodated by 
even the Panama Canal.  Some are specifically intended for one 
ocean travel only.  Vessels of this magnitude need to be 
developed and constructed by world class companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World class companies become so by building on their 
experiences.  Such experience exists in the Canadian shipbuilding 
industry. We must develop an approach to build on such experience 
and to assist in the creation of world class shipbuilders that 
are properly reflective of our history and expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the leaders in the construction of wooden ships.  Tall 
ships were the daily occurrence in Quebec City and Montreal with 
the St. Lawrence River being the portal of entry, a route of 
imports and exports, both cargo and human.  Immigration to Canada 
was the result of our shipbuilding skills.  The face of our 
nation is very much due to our shipbuilding efforts.  Most 
immigrants came to Canada in Canadian built ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to cause a decline in the shipbuilding industry to 
its current state?  I suggest that the shipbuilding industry has 
been lost twice in Canadian history and in both cases the loss 
has been primarily due to research and development deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first decline occurred in the transition from wooden to 
steel ships at the turn of the century.  At the time, Canadian 
shipyards in Quebec and the maritimes built most ships of 
commerce used by England and many other countries.  Then we 
lagged behind Britain where the steel industry was already well 
integrated with the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, our history was that of exporting our natural 
resources to be manufactured elsewhere.  The one notable 
exception, being of course wooden shipbuilding, was where Canada 
excelled. The interrelationship between the steel industry and 
the shipbuilding industry in Canada did not occur readily.  The 
technological transfer from wood to steel simply did not happen.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said that we lost our shipbuilding industry twice.  The 
second occasion was after the second world war.  During the war 
our shipbuilding expertise was as renowned as the member's motion 
would have us believe.  After the war however, it seemed that 
once again the tendency toward looking inward and to not exploit 
competitive advantages took hold yet once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know for example that many of the difficulties of our 
merchant navy veterans had to do with the fact that after the war 
it was assumed our shipping industry would continue to be robust 
and that the merchant navy veterans would have no job worries. We 
know that within five short years after World War II many of our 
merchant mariners were unemployed.  Shipping interests had 
focused on other parts of the world, taking much of their 
shipbuilding needs with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the technological transfer from war purpose vessels 
to commerce efficient vessels did not take place.  Canada's 
shipyards went into decline.  Canada was once a major player in 
the global shipbuilding industry.  Over the decades the history 
of Canadian shipbuilding has had its ups and downs, the highest 
demand coming during the war years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every one direct job lost in the shipbuilding industry, 
there are two or more jobs lost in the local economy.  What was 
once an important employer in Canada has withered to the point 
where we cannot even meet our own modest shipbuilding needs let 
alone become a player in the global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, I would suggest in the experience of most Canadians, 
economies do not gain any sustaining strength through government 
subsidies.  Government subsidies do not in the long term make any 
industry strong.  Instead, industry must gain its strength 
through trading internationally in the global peacetime economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the incentive for long term research and development if 
the government is there to pick up, or contract, or otherwise 
bail you out?  It should be noted that the shipbuilding industry 
itself contributes little to its own research and development by 
world standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly mention taxation.  It would appear to be 
self-evident that if income taxes are higher, wage demands will 
be higher.  We see this in the auto industry and other industries 
which are attempting to compete globally.  What people look to is 
what they are netting after taxes.  Gross salary is largely 
irrelevant other than as some misguided notion of status or 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into great detail, I would suggest that any 
thought of revitalization of the shipbuilding industry has to be 
based on a mix of lower taxes and enhanced freedom with respect 
to international trade.  The answer to our problems is not to be 
found in further government subsidies, but to level the playing 
field for international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country has the raw materials.  It has the ports and it has 
the shipyards.  It has the willing capable workers.  Canada even 
has a 75 cent dollar selling price compared to the American 
dollar.  Why are there no sales of Canadian made ships?  High 
taxes and trade barriers.  That is why.

industry, would the hon. member agree that the best thing we can 
do is to pass Bill C-493, which was introduced by the hon. member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not provide subsidies, but tax measures to make 
Canadian shipbuilders more competitive internationally, a loans 
program with guarantees of up to 87%, just like in the United 
States, an Income Tax Act amendment to bring leasing rules more 
in line with those in the rail industry, and a refundable tax 
credit similar to the one in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, would these measures be in tune with his 
vision, because he is not looking for subsidies, but government 
assistance programs? That would help us to diversify our 
regional economies. Quebec and Canada could also regain their 
position on the world shipbuilding market. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the true way 
to develop and encourage the industry is to approach the 
problems.  This would not necessarily be through straight 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems seem to be apparent.  I think we could relate back 
to possibly the 1960s when I first was an adult and the first 
time I voted.  It was noticeable to me at that time that the 
Canadian dollar was $1.10 to the American dollar and the taxation 
level was far lower than it is today.  Yet somehow there was some 
help to our shipbuilding industry at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the things that we should be addressing as well as the 
very significant problems of levelling the international trade 
situation by possibly approaching a repeal of the Jones act.  It 
seems to give unfair discrimination against Canada to its 
shipbuilding industry.  These are the areas we should be 
approaching to resolve the taxation system and levelling the 
playing field on international trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Americans are fond of recalling their first dollar.  I 
can recall my first dime.  It was a very small shiny thing.  I 
remember on the one side of that small shiny coin there was the 
head of a man.  It did not interest me much and I do not think 
the head on that side of the coin interests me much any more, or 
still, I should say.  Of course that was King George VI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the coin, on the dime, there was a picture 
of a ship.  It was a ship in full sail coming right out of that 
coin.  I thought that was one of the prettiest things that I had 
ever seen as a very small child.  This is a memory that certainly 
predates school age.  I should also tell hon. members that dime 
at the time bought one Coca-Cola, but that is not the reason why 
I remember it so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That little ship is still sailing on that dime, only now it is 
on nickel alloy instead of a sea of silver.  That ship connects 
this debate to ourselves as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later, when I got a little older, I started collecting stamps. 
Anyone who is listening who was ever a stamp collector will 
remember that the 50¢ Bluenose is without any question the most 
beautiful stamp that Canada has ever produced.  It is a classic 
stamp.  Of course the <I>Bluenose</I> is that famous vessel that 
was built in Nova Scotia during the 19th century that won all the 
races and yet was a fishing vessel at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, much, much later in life I had occasion to visit a 
replica of the <I>Bluenose</I> in Toronto harbour.  It was a 
wonderful ship.  It reflects the heritage of Nova Scotia and the 
maritimes, because of course in the 19th century the shipbuilding 
industry in the maritimes, and particularly Nova Scotia, was 
world class. Nova Scotia was famous for its wooden ships and the 
<I>Bluenose</I> was the most classic ship ever built in Canada, 
for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other connections of the shipbuilding industry to 
Canada's past.  I was listening to my Bloc colleagues who have 
taken a very active interest in this debate and I congratulate 
them for it because I come from a riding that is in central 
Ontario, just west of Hamilton, and one would think there would 
be no real connection with the shipbuilding industry there.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 17th century a very famous French explorer visited my 
region at the head of the lake, at Burlington Bay, and his name 
was La Salle.  He was the explorer who actually founded 
Louisiana.  La Salle in the 1670s explored down the Ohio River 
and Mississippi right down to Louisiana, to the mouth of the 
Mississippi, and claimed it for France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 17th century the French in New France were probably the 
world's greatest entrepreneurs because for La Salle it was not 
just exploration.  It was the development of the fur trade. La 
Salle built the very first ship on the upper Great Lakes.  He 
built the <I>Griffon</I> in 1678.  He built it not very far from 
where I live at Niagara Falls, above the falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That ship set sail.  It was 45 tonnes, built from white pine in 
the area by hand.  It set sail on Lake Erie and went up to 
Michilimackinac.  In 1680 it picked up a cargo of furs to return 
to the port at Niagara and disappeared.  It is one of the great 
mysteries of Canadian history, what ever happened to the 
<I>Griffon</I>.  In the cold waters of Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan 
or Lake Huron, for that matter, there is a very good chance that 
the <I>Griffon</I> will still be on the bottom and in perfect 
condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this because during the war of 1812 there was a 
businessman in my area who built a trading ship.  The area was 
still forest and hardly developed.  It was seized by the 
Americans.  It was armed in the war of 1812 and sank off St. 
Catharines during a storm.  Not many years ago they discovered 
that ship at the bottom in perfect condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of shipbuilding in this country transcends this 
country.  It is all across this country.  In that sense I think 
the introduction of the motion in the House is a very appropriate 
thing to do because it does touch on our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have quarrel with the motion in this sense.  The motion 
suggests that the federal government needs to develop a 
shipbuilding policy, as though there was not a policy at all to 
date, and that it should revitalize the Canadian shipbuilding 
industry by maintaining and advancing a degree of excellence and 
the technologies that Canada is famous for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are very noble sounding words.  I appreciate they come 
from a resolution that was passed at a Liberal convention in 
1998.  I point out that a resolution that is passed at a 
convention is not the same thing as bringing something before the 
House.  If I find fault with the motion, I find fault with it 
because it does not suggest a significant way of addressing the 
problem of Canada's shipbuilding industry.  I suggest the reason 
is because it does not deal with the terrible problems that 
Canada's shipbuilding industry is facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Saint John was the lead off speaker for the 
Conservatives, and this is a Conservative motion.  She proposed 
that what the government should be doing is it should be 
sweetening the loan support for people who are buying ships or it 
should change the tax laws slightly with respect to leasing and 
little fixes like that.  That does not address the problem of 40% 
overcapacity in the shipbuilding industry around the world.  That 
does not address the fact that South Korea alone has $10 billion 
worth of orders for 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not alone with respect to a problem with its 
shipbuilding industry.  All we have to do is search across the 
world wide web and what we will find is that the European Union 
is desperately worried about the fact that its shipyards are 
beginning to perish because it cannot compete on the open market 
with particularly South Korea and also Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with an overcapacity in the shipbuilding industry, 
and we are faced with the Asian flu for example which has lowered 
the currency in South Korea enormously. They have cheap labour, 
cheap currency, and they have a huge shipbuilding infrastructure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD has had meetings just in the last few months in which 
it has tried to come to grips with this problem in the 
shipbuilding industry because it affects almost every country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brazil, Romania and Russia are complaining.  Both communist 
China and Taiwan have very active shipbuilding industries, but no 
one seems to be able to compete with the South Koreans.  Indeed, 
if we follow the Internet, there are even some complaints or some 
suggestions that the South Koreans are using IMF dollars to 
unfairly buoy up their industry.  There is a problem there.  When 
put in that context, a few tax fixes is not going to correct, not 
going to help, not even going to address the desperate problem 
that faces Canada's shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the other aspect.  The other problem is that 
during the North American Free Trade Agreement the Tories, the 
former government of the party that has advanced this motion, had 
an opportunity to give shipbuilding the protection of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, particularly by doing something 
about the Jones law.  The Jones law is a law that forbids 
carriers from American ports to other American ports to use 
anything other than American made ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge amount of traffic in coastal vessels that runs 
up and down the American eastern seaboard.  If we had managed to 
get only one-tenth or maybe only 1% of the shipbuilding market of 
that traffic, we would not be having this debate today.  It was a 
huge failure of the free trade agreement not to include 
shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have this dilemma.  It is not a simple matter of a couple of 
minuscule tax fixes.  That will not do any good at all.  We could 
try it but it is not going to do any good.  What the minister has 
said is closer to what we must do.  He said that we have to put 
pressure on the OECD to come to terms with the unfair advantages 
that South Korea and Japan have been enjoying in the shipbuilding 
industry.  We have to bring it into the international forum and 
make it into an even playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the minister and the member opposite from the 
Reform Party in his last remarks during questions and comments 
said that maybe we have to go back to the United States and do 
something about the Jones law.  I would say he is precisely 
right.  We have to go back to the United States and offer it 
something to allow us to take part in that industry in the United 
States.  Just a small percentage and we would be doing just fine. 
We have to do that.  These are things perhaps that are almost 
wishful thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the minister in his remarks said that Canada is 
proceeding on these two avenues right now.  There is no question 
that the federal government does have a policy, but if I may add 
my dime's worth to this debate I think we need to think of novel 
approaches as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to bring up the Government of British Columbia but I am 
going to do it.  The Government of British Columbia has 
undertaken a very controversial, if not notorious, ferry building 
project.  In order to buoy up the industry in B.C. the Government 
of British Columbia undertook a project to build three fast 
ferries out of aluminum hulls, the idea being that hopefully they 
would develop new technology, create competitive vessels and 
develop expertise.  Unfortunately there have been major cost 
overruns.  It projected $70 million for each vessel and now the 
overrun is running at approximately $400 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the kind of thing we want to see in this climate of 
fiscal prudence, but there is something very strong to be said 
for the federal government investing not only in the shipyards to 
produce the ships it needs but also through various technological 
enhancement programs or infrastructure programs.  There is a lot 
to be said.  If the industry rationalizes itself so that it comes 
to the federal government in a coherent fashion, perhaps we can 
work with the provinces and set shipbuilding along a course where 
we build specialized high tech ships which we can sell abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now I do not think there is much more that we can do other 
than what the minister is already doing, which is pressuring the 
OECD to come to terms with the unfair competition that is 
occurring in shipbuilding across the world.  We can also do 
something about the unfair competition in South Korea and talk 
again to the Americans.  That is a policy.  That is what we 
should be doing and that is what we are doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I get 
the feeling that my colleagues on the government side are going 
to vote against our motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to see is them voting for our motion and then 
taking the steps stated by the hon. member:  to sit down with the 
World Trade Organization and talk over with the OECD how exactly 
we can change these thing.  That can come from this new 
shipbuilding policy which we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify something for the member.  When we talk about 
the new construction ships built in Canadian shipyards being 
excluded from the present Revenue Canada leasing regulations, 
what we are saying is that under the current rules, the company 
pays more taxes in the first several years which runs counter to 
the actual economies of owning and operating a ship to the useful 
life of the ship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed change that we have mentioned, the company 
would pay most of the taxes toward the end of the useful life of 
the ship.  We are saying that it would get it all, but this is 
what the industry is saying to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking members to assist and help us.  Let us all work 
together to come up with a national shipbuilding policy that will 
help all of our people throughout Canada.  I ask my colleague to 
look at that in a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said, the matter of 
tax fixes is not what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that during the debate the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona felt that the motion did not have any real 
substance.  He said that the Reform Party would support it anyway 
because it was inoffensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we in the House are not in the business of 
debating ideas that do not have substance because they raise 
false hopes.  If there had been a real idea or something 
significant in the motion I would have supported it.  As it 
stands, I do not expect to be able to do so.

since the very articulate member is used to these kinds of 
debates, I want to ask him some specific questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he remembers attending the last Liberal convention, he must 
remember that the Liberal Party resolution was approved by a 
high percentage of supporters. Did he vote in favour of the 
resolution at the last Liberal convention in 1998? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of principle, does the hon. member think that it is 
normal that, six years later, we are still waiting for the 
summit his party promised, in 1993, to hold within a year? Does 
he think it is normal for everyone, except the Minister of 
Industry, to agree that things are not as they should be in the 
shipbuilding industry, which is only operating at 40% of its 
capacity? Does he think it is normal to be able to do nothing 
and to bow down before the American giant, saying nothing can be 
done? Does he think it is normal? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out in my 
speech, the minister gave the policy and we delivered. A policy 
is in place and it is the best policy we can have under the 
circumstances.  This a global problem.  We have delivered a 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any of the members of the opposition had a new idea to add to 
that policy I have not so far heard it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have just two quick points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member keeps talking, as do others on that side, about 
the policy, about having a policy and about the minister giving 
the policy.  I have yet to see this policy in writing and to see 
exactly what it entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned in his speech that we should go to the Americans to 
see what we can give them in order to get a small piece of this 
business.  I guess I take some offence to this idea of us always 
going with hat in hand to the Americans. 
It seems to me this is what we are doing all the time.  We did it 
on the ethanol case.  We did it when they would not allow us to 
launch our satellite.  Bill C-55 was another example.  We could 
go on and on with the examples of how we are constantly going 
with our hat in hand to the Americans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not stand up as Canadians, develop a policy for 
ourselves and put something on the table with strong force rather 
than going to see what we can give in order that they allow us to 
have a part of this business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a crisis of 
international sales, of shipbuilding.  We cannot get into the 
American market and we cannot do it alone in Canada.  There are 
no markets in Canada that will sustain our shipbuilding industry. 
The American market is protected because that other party over 
there, in that direction generally, failed to get it into the 
free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of going hat in hand.  We are now at a 
major disadvantage and people are suffering.  We are losing one 
of our heritage industries because the Conservative Party or the 
Conservative government never took the proper steps when it 
arranged the free trade deal with the Americans. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the government had indicated earlier that one of the 
factors in the shipbuilding industry is high labour cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way mentioned earlier the low cost of 
Korean labour.  Could he comment on whether it is really a 
multiple factor on labour where we have higher income taxes, a 
lower productivity level or a varying productivity level that 
would be a factor? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The factor here of wages does not necessarily come into this 
discussion at all.  After all, we are also competing on the world 
market in shipbuilding with England and Germany whose wage levels 
are relatively high.  Could the hon. member comment on the 
taxation portion and productivity portion, and whether it is the 
actual root wage itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in his speech, this very 
member recalled when the Canadian dollar was worth $1.10 to the 
American dollar.  He thought that was a happy time.  Precisely 
the problem now is that the Korean currency is so low. It is 
below the Canadian dollar and below everything.  It means that 
Korean labour, relative to North American labour, relative to 
Canadian labour, is very underpriced.  The problem is to 
understand not just labour costs, but to understand the 
difference between the values of international currency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
quite intently to my hon. colleague from across the way.  Yes, 
Nova Scotia was a fine place where ships were built, especially 
in the years past, but it is still a very good and strong 
shipbuilding place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern, however, is that there is too much partisanship in 
this debate.  This issue is something that affects Canada from 
coast to coast to coast.  I would like to see the members across 
the way forget all the partisanship and work on the issue that is 
so very important here.  A vital part of our Canadian economy is 
being fluffed off as something that is not important.  They say 
that our motion does not have substance.  They are the 
government; they should put the substance in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague stand up in the House and say he will 
work with his colleagues to get rid of the Jones Act and other 
items that would benefit us as Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all I can say is what I 
have said.  It seems the opposition cannot come up with a better 
expression of a direction to take the government, the economy, 
the people of the maritimes and the shipbuilding industry into 
than a motion that has no original idea to it, and in fact was 
borrowed from the Liberals.  When is the opposition going to come 
up with its own ideas?

all, I want to tell you at the outset that I will be sharing my 
time with my hon. colleague for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to take part in this very important debate, 
even if it is quite technical. It is very important for the 
development of economically significant regions of Canada, like 
the maritimes and the coast of British Columbia and particularly 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to participate in this debate as member of 
Trois-Rivières, which is a maritime city, and also as labour 
critic, since it has an effect on the institutionalized disorder 
that we see in that industry. I believe there is too much 
reference to labour. As coast guard critic, I know that some 
people of the coast guard are also closely involved with the 
issues related to shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read, for the purpose of the debate, the motion 
introduced by the member for Saint John. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls the government to develop a new national 
shipbuilding policy to support the revitalisation of the 
Canadian shipbuilding industry by maintaining and advancing the 
degree of excellence and the technologies for which Canada is 
historically renowned, given that Canada has the longest coast 
line of any nation in the world and that historically Canadians 
are among the finest shipbuilders in the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to pay a very special tribute to my colleague 
and friend, the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, 
who has done not only a remarkable job on this issue but a task 
that could be termed as colossal. 
Indeed, for more than a year, the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has travelled all across Canada 
and has met all stakeholders, builders, all shipyard operators 
that are members of the shipbuilders association, despite 
the fact that he is not all that fluent in English. 
Nevertheless, he managed to deal with the situation and he 
established excellent contacts with employers as well as with 
unions in the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through his efforts, he succeeded in bringing together, on 
Parliament Hill, on December 8, 1998, representatives of a large 
Quebec shipbuilding firm and almost all Canadian unions involved 
in the shipbuilding industry. According to a union 
representative, this was a first in Canadian history. 
He managed to bring together, to discuss the problems faced by 
shipyards, many stakeholders as closely connected to the 
industry as these people were. He pulled a major coup by 
bringing to the same table representatives from the four 
opposition parties, including three out of the four leaders, to 
make the necessary representations and put pressure on the 
government which, in this issue as in others, has proven to be 
inept. The purpose was to try to improve the way this very 
important industry has been treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resulted in representations to the Standing Committee on 
Industry with a view to putting forward, through this committee, 
recommendations reflecting the comments or the vision of the 
labour representatives as expressed at this meeting. 
Unfortunately, in this issue as in others, the government lent a 
deaf ear and eventually only very reluctantly agreed to conduct 
a broad study, reportedly too wide focussed, on the productivity 
of shipyards. The timetable and specific goals of the study are 
said to be unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot be stressed often enough: it is totally nonsensical, 
ludicrous, and deplorable to be debating this issue today when 
we know how critical this industry is to Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada boasts the world's longest shoreline, three oceans—the 
Atlantic, the Pacific and the Arctic—and, as long as we are still 
part of it, the most important water route in the world, the 
Saint Lawrence River. In spite of all these very positive 
factors, shipbuilding in Canada is in a deplorable state, 
reportedly operating at merely 40% of its capacity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it is a high tech industry, because building ships is a 
complex operation.  It is a category of industry that has to 
apply the most stringent of quality standards.  It is a member 
of the ISO 9001, ISO 9002 club.  ISO 9001 is for the 
aeronautical industry.  This industry is governed by very 
demanding quality standards and the shipbuilding industry in 
Canada and in Quebec can hold its own with any other in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, true to form, has been negligent. It is all 
very well to speak today of shipbuilding, but we know that this 
government has been negligent with the air transportation 
industry, with the rail industry, with the shipping industry, not 
just with shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has paid for that negligence.  We have seen shipyards 
close down in Gaspé and Sorel, a small-scale one in Lévis, and 
Vickers in Montreal, all in the past 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to the manpower issue.  I am concerned, 
as I have already said, as the labour critic, by the references 
to labour costs. 
This does not hold up to analysis, according to the figures 
available to us.  According to the 1994 figures provided to us 
by the shipbuilders, via the union of the marine workers 
federation, the CAW, shipyard labour costs $15 U.S. in Canada, 
while only 2 countries out of the 12 analyzed pay less than 
Canada: Taiwan and Greece.  All the others pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, while it costs $15 U.S. an hour in Canada, it costs 
$18 in Italy, $19 in France and the U.S., $24 in Norway, $27 in 
Japan, and $30 in Germany.  These are the 1994 figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the argument that the industry is not competitive with 
other countries because labour costs are too high does not hold 
up to analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the best explanation for the disarray in the industry is to 
be found in the government's negligence. The Minister of 
Industry, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Transport and 
the Minister for International Trade keep passing the buck to 
one another on this. Even the Prime Minister did not answer the 
letter my colleague from Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière sent him 
several months ago. The Prime Minister did not even bother to 
answer the letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, in the red book, the Liberals, and in particular the 
Liberal candidates from the Quebec City area, made a firm 
commitment to do a serious study of the issue. 
In March 1998, grassroots Liberals raised the issue again and 
asked the government to take a firm stand and take action on 
shipbuilding, but it has not yet done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, today's debate will make the government think and 
take the measures needed to improve the situation of this 
valuable industry. The government—and I am just talking common 
sense here—should act to make Canada and Quebec world leaders 
in shipbuilding. The government should stop dragging its feet 
and do what needs to be done to make Quebec and Canada the world 
leaders they should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Bloc Quebecois critic for transport, I am pleased 
to speak to the motion by the Progressive Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my intent to speak much more gently about the 
Conservatives because I thought their motion a good one.  It is, 
in short, a general motion.  I do not think anyone opposes 
virtue.  On the contrary, we support saintliness, without 
necessarily expecting to be canonized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the motion, but it is clear from the 
statement by the Progressive Conservative member for Chicoutimi 
before oral question period, which literally incensed the 
Liberal government, that this member is an expert in the art of 
joining with the Liberals against Quebec and the Government of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, given the attitude of the member for Chicoutimi, and when I 
read the articles in the Chicoutimi daily—because the hon. member 
has a real in with the daily and the chief editorial writer in 
particular, we learned recently—I will start by saying to those 
watching that, in 1993 and 1997, the Bloc Quebecois has made it 
known that the Liberals and the Conservatives are the flip sides 
of the same coin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I saying they are the same?  For one very simple and good 
reason.  The entire problem in shipbuilding in Quebec started 
with the Conservatives.  When they were in power—between 1984 and 
1993—they said “The shipyards must be streamlined.  Not everyone 
can compete.  Everyone is going to have to close”.  The only 
province to streamline its shipyards was Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Vickers shipyard in Montreal was really 
flourishing.  There was Marine Industries in Sorel.  These two 
major shipyards—not to mention the little yards that closed—which 
employed hundreds and hundreds, indeed thousands, of workers had 
to close their doors because the ministers of the Conservative 
government said “You must streamline”.  So that the only 
shipyard left was MIL Davie in Lauzon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my parents, I have an excellent memory.  On Monday, October 
11, 1993, on the night of Thanksgiving Day, and a few weeks 
before the election, I had the honour, the pleasure and the 
privilege of representing my party during a public debate that 
was carried by Radio-Canada in the Quebec region from Portneuf to 
the Magdalen Islands, including Gaspé, Sept-Îles and the greater 
Quebec City region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was representing the Bloc Quebecois, and I was facing the 
Liberal candidate in the riding of Quebec, Jean Pelletier, who 
lost to my colleague for Quebec, and is presently the chief of 
staff of the Prime Minister of Canada. The Conservatives were 
represented by good old Pierre Blais, who was the Minister of 
Justice and the member for Bellechasse. He lost to my colleague 
François Langlois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking for the Conservative government, the hon. member for 
Bellechasse told us “We have given money to MIL Davie”. I asked 
him how much, and he said “$1.2 billion”. 
I then told Pierre Blais “During that same period when you gave 
$1.2 billion to MIL Davie, you handed out $11 billion to the 
maritimes”. During the nine years the Conservatives were in 
power, shipyards kept popping up from nowhere in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election campaign, the Liberal Party, with Jean 
Pelletier, the present chief of staff of the Prime Minister of 
Canada and a Liberal candidate in the riding of Quebec, was 
claiming that it would invest $125 million in the Quebec City 
port.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went and made speeches to workers coming out of the MIL Davie 
shipyard. We remember that. The Liberals promised the world and 
a marine policy. This government has been in office since 1993. 
What has it done? Absolutely nothing. I have here the 
resolutions adopted during the convention of the Liberal Party 
of Canada, including one by the New Brunswick Liberal 
Association, which is similar—I read it earlier—in almost every 
respect to what the Progressive Conservative Party is proposing 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One conclusion provides that the Liberal Party of Canada should 
urge the Canadian government to immediately develop a national 
shipbuilding policy to help that industry and thus maintain and 
strengthen the degree of excellence and the technologies that 
helped build a solid reputation which we are in danger of 
losing. This is a resolution from the New Brunswick Liberal 
Association to its own party, which is the ruling party. What 
are the Liberals doing? Nothing. The resolutions arising from 
Liberal Party conventions are not worth the paper they are 
written on. If I were a Liberal militant I would be distressed 
to see that my government ignores the recommendations of its own 
militants. This is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention something else before my time is up. When Bloc 
Quebecois members speak in the House, it is often said that 
their input is useless because they are sovereignists. 
The Quebec government is useless because it is a sovereignist 
government. Nothing good can come from Quebec City. The Minister 
of Human Resources Development will not let the millennium 
scholarships be discussed between elected people, instead of 
asking the president of Bell Canada to negotiate with the 
Minister of Education, who was democratically elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, our friends opposite would have us believe that nothing 
worthwhile is accomplished in Quebec. I am sorry, but the 
government should take note of the fact that, for several years 
now, and particularly since 1994, when the Parti Quebecois came 
back in office, tax incentives have been put in place for the 
shipbuilding industry, and not regressive measures that will 
kill what is left of that industry in Quebec. On the contrary, 
these measures were taken to promote the development of that 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for expertise, there are the folks at MIL Davie and in Les 
Méchins, at the the shipyard run by Mrs. Verreault, a competent 
businesswoman able to compete internationally.  So Quebec has 
expertise, but tax incentives are needed to help it develop and 
prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the Government of Quebec announced tax incentives to 
stimulate the shipping industry.  Among other things, it raised 
the refundable tax credit for shipbuilding, around since 1996, 
from 40% to 50%.  Second, it introduced a tax credit for the 
conversion or major refitting of ships, and extended this 
measure to oil rigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it made some adjustments the measure to reduce capital 
taxes. 
The problem is that the Government of Canada is taxing the 
benefits of Quebec's tax advantages, thus cancelling out part of 
the positive impact of these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the federal Minister of Finance would do better to take 
a look at what Minister Landry is doing in Quebec, on behalf of 
the Government of Quebec, not just in Mr. Landry's own personal 
interest, although I have great respect for the man. The 
Government of Quebec has shown political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the Minister of Finance would do better to look at what is 
going on, because there is a problem.  Each time we want to 
speak to the federal Minister of Finance about shipbuilding or 
the shipping industry, he has to watch what he says. Everyone 
knows he is a major shipowner, being the owner of Canada 
Steamship Lines. 
Our party was the first to point out that four of the ships 
owned by Canada Steamship Lines are registered to the Bahamas, 
with foreign crews, and do not pay taxes here.  The Minister of 
Finance is not setting a good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, our party will be supporting this good motion, 
although I must say it is somewhat general.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I 
would like to thank my colleague from 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans for supporting our 
motion that he describes as general. It is nevertheless an 
essential one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel compelled to speak up because of his introduction and of 
the fact that he comes from Chicoutimi. I was brought up to 
think that credit had to be given where credit is due. It was 
therefore a pleasure for me to pay tribute at noon today to the 
secretary of state who has made the aluminum industry, and 
particularly the processing of aluminum, a priority for this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that in my area it is an issue that is followed 
quite closely. 
After having seen 8,000 jobs lost in the primary aluminium 
sector, it is good news when we hear a person in power say “We 
are going to help you do the processing”. Currently, about 
600,000 tonnes are processed outside of the country and the 
Saguenay—Lac Saint-Jean is paying for that. I am sure that the 
member from Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
misspoke himself and I forgive him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to tell us what he thinks of a political party 
which sought the approval of its members at a convention for a 
resolution that an opposition party copied word for word to help 
it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought that we would do everything in our power to help the 
government to support readily, in good faith and free of 
partisanship an initiative that could restart a major industry 
that has an impact on thousands of sectors, one where our 
technological sophistication can be of benefit to every country 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing we want is a fiscal policy that will be fair 
compared to what is done elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to enter into a 
lengthy debate with the member for Chicoutimi because I see him 
often in the lobby and I am sure that, in the next election 
campaign, I will have the opportunity to visit his riding a lot 
more often. Therefore, I want to save my words and my energy for 
the next campaign, two years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said that the principle and the wording of this motion 
were general, I did not mean it in a derogatory way. On the 
contrary, this motion is general enough to attract broader 
support. I find it interesting that the researchers for the 
Progressive Conservative Party drew this from the resolutions 
adopted by the Liberal convention. 
This does indeed put the Liberal Party in a very bad spot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, nothing should surprise us with this government. I 
am certain that the left hand does not even know what the right 
hand is doing and that the government will reject our motion, as 
it usually does. According to the government, nothing that comes 
from the opposition can be worthwhile. So we will see what comes 
of this later today or next week. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, many many 
years ago, I got my first job after studying engineering at 
Laval University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at the Lauzon shipyard, which was called at the time 
Davie Shipbuilding.  I worked there for several months as an 
electrical draughtsman. At the time, more than 1,000 people 
worked in the shipyard. There were ships everywhere. Some were 
in dry docks—there was the small dry dock and the big dry dock—and 
some were on slipways. Shipbuilding at the time was a 
flourishing business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Vickers in Montreal, another shipyard in Sorel and Davie in 
Lauzon all had a lot of work, building lakers for private 
companies and ships for the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the government reduce such a flourishing industry to 
what it is today, absolutely nothing? What went wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, if foreign companies used to 
come and still come now to MIL Davie to have their ships built 
or repaired, it is not just to please us. They are not 
charitable organizations. They do business with our shipyards 
because of the quality of their work, their efficiency and their 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CSN workers at MIL Davie have shown some backbone. They put 
their collective agreement in order. They want to survive and 
prosper, which is quite legitimate. The hon. member is right to 
say that in Lauzon and elsewhere in Quebec—let us not forget the 
shipyard in Les Méchins—we have experienced, competent and 
motivated shipbuilding workers.

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by indicating again that the government has a 
shipbuilding policy.  In fact the policy being pursued by the 
government traces its origins to the days when the Progressive 
Conservative Party formed the Government of Canada.  I remind my 
colleagues across the way of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then we have done a lot of good for the shipbuilding 
industry in this country.  Some of the good work lies in the 
support provided by the Export Development Corporation.  It is in 
that area that I would like to address my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by stating that the Export Development Corporation, 
Canada's official export credit agency, provides Canadian 
exporters in all sectors a wide range of innovative trade finance 
services.  Canadian exporters and investors look to the EDC to 
provide creative and responsive financial solutions as they do 
business in over 200 countries, including high risk and emerging 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Founded in 1944 as a crown corporation, the EDC operates as a 
commercial financial institution on a self-sustaining basis.  As 
the EDC carries out its mandate to be self-sustaining it applies 
sound commercial principles to all of its transactions.  Premiums 
and fees are charged for insurance and all loans are fully 
repayable with interest.  The EDC reinvests to support future 
growth in Canadian exports.  As the EDC operates along commercial 
lines, it does not provide subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada's official export credit agency, with the government 
of Canada as its stakeholder, the EDC is bound by certain 
international trade obligations.  This includes the OECD's 
arrangement on guidelines for officially supported export 
credits.  This arrangement, also know as the consensus, has 
provided disciplines for the orderly use of officially supported 
export credits since 1979.  The arrangement provides participants 
clear limitations on key terms and conditions when official 
support is provided, such as maximum repayment terms, minimum 
interest rates and disciplines on trade related aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In certain key areas, such as aircraft and shipbuilding, the 
consensus agreement has sector understandings in place to provide 
disciplines that satisfy the special demands of these important 
industrial sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present there is a sector understanding on shipbuilding which 
dates from 1981.  The OECD, recognizing the strategic importance 
of the shipbuilding sector, concluded negotiations in 1994 on a 
new agreement respecting normal competitive conditions in the 
commercial shipbuilding and repair industry.  As part of this new 
agreement the sector understanding on export credits for ships 
was revised to bring it more in line with current market 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised 1994 sector understanding calls for maximum 
repayment terms of 12 years for loans and interest rates which 
reflect market conditions, the commercial interest reference rate 
of the OECD, and a 20% down payment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has stated that it will not sign the shipbuilding 
agreement until such time as it is ratified by all signatories. 
It will then be clear what final exemptions the U.S. and other 
signatories will build into the agreement to protect their 
individual national shipbuilding industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing OECD guidelines allow us to match foreign financing 
terms when these are extended to more favourable terms and 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada fully supports efforts by the OECD to 
move closer to an internationally accepted set of rules that will 
eliminate unfair financing practices.  The EDC will continue to 
be guided by revised 1994 sector understandings when offering 
support to Canadian yards for their foreign business 
transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to the specifics of EDC support in the shipbuilding 
sector, I am very pleased to state that the EDC has been 
providing a tremendous amount of support to the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry.  The EDC tells me that since 1996 it has 
supported more than $110 million in Canadian trade vessels and in 
ship repair services provided by Canadian yards.  At this time 
the EDC is developing another $733 million in potential 
international business on behalf of Canadian yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should not take my word for it.  In the April 26, 1999 
edition of the <I>Canadian Sailings</I> magazine the president of 
the Shipbuilding Association of Canada, Peter Cairns, said in 
reference to the EDC that it was “a significant step in the 
right direction in an area where Canada has a lot of expertise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other enthusiastic supporters of the initiative of the 
EDC who have raised their comments in support, including Alan 
Thoms, president of Canadian Shipbuilding & Engineering Ltd. and 
John T. B. Chard, executive vice-president and chief operating 
officer of Shipyards in North Vancouver for the Washington Marine 
Group.  These are people in the industry who support the very 
important role which the EDC plays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EDC is organized along sectoral lines so that business teams 
can provide Canadian exporters with financial services to meet 
their specific and unique needs.  Shipbuilding and repair 
transactions are handled by the ground transportation and 
shipping team.  This team contains financial service 
professionals who can structure financial support to meet the 
complex demands of today's shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EDC can support Canadian shipbuilders with a wide range of 
financing, guarantees, insurance and bonding products.  The EDC 
actively considers support for Canadian shipbuilding using direct 
loans, guarantees for debt participants in shipbuilding 
transactions who are taking a risk with the EDC, bid and 
performance bonding, specific transaction insurance and leading 
and participating in structured financial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a market in financing where the EDC has not been able 
to help Canadian yards.  This is the case of a Canadian buyer 
receiving offers from foreign yards to buy their vessels on terms 
supported by their national export credit agencies.  This has 
happened on occasion in the past.  Unfortunately, since these 
would be domestic transactions, Canadian yards have not been able 
to go to the EDC for competitive financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An outstanding example of the EDC sectoral approach to 
supporting Canadian business is its ship repair financing 
framework.  The framework is ideally designed for ship repair 
transactions which require swift credit decisions for amounts up 
to $1.5 million U.S. and credit terms of up to 120 days.  The EDC 
purchases the promissory notes issued for the cost of the ship 
repairs, allowing shipowners to receive financing for up to 80% 
of the cost of ship repairs, with a fixed interest rate for up to 
four months, with a straightforward documentation and 
administration process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefit to the Canadian shipyard is a cash sale upon receipt 
of the promissory notes by the EDC.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be eligible for this financing, the proposed 
transactions must involve a shipyard or shipyards operating in 
Canada, benefits to Canada and the vessels involved must operate 
on international routes.  EDC is also very willing to discuss 
financial solutions for complete ship overhauls and new 
construction in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I would like to make a few comments on U.S. 
programs that are of great interest to Canadian shipyards.  The 
new OECD shipbuilding agreement which was discussed earlier has 
still not been ratified by the United States, which continues to 
offer special longer repayment terms to buyers of U.S. vessels. 
As an example, under the U.S. MarAd program title XI financing of 
the U.S. sourced equipment and products, buyers can receive 
financing support of up to 87.5% of the contract value and 
repayment terms up to 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we have discussed in the House today a number of 
maritime laws known collectively as the Jones act which also 
impose a variety of limits on foreign participation in the U.S. 
domestic maritime industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these laws the carriage of cargo or passengers between 
points in the United States is restricted to U.S built and U.S. 
documented vessels owned and operated by U.S. citizens.  Similar 
restrictions apply to dredging, salvage and other commercial 
marine activities in U.S. waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In international shipping there are limitations on foreign 
ownership of vessels eligible for documentation in the U.S.  In 
addition several subsidies and other support measures are 
available to operators of U.S. vessels.  Cargo preference laws 
restrict the carriage of military cargo and limit the carriage of 
government non-military cargo, aid cargo and certain agricultural 
commodities to U.S. vessels.  These and other restrictions 
coupled with defence related prohibitions of the Byrnes-Tollefson 
amendment limit Canadian participation in U.S. shipping 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Jones act does not entirely bar foreign shipyards from 
participating in the U.S. shipbuilding market.  For instance, 
certain types of ships such as research vessels and other 
offshore platforms may be procured from non-U.S. yards. Foreign 
yards are allowed to do some repair and overhaul work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of a commitment made in NAFTA negotiations, 
virtually its only undertaking in the maritime sector, the U.S. 
has clarified that work involving the replacement of less than 
7.5% of the hull and superstructure of a vessel can be done 
without forfeiting its Jones act status.  Work involved in the 
replacement of more than 7.5% but less than 10% of the structure 
of a vessel can be done without forfeiting the U.S. Jones act 
status, but approval for such work must be obtained in advance. 
Having fulfilled its NAFTA commitment to clarify the rebuilding 
determination, there is no expectation at this time that this 
allowance for repair and overhaul work will be liberalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada and other trading partners have sought to 
enhance access to the American market in this sector through 
trade negotiations, the United States has refused to negotiate 
improvements.  At this time there is no viable recourse available 
to Canada against the Jones act.  Legally the United States has 
safeguarded the Jones act both in NAFTA and the WTO under the 
present terms and conditions of these agreements.  Therefore 
future trade negotiations may provide an opportunity for change, 
but even this will be difficult in light of the strong support 
the Jones act continues to enjoy in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the NAFTA and the WTO Canada protected its ability to utilize 
similar measures with respect to imports from the United States. 
An initial assessment of the imports of a Jones act type 
restriction in Canada indicates that such action is likely to 
impose significant costs on the Canadian economy while at the 
same time being unlikely to achieve any success in reducing the 
Jones act restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall I am convinced that EDC financing support has been 
competitive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have studied the issue and where international transactions 
have been lost other issues have been found to be at play.  I am 
very impressed with the progress that has been made in 
productivity and modernization improvements in Canada's yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when other countries choose to subsidize their cost of 
production, we cannot fault our suppliers for failing to submit a 
competitive bid.  We cannot expect EDC financing to compensate in 
these situations since we do not have deep enough pockets to 
fight on those terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by once again noting the high level of EDC 
support to the shipbuilding industry.  The good news is that the 
EDC is currently developing $733 million in potential 
international business on behalf of Canadian shipyards.  Members 
will understand that I cannot go into specifics because of the 
commercially confidential nature.  However, since our industry 
has made enormous strides in recent years and is competitive 
internationally, I expect that much of this business pipeline 
will become firm contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the EDC is committed to abiding by our international trade 
obligations, it will continue to aggressively monitor and pursue 
deviations by other export credit agencies under OECD guidelines. 
EDC will continue to be an important partner for the Canadian 
shipbuilding industry in a highly competitive international 
market.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of questions on the OECD and the agreement in 1981.  I 
have been led to understand that the only country abiding by the 
OECD agreement of 1981 is Canada.  None of the other countries 
are abiding by those rules and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that there was a new agreement in 1994, but it 
has not been signed by the U.S.  We have not signed it either 
because the U.S. has not signed it.  The 1981 agreement still 
applies.  I wonder why the WTO is not dealing with this issue. 
All the other countries have opted away from that agreement and 
are doing their own thing.  I ask my hon. colleague to address 
that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly respect my 
colleague's comments.  It is my understanding that in the next 
round this issue will be dealt with.  It is obviously of concern 
to us and is something that will be dealt with in the next round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  When?  Do you have a time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am afraid I do not have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I got to know my colleague across the way better during a trip 
to Taiwan, where our group visited the giant Kao-hsiung 
shipyards.  We could see that they too were experiencing certain 
difficulties, which leads me to make a point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often compare our shipbuilding facilities to those in Asia, 
but the ones in Canada, in Saint John, Lévis or elsewhere, have 
developed different areas of expertise than those of Asia, which 
were designed mainly for building ships in excess of 300,000 
tonnes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take away some of the mystery. Most ships built in 
Canada have to use the Panama canal, so our dry docks are made 
for tonnages of 90,000 or less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of Canada's shipyards has an area of specialization, for 
instance, aluminum ferries in B.C., military vessels in Halifax. 
Each, therefore, including St. Catharines and Port Weller, has 
highly specialized and highly advanced equipment.  This is not, 
therefore, where the problem lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is raised by the hon. member for Saint John.  In my 
opinion, Canada's attitude can be considered naïve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, we depend on the OECD treaties, while the 
European countries, seeing that the Americans are not signing 
them, are adopting interim measures.  These include subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also refers to the EDC.  That is all very well, 
but allow me to cite an example.  Just recently, a few weeks 
ago, two years after the arrival of the <I>Spirit of Columbus</I> 
platform and after Davie Shipbuilding was at risk of closure 
because of the lack of funding guarantees, the EDC finally came 
through.  The funding guarantees should have been available 
right from the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, therefore, certain possibilities, but the mechanisms 
for evaluation operate far too slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the hon. member's reaction to this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the difficulties 
is that unfortunately, and I pointed it out in my comments, it is 
not a level playing field.  We know subsidies are being provided 
by other countries.  That explains in part to my colleague across 
the way why some of the things he pointed out exist.  I concur 
with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that, as he mentioned, in Kao-hsiung, Taiwan, where China 
shipyards clearly have that advantage from the government.  We 
are working as a government with our partners around the world, 
particularly in the next round, to push for liberalization in the 
market and to make sure about these types of subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1997 the OECD reported internationally that there 
was a substantial overcapacity in terms of shipbuilding, which is 
estimated will be about 40% by the year 2005.  We have to work 
together.  We have to stop the kind of things that put us at a 
disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country the EDC is working very hard with our 
shipbuilding industry to make sure we are very competitive where 
we can be for contracts in the international field. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a couple of comments and questions for my hon. colleague.  I am 
left somewhat confused by his position with respect to 
shipbuilding.  Maybe he can help me work it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is saying that the EDC is actually supplying sufficient 
support to the shipbuilding industry and that the federal 
government is essentially doing the best it possibly can with 
respect to the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would a candidate who actually ran in the riding of Lévis in 
the last election in 1997—I was a candidate and I know, Mr. 
Speaker, you were a candidate in that same election—make as one 
of his fundamental planks that we needed to have a new 
revitalized shipbuilding policy if everything was fine the way it 
was? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am even more confused about a particular initiative. I know 
most Liberals sometimes get things a little mixed up or confused. 
The enter convention hall of the Liberal Party of Canada 
indicated as one of its policy initiatives that it was imperative 
the federal government take progressive steps to establish a new, 
revitalized shipbuilding policy for the country. They voted on 
that.  The actual wording of the amendment we put forward today 
is very constructive.  The entire Liberal Party of Canada 
actually voted at its congress to go ahead and do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the candidate, the Liberal Party of Canada membership, the 
premiers, the shipbuilders association and the shipowners 
association all say that something has to be done, and labour is 
on side as well, I would say the member might want to take a look 
at it again and say that not everybody is happy with the 
so-called shipbuilding policy he put forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would point out to the 
member that we have a motion before us which the Liberal Party of 
Canada voted on at its convention.  I am sure motions often get 
put forward at Conservative Party conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this debate is to inform both the opposition and 
the country as a whole what the government has been doing.  I 
have been pointing out a number of things which the government 
has been doing in response to that resolution, whether it is the 
accelerated capital cost allowance of 33.3% on Canadian built 
ships or the 25% tariff on most non-NAFTA ship imports.  The 
Export Development Corporation plays a major role.   I am sure my 
hon. colleague was listening when I said that it cannot help a 
Canadian buyer receiving offers from foreign yards to buy their 
vessels on terms supported by their national export credit 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the record.  We have a very favourable research 
and development tax credit system and domestic procurement by the 
federal government for all government shipbuilding and ship 
repair needs.  The EDC is currently assessing an unprecedented 
number of shipbuilding proposals which I mentioned in my comments 
earlier.  Obviously, if provinces in this country want to pursue 
these initiatives they are free to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out to my colleague earlier the fact that we are 
building on a policy which has been working well.  We did not say 
it was perfect, but we did say that we are doing something.  I 
want you to keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member was 
addressing his remarks to the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some days this place reminds me of Yuk 
Yuk's, the stand-up comedy headquarters.  We listen to speaker 
after speaker and sometimes we just have to shake our heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal Party of Canada votes at its national 
convention that we have a serious problem with our shipbuilding 
policy; when we have workers from coast to coast to coast, who 
know the industry, saying that we have a serious problem with our 
shipbuilding industry; when the owners and the administrators of 
the various shipyards are saying that we have a problem and when 
every expert in the country on shipbuilding is saying we have a 
problem, we probably have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have been standing in the House saying that we do not 
have a problem because a policy is in place.  I would like to 
issue a challenge to all my friends sitting across the way on the 
Liberal benches.  I would like them to jot down on a piece of 
paper what they think Canada's shipbuilding policy is.  Can 
anyone imagine the kind of hodgepodge we would come up with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have a few people saying that our R and D credit is one 
of the best in the world. That is fair enough.  Some people would 
say that some EDC programs are concerned about funding some of 
our exports. Yes, that is good.  Some members would mention the 
people who are doing very well in a particular yard or agency. 
However, what is our strategy?  What is our policy?  What is it 
that we are trying to accomplish as a country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let is look at the records of the other countries that are 
involved.  Let us look at the United States of America which has 
a policy and articulates clearly what that policy is.  All 
members of the congress, if asked, would indicate what they 
understand their national shipbuilding policy to be.  They would 
not be 100% correct, but they would at least be in the ballpark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again challenge my friends opposite to articulate today what 
our shipbuilding policy is?  The answer would be an embarrassing 
no. That is nothing new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the second largest country in the world but do we have a 
transportation policy?  No.  We are the second largest country in 
the world with water from coast to coast to coast.  We have one 
of the major reservoirs of freshwater in the world but do we have 
a water policy?  No.  We are one of the major trading nations in 
the world and, historically, always have been.  One would think 
that if there was a single country that had a shipbuilding 
strategy it would be Canada.  Do we have a shipbuilding strategy? 
No.  The answer is no, no, no. 
We do not have strategies.  We do not have policies.  We do not 
have programs and plans because we believe in the liberalization 
of the marketplace.  That is our plan.  It is called free trade. 
We are the free traders of the world.  We do not like government 
encumbrances.  We do not like tariffs.  We do not like things 
that are limiting.  We do not like the Jones Act in Canada. We 
are a free trader.  We are the global marketplace. We are the 
free marketplace and that is our mantra.  If we do not believe in 
the free market then we cannot believe in plans. We cannot have 
strategies.  The market is the strategy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No one else believes that stuff.  If there has ever been a 
collection of boy scouts, we have to be it.  Probably, if we 
looked back at the backgrounds of all of the men and women of the 
House of Commons, we must have been girl guides and boy scouts at 
one time because that is how we act.  We are really nice people 
who like to help people around the world.  We will just abandon 
all of our tariffs and everything, but nobody else will. We will 
just abandon any strategy we have or any support program from the 
government, but nobody else will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give my Liberal friend who just spoke a great deal of credit. 
He talked about Taiwan.  If there is supposed to be a free 
trading nation it is Taiwan, but it is not a free trading nation. 
It has huge subsidies in its shipbuilding sector. It has huge 
infrastructure subsidies.  It probably has subsidies in every 
single sector there is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks and the governments are all involved.  One of the 
reasons Taiwan has done so well compared to other countries is 
that it actually has a strategy.  The banks know what the 
strategy is, the investors know what the strategy is, the unions 
know what the strategy is and the managers know what the strategy 
is.  Everybody knows what the strategy is, but not so in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were quite hopeful a few years ago, particularly those 
who were knowledgeable of the shipbuilding sector, because they 
received a letter from the Prime Minister.   It said, “It is 
safe to say that most people recognize that something has to be 
done to create a much more competitive shipbuilding industry”. 
The government should now, as it should have long ago, and indeed 
as it promised to do, take steps to alleviate the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people working in a shipyard and receiving a letter like 
that from the Prime Minister would probably think that once the 
Prime Minister got into office and got a nice majority government 
behind him, they would actually see some significant changes such 
as employment in the shipbuilding sector going up and some long 
term strategies coming into place.  This would be a natural 
assumption for a voter to assume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are now, some eight years later, is there a strategy? 
No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always listen to what my Liberal colleague has to say because 
he actually has some very useful observations.  He said there is 
no level playing field when it comes to the shipbuilding 
industry.  So here we are, the level playing field enthusiasts, 
playing the game with no other level playing field enthusiast to 
play with, but we went out there and levelled it all off to the 
point where we now do not have much of a shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very frustrating debate. I want to congratulate my 
hon. friend from the Progressive Conservative Party for at least 
bringing the issue forward.  I know we have all been listening to 
the various groups that have come from the various shipbuilding 
sectors explaining what they felt ought to be done, that we ought 
to have a clear strategy in place.  They do not necessarily want 
subsidies, but they do want a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would that plan look like?  Most of the shipbuilding 
initiatives we take, we take either because we are embarrassed 
into something or it becomes so acute we have to sort of say that 
we will need to have a fleet of ferries, or we will need to build 
a whole number of frigates, or we will need to do this or that. 
It is sort of a last gasp decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice to have a plan in place where we could say to 
the various shipyards on the coast that we will start building 
this number of ships over the next 10 years, these kinds of ships 
over the next 15 years and these kinds of ships over the next 5 
years.  Every shipyard could then plan and know that some of the 
government programs would be coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Is that a five year plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I am not talking about a five year plan, 
I am talking about any kind of plan.  I would be happy to have 
some kind of commitment, some kind of plan so that those 
shipyards would know they are guaranteed this, this and this 
order in perpetuity and we could then build on top of that with 
some other supports in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what other countries do, they offer loan 
guarantees, long term amortization and so on. 
In other words, there are actual things that we could do to make 
these shipyards economically and financially viable into the 
future.  That is what we are calling on the government to do, or 
at least to consider and be open to this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Jones Act in the United States.  I suspect the Jones 
Act contravenes every free trade concept that exists.  If one 
wants to move material from port to port in the United States, 
one has to have a ship that is built in the United States with 
employees from the United States.  We understand why it does 
that.  It is good economic policy from the American's point of 
view.  It is certainly not part of any free trade, free market 
mentality.  It is good regional politics and good national 
economic development.  We do not do that.  Again, we are the boy 
scouts of the world.  We let the Americans get away with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that most of us have at one time or another toured a 
shipyard on the coast or in other areas, large and small.  I 
think it is fair to say that Canadian shipbuilders are probably 
the most creative, productive and efficient in the world.  We do 
not take a second place to anyone.  We can compete with anyone as 
long as we have a level playing field in which to compete.  I 
think the point being made today is that we do not have that. If 
we had that, we would do exceptionally well.  We need a level 
playing field for our shipbuilding sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that employment in this industry has plummeted from 
12,000 employees in 1990 to less than 5,000 last year represents 
where the issue is.  It is very clearly a declining industry at a 
time when international trade is expanding, where the need for 
ships is increasing and where a whole variety of new technology 
in shipping is becoming more relevant by the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and Canadians should be playing a role in the development 
of this technology and playing a significant leadership role in 
the development of these new shipping opportunities, but we do 
not.  One of the reasons we do not is because the government of 
the day, for some mysterious reason that escapes me, is simply 
unprepared to sit down and draft a long term strategy, a long 
term plan for this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this may sound boring.  I have said long term plan about 
20 times in my short speech.  However, can we have a successful 
life if we do not plan it?  Can we run a successful organization 
if we do not have any plan?  Can we run a successful business if 
we do not have a business plan?  The answer is always no. 
However, for some reason we believe that we can have a 
shipbuilding industry without any national plan to it. It is some 
sort of magic that we just play by ear day each day.  Obviously 
that will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could say a great deal more about this, but I will simply 
compliment a number of the comments made by others earlier. 
People have laid out the case that we need to have a strategy. 
It makes sense for a trading nation like Canada to have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, with some regret, that when we look for leadership on the 
government benches and to the Minister of Finance, who is 
certainly well known in the shipping business where he does his 
shipbuilding and where he gets crews for his ships and so on, 
they do not really provide the kind of leadership that is 
encouraging to the Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks by simply saying that I hope today's 
debate at least advances the issue and takes it forward another 
step. Maybe one day soon we will hear an announcement by the 
Minister of Industry saying that the government plans to bring 
the stakeholders together to develop, once and for all, a 
comprehensive, dynamic, national strategy for Canada's 
shipbuilding sector.

the remarks by my NDP colleague lead me to say the following. 
He is supporting a motion by the member for Saint John, who is a 
Progressive Conservative and does not usually think like a 
member of the NDP and vice versa.  On this subject, however, be 
they from the west, British Columbia, the maritimes or Quebec, 
the members of the opposition parties are in agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a rare thing to have a consensus among all the unions of 
the various regions of Canada and the members of the Canadian 
shipbuilders association, which represents the nine biggest 
shipyards in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the NDP often takes stands on the number of jobs or employee 
rights, I have a question for my colleague.  Did he notice, as I 
did, in thoroughly examining the shipyards issue, that none of 
the unions involved in shipbuilding, for the past four or five 
years, can be claimed to be protecting its collective agreements 
at all cost?  Did he see the same thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The collective agreements are now very flexible.  Workers have 
agreed to make considerable sacrifices, for example the ones in 
Lévis and the other shipyards I have visited.  Studies show that 
members of the United Auto Workers, who are in the eastern 
shipyards especially, have pointed out—and the member for 
Trois-Rivières did too—that salaries and collective agreements 
are not the issue.  In this case, the workers cannot be blamed 
for the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know whether the member shares this position, whether 
he has seen what I have in terms of the effort put out by the 
workers in Canada's shipyards. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, my hon. friend notes 
that the New Democrats are agreeing with the Progressive 
Conservatives on this motion.  I suspect that probably everybody 
in the House basically agrees with the motion.  However, because 
of the nature of our parliamentary system, the government has to 
be somewhat more hesitant to agree and opposition parties more 
enthusiastic, but that does not occur on all motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think it is fair to say that as a classic Progressive 
Conservative and as a classic social democratic we probably find 
more in common than we find in difference, unlike our Liberal 
friends across the way.  Quite frankly, I do not know what a 
Liberal is, but I will simply say that it is not a Conservative 
or a social democratic and whatever is left over can be Liberal, 
depending on the nature of the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I agree with my friends.  I would challenge my Liberal 
colleagues opposite to identify anybody who would suggest we 
should not have a shipbuilding strategy for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  We have one, but not to your liking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says that we have one.  We 
have strategies on everything.  However, I do not think anybody 
knows what this one is.  That is the problem.  I do not think we 
could articulate it.  I do not think we could sit down and say 
“This is what our strategy is”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me rephrase that.  I do not think we would find a single 
Canadian who is concerned about the Canadian shipbuilding 
industry, or certainly knowledgeable about that sector, who would 
say that we should not at this point bring together the 
appropriate stakeholders to develop a national strategy which is 
flexible and includes all of the players, including, as my friend 
suggested, the various unions.  They have indicated a willingness 
to be flexible even beyond where they have already gone and to do 
it just seems natural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my Liberal friends opposite:  Would anybody suggest 
that we should not do that?  I do not think anybody at this time 
would say that everything is okay.  In fact I have not heard 
people identify many groups in the country which would suggest 
that we have a shipbuilding policy in place, and certainly one 
that makes sense.

to thank my colleague from the NDP for his presentation and his 
full support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most disturbing to me, and I am probably the 
most non-political person who sits in the House of Commons, are 
the letters which the Minister of Industry wrote when he was the 
industry critic, replying to people who were working in the 
shipyards.  They got in touch with him when he was in opposition 
and his reply was “Please be assured that the 
shipbuilding industry is a priority for me as it is for my caucus 
colleagues”, and he said that they would be doing something about 
the situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of families are breaking up.  There were 200 people in my 
riding who were asked to go to Louisiana, U.S.A., to work.  They 
were told they were the best shipbuilders who had been 
interviewed from around the world.  I am really concerned about 
what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that our boys back home have sat down with the owners of 
our shipyard.  They have made concessions.  They will do whatever 
is necessary to bring work into the shipyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague think that we could honestly, all of us 
collectively, convince our colleagues on the government side that 
they should agree with and adopt the motion?  Then they could 
come to us and say that they agree there has to be a new 
shipbuilding policy.  They could say that they will take steps to 
bring intergovernmental affairs, finance and industry together to 
see what could be worked out.  They could take the credit for 
that.  All we want to do is put our people back to work and give 
them their dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague think we could convince them today to do 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we could convince 
our colleagues across the way to do this today.  It seems to me 
to be a very thoughtful proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps another avenue would be to strike a special task force 
of members of parliament from the various political parties and 
bring in the various standing committees on industry, finance and 
others, as she suggested, to work among ourselves toward the 
development of a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I think that is possible.  I hope as this debate concludes 
that we all agree to make this a votable motion so that we can 
support it 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend mentioned the letters the Minister of Industry 
wrote to various people in the shipbuilding industry, saying that 
if he became minister or the Liberals formed the government they 
would do something about the shipbuilding industry.  People 
misunderstood that to mean that something would be done to 
improve it, as opposed to something which would make it more 
difficult to survive.  Perhaps we need to read those letters a 
bit more carefully and recognize that the minister was saying 
they did not plan to do much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is right.  We all agree that it is time to move 
forward.  I suspect that my hon. friends opposite will be anxious 
to make this motion votable so that we can do something positive 
for the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I first want to say that this is a very important debate.  I have 
listened very closely to all hon. members today talk about this 
very important industry.  It is important that Canadians have the 
opportunity to hear the points of view of members of the House 
because, indeed, this is important and something which all 
Canadians should, and in fact do, take very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her motion the hon. member for Saint John refers to Canada's 
coastline as being the longest in the world, and I think she is 
correct.  I would also add that we have the largest bodies of 
inland water in the world and, by these measures, we are 
certainly a maritime nation.  I do not think anyone disputes 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is fair to point out that the hon. member should not 
equate this geography with a high domestic demand for 
shipbuilding.  It is simply not there.  This is a reality for 
Canada and it is something that we must face.  Therefore, for 
Canada to remain in the shipbuilding industry, we must export. 
That is the reality of the world in which we live today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an industry for Canadians in which we must succeed in 
global markets because our domestic market is simply not big 
enough.  International competitiveness is the key to all of this; 
competitiveness, moreover, that must come at a time when there is 
substantial overcapacity in shipbuilding around the world.  The 
OECD, for example, predicts that by the year 2005 the 
overcapacity will reach 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to overcapacity in this country the Canadian 
shipbuilding sector has already gone through a voluntary 
industry-led rationalization process.  That is important to note 
because it underscores its commitment to this very important 
rationalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has contributed $198 million to this 
process.  Through the reorganization and streamlining of its 
operations over the past decade the Canadian industry has been 
able to improve its productivity levels. 
That is something we can all be very proud of. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it still faces very tough competition from 
international markets.  That is the kind of world in which we 
live in the late 1990s, into the year 2000 and beyond.  The way 
to meet that competition is not to go to the government to ask 
for money from the taxpayers.  I think those days are over, as 
the opposition parties are proposing.  Rather, the solution lies 
in building competitiveness through innovation by offering 
generous research and development tax credits, for example, and 
by promoting enabling industries which give Canada-built ships 
the technological edge.  That is where the world of tomorrow is 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution, I would also submit, lies in providing support for 
export financing through the Export Development Corporation.  As 
we know, the EDC has improved the financing packages available to 
shipbuilders.  The terms of repayment, as has been noted in the 
House, have been increased from eight to twelve years and 
interest rates now match the commercial rates that we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I think the solution lies in convincing other countries 
to stop their wasteful and burdensome subsidies so that all 
nations can compete on a level playing field.  I think that is 
important too as we move into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should then negotiate down rather than subsidize up.  That is 
where the world lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is doing this.  We should be continuing 
to do so through the OECD and the World Trade Organization 
negotiations on shipbuilding.  That we will and must continue to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that some provincial governments in 
Canada have taken a different approach.  For example, the 
province of Quebec announced four incentives for shipbuilding in 
its 1996-97 budget.  I will elaborate on those four points.  The 
first is the marine construction loan guarantee program which was 
included in that budget.  The second is an income tax holiday for 
Quebec sailors assigned to international freighters.  The third 
is a refundable tax credit for shipbuilders.  The final incentive 
is a capital tax reduction for taxpayers who acquire Quebec built 
ships.  Those are significant changes and certainly we note them 
in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of the Bloc have argued that the federal tax system 
undermines some of these measures.  That is simply not the case. 
The record needs to be set straight.  The operation of the 
federal tax system does not cancel or eliminate the benefits of 
provincial programs which are designed to support particular 
industries.  In general, the federal tax system provides for tax 
deductions and credits based on the actual amount of costs 
incurred, net of any provincial assistance.  To do otherwise 
would provide tax deductions or tax credits for costs that a 
taxpayer has not incurred.  We need to note that and we need to 
understand it fully so that all Canadians know exactly what the 
case is in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphasize that the federal government has also supported 
the shipbuilding industry in Quebec.  Between 1986 and 1993, for 
example, the federal government invested almost $1.6 billion in 
Davie Industries in the form of contracts, contributions and loan 
guarantees.  As hon. members are aware, Davie Industries is now 
under the protection of the Bankruptcy Act following the 
bankruptcy of its owner, Dominion Bridge Corporation.  Davie 
Industries will receive all of the benefits to which it is 
entitled under the act.  Meanwhile, Davie Industries has a 
contract to modify the <I>Spirit of Columbus</I> oil platform for 
Brazil.  The Export Development Corporation is studying a 
proposal to supply export financing to support this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has a generous package of measures 
which, in conjunction with provincial policies and sound 
industrial practice, benefits shipbuilders.  In addition to EDC 
financing, for example, this package includes an accelerated 
capital cost allowance and very generous R and D tax credits.  It 
includes a duty on ship imports and domestic procurement for all 
government shipbuilding and ship repair needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize once again, and I know we have heard it 
throughout the course of this debate, that the government is now 
and always has been supportive of the shipbuilding industry and 
will continue to encourage its development.  That is, after all, 
what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government already provides strong support in this 
area to the industry. 
It is important to note these points. There is in the form of 
support an accelerated capital cost allowance of 33.3% for 
Canadian built ships.  There is a 25% tariff on most non-NAFTA 
ship imports.  There is domestic procurement by the federal 
government for all government shipbuilding and ship repair needs. 
There is the Export Development Corporation financing for 
commercially viable transactions.  There is a very favourable 
research and development tax credit system.  All of these things 
underscore our commitment in this very important area.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry also has access to the enabling 
element of technology partnerships Canada.  That program supports 
the private sector through investments sharing both risk and 
reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective as a government in this very important sector is 
to make sure it is competitive and therefore able to win in 
international markets without subsidies.  That is what all 
Canadians want.  As a result, our policies and programs are 
working.  The Canadian shipbuilding sector is now more 
streamlined and viable as a result, which is something we can all 
be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The global shipbuilding marketplace is restructured.  We see 
that and we know that is happening throughout the world.  Labour 
costs, aggressive pricing practices and shipowner national 
loyalty are having an impact in this important area, as is the 
growth of large integrated companies which build ships for their 
own use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government subsidies could be one way to respond to these 
changes but it would not be a good way.  Instead, Canada should 
be enabling its shipbuilding industry to focus on high 
productivity, research and development that provides value added 
components, modernization and innovative marketing.  These are 
important things that we as a government are aggressively 
pursuing, and rightfully so, on behalf of this important sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the route we as the government are taking.  I hope other 
members in the House will support that approach by voting down 
the hon. member's motion.  This is the way we need to proceed, 
the way we need to move into the 21st century.  This is the 
approach that will be in the best interests of Canada and all 
Canadians wherever they may live in this great country of ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I ask the member for Waterloo—Wellington my question, I 
would like to make the following comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here since the beginning of this debate on the 
motion by the member for Saint John.  The motion repeats word 
for word a resolution adopted at the federal Liberal Party 
convention in 1998.  I am astonished that, so far, Ontario MPs 
are the ones speaking on behalf of the Liberal government. 
There have been no representatives of the maritimes, Quebec or 
the west coast.  Yet they are the ones with shipyards in their 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing perhaps worth pointing out is that all the members 
with shipyards in their ridings are opposition members.  In my 
riding, I defended the Lévis shipyard with everything I had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the electoral map and saw that it was not very hard 
to find a Liberal in Ontario.  With one exception, all the 
members from Ontario are Liberal.  Contrary to the promise it 
made in 1993, this government did not hold a summit on the 
future of Canada's shipyards in the year following its election 
to office.  After failing to keep their promise, some well 
meaning members probably want to do well by the Prime Minister 
and they are all singing from the same song sheet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Waterloo—Wellington whether he attended the 
last convention of the federal Liberal Party, whether he recalls 
the resolution put forward by the New Brunswick Liberal 
Association, and whether he voted for or against it.  And if he 
voted in favour, will he show some consistency and vote in 
favour of the motion by the member for Saint John when it is put 
to a vote? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting that 
the member would want on the record my comments about attending 
Liberal Party conventions.  Let me say categorically through you, 
Mr. Speaker, that I am very proud to have attended all of them 
that I can remember since 1965. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the approach of the Bloc members opposite, we on this 
side of the House no matter where we live or which ridings we 
represent in Canada, speak as a government on behalf of all 
Canadians.  While the Bloc members have a parochial view of the 
country and while they want to divide as opposed to unite, we on 
this side of the House pull together in a way that is meaningful 
for Canadians no matter where they live in this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the Bloc that we over time, not only in the past, 
will continue to support this very important sector of the 
economy. Shipbuilding is absolutely crucial to Canada.  It is 
fundamental to out very values not only going back through 
history but also projecting into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government will continue to maintain that kind of 
approach in the best interests of this very important sector and 
in the best interests of Canadians wherever they may live. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to pick up on some of the comments made by my hon. friend 
and colleague from Lévis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious issue.  We need to ensure that we are 
debating the merits of the initiatives which were put forth by 
the member for Saint John and seconded by the member for 
Burin—St. George's.  All members from all parties spoke about 
this issue.  I do not think we need to overly attack the 
intentions of different members.  The member from Lévis has 
worked very hard on advancing this particular file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's comments during his speech were dead on in one 
regard.  The future success of the shipbuilding industry in 
Canada is through the export sector in addition to domestic 
repair and new ships which will be built to replace the aging 
fleets in the Great Lakes.  In order to do that, an export 
financing regime is needed to be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have had a regime entitled title IX which they 
extended in 1985.  Previous to 1985 they were not a player in 
exporting ships internationally.  Almost overnight they started 
to show up on the order book in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we should be very embarrassed about, but a 
company in Canada, Secunda Marine, had to make a financial 
decision on where it could get the best ship at the best price. 
All it came down to was the financing.  The price was competitive 
but in terms of having access to capital and lease financing that 
was cost competitive, it made a choice to have a ship built in 
the United States.  Courtesy of what?  Courtesy of title IX, the 
same financial vehicle which we are asking the government to 
address. That is my first issue.  Why do we not actually look at 
something that works and adopt it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second question for the hon. member.  The membership of 
the Liberal Party of Canada voted overwhelmingly to adopt the 
very wording of today's motion.  The previous Liberal member who 
spoke said that there are lots of motions and things that they 
vote on at conventions, inferring that it does not necessarily 
mean something is going to happen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the membership and the policy initiatives of the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.  I believe Reform 
speaks to this as well.  The membership of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada owns the principles and policies of 
our party.  It is incumbent on us to follow through with them, to 
visit them and to bring them to the House of Commons.  They are 
not something out of a feel good group therapy session for our 
party members.  That is what the Liberal Party of Canada 
obviously feels this to be if the Liberals are going to vote it 
down.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, and thank 
goodness I am not, I would have voted on issues and policy 
directives and then have come to Ottawa and voted on a particular 
initiative actually to find out that they cared less if it passed 
or not.  Are you going to actually respect the membership of your 
own party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is wrong with adopting a title XI regime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I remind hon. members 
to address each other through the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we on the government side 
and in the Liberal Party always respect the membership. We 
advance accordingly, knowing full well that they have a 
tremendous contribution to make.  Certainly that has been the way 
we have traditionally operated and it will be the way we continue 
to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to say how gratified I was to hear the 
hon. member opposite say that he agreed with my speech about the 
need for Canada to export.  I think he understands, or 
understands hopefully, that we on the government side are 
somewhat on the right track in this matter.  That is very 
important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the member for Fundy—Royal had private member's motion 
No. 214.  I will read from that motion: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government should actively develop an innovative national 
shipbuilding policy which focuses on making shipyards 
internationally competitive by providing tax incentives and 
construction financing comparable to what is being provided 
elsewhere in the world and which ensures reasonable access to 
foreign markets, particularly the United States of America— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Fundy—Royal was really saying that he has 
concern over the Jones act, the 1920 piece of legislation.  I 
find that very interesting coming from the very party that 
allowed that to go forward under the free trade agreement. It is 
outrageous, quite frankly, that they would have let that proceed 
in the manner they did and now we are stuck with that kind of 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to talk out of one side of his mouth on a 
motion back in 1997 and quite differently now is quite 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that same debate the member for Saint John went on to 
suggest improvements to export financing and loan guarantees. 
She talked about the exclusion of newly Canadian constructed 
ships from the present Revenue Canada leasing regulations.  “For 
the life of me,” she said, “I cannot understand why the 
government would not look favourably on that. It is done for rail 
cars, vans, trucks and computers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that by any other name is a subsidy.  If it 
quacks like a duck, I can guarantee it is a duck.  That is a 
subsidy, something that those people opposite say they are not in 
favour of yet that is exactly what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implication of that would be enormous.  The domino effect it 
would have on all other industries would be outrageous.  I say to 
them their unfairness will not work and it is simply something we 
in the government will not buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the amount of respect I have for the House and this 
institution, I want to make sure we have as co-operative a 
relationship as we possibly can. Having said that, I would be 
free to take a brief moment to tell the member the difference 
between a subsidy and a tax incentive.  I would be willing to 
help him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Nice try but it is 
not a point of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in this very important debate, particularly as I 
said earlier because shipbuilding is such an important component 
of the economy in my riding of West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the first European settlers arrived in West Nova, boat 
building has played an integral role in our rural society. Moving 
along the rich coastal waters of the Bay of Fundy, many of my 
constituents are involved in the fishing industry and as such 
depend on the expertise of our very experienced shipbuilding 
industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What scares me about the downturn and the lack of a shipbuilding 
policy is the potential loss of expertise of our shipbuilders. 
Not only are we losing the economic benefits of shipbuilding but 
we might lose the expertise that they have.  I would want that to 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipbuilding in West Nova grew sharply during the second world 
war as the allies worked feverishly to prepare our navy for the 
daunting task that lay ahead, which culminated with our victory 
in the Battle of the Atlantic.  West Nova has some of the finest 
shipbuilders in the world.  They have developed their expertise 
after decades of practising their trades for local fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a federal government that is indifferent to the 
shipbuilding industry.  Throughout the world we can find examples 
of countries that are supporting their own shipbuilding industry. 
We need only look to the south of us to see the United States and 
the Jones act which effectively prevents our Canadian shipyards 
from competing with U.S. shipbuilding interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues from across the way continue to refer to the past 
when NAFTA and free trade were negotiated.  It is incumbent upon 
the government to look at the future.  The Jones act has not been 
working.  It is something that really affects our ability to be 
competitive in the shipbuilding industry.  I would urge the 
government to work with the U.S. to reduce or remove the effects 
of the Jones act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the U.S. has recognized the importance of shipbuilding 
to its local economies.  Our own Liberal government, despite 
repeated promises to introduce a new shipbuilding policy both in 
1993 and in 1997, has decided to turn its back on this vital 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This industry could easily employ 10,000 employees instead of 
the fewer than 4,000 who are presently employed.  The Liberal 
government suggests that politics have nothing to do with its 
decision to turn its back on our shipbuilding industry.  I 
suppose this goes with what my colleague from Lévis said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are speaking to shipbuilding seem to be from the 
opposition.  I wonder if the government's lack of interest in a 
shipbuilding policy for eastern Canada is due to the fact that 
not many Liberals were elected there, especially in Nova Scotia 
where none were elected.  Perhaps that has an impact on the 
Liberal lack of interest in shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government is turning its back on our fishing 
industry and therefore does not see the necessity of having a 
shipbuilding policy.  Fishing is still a viable option in West 
Nova, and for that matter in most of Atlantic Canada.  We have 
some of the richest grounds in the world just off the southern 
tip of Nova Scotia.  Our lobster industry is by far the most 
lucrative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a need for shipbuilding services in our area. 
However, if the government continues to ignore the plight of 
those involved in the industry, our small family owned 
shipbuilding operations will not be able to compete with foreign 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the family boat building operations in my riding 
such as A. F. Theriault and Sons. on Meteghan River, Camille 
D'eon's boat building in Middle West Pubnico and Doucette's boat 
building in Cape Ste. Mary's.  What about David LeBlanc in 
Mavilette and Cape Ste. Mary's or Paul and Alain Pothier in St. 
Martin?  These are all small family run operations that have 
survived over the years because they have mastered their craft to 
a point where they have developed great reputations from within 
the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party wants partisanship to be taken out of this 
discussion so that all parties in the House can work toward 
developing a policy for shipbuilding that will help promote and 
put Canada on a level playing field so that we can compete with 
other countries that build ships.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The shipbuilding industry has proposed four measures which would 
immediately stimulate the shipbuilding industry.  They include 
changes to leasing regulations, a refundable tax credit, and a 
pro-Canada provision of levelling the playing field, as I said 
earlier, without competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With proper support from our federal government some of the 
family operations could legitimately expand their operations, 
creating countless numbers of new jobs for our struggling 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have referred a lot to my riding of West Nova but a new 
shipbuilding policy is a pan-Canadian issue.  Shipyards are 
located across Canada in B.C., Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian shipyards have the capacity to directly employ over 
10,000 Canadians.  The economic benefits of $100 million worth of 
new shipbuilding business will create over 1,500 jobs in 
shipbuilding and allied businesses and generate over $23 million 
of income for the federal treasury.  It is for these reasons that 
we believe there should be a comprehensive shipbuilding policy in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The P.C. Party of Canada wants the government to work in a 
non-partisan way with all parties of the House toward developing 
a comprehensive shipbuilding policy which will help promote a 
very important industry in our Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House to support this very 
important endeavour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since these are probably the last remarks in today's debate, I 
must thank the member for Saint John and the Progressive 
Conservative Party for raising this issue on opposition day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is broad, but at the same time very clever; it is 
unifying in that it brings together all the opposition parties, 
but also picks up the text of a resolution adopted by the 
Liberal Party at its convention, and introduced by the Maritimes 
Liberal Association. I find this very clever, because it forces 
Liberal members to ask themselves a very serious question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be two different concepts of democracy. 
In a dictatorship, people are told “Do as you are told and keep 
quiet. You do not have the right to speak up”. A modern version 
of this, the Liberal version, highlights the role of the 
grassroots members at a convention, but it means nothing because 
their voice is ignored. Would the member agree? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague touched on 
something very important.  Before I answer his question I would 
like to say that I know all members of the opposition are in 
support of the motion.  It is really ironic when the motion word 
for word is a motion that was drafted and supported by the 
Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, we do not need a vote because we already know that 
it is unanimous unless the Liberals choose to make it otherwise. 
If they do that then they are neglecting their responsibility 
toward people in the fishing and the shipbuilding industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 6.25 p.m. 
it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings.  Pursuant to order 
made earlier today, all questions on the motion are deemed put 
and a recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until 
Wednesday, May 5, 1999, at the expiry of the time provided for 
Government Orders.

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
February 19, 1999, I expressed concern in the House that the 
Minister of National Defence indicated during the previously held 
take note debate on Kosovo that he did not know the details 
concerning the involvement of Canadian troops in a peacekeeping 
mission.  The minister in fact said that these details would be 
worked out after the signing of a peace agreement.  Then a formal 
request would be made by NATO, and Canada would have two weeks to 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister at that time if he would commit to bringing 
the detailed request before parliament for a debate and a vote so 
that he might respond to the request with the full and open 
backing of Canadians through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made it very clear in his answer, and the 
government has made it very clear since then, that there will be 
no vote on that issue.  The minister indicated that the 
government had had a debate and would make a final decision 
expeditiously as matters unfolded.  The minister said they would 
do so and keep everybody fully informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the keynote of the day.  There would be no vote but 
everybody would be kept fully informed.  We can see as matters 
have evolved that there has been no vote and that about 800 
troops have since been committed.  They are on standby for 
whatever NATO may deem to request of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that with no vote Canada has joined the largest 
allied military assault in Europe since World War II.  The phrase 
“sentence first and verdict afterwards” is from the twisted 
world of <I>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</I> and it seems the 
same twisted approach is being used by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has seen fit to hold votes on many other pieces 
of business, on legislation that it has introduced in parliament 
updating terminology related to the Royal Canadian Mint, 
Teleglobe Canada legislation, establishing parks, amending the 
wheat board act, and even legislating workers back to work.  Yet 
the government does not think that Canadians deserve to have 
their elected representatives vote on Canada's participation in 
the bloody slaughter of innocents in Yugoslavia and Canada's 
participation in the devastation of an economy and infrastructure 
including water, sewage, roads and communications which will take 
untold generations to rebuild. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government places expediency before democracy.  The Liberal 
government has acted as if the Liberal Party is at war and not 
the country of Canada, which is a very scary conclusion.  The 
government suggests that it is at war.  We note that the term war 
is quite often avoided and we talk about a conflict.  In reality 
we have to call it what it is.  The government is at war for 
democratic reasons, the government says, but it has overridden 
democracy in favour of one party rule to pursue its goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon what moral authority does the government see fit to send 
our country to war without a vote?  The vote is the key issue. It 
is very important.  When the Prime Minister was in opposition he 
demanded a vote on Canada's participation in the gulf war of 
1991.  Yet now he has chosen to hide from democracy in this 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was campaigning many people indicated their very serious 
concerns about government.  They were quite pessimistic about the 
political process, to the point that many had given up their 
right to vote.  I encouraged people that the vote is the keystone 
of our democracy.  It is a key point in our democracy.  We must 
not at any cost give up the right to vote.  I urge all members to 
consider seriously that in this issue the vote is the important 
issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, may I say to 
the member in starting that the opposition parties have the 
opportunity every time they have an opposition day to bring forth 
a vote if that is what they are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that Canadian participation in NATO 
operations is important, not simply because we are members of the 
alliance but because of the moral issues at stake.  Members of 
the Canadians forces deserve our recognition and support for the 
important task they have taken up on behalf of all Canadians. 
Parliament has played an important role in our Kosovo 
deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making its decisions respecting Canada's involvement in 
Kosovo, the government recognizes the importance of the views of 
parliamentarians on this crucial issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has debated the situation in Kosovo on four different 
occasions:  first on October 7, 1998, when all parties agreed 
that Canada should join our NATO allies in air operations if they 
proved necessary; second on February 17, 1999, when there was 
hope that a peace agreement would be signed and our involvement 
would consist of a peacekeeping force; third on April 12, 1999, 
when the House once again discussed events in Kosovo and when all 
parties supported Canada's decision to participate in NATO-led 
air operations; and fourth on April 19, 1999, when the House 
debated the opposition day motion calling for a debate and vote 
on any deployment of ground troops for military or peacekeeping 
operations in the Balkans.  That motion was defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice-weekly briefings on Kosovo are being given to joint 
meetings of the Standing Committees on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and National Defence and Veterans Affairs. 
Moreover, ministers and officials have participated in daily 
technical briefings which have been well attended by the public 
and the press.  Should the nature of our involvement in Kosovo 
change, the government has made a firm commitment to consult 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated, this thankfully 
remains a hypothetical question.  If the situation changes he 
will address the question on votes at that time.  However, for 
the time being questions about voting on ground troops is 
irrelevant.  Our efforts should be directed toward resolving this 
tragic dispute, not debating hypothetical questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think this is very relevant to the debate that has just taken 
place and, therefore, I would like to review on the record some 
comments that were made by President Václav Havel, the President 
of the Czech Republic, on April 29. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that if it is possible to say about war that it is 
ethical, or that it is fought for ethical reasons, it is true of 
this war.  He was referring to the Kosovo war.  He said that 
Kosovo has no oil fields whose output might perhaps attract 
somebody's interest, no member country of the alliance has any 
territorial claims there, and Milosevic is not threatening either 
the territorial integrity or any other integrity of any NATO 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that, nevertheless, the alliance is fighting. 
It is fighting in the name of human interest for the fate of 
other human beings.  It is fighting because decent people cannot 
sit back and watch the systematic, state directed massacre of 
other people.  Decent people simply cannot tolerate this and 
cannot fail to come to the rescue, if a rescue action is within 
their power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concluded by saying that this war gives human rights 
precedence over the rights of states.  The federal republic of 
Yugoslavia has been attacked without a direct UN mandate for the 
alliance's action, but the alliance has not acted out of licence, 
aggressiveness or disrespect for international law.  On the 
contrary, it has acted out of respect for the law and that law 
ranks higher than the protection of the sovereignty of states. 
It has acted out of respect for the rights of humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is the answer to the member's question about 
whether the vote is important or whether human rights are 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 27, two days earlier, I had the opportunity to ask the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration a question which was 
prompted by the events that have transpired in Kosovo over all 
these many weeks which had to do with refugees.  I asked the 
minister the question because as Canadians we collectively share 
concern about the plight of the refugees in Kosovo and because 
many members of parliament have been approached by constituents 
who have family members in that area who are in harm's way.  The 
question to the minister was basically:  What are the 
government's efforts with regard to these refugees, particularly 
those who have family members already living in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responded by saying that there had already been, I 
believe, 120 applications for sponsorship and that that they 
covered as many as 700 people.  She was also pleased to announce, 
and I think the House was very delighted to hear, that as of 
April 27 the first refugees were arriving in Canada, some in my 
riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration please update us on the rapidly evolving 
developments with regard to refugees, those who are coming here 
under sponsorship and those who we are bringing to Canada 
possibly on a temporary basis as opposed to a long term basis?  I 
think Canadians would like to be updated on that matter.

by saying to my friend that back in 1956 there was a similar 
debate taking place and it was about Hungarian refugees.  I was 
one of the refugees who ended up coming to this country in 1957. 
So it does have a great deal of personal resonance with me.

the present situation.  I am happy to be able to tell the hon.

Canada to be reunited with their families. Others will be 
arriving over the next few weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, under a special system we have put in place to fast 
track the processing of family reunification applications, we 
have received 158 applications from Canadians or Canadian 
residents with relatives over there.   Those applications involve 
974 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIC has put the following system in place to handle the 
applications to bring over Kosovar refugees who have relatives in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relative identification form, RIF, has been developed by 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada to assist the department in 
tracking and monitoring cases. It will also help to identify 
relatives of Canadian residents who may be eligible for

are in Macedonia or Albania, they must call the Kosovo hotline at 
1-888-410-0009, toll free, to register their request.  The 
hotline will either complete the RIF on the caller's behalf or 
provide the caller with the RIF to complete themselves and they 
must then fax it to the hot fax at 1-877-883-8834. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information gathered from the RIFs will be forwarded to various 
organizations by CIC to assist in the processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have five visa officers in Macedonia and four in 
Albania.  Once the refugees have been located, CIC visa officers 
will interview them and if the refugees wish, they will be fast 
tracked into Canada.

family members have been located. This timeframe may vary 
depending on various formalities and movement restrictions 
imposed by local authorities.
