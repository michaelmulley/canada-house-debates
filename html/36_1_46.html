</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-218, an act to amend the Divorce Act (marriage counselling 
required before divorce granted), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is my honour to rise in the House of 
Commons today to speak about the Canadian family in regard to 
Bill C-218, an act to require mandatory counselling prior to 
granting a divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing feeling that the Canadian family is in crisis 
and that the enormous consequences affect each and every one of 
us on a daily basis.  The conflict between individual rights and 
the collective interests of society has created a menacing 
minefield of life in which our children must grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many we have become a no fault society which not only 
tolerates irresponsibility, but often condones it by resisting 
preventive measures which may be viewed as encroaching on 
individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where rights exist, are there not also responsibilities?  Should 
there not be consequences if we fail or do wrong?  Is it 
acceptable to just continue to rationalize our problems by 
blaming it on low self-esteem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians enjoy one of the most envied standards of living in 
the world, however, we cannot ignore the fact that success does 
not come without social pressures which may undermine the very 
foundations of that success, which include the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these statements may provoke defensive reactions, we must 
resist simple, dismissive rationalizations to complex issues.  We 
must recognize and set aside our personal biases.  We must be 
open and responsive to the evidence of objective assessment.  We 
must not ignore the fundamental truth that healthy children make 
strong families and, ultimately, a strong country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one definition of family which all of us have in 
common.  It is a child with their biological mother and father. 
It is a unique relationship which has no substitute and in that 
context family is a fact, not an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society exists and sustains itself because of family.  As 
such, any threat to the security of the family unit must also be 
considered as a serious threat to our social well-being.  As 
members of Parliament we encounter a broad range of issues, many 
of which are relatively straightforward in terms of their 
implications.  Child poverty is an example.  Invariably, however, 
we find that resolving these implications are far more complex 
when one considers all the relevant factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, we often find that a comprehensive solution with a 
multiplicity of preventive and remedial approaches is necessary. 
We also find that the root causes of problems are not absolute, 
but rather they present risk factors affecting the occurrence of 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a poor family can have a healthy, well adjusted 
child.  Therefore, although poverty may not necessarily cause 
poor outcomes of children, the probability is higher than for 
well-off Canadians.  As legislators we must therefore assess the 
probabilities and likelihoods of problems occurring, analyse the 
complexity of contributing factors and develop initiatives with 
an appropriate balance between prevention and cure.  This 
strategy is particularly relevant in family issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let's consider some of the problems facing the Canadian family. 
Child poverty continues to be a major challenge which is 
certainly complex.  The starting point, I believe, should be to 
admit that the term “child poverty” is a political term 
intended to evoke sympathetic feelings.  The fact is that child 
poverty is family poverty and therefore solutions must 
necessarily be delivered through the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lone parent families represent only 14.5% of all families in 
Canada but account for 46% of all children living in poverty.  In 
most of those instances, the poverty was manufactured or created 
by the family breakdown.  Two can live cheaper than one, but the 
financial consequences of undoing that union are almost always 
devastating to all concerned.  In contrast, only 11.5% of 
children in two-parent families live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The growing incidence of child abuse, both physical and mental, 
also continues to be of serious concern.  If a child is hungry, 
functionally illiterate, depressed, aggressive or unloved, is 
that not the result of parental abuse?  The majority of such 
abuse occurs in dysfunctional or broken families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth crime has angered many Canadians because of the escalating 
seriousness of the kinds of offences.  Tougher penalties are 
often called for, but we cannot ignore the fact that 70% of young 
offenders come from broken homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physical, mental and social health outcomes of children have 
also become an emerging issue.  Research on brain development in 
the formative years has discovered that the foundations for 
rational thinking, problem solving and general reasoning are all 
established by age one.  It is generally accepted that the 
quality of parenting during the first three years of infancy is 
the most critical period in which you influence the long-term 
outcome of children.  Since the largest percentage of family 
breakdowns occurs in the first five years, this fact represents a 
serious threat to childhood outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Teen suicide has increased tenfold in the past decade and the 
tragic reality is that we all must share the blame.  Seventy-five 
percent of teens who commit suicide come from broken homes.  The 
same can be said about drug, alcohol and substance abuse by our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To drop out of high school is to opt out of a chance for a 
healthy, secure future.  Our current drop-out rate in Canada is 
approximately 30%.  Drop-outs have an unemployment rate in excess 
of 25% and represent over 50% of youth unemployment.  High school 
drop-outs are Canada's poor in waiting and over 70% of them come 
from broken families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the family breakdown with children, a whole host of 
aggravating problems arise, including custody support and 
visitation disputes.  Since over 85% of court rulings award 
custody to the mother, defaults on support payments are 
devastating to women and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another serious problem flowing from the family breakdown is the 
high incidence of domestic abuse and homicide.  When the 
relationship breaks down, it is not over.  The fighting often 
continues for years.  According to justice department statistics, 
17% of homicides in Canada are divorced persons and yet divorced 
persons only represent 5.2% of our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, when the family breaks down, bad things can and 
do happen. 
It reflects a social poverty, an erosion of values which also 
contributes to the widening gap between rich and poor.  The me 
first social experiment has failed miserably and children are the 
forgotten victims like so much road kill.  Not all children of 
divorce are doomed but in about every way we have to measure such 
things, children are the victims of the divorce.  They are the 
ones that are hurt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce may be common but the consequences thereof are not.  The 
findings of recent studies are very disturbing.  Here are some 
observations.  Even when there is general agreement, divorce is 
one of the most stressful events of life that hurts not only the 
parents and children but also the grandparents, other relatives, 
friends, neighbours and co-workers.  Canada has one of the 
highest divorce rates in the world, having increased tenfold 
since the mid-1960s to over 75,000 per year.  Forty-five per cent 
of children will see their parents divorced before those children 
reach their 18th birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Divorce trials can cost over $100,000 and the court system has 
literally become a forum for revenge.  One in four children do 
not live at home with their biological parents.  Children of 
divorce are three times more likely to experience both poverty 
and insecurity.  Forty-one per cent of children of lone parent 
families experience some form of conduct disorder such as 
anxiety, depression or aggressive behaviour.  Children in lone 
parent families are also twice as likely to repeat a grade or 
have other problems in school.  About 25% of divorces end up in 
custody disputes.  Children of broken families account for 70% of 
young offenders, 75% of teen suicides and 80% of adolescents in 
psychiatric care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-218 calls for mandatory counselling prior to legal 
granting of a divorce.  For many it provokes the snap reaction 
coined by Justice Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau in 1967 that 
the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation.  If the 
issue solely impacts mutually consenting parties with no 
consequential impacts on others, then I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, consider the issue of sexual orientation.  The state 
respects the rights of individuals to make choices.  When it 
became clear that such choices had become the primary cause of a 
disease without a cure, which would result in a slow and painful 
death, government had to act.  The risk of long term suffering 
and death was so certain it was like playing Russian roulette 
with a bullet in virtually every chamber.  The long term cost to 
our health care system had also reached hundreds of millions 
dollars and it is growing expeditiously.  That is why we now have 
so many governments sponsored programs, to caution those at risk, 
to conduct research to find a cure, to help those who are dying 
without hope and to safeguard others from contracting the 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undeniably these problems are rooted in the bedrooms of the 
nation.  Who in this place would deny that the government is 
intervening.  Who would deny that it is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the foregoing the criteria for action by government 
should be two reasons.  One, there is reason to believe that the 
impacts affect others beyond the principal parties.  Second, that 
there is a high risk or threat to the lives, the health or the 
fiscal and social well-being of Canadians.  In my view, the issue 
of family breakdown clearly meets the criteria for government 
action.  It is also a complex problem which requires a broad 
range of approaches, including both preventative and remedial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-218 is not to promote reconciliation.  I 
repeat, not to promote reconciliation, although that is always an 
option available to the couples.  The purpose is first to ensure 
that where children are involved a viable parenting plan is in 
place.  Second, it is to ensure that post-breakup acrimony is 
mitigated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me elaborate.  There is little disagreement that where 
children are involved the real victims of family breakdown are 
those children.  In many respects it can be considered a form of 
child abuse in that the child is deprived of a stable, loving 
family home with both mother and father.  The priority therefore 
should be to mitigate the negative impacts of breakdown.  A 
viable parenting plan is vital.  Issues to be resolved include 
custody arrangements, child support, visitation rights and other 
financial settlement issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a contested divorce both parents are represented by lawyers. 
If we accept that children are the true victims of family 
breakdown, then who is representing the interests of the 
children?  Counselling may provide that vital intervention that 
will ensure that the interests of the children come first. Some 
may suggest that counselling at a time of divorce is too late and 
that approaches such as premarriage programs would be more 
appropriate.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that most marriages face serious problems 
sooner or later.  Premarriage counselling is a helpful start but 
you have to continue to work on the relationship virtually every 
day.  When we consider that almost 70% of divorced persons 
remarry within five years, counselling will also play a useful 
role in understanding what happened and why so that future 
relationships will benefit from that experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-218 was given first reading, Michael Harris of the 
<I>Sun</I> newspaper chain wrote a story which ridiculed the bill, 
decrying when it's over, it's over.  In reality however one set 
of problems is replaced by another and the fighting can go on for 
years.  The post breakup acrimony not only can lead to domestic 
violence but the negative impact on children can be very damaging 
and long lasting. Research has shown that children can be so 
emotionally damaged by their parents' behaviour that they may 
have difficulty making commitments in forming families 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In focusing on divorce, Bill C-218 deals with a small part of 
the issue of family breakdown.  According to Statistics Canada 
there are over one million common law relationships in Canada. 
Since they account for 60% of domestic violence, break down 50% 
more than married couples and only last an average of five years, 
the problem obviously is much larger and more complex than can be 
addressed by this legislation alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over two years the city of Edmonton has run a parenting 
after divorce program which provides court ordered mandatory 
counselling.  The results have been so positive that the province 
of Alberta is considering province wide implementation. As well 
there are 14 U.S. states with similar programs and similar 
results.  The participants regularly admit that they did not 
realize how much they were hurting their children.  Marriage 
mentoring, covenant marriages and mediation sessions are also 
emerging programs motivated by similar concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, today I am calling on the government, members of 
Parliament and all Canadians to take action. Specifically I ask 
the Prime Minister and the cabinet to act on the recommendations 
of the National Forum on Health by developing programs and 
policies which are dedicated to protecting and investing in 
children to strengthen the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I am calling on all hon. members of Parliament to inform 
themselves about the issues and to develop and promote their own 
family related initiatives or legislation to bring national 
attention to the risks facing the Canadian family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I call on all Canadians to invest in the well-being of 
our children to work harder on strengthening the Canadian family. 
Since strong families make a strong country, we all have a vital 
role to play.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would

this bill forward as well as for many of the comments he has put 
on the record today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that this bill is not a votable bill.  I think 
there is a feeling and a thought moving through all caucuses in 
this House that all private members' bills ought to be votable 
bills so that we not only hear the concerns of private members as 
expressed through their bills but also that we have a right to 
vote and represent the views and concerns of our constituents on 
these important matters brought forward by private members. 
Those are my opening comments on this bill that the hon. member 
has brought forward. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at the bill and am wondering about its 
constitutionality and its cost.  The greatest pressure placed on 
any family is economic pressure.  If there are not enough dollars 
to go around, it will weaken the other dynamics within a family 
and lead to frustration, irritation, confrontation and eventual 
disintegration of those emotions and feelings that keep a family 
together.  In looking at how we can strengthen the family let us 
begin there first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government wants to strengthen the family, let us look 
at how we can do it economically.  When 50¢ of every dollar that 
the mother or father brings home goes to taxes in one way or 
another, that is an enormous attack on the economic viability of 
that family. What can we do in that regard?  After we take money 
from them, do we direct money back to those who are experiencing 
difficulty, those living in poverty or below what we call the 
poverty line? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a disaster in this country in this particular area.  Not 
only are we paying taxes at the highest rate in this country's 
history, but we have also borrowed and spent $600 billion.  Yet 
all of these children are living in poverty. The hon. member is 
absolutely correct when he states that we cannot talk about 
children living in poverty.  It is families and communities that 
are living in poverty.  We must address that and look at the 
causes of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the single greatest contributing factors to family 
breakdown is when there is not enough money to meet the family's 
requirements at the end of each month, to pay the phone bill, the 
power bill and perhaps the mortgage.  This is what causes the 
stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as poverty is concerned, I think many members of my age, 
and I go back quite a ways, were born in poverty compared to what 
we have today.  I was born in a log house with a sod roof without 
the benefit of a doctor or a nurse.  Three of my eight brothers 
were also born under those conditions.  We lived in poverty.  We 
did not have power.  We had an outside sewer system, if I can 
call it that.  We did not have central heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago I asked my mother, who is still living in 
Saskatoon, what she saw as the greatest advancement over the 
years.  She thought for a moment and said central heating.  I 
asked her why she would say that because I thought it would be 
something else.  She said, “You do not know what it was like to 
wake up in the middle of the night in a house frozen solid with 
three babies in diapers and having to light a fire to heat the 
frozen milk and to change diapers under those conditions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How we survived I really do not know. Do you want to talk about 
poverty?  You bet we lived in poverty but we made it.   Every one 
of my brothers and I made it.  Why?  Because of the love we had 
from our mother and father even under those conditions. We were 
looked after.  They made great sacrifices and we knew they cared 
for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a justice system hanging on the wall. We knew when we did 
wrong but it never affected our sense of justice.  Later we knew 
that justice system hanging on the wall was there because it was 
an expression of dad's love for his children.  He wanted us to 
stay away from the lake that had just frozen over because he did 
not want us to fall through. 
He did not want us playing with matches.  He did not want us 
doing all these things that could place our lives at risk.  We 
knew that and that was an inherent feeling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes we had great difficulty.  But I do know this.  My father 
never paid personal income tax until I was 15 or 16 years old.  I 
remember the first time I saw him sitting at a table struggling 
to fill out the new form called the personal income tax. When my 
father took his grain or his cattle to market, he kept 100% of 
that dollar he brought home and he put that into the family.  It 
kept us going.  He was able to meet the economic requirements of 
our family to a degree, although it was certainly nothing like we 
enjoy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember seeing a television program where a single mother 
living below what they call the poverty line was being 
interviewed.  I remember the television program showing the 
conveniences they had.  There was central heating.  There was 
television.  There was a fridge.  There were electric lights. If 
we had that back in my day, we would have thought we were living 
in heaven.  To turn on a coloured television set, to have central 
heating when we got up in the middle of the night and to go to an 
indoor bathroom and not freeze and not have to get dressed to do 
so would have been a wonderful thing for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marital breakdown is a problem and I commend my colleague 
opposite for bringing this bill forward and at least focusing the 
attention of members of this House upon this very serious matter. 
Let us look at the cause of marital breakdown. I say the number 
one cause is actions by government at all three levels.  That is 
what weakens the economic stability of the family.  When the 
money runs out before the end of the month or before the next 
paycheque, it is a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were getting letters from the letter deliverers and their 
families asking us to do whatever we could to end the postal 
strike.  Why?  Because they went two weeks without a paycheque. 
How were they going to meet their commitments at the end of the 
month just before Christmas? When we see these kinds of 
initiatives by people in responsible positions further attacking 
and weakening the economic stability of the family, certainly we 
have reasons to look at what is happening along with the effect 
of what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marital breakdown in this country can be attributed to some of 
the things that we as responsible people do, whether it is within 
this House, within a union, or wherever it might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in Edmonton for goodness sake that the union and 
management could not get together and save 800 jobs. What 
happened?  They went on strike and for reasons that are not all 
that clear, they have lost their jobs because the company shut 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing this issue forward.  I 
wish as I stated earlier that this were a votable matter so that 
we as elected representatives of the people could express our 
support for this bill by way of a vote. I would like it to go 
before committee and have it examined in other areas. The area of 
counselling, who will pay for that? Will the family have to pay 
for that?  It will be another drain on the economic resources of 
the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all those questions I would like answered about the 
bill but regardless, I still feel that this is an initiative that 
is to be commended. It is directed at a very important area of 
society, that is, what is happening to our families, and how we 
can maintain the strength of the family and give our children the 
greatest opportunity to receive love from a mother and a father 
and keep that family together so that we have strong, healthy, 
self-reliant children growing into adulthood.

requirement for marriage counselling before a divorce is granted, 
for the purpose of exploring the possibility of reconciliation.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I find it hard to speak out against virtue, 
but I shall come back to that in greater detail in a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with a historical overview of the Divorce Act. 
It is not all that long ago that women could get a divorce if they 
could prove their husbands had committed incestuous adultery, rape, 
sodomy, bestiality, bigamy or adultery combined with cruelty or 
abandonment of the marital home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only in 1968, with the coming of the Divorce Act, were men and 
women both enabled to cite these reasons for divorce. 
The act still had its shortcomings, however.  It was therefore 
improved in 1985 in order to reflect the recommendations of the Law 
Reform Commission of Canada's 1976 report on family law.  The 1985 
Divorce Act changed the recognized grounds to include breakdown of 
a marriage.  This new measure made the procedure simpler by 
reducing the hostility with which the traditional adversarial 
procedure was charged.  It also made it easier to find more 
constructive solutions to the differences that arise at the time of 
a divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one can see, the Divorce Act has not stopped adjusting to 
the new realities of society, but there is always room for 
improvement or, better still, for transfer of powers to the 
provinces.  Nevertheless, a divorce is never an easy thing on the 
human level.  When people separate, a part of their lives goes up 
in smoke. 
So, legal proceedings must be as effective as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us knows someone who is divorced, and the difference 
between someone who has gone through a bitter divorce and someone 
who has reached an amicable settlement is palpable.  Then there are 
the effects on the immediate family, especially on the children, 
who are the main victims of a difficult divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a spectacular leap in the 1980s, the divorce rate has 
become relatively stable in the 1990s.  The changes in 1985 
permitting the failure of the marriage to be the sole grounds for 
divorce prompted the spectacular leap, which led, in turn, to an 
increase in the number of remarriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest report by Statistics Canada indicates that the 
divorce rate has remained relatively stable in the 1990s. 
Some find reassurance in the fact that, even though the risk of 
divorce is higher since the 1970s, two marriages out of three 
continue until the death of one of the spouses.  This is reassuring 
nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987, 96,200 divorces were granted.  In 1995, there were 
only 77,636.  According to Statistics Canada, one marriage in 100 
ended in 1995.  It expects that 31 per cent of couples married in 
1991 will divorce.  If marriage counselling is really to be 
introduced, there is no point waiting for divorce proceedings to do 
something.  Data indicate that the risk of divorce rises quickly in 
the first years of the marriage reaching its peak in the fifth 
year.  In 1990, nearly four couples in ten divorced shortly after 
their fifth anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With figures like these, our concern should be to have good divorce 
legislation. In this respect, according to Professor Julien Payne, good 
divorce legislation must achieve three main goals: first, to facilitate 
the dissolution of marriages irredeemably doomed to failure by reducing 
to a minimum the pain, humiliation and hardship; second, to promote a 
fair distribution of the financial consequences of marriage breakdown; 
and finally, to ensure that reasonable provisions are made for the 
education of the children of the divorcing parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family law is a jurisdiction that is shared between the provinces 
and the federal government. Under the Constitution Act, 1867, while the 
federal Parliament is responsible for divorce matters, legislative 
powers regarding property and civil rights are assigned to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly put, this means that the separation of non-married couples 
is a matter of provincial legislation, and divorce a matter of federal 
legislation. 
How ridiculous. Why accept such overlap of jurisdictions when the entire 
divorce procedure could be transferred to the provinces? The truth is 
that the federal government simply has no place in that area of 
responsibility. One could argue that, under subsection 92(13) concerning 
property and civil rights, the provinces are the ones that should have 
jurisdiction in the area of divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Quebec is already prepared to take on this responsibility. 
An entire section of the Civil Code is devoted to this subject but it 
has not been implemented simply because we do not yet have jurisdiction. 
But I am an optimist and I hope that the day will come when we do and 
when the federal government will finally withdraw from this area.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill brings me to the whole issue of family law and, more 
particularly, family mediation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has a comprehensive policy on free family mediation, and I 
think the sponsor of this bill was inspired by it. However, our province 
provides for much more than mere marriage counselling. In fact, members 
of this House must recognize that Quebec has become an expert on family 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada wants to rely on our expertise, fine. It can only benefit 
the rest of the country if the federal government adopts some of our 
policies. 
I simply want to point out that, if the federal government is going to 
adopt Quebec's ideas on separation and apply them to divorce, it should 
instead transfer the responsibility for divorce to the provinces and 
make it an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is high time Ottawa recognized Quebec's expertise 
in family law and changed its approach accordingly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak about Bill C-218 which would amend the Divorce 
Act to require spouses to attend marriage counselling before 
divorce can be granted. It would provide that prior to granting a 
divorce the court must satisfy itself that the spouses in the 
proceedings have been advised by a prescribed marriage counsellor 
with a view to assist them to achieve a reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will examine more closely the intent and effect of this 
proposed bill.  There is a lot of concern expressed these days 
about the institution of marriage and the rising divorce rate. 
There is no doubt that rapid social change in recent decades has 
had an impact on family life.  The Vanier Institute has reported 
that the marriage rate has declined by 39% in Canada over the 
last 25 years.  Statistics also indicate that in 1995 the overall 
divorce rate for Canada was 262 divorces per 100,000 population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians must ask this important question.  What should 
divorce law and procedure seek to do to respond to these new 
realities?  As far as possible the law should support the 
institution of marriage and require divorcing couples to meet 
their responsibilities and obligations. Couples should be urged 
to consider carefully the consequences and implications of ending 
their marriage.  However, there must be mechanisms to enable 
people who are unhappily married to reorganize their legal 
obligations when the marriage breaks down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some very basic questions must be asked about this bill.  The 
first is whether mandatory marriage counselling is something the 
Government of Canada should be imposing on all couples who file 
for divorce.  There are some implications associated with 
mandatory legal requirements.  There is a danger these 
requirements can become a real barrier to access to the legal 
system.  Reconciliation counselling is to be a requirement 
imposed on everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a corresponding obligation to have 
counselling services and programs in place at the local level to 
operationalize this provision.  This would be a very costly 
obligation that would require the support and co-operation of all 
the provinces and territories to ensure that affordable services 
would be available nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that many people agree marriage counselling can be a 
good thing.  It enables couples to work together to understand 
and preserve their relationship.  It can help couples to look at 
their problems and to explore whether and how these problems can 
be resolved.   For some couples marriage counselling may be 
useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, like most types of counselling, its usefulness will be 
directly related to the willingness of the parties involved to 
participate in the process.  To be successful both parties have 
to enter the counselling in good faith.  I am not aware of any 
research that proves the effectiveness of counselling services in 
the reduction of the divorce rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Practically I must seriously question how many divorces will be 
prevented by forcing parties to counselling after one or both of 
them has taken the serious step of deciding to commence the 
divorce process.  It is important to note there are already 
references to reconciliation in the Divorce Act.  Section 9(1) 
imposes specific duties on every barrister, solicitor, lawyer or 
advocate who undertakes to act on behalf of a spouse in a divorce 
proceeding.  These duties include drawing to the attention of 
their clients the provisions of the act that have as their object 
the reconciliation of spouses.  They must discuss with their 
clients the possibility of reconciliation and they must inform 
their clients about marriage counselling or guidance facilities 
that may be able to assist them in achieving a reconciliation.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a duty imposed on all legal advisers, unless the 
circumstances of the case are of such a nature that it would 
clearly not be appropriate to do so.  In other words, couples who 
go to a lawyer to get a divorce are already made aware of 
reconciliation counselling and urged to make use of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory marriage counselling to reconcile couples who already 
have decided to divorce is not the right approach.  It is also 
not the only approach available.  In my view, the key concern of 
the government and the law should be to assist the children. 
Everyone would agree that by far the most serious impact of 
divorce is the effect it has on children.  Research suggests that 
it is not the divorce itself which results in the negative 
consequences to the children but rather the parental conflict, 
the bitterness and hostility of the parents which negatively 
impacts on children's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the better approach would be to realistically 
acknowledge that couples should be allowed to end the 
relationship if they reach the point where it is not sensible to 
continue.  Rather than imposing marriage reconciliation attempts, 
the government's focus should be on supporting parenting 
education programs.  These courses focus on providing information 
about how children are affected by divorce in order to assist 
divorcing parents to develop appropriate post-divorce parenting 
arrangements for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that there are many parenting educational programs 
already available.  The seminars include material about the 
effects of separation and divorce on parents and children.  The 
emphasis is on explaining the impact of parents' behaviour on 
children at that very vulnerable point in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General legal information is also provided, information about 
dispute resolution alternatives, parenting and scheduling 
options.  Also, information is available about the financial 
responsibilities of both parents and about how to calculate child 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These courses are currently being financially supported by the 
federal government through the recent child support initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reports are that they appear to be very successful. 
Participants consistently give the programs high ratings on 
evaluation.  Family law lawyers, mediators and family counsellors 
report that parents appear to be more conciliatory after taking 
part in the course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that can be done to address the concerns that 
Canadians have about divorce.  However, I do not believe that 
Bill C-218 is one of them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-218 and I commend my colleague 
opposite for bringing forth the idea that we need policies to 
promote healthy families and, hopefully, happy families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-218 is not the way to go about saving a marriage. 
Marriage counselling imposed by law rather than by the conscious 
decision of a mature couple will not work.  It will increase the 
cost of divorce because it is fair to assume that the government 
will not allocate counselling resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to think about the cultural implications of 
counselling which may not fit with the way first nations people 
deal with their family problems.  Also, in remote areas 
counselling is not available.  It is not easy to get any kind of 
formal counselling in the city of Dawson.  It is certainly not 
available in Old Crow.  There are informal support networks, but 
there would not be counselling available to those people should 
they be in the process of divorcing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect is that nobody takes divorce lightly.  They do 
not approach it on a whim.  There have usually been years of 
struggle before a couple will separate and go through the process 
of divorcing.  Many couples separate and never go through a 
formal divorce process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many causes behind marriage breakdown.  The economic 
and social policies of governments are major factors.  I would 
certainly agree with my other hon. colleague that financial 
stresses are incredibly damaging to families.  If we want to 
address that issue we would need to approach it from the aspect 
of our high unemployment rate and try to make a difference there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to the Canadian social safety net and the massive 
restructuring of our economy have created unemployment and lower 
living standards.  Uncertainty, fear, declining incomes and 
increasing disparities have been created which affect negatively 
the well-being and psychological stability of our family unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good thing about this debate is that it recognizes the 
family unit and the place it has within our economy and our 
society.  It is essential that we recognize the unpaid work of 
mothers and the unpaid work of fathers. 
All the men I know who get up at 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning 
to run hockey and soccer programs are the people who work very 
hard to keep families strong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a multifaceted approach if we want to protect our 
children.  We have to make sure that maintenance money goes where 
the child is.  Whether that child is with a grandmother, an aunt, 
a great aunt or someone else in the family, maintenance payments 
should follow the child.  They are for the benefit of the child. 
Positive parenting programs should be put in place in time to 
keep families together and to help people deal with the stress of 
raising children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was home for 15 years but it was at a time when our culture 
changed.  Grandmothers, aunts and uncles were not around to help 
me with raising four children.  It was very stressful to do on my 
own.  In my mother's generation a whole neighbourhood of women 
helped each other to look after their children.  That does not 
exist, which makes parenting very stressful.  Full time parents 
need breaks.  We need to recognize that and address it in 
policies dealing with families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be less marriage breakdowns if the government 
developed a more balanced policy to economic growth, employment 
and development.  It should not base everything on the concept 
that the open market will look after families, because it will 
not.  That is not the market's concern.  It is the concern of 
governments and of cultures.  We need a fair distribution of 
wealth, better access to education and training, and better 
perspectives for the family as a whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I thank all hon. members who took the opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-218, an act to amend the Divorce Act to require mandatory 
counselling prior to granting a divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have failed to properly communicate to members of Parliament 
the intent of Bill C-218.  Two members of Parliament stood to lay 
out eloquent arguments why Bill C-218 was not the way to go to 
save a marriage, to reconcile a marriage.   Bill C-218 has 
nothing to do with reconciling marriages, absolutely nothing.  It 
is clearly not the reason for counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has two purposes.  The first is to make sure a viable 
parenting plan is in place in which children are involved after 
the divorce occurs, after the family breaks down.  The second is 
to deal with the issue of post-breakup acrimony, domestic 
violence and homicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout my speech I attempted to lay out some of the 
consequences of family breakdown in Canada.  I concluded through 
my research that children were the real victims of divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member of the New Democratic Party suggested that 
the bill was no way to reconcile a marriage, she went on to 
suggest that we had to make sure child support payments go where 
they should go.  What better way than through an intervention by 
counselling to ensure that every party understands what should 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the Reform Party raised an interesting issue.  He 
suggested that there might be a constitutional issue here.  I 
raise for the attention of all members that currently in Edmonton 
the courts regularly order mandatory counselling to deal with 
custody disputes.  This program has been ongoing for two years. 
It has been so successful that the province of Alberta and its 
minister of justice have said he is hopeful it will become a 
province-wide initiative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of what is already happening in Canada I can only 
conclude that constitutional concerns are not relevant in this 
case.  However it raises a broader question about whether our 
constitution is dedicated solely to individual rights or whether 
there is room in that constitution for the rights of children who 
cannot exercise their rights, who have no control over their 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In divorce proceedings the mother has a lawyer, the father has a 
lawyer, but who represents the interest of children?  Divorce is 
really a form of child abuse.  Counselling would provide, as all 
members have said, that vital intervention which would ensure the 
interest of children in fact comes first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member also mentioned votability.  I too regret that. 
However that is our process.  Let us deal with it rather than 
lament the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of Quebec suggesting that this is provincial 
jurisdiction, the fact remains that the marriage rate in Quebec 
is lower than any other province.  The rates of spousal abuse, 
family breakdown and other problems associated with family 
breakdown are higher in Quebec by a large factor over any other 
province.  I do not suggest in any way that the Quebec model 
should somehow be followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my comments by thanking hon. members for putting 
their views on the floor.  It is very important to hear a broad 
range of interventions.  I thank all hon. members for their 
thoughtful comments.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to begin the debate on the 
resolution to amend Term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with 
Canada. Any amendment to our Constitution is an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the hard work of those colleagues in the House and in the 
Senate who examined the proposed amendment, the federal Parliament is in 
a position to contribute to the reform of the school system of 
Newfoundland and Labrador in a way that will maximize chances for 
children of that province to get a good education. We should all be 
proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment would replace the separate school system 
currently in place in the province—which is an exclusively 
denominational system—with a single public system, in which all 
children, regardless of their religious faith, would attend the same 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment also states that the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador “shall provide for courses in religion that are not specific to 
a religious denomination” and shall permit “religious observances in a 
school where requested by parents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before continuing, I would like to congratulate the members of the 
committee for their great work. They devoted a lot of time and energy on 
a very complex social and moral constitutional matter. Through their 
efforts, many citizens and groups from Newfoundland, Labrador and across 
Canada had the opportunity to express their views on the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will also see that the work of the committee has demonstrated 
the desirability of the proposed amendment. Its proceedings further 
confirmed the wide range of support for the amendment in Newfoundland 
and Labrador and also provided evidence of reasonable support from 
affected minorities. 
In this respect, the government's initial point of view was confirmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, after having given a brief outline of the history of 
this amendment and explained why it is necessary, I will limit my 
observations to the main concerns raised during the committee hearings, 
including whether term 17 as amended will be compatible with the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, and whether the proposed constitutional 
amendment has adequate support from the affected minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few words on the background. To fully grasp the importance of the 
proposed amendment, we must first of all consider the history of the 
denominational school system in Newfoundland and Labrador and the 
attempts that were made to reform it. The 1949 Terms of Union enshrined 
a school system that is exclusively denominational. Many religious 
groups had the right to establish, operate and manage their own public 
schools. 
Therefore Newfoundland was unique in Canada because there were no 
non-denominational public schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest attempt to integrate the province's schools was in 1992 
following the Williams Royal Commission. That commission recommended in 
its final report a fully integrated school system. When discussions with 
the churches to implement this recommendation failed, the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador attempted to reform its school system by 
amending term 17. That amendment was proclaimed on April 21, 1997, and 
represented a compromise which maintained the role of the churches in 
education and which did not seek to eliminate all denominational 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the attempt to implement the new term through a 
legislative mechanism was successfully challenged in the Supreme Court 
of Newfoundland. 
Mr. Justice Leo Barry pointed out that the legal problems arose from the 
Schools Act and not from the amendment itself, and granted to the 
representatives of the Roman Catholic and Pentecostal churches a 
temporary injunction which completely blocked the school reform.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland, this led to considerable confusion and much 
uncertainty about the future structure of the school system.  The 
Newfoundland government was forced to conclude that it could not go 
ahead with the compromise inherent in the amended Term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, Premier Tobin decided to again seek a mandate 
from the public to amend Term 17.  The purpose of the amendment now 
before the House is to create a single, publicly funded school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 27, the government introduced a resolution in the 
House to amend Term 17.  On November 5, it introduced a similar 
resolution in the Senate. 
Although the government feels that this amendment deserves our 
support, we think that any mechanisms used to abolish the 
constitutional rights of minorities should be fair and exhaustive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we created the special joint committee to study 
the proposed amendment.  The committee held broad public 
consultations, during which it heard from 49 groups and 
individuals.  Last Friday, the committee reported to both Chambers 
and indicated in a lengthy report that the consensus in 
Newfoundland and Labrador is that the federal Parliament should 
support the amendment.  The committee reached this conclusion after 
considering this complex issue from many angles and examining the 
testimony. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment responds to Newfoundland's long-held 
desire to reform and integrate its education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By completely removing the churches from the administration of 
public education, the amendment gives the house of assembly the 
power to fully manage and integrate the province's schools.  This 
will surely enhance students' educational opportunities by 
eliminating the province's requirement to continue funding and 
operating small unviable schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his testimony before the special joint committee provincial 
NDP leader Jack Harris welcomed the fact that the amendment would 
“maximize available resources to provide the best education 
possible to our children, regardless of the religious faith of 
their parents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grassroots parent groups such as Education First and the 
Newfoundland and Labrador Home and School Federation told the 
committee that by establishing a single education system the 
amendment would curb or eliminate the need to bus children to 
denominational schools in other communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed amendment all children would have the right 
to attend their own local school and, as the provincial teachers' 
union was pleased to note, no school would have the right to hire 
or fire teachers based on their religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the amendment will reform and enhance education in a 
manner that does not prohibit religious education or observances 
that have been an important and historical element of the 
province's school system.  It is also important to note that the 
amendment will not require children to take religion courses or 
to participate in religious observances if the parents object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province's commitment to preserve the right to religion 
courses and religious observances in public schools may help to 
explain why the amendment received such an exceptionally high 
degree of support in the referendum and the house of assembly. 
The province made it clear from the start that religion courses 
would not be specific to any particular denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee's deliberations this assessment was 
confirmed by Ms. Gale Welsh from the Newfoundland and Labrador 
department of justice.  Ms. Welsh noted that the wording of the 
referendum question and the proposed term resulted from a series 
of events and consultations that have transpired over many years 
in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the committee's report notes, the amendment's provisions for 
religion courses and observances raised concerns among some 
witnesses such as Ms. Anne Bayefsky, an expert in constitutional 
law.  Ms. Bayefsky and some other legal experts had questions 
about the proposed term's compatibility with the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, they suggested that the proposed term 17, because 
it permits religious observances in a school, may contravene the 
charter's freedom of religion and equality rights guaranteed in 
sections 2(a) and 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument is based on Ontario Court of Appeal decisions 
ruling that observances such as the Lord's Prayer and nativity 
scenes cannot be held in public schools, even if provisions are 
made for opting out.  Witnesses argued that these charter 
concerns would also apply to provisions for religion courses set 
out in subsection 2 of the proposed term 17, which requires the 
Newfoundland legislature to provide for courses in religion that 
are not specific to a religious denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated to the committee, the government does not share 
this view, first because it would be incorrect to conclude that 
the Ontario Court of Appeal rulings, which have not been tested 
in the Supreme Court of Canada, would necessarily apply to the 
implementation and operation of the proposed term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislative jurisdiction for education in Ontario is set out in 
section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which, unlike the 
proposed term, does not make explicit provisions for religion 
courses and religious observances in public schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if enacted, term 17 will become part of the Constitution 
of Canada.  Thus it will be shielded by the well established 
principle that one part of the constitution, let's say the 
charter, cannot be used to invalidate or repeal another part of 
the constitution.  As a result, the provisions in subsections 2 
and 3 will enjoy a measure of charter immunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, subsection 2 deals with religion courses and 
subsection 3 directs that “religious observances shall be 
permitted in a school where requested by parents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle that one part of the constitution cannot 
invalidate another is grounded in supreme court case law and was 
clearly stated in connection with educational rights in the 1987 
reference case on the amendment to Ontario's education act.  On 
that occasion the supreme court explicitly stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Charter is not envisaged in our jurisprudence as 
providing for the automatic repeal of any provisions of the 
Constitution of Canada, which includes all of the documents 
enumerated in section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52 establishes that term 17 as part of the Newfoundland 
Act and any amendments to it are part of the Constitution of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to section 93 the court stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislative power in the province is not subject to 
regulation by other parts of the Constitution in any way which 
would be tantamount to its repeal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle, which was reiterated in the Adler decision last 
year, would apply with equal force to the proposed term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have suggested that because this amendment of term 17 would 
take effect after the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, of 
which the charter is a part, it would be subject to the charter 
even though the original term 17 which predated the Constitution 
Act, 1982, was not.  This argument is not supported by the plain 
language of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52, which determines what comprises the constitution, 
makes no distinction between whether a part of the Constitution 
has been enacted before or after 1982.  Indeed, subsection 
52(2)(c) clearly specifies that any amendment to an act which is 
itself part of the constitution is also part of the constitution. 
Once something is included it is as legitimate a part of the 
constitution as any other, regardless of when it was adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the proposed term's compatibility with rights set 
out in the international covenant on civil and political rights 
was discussed by various witnesses during the committee's public 
hearings. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, some witnesses cited potential violations of the 
right to freedom of religion under article 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first three paragraphs of article 18 pertinent to freedom of 
religion in the context of choosing and practising religion are 
designed to protect individuals from religiously based 
discrimination.  There is nothing in proposed term 17 that would 
hamper an individual's freedom to choose or to practice their 
religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth paragraph deals more directly with education.  It 
speaks to the liberty of parents “to ensure the religious and 
moral education of their children in conformity with their own 
convictions”.  This liberty has never been interpreted in a 
manner that would imply that the state is required to fund 
denominational schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's report notes that the Newfoundland and Labrador 
Human Rights Association also concluded that proposed term 17 was 
consistent with international declarations and the covenant. 
Moreover, Ms. Anne Bayefsky added that the term's proposal to 
remove public funding for denominational schools did not violate 
rights to religious freedom set out in the covenant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as I explained in my December 1 appearance before 
the committee, the covenant's protection of freedom of religion 
does not prohibit states from offering non-mandatory religion 
courses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations human rights committee, which is responsible 
for administering the covenant, has published a general comment 
on article 18.  It says that article 18 permits religious 
instruction, even instruction that is specific to one 
denomination, in public schools. However, provision must be made 
for non-discriminatory exemptions or alternatives where requested 
by parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that proposed term 17 specifies that the government shall 
provide for courses in religion that are not specific to a 
religious denomination, but nowhere does it say that children 
must attend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government of Newfoundland has indicated on 
several occasions with the committee that children will not be 
required to take religion courses or to participate in religious 
observances if their parents object. Therefore I conclude and 
maintain that the term is in compliance with the covenant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legal counsel for the Newfoundland government has made similar 
arguments and the committee's report concluded that it is evident 
that subsections 17(2) and 17(3) were carefully crafted to 
respond to complex historical, political and legal criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding consent of the affected minorities, the Canadian 
Constitution is the fundamental law of the country.  As such, any 
amendment of the Constitution should be undertaken with great 
care. We must be even more prudent when we amend the Constitution 
to revise or remove rights than we are when we add rights. 
Changes affecting a minority deserve even greater prudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In interpreting whether there is sufficient support to move 
ahead with this amendment of term 17, we are proceeding on the 
principle that the level of support required for a significant 
alteration of entrenched rights or freedoms is directly related 
to the nature of the right or freedom in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical in this assessment to consider what rights are 
actually being affected.  Let us be clear.  In the case of term 
17, we are not talking about the freedom of religion or freedom 
of speech, which are fundamental freedoms explicitly protected as 
such in the Canadian charter and many other international 
covenants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are facing in this case is not a fundamental right.  We 
are talking about an entitlement resulting from a uniquely 
Canadian political agreement dating back to the time of 
Newfoundland's union with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit to some surprise at seeing the official opposition 
state in its dissenting opinion that Parliament would somehow be 
setting a precedent in drawing a distinction between such 
fundamental rights as freedom of religion and the right to have 
publicly funded denominational education. 
We are setting no such precedent.  A distinction already exists 
both in law and in practice.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many different rights and freedoms.  The issue of what 
is and what is not a fundamental right has been studied by courts 
and international organizations, and some general consensus has 
emerged.  This consensus is reflected in international documents 
such as the universal declaration of human rights adopted by the 
United Nations, the European covenant of human rights and 
equivalent measures adopted by various regional organizations 
such as the Organizations of American States and the Organization 
of African States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2 of the Canadian charter identifies what Canada has 
recognized as fundamental freedoms as follows:  freedom of 
conscience and religion; freedom of thought, belief, opinion and 
expression, including freedom of the press and other media of 
communication; freedom of peaceful assembly; freedom of 
association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are different categories of fundamental rights, even 
in the Canadian charter, public funding of denominational 
education is nowhere to be found in any scholarly analysis of the 
definition of fundamental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's supreme court has ruled on the denominational 
guarantees in section 93, similar to those of term 17.  It 
concluded in Adler v. Ontario, 1996: “As a child born of 
historical exigency, section 93 does not represent a guarantee of 
fundamental freedoms”.  An earlier supreme court judgment said: 
“While it may be rooted in notions of tolerance and diversity, 
the exception in section 93 is not a blanket affirmation of 
freedom of religion or freedom of conscience and should not be 
construed as a charter human right or freedom”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is not to imply that the denominational rights in 
section 93 or term 17 are unimportant.  This is by no means true. 
But we must be clear about what is at stake here and we must 
judge the required level of support in a way that is 
proportionate to the affected right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that amending term 17 for Newfoundland sets no 
precedent, legal or otherwise, for other provinces.  The federal 
Parliament must take into account the specific context of each 
case before it.  This principle lies at the heart of federalism 
which is designed to ensure that policies of each province fit 
that province's specific needs and realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Newfoundland is not the same as that in other 
provinces.  Thus, while upholding the principle that publicly 
funded denominational education rights are not equivalent to the 
fundamental freedom of religion, I affirm that any future 
decisions by Parliament on this matter should be made according 
to the specific context of the case in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have explained throughout this process, the Government of 
Canada based its decision to proceed in this case on a number of 
factors and considerations including the referendum results.  Our 
analysis of the results is not based on improbable statistical 
assumptions but on what appears to have happened on polling day. 
It indicates that in heavily Roman Catholic areas the proposal 
was supported by the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also indicates that catholics constitute nearly 50% of the 
population and the majority—25 out of 48 or 52%—of the 
province's electoral districts, and that the proposal carried in 
all but one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assessing the degree of support of the amendment among the small 
Pentecostal minority was much more difficult.  As I explained 
during my second committee appearance, even Doctor Melvin 
Regular, executive officer of the Pentecostal education 
committee, readily admitted in his testimony that there is really 
no way of knowing how the members of his community actually 
voted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing we can know with any certainty is that in the 
four electoral districts with the largest Pentecostal 
populations, the amendment proposal carried with average 
majorities of 60%.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, given this amendment's impact on minority 
rights, a mere 50% plus one referendum majority would not have 
been sufficient in measuring the degree of consensus among those 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, no majority on its own in a referendum can justify 
the abolition of fundamental rights. However, this is not a case 
of fundamental rights.  The referendum did not result in a narrow 
majority.  It was an overwhelming majority of 73%, which provided 
evidence of minority support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the house of assembly voted unanimously to approve the 
proposed amendment.  This included all catholic and Pentecostal 
members, as well as the leader of the opposition, Mr. Loyola 
Sullivan, and the NDP leader, Mr. Jack Harris.  In the one 
democratic institution that speaks for all Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians there is no division or uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Government of Canada has argued and as the report of the 
special joint committee has confirmed, it would be difficult to 
justify a rejection of Newfoundland's proposal given the obvious 
merits of the amendment and the strong and widespread support for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because minority rights are involved we have proceeded with all 
due caution and consideration, but at the end of the day we 
believe this is a positive change which is desired by the people 
of Newfoundland and Labrador, and that desire reflects a 
reasonable degree of support among the affected religious 
minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that opponents of amending term 17 are sincere in raising 
their heartfelt concerns about this reform.  I also know that the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is sincere in wishing to 
include the province's Roman Catholic and Pentecostal leaders in 
developing a new religion curriculum and in setting up the new 
school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada expects that all parties in 
Newfoundland will act responsibly and fairly in implementing this 
important reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the excellent work of the committee will reaffirm in 
the minds of my colleagues that we should take the opportunity 
provided to us with this proposal from Newfoundland to show that 
the Constitution of Canada and its institutions can respond to 
the needs of Canadians.  I hope that together we will help to 
ensure that the children of Newfoundland can get the best 
education possible and that they will have true equality of 
opportunity as we move into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of the House will join me in voting yes to 
this amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to address the question of the Newfoundland 
schools amendment and in particular the motion before the House 
to utilize section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982 to amend the 
constitution.  The purpose of this amendment is to replace the 
present term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada 
with a new term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of this amendment is to replace the denominational 
school system of Newfoundland with a single public school system 
where all children, regardless of their religious affiliation, 
will attend the same schools.  Stated another way, the effect of 
this amendment is to extinguish the denominational rights 
provided in the present term 17 and replace them with the 
provisions and rights contained in the new term 17, namely the 
provision of a single, publicly operated school system, the 
provision for courses in religion not specific to a religious 
denomination, and the rights of parents to request religious 
observances in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the details I would like to express two 
sentiments which will govern everything I have to say on this 
subject.  First I want to express, on behalf of the members of 
the official opposition, our good will toward the people in the 
province of Newfoundland and our sincere interest in their desire 
to improve their educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the enormous difficulties that Newfoundland has 
faced and the economic hardships that have been caused by the 
collapse of the fishery, one of the basic primary industries of 
that province. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta MPs like me can identify with this because our parents 
lived through a period when our province was flat on its back due 
to the collapse of its primary industry, agriculture, during the 
great depression.  We can also identify with the recent good news 
from Newfoundland that after an enormous front end capital 
investment and the application of great technical ingenuity, the 
first oil is now flowing from Hibernia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was primarily oil and gas which transformed the economy of my 
home province.  I want to express the hope that the development 
of this resource will mean the dawning of a new day for the 
province of Newfoundland and a stream of revenue that will enable 
it to finance the social services, including the educational 
services, required by its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that the members of the official opposition 
fully respect Newfoundland's jurisdiction over education.  We 
know that education deals with Newfoundland's most precious 
resource, the lives of its children.  We therefore wish 
Newfoundlanders well in whatever educational reforms they decide 
to undertake and whatever the future may hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that as members of the federal Parliament, 
we should define our principles and choose our positions 
carefully when we are dealing with constitutional amendments. 
Over the next number of years this Parliament could very well be 
faced with major constitutional challenges, not just from the 
continuing secession threat from Quebec, but demands that will 
arise from various parts of the country for major changes in our 
constitutional arrangements, changes affecting the division of 
powers between the federal and provincial governments and the 
balance between majority and minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we do and say in this area of constitutional law can 
be taken as political, if not a legal, precedent in future 
situations.  We should therefore look down the road as to the 
precedent effect of anything we propose or adopt in relation to 
the Newfoundland schools amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we define positions on majority and minority rights with 
respect to this amendment, we should think through how those same 
positions would relate to other situations where majority and 
minority rights are constitutionally affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we define positions and make statements about what 
constitutes democratic consent for a constitutional proposal from 
Newfoundland, we should think through how that same principle 
would apply in other situations where we require democratic 
consent.  For example, I have noted with interest the language 
used by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in providing 
his definition of the principle of democratic consent.  In his 
presentation to the special joint committee on November 18, 1997 
he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this amendment's impact on minority rights, a mere 50 plus 
one referendum majority would not have been sufficient nor 
adequate in measuring the degree of consensus among those 
affected.  But the referendum did not result in a narrow 
majority:  It was an overwhelming majority of 73%, which provided 
evidence of minority support. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all well and good, but I note that it is a slightly 
different conception of democratic consent from what was taken by 
the government in 1996 when the previous Newfoundland school 
amendment came before the House.  The referendum that preceded 
that amendment carried by only 54%, but on that occasion the 
government considered that a big enough majority to satisfy the 
requirement of democratic consent.  The government will want to 
strive for consistency on this point because inconsistency on the 
principle of democratic consent will not go unnoticed by us or by 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also noted with interest just a few minutes ago the 
pronouncements of the minister on whether denominational or 
confessional rights are fundamental rights under the law.  It is 
maintained by many that denominational or confessional rights are 
not a fundamental right.  This is primarily the view of the 
secular and legalistic mind and the courts and the minister hold 
and defend that view.  But to the religious mind for those whom 
matters of faith and conscience are supreme, confessional rights 
are seen as an extension of freedom of conscience and freedom of 
religion. Therefore they are in some way fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister argues that the right to confessional schools in 
Quebec is not a fundamental right.  Therefore, by logical 
extension the right to linguistic schools in Quebec is not a 
fundamental right.  I would be very surprised if the majority of 
Quebeckers do not regard the right to linguistic schools as a 
fundamental extension of their right to freedom of speech and 
expression.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter of what is fundamental and what is not in its 
broadest sense therefore very much depends on your orientation 
and your deepest values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will forgive me if I take a moment, as the first 
speaker for the official opposition on this motion, to briefly 
sketch our understanding of the background behind the 
constitutional amendment requested of us by the government of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I sketch the background here—and I know this is very 
familiar to those who have been following this issue but not as 
familiar to those who have not in detail—then subsequent Reform 
speakers will not need to repeat it and can deal directly with 
more important details and matters of principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to state our understanding so that other members, 
especially the members from Newfoundland, can correct us if we 
misunderstood or misinterpreted the background in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the background to term 17 provided by the minister 
and by the special joint committee as to the origins of the 
original term 17 and I find them deficient on one very important 
point.  It was a point which I was reminded of by former Premier 
Wells when he was in town last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That point is that term 17 was included in the original terms of 
Union primarily to meet a political, not a legal or a 
constitutional requirement.  When Newfoundlanders were debating 
whether to join Canada in 1949, one of the principal arguments of 
those opposed to the union was that union with Canada would 
destroy Newfoundland's unique denominational educational school 
system.  To take that argument away, Joey Smallwood and others 
proposed the original term 17 in the terms of union to provide a 
constitutional guarantee of the continuance of that unique 
educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That original term 17 read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>17(1) In lieu of Section 93 of the British North America Act, 
1867, the following term shall apply in respect of the province 
of Newfoundland:  in and for the province of Newfoundland the 
legislature shall have exclusive authority to make laws in 
relation to education, but the legislature will not have 
authority to make laws prejudicially affecting any right or 
privilege with respect to denominational schools, common 
(amalgamated) schools, or denominational colleges, that any class 
or classes or persons have by law in Newfoundland at the date of 
union and out of public funds of the province of Newfoundland 
provided for education. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A) All such schools shall receive their share of such funds in 
accordance with scales determined on a non-discriminatory basis 
from time to time by the legislature for all schools then being 
conducted under authority of the legislature; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B)  All such colleges shall receive their share of any grant from 
time to time voted for all colleges then being conducted under 
authority of the legislature, such grant being distributed on a 
non-discriminatory basis. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The language used in this original term 17 is borrowed from 
section 93 of the British North America Act of 1867 which said in 
part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In and for each province, the legislature may exclusively make 
laws in relation to education, subject and according to the 
following provisions: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1) nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right 
or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any 
class of persons have by law in the province at the union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am indebted to the minister and to others for pointing out 
that section 93 itself does not apply to the province of 
Newfoundland and, hence, no amendment to term 17 can strictly be 
said to violate section 93.  Term 17 in all its forms is said to 
apply “in lieu of section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original term 17 guaranteed the denominational school rights 
of seven specific religious groups.  In 1987 it was amended to 
include another denomination, the Pentecostal Assemblies of 
Newfoundland, in the denominational schools system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will know, in 1992 after two years of study, the 
Williams royal commission recommended the reorganization of the 
school system in Newfoundland and Labrador to permit the 
government to administer the system in a more efficient way.  The 
commission proposed the creation of a single interdenominational 
school system encompassing the four separate denominational 
systems then in operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1995 the government of Newfoundland sought the approval 
of the people to amend term 17 of the terms of union in order to 
proceed with these restructuring plans.  A referendum was held on 
the following question:  “Do you support revising term 17 in the 
manner proposed by the government to enable reform of the 
denomination educational system?  Yes or no?” The result was 
approved by 54.4% of those voting. 
The proposed amendment of term 17 altered the rights to 
denominational schools in Newfoundland but did not extinguish 
them and endeavoured to reconcile them with the demands for a 
more updated system.  It was a compromise solution.

that is proportionate to the population of the class in the area 
under the board's jurisdiction. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland House of Assembly then passed a new schools act 
and a new education act which allowed the province to reduce the 
number of school districts to 10 and to appoint 
interdenominational school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-seven denominational school boards were then dissolved 
and 10 new interdenominational school boards assumed full 
responsibility for the administration of the system.  Sixty 
schools province wide were identified for closure at the end of 
the 1996-97 school year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in May 1997, and members will be familiar with this, the 
Pentecostal Assemblies and representatives of the Roman Catholic 
church initiated legal action to challenge the Newfoundland 
legislation and to seek an injunction to stop boards from 
implementing school designations and from closing certain 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their legal action, the plaintiffs did not challenge the 
constitutionality of the amended term 17.  Rather, they 
challenged the way it had been put into practice under the 
Newfoundland legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court subsequently granted the injunction on the grounds 
that denominational rights could only be made subordinate to 
rules set out in law or regulation which were uniform and which 
were not so restrictive as to make exercise of the right 
virtually impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge found that there was a case to be argued that the 
Minister of Education's guidelines gave so much discretion to the 
school boards that the rules were not being applied uniformly and 
that the directives regarding the amount the province would pay 
for such costs as busing were in practice so constraining on the 
right that they amounted to denying the denominations their 
rights under the revised term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The granting of this injunction brought the reform process to a 
halt and disrupted the plans for the 1997-98 school year and it 
provoked a political reaction rather than a legislative response 
from the Government of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 1, 1997, Premier Tobin announced that another referendum 
would be held on September 2 to further revise term 17.  It was 
now proposed to extinguish denominational rights granted by the 
term 17 amendment of 1995 and to replace them with the amendment 
we have before us.  That amendment, of course, reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>17.(1)  In lieu of section ninety-three of the Constitution Act, 
1867, this section shall apply in respect of the Province of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) In and for the Province of Newfoundland, the Legislature 
shall have exclusive authority to make laws in relation to 
education, but shall provide for courses in religion that are not 
specific to a religious denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) Religious observances shall be permitted in a school where 
requested by parents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 2, Newfoundlanders voted in the second referendum 
on the question: “Do you support a single school system where 
all children, regardless of their religious affiliation, attend 
the same schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 3, the Chief Electoral Officer announced the 
results, that 73% of those who voted in the referendum had voted 
yes to the question and 27% voted no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October of this year, on a motion by the Minister of 
Inter-Governmental Affairs, this House established a Special 
Joint Committee of the Senate and House to consider the amendment 
which is before us. That committee has prepared its report 
recommending support of the resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members of the committee filed a minority report raising 
particular concerns with respect to the treatment of majority and 
minority rights under the proposed amendment, but making no 
specific recommendation other than that members voting freely on 
this resolution take their concerns into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so it is by this long, torturous route we come to today's 
debate and a decision by Parliament on an issue with which 
Newfoundlanders have been wrestling now for many many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will know that the official opposition 
believes that constitutional amendments should be subjected to 
three great tests; the test of democratic consent, the test of 
the rule of law, and the test of the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We contend that these tests are broad enough and deep enough to 
handle any constitutional change, including those of the most 
radical variety. 
In other words these are the great principles that would guide a 
Reform government in dealing with any constitutional change or 
challenge from educational reform amendments to a secession 
attempt.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are especially pleased to see that the government has also 
adopted these three tests as a standard with the 
intergovernmental affairs minister beginning his testimony before 
the joint committee on November 18 with these words: 
“Specifically, I will explain how the amendment conforms to the 
legal requirements of the Constitution, has merit and is in the 
interest of Newfoundland and Canadians, and enjoys substantial 
democratic support, including a reasonable degree of support 
among minorities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should strive in our application of these three tests to be 
consistent. These therefore are exactly the same tests which we 
applied to the Quebec schools amendment, although when applied to 
different facts and a different situation the application of 
these tests may lead to different conclusions. Allow me then to 
briefly discuss the application of these tests to the 
Newfoundland schools amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the test of democratic consent.  Do a majority of the 
citizens affected by the proposed constitutional amendment 
approve of the amendment? On major amendments we believe that 
this test should be conducted through a referendum.  In the case 
of the term 17 amendment before us, I am persuaded that the 
amendment passes this democratic test. The principle behind it 
was approved by 73% of those voting in a provincial referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are members who have questions about the manner in 
which the Newfoundland referendum was conducted, the 
appropriateness of the question asked, the time period and the 
resources available to proponents on each side of the issue. 
These are legitimate questions. But it seems to me that after 
years and years of debate on this subject the people of 
Newfoundland knew what they were voting on when they approved the 
1995 term 17 proposal by a majority of 54% and that even more 
knew what they were voting on in the second referendum which was 
approved by a majority of 73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also persuaded that Newfoundlanders are aware that this 
issue involves not only educational reforms but the difficult 
subject of extinguishing, granting and balancing majority and 
minority rights.  I therefore believe that this Parliament should 
be very careful in presuming that its judgment on any of these 
matters is somehow superior to that of the people of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we want to satisfy ourselves that the proposed 
constitutional amendment and the amendment formula utilized 
conform to the rule of law.  It is apparent that term 17 applies 
only to Newfoundland and therefore from a strictly legal 
standpoint can be amended under the bilateral formula contained 
in section 43.  In fact it has already been amended twice under 
that formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general principle I would prefer that provincial 
governments submitting legally controversial amendments obtain a 
court reference first, affirming the constitutionality of what is 
proposed so that we do not run the risk of going through this 
entire process only to have the results upset on constitutional 
grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do acknowledge that our confidence in the legal opinions 
provided to us by Premier Tobin in 1996 was shaken when the 
injunction was granted by the Newfoundland Supreme Court to halt 
the implementation of the reforms proposed under the Newfoundland 
legislation.  It is my understanding however that what led to the 
court challenge was not the constitutionality or the legality of 
the amendment but the way in which it was implemented under the 
Newfoundland legislation. I am therefore prepared to acknowledge 
that the amendment before us conforms to the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us then to the test of the Canadian national 
interest.  Majorities have an interest in minority rights.  Each 
of us may be a part of some majority in a particular situation 
but each of us may also find ourselves if not at present then in 
the future in a minority position.  We may be part of an ethnic 
majority but part of a religious minority.   All of us therefore 
have an interest in the protection of minority rights whether or 
not we are a member of the particular minority in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to education, the Constitution of Canada makes it 
very clear that education is under provincial jurisdiction.  But 
the spirit and intent of section 93, much of which was imported 
into the original term 17, is that governments assume political 
responsibility for ensuring that powers are not exercised in a 
way that prejudicially affects rights previously granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also aware that the actions of one province affecting 
majority and minority rights in education may set important 
precedents regarding educational rights of minorities and 
majorities in other provinces. 
We are not speaking here simply of legal precedents but also of 
political precedents which are very important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with respect to the impact of the proposed Newfoundland 
schools amendment on rights previously granted that I have 
concerns.  It is in fact in this area that our caucus has had its 
greatest concerns.  It is this aspect of the amendment which has 
been the principal focus of our internal discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So interested and concerned have we been on this matter that not 
only have we endeavoured to absorb the testimony and the findings 
of the special joint committee and the representations to the 
ministers to that committee, but we also sponsored a special 
debate of our own on this issue.  The question debated was:  Does 
the Newfoundland schools amendment prejudicially affect rights 
previously granted to persons desiring a religious orientation in 
the education of their children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To argue the yes side, we invited Joseph Hutchings, a partner in 
the firm of Poole, Althouse and Associates of Cornerbrook who 
handled the supreme court challenge of the Newfoundland Schools 
Act resulting from the 1995 term 17 amendment. On the no side we 
invited Clyde Wells of the law firm of O'Reilly, Noseworthy in 
St. John's.  Mr. Wells of course is the former premier of 
Newfoundland and the premier to first consult the people of 
Newfoundland on educational reform through a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intention to reproduce here the pros and cons of 
the arguments raised by these two gentlemen, but I do want to 
thank them both for contributing to our understanding of this 
issue and to express my disappointment that other members of the 
House who were invited to this debate did not take full advantage 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the nub of the argument with respect to whether 
the Newfoundland schools amendment passes the test of the 
Canadian national interest, particularly with regard to its 
impact on rights previously granted to classes of persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the original term 17 in 1949 specifically 
entrenched denominational rights by specifying that the 
legislature will not have authority to make laws prejudicially 
affecting any right or privilege with respect to denominational 
schools, common amalgamated schools or denominational colleges, 
that any classes of persons have by law in Newfoundland at the 
date of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Term 17 as amended in 1995 also in clause (a) upheld 
denominational rights by stating that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c), schools 
established, maintained and operated with public funds shall be 
denominational schools, and any class having rights under this 
term as it read on January 1, 1995 shall continue to have the 
right to provide for religious education, activities, and 
observances for the children of that class in those schools. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we then look at the term 17 currently before us, we find that 
these denominational rights are extinguished and they are in 
effect replaced by three things:  one, the exclusive authority of 
the province of Newfoundland to make laws in relation to 
education, which presumably is intended to give expression to the 
public desire in Newfoundland to exercise a right to have public 
schools; two, the right to provide for courses in religion that 
are not specific to a religious denomination; and three, the 
right to religious observances in a school where requested by 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumably if the people of Newfoundland voted so strongly in 
favour of replacing denominational schools with a single public 
school system, a significant majority must prefer the right to a 
public education system over the right to maintain a 
denominational school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little question in my mind that the two other rights 
established by this amendment are of questionable value, 
especially to parents desiring a religious orientation in the 
education of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions for courses in religion that are not specific to 
a religious denomination and the right to religious observances 
in a school where requested by parents are hardly adequate 
substitutes for the right “to provide for religious education, 
activities and observances for children in denominational 
schools” as guaranteed by the 1995 term 17 amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada pointed out in a brief 
dated November 18, 1997 and prepared for the special joint 
committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision of religious education classes and religious 
observance is insufficient to accommodate the faith based 
approach to education.  This was recognized by the Supreme Court 
of Canada in Tiny Separate School Trustees v. The King in which 
it was stated: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea that the denominational school is to be differentiated 
from the common school purely by the character of its religious 
exercises or religious studies is erroneous. 
Common and separate schools are based on fundamentally different 
conceptions of education.  Undenominational schools are based on 
the idea that the separation of secular from religious education 
is advantageous.  Supporters of denominational schools, on the 
other hand, maintain that religious instruction and influence 
should always accompany secular training.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the right to religious observances in a school 
where requested by parents, there is a justifiable fear expressed 
by some that this provision will be simply overridden by the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To counter balance this apparent weakening of rights to 
religious based education are the following assurances given by 
the Government of Newfoundland and in part by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister assures us that parental rights are strengthened by 
this amendment. In his presentation on December 1 to the 
committee, he said in fact that parents have more power under the 
proposed amendment than they ever did before. Parental rights, it 
was argued, are strengthened:  “They have the power to elect 
school boards, to enrol their children in the school of their 
choice, the the power to withdraw them from classes where there 
is instruction that they do not wish for their children.  They 
have the right to request religious observances in school and the 
right not to have their children forced to attend those 
observances”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also assured us that part 3 of this amendment is immune to 
charter challenge.  I believe he repeated that again today. In 
his December 1 presentation to the joint committee, he said: “If 
enacted, term 17 will become part of the Constitution of Canada. 
Thus it will be shielded by the well-established principle that 
one part of the Constitution”—that is the charter—“cannot be 
used to invalidate or repeal another.  As a result, the 
provisions in subsections (2) and (3) will enjoy a measure of 
charter immunity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then went on to give the supreme court references with 
particular reference to the 1987 reference case on the amendment 
to the Ontario Education Act which supports this conclusion: 
“With respect to section 93, the court said that this 
legislative power in the province is not subject to regulation by 
other parts of the Constitution in any way which would be 
tantamount to its repeal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the value of the rights granted under this new term 17 
therefore is very much dependent on the weight that 
Newfoundlanders attach to these assurances given by the minister 
in this Parliament and by the Government of Newfoundland in that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of these rights is very much dependent on the way in 
which the Government of Newfoundland fulfils its educational 
reform obligations.  The value of these rights is also very much 
dependent upon the extent to which parents exercise them and the 
manner in which the denominations endeavour to exercise their 
influence under the new regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that many Newfoundlanders are aware of these 
considerations, that they have debated them longer and more 
deeply than we in this House and took them into account in voting 
on the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My personal concern about the impact of this amendment on rights 
is substantial but not substantial enough to outweigh my desire 
to respect the wishes of the people of Newfoundland as expressed 
in their referendum. I will therefore with these reservations 
vote in favour of the Newfoundland schools amendment. In saying 
this, I fully appreciate there will be a free vote and that 
colleagues in this House, including members of my own caucus, 
will attach a different weighting to these principles and 
conclusions with respect to democratic consent, the rule of law 
and particularly the effect on rights, and that the weighting 
they attach to these factors may well lead them to vote against 
the amendment rather than in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are three other observations I would like 
to make concerning this amendment, its effects on denominational 
rights and the obligations of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs and the Government of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to make clear that the Newfoundland schools 
amendment is fundamentally different from the Quebec schools 
amendment and the application of our three tests leads to a 
different conclusion in each case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I am sympathetic to the desire of Quebeckers to 
reform their education system, I voted against that amendment 
because it was not ratified by the people it affects through a 
referendum and because it replaced constitutional guarantees of 
rights previously granted with inferior guarantees contained in 
provincial statutes that can easily be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Newfoundland schools amendment, the amendment 
was ratified by a popular referendum, and while certain rights 
are being extinguished and other rights are being granted, the 
new rights granted are constitutionally guaranteed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word to parents in Newfoundland whose principal 
interest in this whole issue is securing a religious orientation 
in the education of their children and who are likely to be 
gravely disappointed if parliament approves the motion before us. 
Many members of the House identify with their concerns and 
aspirations for their children, and I am certainly one among 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife Sandra and I have five children, now aged 17 years to 29 
years.  Our children have attended over 20 different schools in 
three different cities in Alberta, including protestant and 
catholic public schools, protestant and catholic separate 
schools, and a private denominational school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As practising Christians we have preferred to have our children 
educated in schools with a spiritual orientation where faith is 
valued, even if we have sometimes opted out of the specific 
religious instruction in a school.  We have preferred schools 
offering a faith oriented education to those schools where the 
entire orientation is secular and either indifferent or hostile 
to faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I believe there are some hard lessons to be 
learned from the denominational schools experience in 
Newfoundland over the past number of years, which should guide in 
dealing with the new regime and which are applicable to the rest 
of us living in other jurisdictions where similar challenges will 
be faced in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first lesson is that if and when denominational groups have 
partial or full control of an educational system, it is extremely 
important that we fully champion freedom of conscience and 
religious expression for all members of the community and not 
just for those in a particular denomination.  It is not necessary 
to agree with another person's religious convictions in order to 
uphold their right to hold and exercise those convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation of denominational educational rights, I maintain, 
is freedom of conscience and religion; but if we only champion 
the expression of that freedom for ourselves and our denomination 
and not for all, the public will see our interest in 
denominational education as a narrow sectarian interest and will 
be unsupportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, when denominational groups are partially or wholly in 
charge of an educational system, it would seem imperative that we 
champion, expand and cultivate the rights of parents and the 
accountability of those systems to parents.  Denominational 
systems that are run from the top down, with parents playing only 
a peripheral advisory role and the real power resting in the 
hands of denominational leaders, do not have good prospects for 
surviving in the long run any more than top down political 
regimes have a long term hope of surviving in the political 
arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the denominational groups in Newfoundland had been seen as 
champions of freedom of conscience for all Newfoundlanders and 
champions of parental rights, the removal of denominational 
rights would have been seen as an interference with fundamental 
rights, and there would have been much less public support for 
that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second lesson we can learn and that denominational interests 
in other provinces can learn from the Newfoundland experience is 
that by trying to keep too much we can lose much of what we had. 
Obviously the term 17 provided for in the 1995 constitutional 
amendment, which preserved denominational rights but endeavoured 
to integrate them with other provincial concerns, would have been 
preferable for parents desiring a religious orientation in the 
education of their children to what would be provided under the 
current term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it was denominational interests themselves that 
challenged the implementation of the preferable term 17.  This 
challenge, while temporarily successful in the courts, in the 
legal arena, provoked a political reaction in the form of the 
second referendum.  This challenge was obviously perceived 
negatively by the public that voted more strongly in the second 
referendum in favour of the government's plan and against any 
recognition of denominational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an ironic reminder of the truth of the New Testament 
parable about the servant to whom our Lord gave one talent of 
silver and who, for fear of losing it and in an attempt to 
preserve it, buried it in the ground instead of using it to 
multiply his resources.  Alas, in the end that servant ended up 
losing even that which he had.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure those parents in Newfoundland desiring a religious 
orientation for their children that this amendment, no matter how 
it is disposed of, does not extinguish their rights and concerns 
from the mind and conscience of members of Parliament like me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by identifying the obligations which the passage of 
this amendment by the federal parliament places on the Government 
of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 27% of those voting in the last referendum being opposed to 
the proposed educational reforms, it seems to me that the 
Government of Newfoundland has a big job to do in making sure 
that its educational reforms work to the advantage of all 
Newfoundlanders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of how to reform educational systems without 
prejudicially affecting rights previously granted, particularly 
the rights of minority groups, would be immeasurably enhanced if 
provincial educational reformers would include in their packages 
a proviso granting parents the right to designate school taxes to 
the school of their choice and an assurance that the approved 
list of available schools would include as wide a range of 
educational and value options as is practical in the 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  I appreciate the applause.  It is 
not the place of this parliament to say what educational reforms 
should be pursued by any province.  That is in the realm of 
provincial jurisdiction.  However I can say, as I believe many 
other members on both sides of the House would say, that had that 
proviso and that assurance been in the package of educational 
reforms presented by the Government of Newfoundland, support for 
this amendment would have been greater and more clear cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that proviso and assurance the government would have been 
on much stronger ground to argue that while rights previously 
granted would be affected by the reforms, they would not be 
prejudicially affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland now has a special obligation to 
make the more limited rights provided in this amendment 
meaningful to those to whom they are most important, in 
particular the right to have religious courses in 
non-denominational schools and the right to religious 
observances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since courses about religion are no a substitute for the embrace 
and practice of religion, much rests on the meaningfulness of the 
third right contained in this amendment, namely that religious 
observances shall be permitted in the school where requested by 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been assured by representatives of the Government of 
Newfoundland and by the federal Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs that this provision is sufficiently strong to prevent 
requests by parents for religious observances in Newfoundland 
schools from being overruled by the charter of rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this proves not to be the case, members of the House will 
have grounds for declaring that we have been misled.  More 
important, a significant portion of the Newfoundland population 
will have grounds for arguing that they have been misled and will 
have grounds for expressing their disapproval in no uncertain 
terms at the ballot box in future federal and provincial 
elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the representations of other members on this 
important issue.

<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
take my turn in speaking on the motion before us, concerning 
amendment of section 17 of the Constitution, which relates to the 
Terms of Union of Newfoundland.  This motion will enable the people 
of Newfoundland to modify their education system as defined by 
them.  Since they initiated this change several years ago, 
culminating in a referendum a few months ago, we shall today be 
supporting this motion in order to allow Newfoundland to move ahead 
with this as promptly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to place this constitutional amendment in its 
context. 
Then I shall move on to speak of the work in committee and of the 
one submission to the committee which left me confused, and still 
does, that of the Government of Canada, by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs.  I must say that it opened the door to 
an analysis in committee which moved the committee members to 
question the level of support. We have heard the speech by the 
leader of the Reform Party just now; Reform will support the 
motion, after having taken the time to thoroughly analyze all of 
their recriminations relating to the very basis, or the potential 
scope, of the amendment.  All of this was a result of what the 
government's representative, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, had to say.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand right off that term 17 makes specific 
provision about Newfoundland's union with Canada.  It accords 
constitutional rights to various religious communities in 
Newfoundland, which enabled them to manage their school system.  In 
1987, through the same constitutional amendment procedure, the 
rights were extended to the Pentacostals.  The result was a school 
system that was run by religious denominations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In practice what that means is that there are actually four 
school systems in Newfoundland.  There is the integrated system, 
the Pentecostal system, the Roman Catholic system and the Seventh 
Day Adventist system.  The integrated system includes the Anglican, 
Presbyterian and United churches and the Salvation Army.  So this 
is what we were faced with, and let us look at what it means in 
practical terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some regions in Newfoundland there is a single religious 
community essentially.  In such cases, there is little debate. 
There are other places, such as urban areas and cities where there 
are two or three secondary schools of different denominations 
within a very small radius, and the children attend school 
according to their religion.  In some instances, there are schools 
near them, and they have to go to a school that is further away, 
because the school close by is not of their religious denomination. 
There are teachers who cannot teach in certain schools because they do 
not belong to the same religious group. There are certainly some very 
able people who experienced difficulties because of this, and we have 
all heard about the fact. Hiring was not based on one's qualifications 
but on the religious group one belonged to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland is the only province that did not have a public 
education system but rather a system belonging to different religious 
denominations. How did the people challenge this system? They used 
different means. In 1992, a royal commission submitted its report and 
suggested that considerable changes should be made to Newfoundland's 
school system. Later on, there were extensive negotiations between the 
government and various denominations in order to find an arrangement to 
reorganize the school system. The first choice was not to adopt directly 
a constitutional amendment. 
People sought to achieve a balance, to find a way to reorganize the 
school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After lengthy and unsuccessful negotiations, in 1995, the 
government came up with a compromise that was submitted to the 
population. That referendum was approved by 54% of the population. 
Later, there were court challenges and an injunction was requested. The 
Government of Newfoundland closed some schools, reorganized its school 
system, and parents supported by special interest groups succeeded in 
obtaining an injunction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland did not choose to argue on the 
substantive issue. 
It decided then to redesign its proposal and to go to the people a 
second time; another referendum was held on September 2, 1997, and this 
time it received the support of 73% of the population. The government 
therefore decided to refer to the people in order to move forward and to 
avoid getting involved in a very lengthy legal battle, which would have 
delayed implementation of a reform that people had wanted for a long 
time. This was obvious from the level of support expressed by the people 
of Newfoundland twice, during two referenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the question asked at that referendum? I will read it to 
you. 
The question was: “Do you support the establishment of a single 
school system where all children, whatever their religion or religious 
affiliation, attend the same schools while having access to courses in 
religion and to religious observances?” So the objective was not to 
throw religion out altogether nor to eliminate courses in religion, but 
instead to ensure that the school system would be managed by the 
government. It is the Government of Newfoundland that will make the 
decisions on the structure that will be implemented, on parent 
committees and everything else, so that from now on it will be a public 
system and no longer a denominational system.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was basically whether the people wanted the 
denominational system to be maintained or instead wanted a public 
system. This debate gave the people an opportunity to express their 
views and, on September 2, they made a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 5, the Legislative Assembly of Newfoundland 
unanimously passed a motion to go ahead with the constitutional 
amendment requested. I will come back to this because the Pentecostal 
members' support can be interpreted a number of ways; the Pentecostal 
community is probably one of the minorities whose support for the 
proposal was weakest, at least as far as we could see in committee. I 
will come back to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I move to the Bloc's support. We expressed support for this 
proposal in this House from the outset, even before it was referred to 
committee. Why? We thought it was quite obvious. It concerns education, 
which is under provincial jurisdiction. Support was expressed as part of 
a democratic process, and the people of Newfoundland decided what they 
wanted to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, it seems to me that the role of the House of Commons 
is to adopt this motion, unanimously I hope, thereby respecting the wish 
of Newfoundlanders. The government saw fit to establish a committee to 
study it and so on. We did not think this was a necessary step that 
would add anything. As it turns out, we did not hear much that we had 
not heard before. There is always a risk with holding hearings: people 
want to start the debate all over again. Opponents made their case again 
hoping that Parliament would finally agree with them. There was a 
campaign, there were opportunities for people to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the chronology of events, I forgot to mention that there was 
also a provincial election held in Newfoundland. The government of the 
day never made any secret about its intentions and was re-elected. It 
too went through the democratic process. Granted, this was not the only 
issue in the provincial election, but still those opposing the proposal 
had numerous opportunities to come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the conclusion reached by the committee, I am very pleased 
to see that the committee did not venture beyond making a recommendation 
to the House of Commons and to the other place to adopt the resolution. 
It did not get into the kind of overly political analysis the Reformers 
and perhaps the minister would have hoped for regarding every 
conceivable potential implication on other aspects of federal-provincial 
and constitutional relations. 
I know some were tempted to do so, but the committee's level of 
consensus might have been lower, since there were already dissenting 
opinions from Conservative senators. The process might be delayed 
somewhat by the Senate, which would be unfortunate. Still, while we may 
have to wait for the Senate once again, it will merely slow down the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told you earlier about the Bloc's support and about potential 
hurdles; the Senate is one of them. Another one is the possibility of 
legal challenges. Witnesses, and also some people during the last 
campaign in Newfoundland, mentioned the possibility that certain aspects 
might be challenged in court. People can do it regarding all sorts of 
issues. There is a legal system in place for this, but it does not 
justify not going ahead with what is proposed to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear distinction to be made here. The constitutional 
amendment is one thing, but it will up to the Government of Newfoundland 
to decide how it will organize its school system. We cannot say, as some 
Conservative senators—among others—might be tempted to do, that 
there may be challenges, that we have to be careful, that we should 
draft the amendment differently, look for alternatives, etc., because, 
in the end, it will all depend on how Newfoundland implements its school 
reform. Of course, if there is non-compliance with the Constitution or 
the charter, then it is a different matter. But, as the minister 
explained, the constitutional amendment as such will not contradict any 
provision in these acts. Similarly, the charter will not contradict what 
is in the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the part of the government's statement that concerns me 
and that opened the door to a debate is that of the support of most of 
the minorities or of support by minorities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of denominational groups involved.  When 
the level of support is examined riding by riding, it seems fairly 
clear that it was very high everywhere, without always being a 
majority.  While it received the support of a good number of 
people, that support was visibly lower in areas where there were 
more Pentecostals.  Many people came and presented all sorts of 
arguments, but there is no way of knowing exactly how they voted. 
That having been said, every indication is that opposition in the 
Pentecostal community is quite strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the criterion is reasonable support from the minorities, 
we have something that is completely subjective. 
Earlier in the House, the minister came back to this as well, 
saying that the level of support from the minorities affected 
depends on the nature of the right involved.  That is subjective. 
There are two things about this that are subjective.  He naturally 
has his definition, based on sources, of what constitutes a 
fundamental right and what does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, however, I must point out to him that his view 
differed widely from that of his new constitutional colleague, the 
Leader of the Reform Party.  The two do not share the same view of 
what constitutes a fundamental right.  He says that, when there is 
freedom of religion, then it follows that running the school system 
on a religious basis is an extension of the fundamental right of 
freedom of expression and of religion.  But there is a difference 
of opinion.  And there may be many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is therefore a view of what constitutes a fundamental 
freedom and what does not. 
Even if there were a definition right now, that does not mean it 
would not change with time.  When the Newfoundland issue is 
approached with a criterion such as reasonable support from the 
minorities concerned, the door is thrown wide open to debate.  This 
does not strike me as a very desirable or good approach.  Nor was 
it the approach taken by the Government of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that government, it is a choice between a public and a 
denominational school system, and 73% of voters opted for a public 
system.  I think this is where the greater logic lies.  If one 
starts with the premise that the support of minorities is required, 
there is no logic in proceeding if support from one of the 
minorities is missing.  This is why Reformers, Conservatives and 
all opponents from Newfoundland have such serious reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the rest of the brief, there were a few other aspects more 
or less along the same lines.  One sentence stated that, according 
to the Government of Canada, the proposed amendment was given a 
favourable reception by an appreciable majority of the population, 
and enjoys reasonable support by the minorities directly affected. 
We shall return later to the words appreciable majority, and the 
notion of reasonable support by the minorities directly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement is then made that the resolution was approved 
unanimously by the Legislative Assembly.  Here again, prudence is 
advisable.  Three days after the referendum, four Pentecostal MLAs 
voted unanimously in favour of the amendment proposed to the 
Legislative Assembly.  The fact that some Pentecostal MLAs 
supported the motion after the referendum cannot, by extension, be 
taken to mean that the Pentecostal community did the same. 
At that time, the members of the legislature had their own reasons, 
and they needed to take their political affiliation into 
consideration, how the rest of their political party was acting, 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also represented ridings, and had to take the opinion of 
their constituents into account. If the majority of their 
constituents had been in favour of the amendment suggested, but 
that the Pentecostals were not the majority in a riding—they are 
one group of the population, but not sufficient in numbers to form 
a majority in the riding—it could very well happen, therefore, 
that the majority of Pentecostals voted against, but overall the 
riding was in favour. 
The MLA therefore finds himself in a situation where he is forced 
to ask himself how he can best represent his constituents.  He has 
his own personal convictions, but he is also there to represent his 
riding.  We must therefore take care not to generalize or to divert 
attention from the fact that there was a considerable degree of 
dissatisfaction in the Pentecostal community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of approach we have to take when we want to 
look at the level of minority support, when we want to break down 
the vote or look at support for this referendum by denomination. 
And it gets more complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had a lot of things besides the situation in 
Newfoundland in his head when he came to testify. 
His arrival in politics was motivated essentially by, as he said 
last night, the Quebec question, and I am sure he had that in mind 
when he wrote the following: “Given the effect of this amendment on 
minority rights, a simple majority of 50% plus one in the 
referendum would be neither sufficient nor satisfactory”.  It is 
strange having the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs make such 
a statement before the committee studying Newfoundland's school 
system.  I will refresh your memory.  Barely two years ago, the 
House of Commons passed on two occasions, because the Senate took 
a very long time on the constitutional amendment, a constitutional 
amendment with respect to Newfoundland, which had just held a 
referendum that had received the support of 54% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they are now saying that a simple majority of 50% 
plus one is not enough, 54% was considered to be enough at the 
time.  So the federal government is faced with a problem of logic. 
I understand their great concern, like that of their constitutional 
colleagues in the Reform Party, over the possible impact of 
recognizing 50% plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, today they are saying “Phew.  A good thing the second one 
passed in 1973.  Now we can include it in our presentation.  We can 
include it now, which we could not have done the first time.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is passing, and I would have liked to talk to you about 
a number of other things.  In conclusion, you have to be careful 
when you try to mix up two things, as the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs is doing in this case. 
He has opened the door to allow many people to express their opposition 
and to avoid considering the real issue, which is that the people of 
Newfoundland indicated what they wanted and did that through a 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I must mention in the minute and a half that I have remaining 
that the people who were against the proposal came up with arguments 
such as “The question was not clear.” It seems to me that I have heard 
that somewhere else before. Living in an area where the people were 
consulted on several occasions, we have often heard this. When the level 
of support was not as expected, for example in the case of the 
federalists in Quebec, when 49.5% of the people voted yes, they said 
“But they did not understand.” The people in Newfoundland reacted in 
very much the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we will be able to come back to this, and I will 
conclude by saying that we will support and respect the will of the 
people of Newfoundland, with the hope that the members of the other 
parties will show the same willingness when the case of Quebec will be 
considered. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy that the leader of the Reform Party, the leader of the official 
opposition, and also the Bloc Quebecois agree with the government to 
support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on what the hon. member said on three 
points. What the Government of Canada is saying is that there should 
always be a balance between the extent of a change and the extent of the 
support it receives. In the case of a relatively moderate change, as 
with the first referendum on term 17, the majority need not be as great 
as in the case of a much more extensive change affecting minorities, as 
we have here. So these are the things that should be balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have invented nothing as Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. The issue of minorities has always been on the table. 
It is being raised in Newfoundland, it was raised during the first 
amendment and it is being raised with the second amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members and senators voted against the first amendment. The Senate 
itself voted against it because of this issue of minority rights. The 
Government of Newfoundland, in the brief it presented on November 18, 
1997, deals with the issue of majorities and minorities, of the rights 
of minorities and also of the support of minorities. This is an issue 
that is unavoidable. If it had been clearly demonstrated to us that the 
Pentecostal Church was for the amendment, there would have been much 
less debate and difficulty. If it had been clearly demonstrated to us 
that they rejected it outright, there would have been much more debate 
and greater difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this issue is before us. And since it is my role to ask a 
question to the member, I ask him this: Does he believe that democracy 
is tyranny by the majority? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
I heard the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs say that he was 
anxious to get back to teaching.  We see today that he already has 
a question prepared for asking his students some day.  Moreover, my 
wish for him is that he can get back to where he says his strongest 
preference lies as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the fundamental rule in a democratic society is 
the following: respecting the wish of the majority.  I would like 
to go further with this.  I recall hearing the minister open a 
debate with the question “What, for example, would happen if New 
Brunswick held a referendum calling for abolition of the language 
rights of francophones?” 
He said he would padlock the doors of Parliament, that he would be 
in the forefront of those opposing it, and that the government 
would never consider such a thing.  Perhaps he could do so.  Yet 
the fact remains that there would be a major problem if one 
province had such a desire, one that had been expressed and 
measured in a democratic exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced, if the opposite position were taken, if a 
referendum were held in Quebec on anglophone rights—regardless of 
context, regardless of whether or not we had a Bill 101 in favour 
of the development of French—there would be a massive vote by 
Quebeckers in favour of the language rights of anglophones. 
Moreover, that was included in what was submitted to the population 
last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the majority wants to oppress its minority, which is what 
he says this comes down to really, that will happen regardless.  Do 
you sincerely believe that, if they express this in a democratic 
exercise, they will not express it in their everyday lives? 
So there is another kind of problem, one of tolerance, which 
involves significant problems.  Respecting the rule of the majority 
therefore, in my point of view, does not lead us to a dangerous 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that he will want to continue the debate and I 
am prepared to continue it at any point with him, on the basis that 
the majority decision is a desire clearly expressed by the people, 
and at that point a government has a duty to take this into 
consideration and to act responsibly in such situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, well I hesitate to continue 
the debate because it is going round in circles.  Almost all texts 
on democracy and almost every democracy I know of have 
constitutions and charters for the very purpose of protecting 
minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It often happens that referendums, even when there is a 
majority, are not followed by legislation, because the majority 
often appears uncertain about the change contemplated.  When the 
change selected involves not adding a right, but rather taking one 
away, and the right affects certain categories of citizens more 
than others, extreme care must be taken and questions asked in 
terms of the majority and the minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that we must not lean too far in 
the opposite direction and give the minority tyranny.  A balance 
must be struck according to the importance of the right at issue 
and the support that is measurable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat what I said.  Should New Brunswick ever approach 
Parliament to abolish official bilingualism, which is recognized in 
the Constitution, without the support of the francophone minority, 
the amendment would have no chance of success, whatever the 
majority in the New Brunswick legislature or among the anglophone 
population of New Brunswick.  It is a question of minority rights. 
Things must be viewed this way, and I am sure that if the hon. 
member gives it some thought he will agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time we 
disagree, but I would like to give him again the example of anglophones 
in Quebec and of linguistic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> He is adding another right, it is not the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> No, no. The removal of rights in a referendum 
exercise is being discussed. I am sure that Quebeckers would be against 
removing what the Quebec anglophone community has now. I am sure it is 
the same thing in the New Brunswick. So I think these things are 
completely hypothetical because the values people have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> This an academic debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Yes, it is a very academic debate. But let us 
come back to the case of Newfoundland. 
If we follow the minister's logic, we should be against this amendment 
because obviously members of the Pentecostal Church are opposed to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue to be resolved is whether this is a fundamental right or 
a less than fundamental right, and whether we can withdraw a right from 
a minority if it is a bit less fundamental than what we consider to be 
fundamental. But where can all this lead us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the people who are concerned that the minister is 
making a judgment on the definition of what is fundamental by stating 
that appropriate support is required from the minorities, by trying to 
state what the debate should be in Newfoundland. I am sorry, but when he 
quoted the minister from Newfoundland, when he was asked the question 
directly, he always said that as far as he was concerned, 73% of the 
people had voted for the project. 
He never started with 32, 38, 27, with assumptions and everything else. 
He said that according to him the issue was the following: a public 
system or a denominational system, and the majority had expressed 
itself.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the minister to be a bit more straightforward when dealing 
with the cases he is referring to, to be specific in his comments and to 
be careful not to be always obsessed with his idea of meeting the 
commitment that he had already taken before the referendum. We must 
remember that it is he who said that he wanted to make Quebec suffer. We 
can see by what he is doing today that he is applying what he said at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, since we will be working together 
for the next two days, I will not respond to the slander that we have 
just heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I ask the member to show us if he can any international 
legislation that recognizes as a fundamental right the control of 
publicly funded schools by churches. I would like him to show us any 
international charter or any charter in a democracy that does not 
include the freedom of worship as a fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the argument that the 
minister wants to bring into this debate. We have never thought along 
these lines. He should be speaking with his colleague from the Reform 
Party, his new constitutional colleague with whom he is working hand in 
hand. I invite him to have good discussions with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard the leader of the Reform Party say that, according 
to them, this was an extension of a fundamental right. According to me, 
that is not the issue. The issue is the choice between a public system 
and a denominational system, and the people chose a public system. They 
have chosen it with a majority, they have expressed this in a consensus 
during two referendums, in a report by a commission, in provincial 
elections, and with everything else. According to me, this should be 
sufficient, and it is based on such support that, hopefully, a 
resolution should be unanimously adopted by this House to respect the 
will expressed by the people of Newfoundland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
stand in support of the recommendation regarding the proposed 
amendment to term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with 
Canada, a constitutional amendment, a change to the very 
foundation of the house of Canada, a house we in this Chamber 
must build stronger and more magnificent every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee has studied the question with great 
care on behalf of Parliament.  Today we have the result of that 
study in the form of the recommendation before us.  The committee 
recommends that we make the changes to term 17 requested by the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the recommendation I want to say that it was a 
privilege and an honour to have had the opportunity to be part of 
the special joint committee considering this issue for the people 
of Newfoundland and indeed Canada.  Coming from Cape Breton I can 
assure the House that the people of my island and the province of 
Newfoundland have more in common than geography.  Our past and 
present bind us together in ways which have forged a warm 
understanding between us. This sentiment accompanied me 
throughout my committee duties and I wish to say it was a 
pleasure to serve the people of Newfoundland in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make the point of saying that Canadians 
should realize that churches have played an instrumental role in 
the development of this country through an education system which 
without them would have been feeble and non-existent in many 
parts of Canada at crucial times in our history.  This point is 
irrefutable and the country will always owe the churches of this 
country a debt of thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of Confederation the Constitution Act, 1867 gave 
provinces exclusive jurisdiction over education with two 
exceptions: the protection of denomination rights existing in law 
at the time of Confederation and a federal remedial role in 
protecting denominational education rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As each of the next five provinces joined Canada its terms of 
union either adopted or adapted this approach to education. 
However, different circumstances in various provinces resulted in 
only four provinces with denominational education by the time 
Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original term 17 guaranteed a system of education based on 
religious denomination in that province.  Publicly funded schools 
were operated by several denominations.  A non-denominational 
public school system similar to the systems in other provinces 
did not exist in Newfoundland. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969 the Anglican, Presbyterian, Salvation Army and United 
Churches joined to establish one integrated system of schools.  A 
constitutional amendment in 1987 added the Pentecostal Assemblies 
of Newfoundland as a class with denominational education rights 
under the term.  By 1987 there were four separate denominational 
school systems in Newfoundland, integrated, Pentecostal, Roman 
Catholic and Seventh-Day Adventist. These denominations made 
decisions with respect to the appointment of school board 
members, the location of schools, the certification and selection 
of teachers and all other decisions required for the 
administration of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador appointed 
the Williams royal commission to study the delivery of 
educational programs.  The commission's final report called for 
fundamental and substantial reforms of the province's education 
system.  It recommended significant changes to the powers 
exercised by the denominations with respect to the administration 
of schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chairman Dr. Len Williams has said that a scarcity of resources 
kept Newfoundland from establishing a non-denominational school 
system parallel to the denominational system.  For three years 
following the reports released in 1992, the Government of 
Newfoundland sought unsuccessfully to reach agreement with the 
denominations to restructure the school system.  Finally, it 
drafted a new education model for the province that would retain 
the denominational character of the current system but which 
would provide the provincial legislature with additional powers 
to organize and administer education in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new model was approved by referendum and passed by 
resolution in the house of assembly.  The house of assembly 
requested that Parliament change term 17 to accommodate the new 
education model.  This was done in 1996.  The term, as amended in 
1996, ensures that all publicly funded schools are denominational 
and creates two types of schools, interdenominational schools and 
schools operated for children of a single denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A conflict arose, however.  As the government attempted to 
implement the new model, it felt that the school board should 
optimize student educational opportunity while recognizing the 
constitutional rights of certain denominations to have separate 
denominational schools.  Some denominations felt that the right 
to uni-denominational schools took precedence over educational 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The catholic and Pentecostal denominations received an 
injunction from the Newfoundland supreme court, which agreed that 
implementing the new model was a violation of their 
constitutionally guaranteed rights.  The court ruled that the 
1996 amendment gives precedence to uni-denominational rights over 
maximizing educational opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the Government of Newfoundland complied with 
the ruling and proposed a rewording of term 17, which was 
approved by referendum with 73% of voters in favour.  The 
Newfoundland House of Assembly then voted unanimously to approve 
a resolution in favour of the rewording of term 17.  The house of 
assembly has asked Parliament to change term 17 to reflect the 
new wording. The special joint committee has studied the issue 
and its report and recommendation are before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that complex issues arise from our consideration of 
the request from the Newfoundland House of Assembly.  There are 
many and often conflicting questions surrounding religion, 
constitutional rights and responsibility and even the quality of 
democracy in these events which I have just discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our responsibility as parliamentarians to answer these 
questions well.  Nothing less than the aspirations of the people 
of Newfoundland are at stake in this House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland are entering the 21st century feeling 
uncertainty and hope.  They realize that excellence in education 
is key to ensuring that Newfoundland stays in step with a world 
marching out of this century faster than when it marched in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duly elected Government of Newfoundland has proposed changes 
in education designed to propel it into the next century. 
Although the bilateral amending formula under section 43 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982 does not require a referendum to be held 
in order to make constitutional amendments such as the one before 
us, the people of Newfoundland were given the opportunity and 
clearly voted in favour of the measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland have been trying to improve their 
education system for a long time. 
Education reform has been one of the key markers of this decade 
for Newfoundlanders.  It is clear there is a passionate desire in 
that province to improve its system of education. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations remained difficult for years following the Williams 
royal commission and aspirations for improvements by all parties 
in education were halted.  The duly elected government has taken 
steps it believes will ensure that improvement and necessary 
efficiencies come about in this area, and they have been approved 
by popular referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legitimate questions have been raised about the validity of that 
referendum. The New Democratic Party believes that constitutional 
change must be carried out in a way that is open and democratic 
with meaningful involvement and participation of all Canadians. 
It must be said that a majority of the population took part in 
this referendum and a large majority of voters who took part 
voted in favour of the changes to term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analysis of the vote provided to the special joint committee 
showed that a majority of the voters in 47 out of 48 districts 
voted in favour of the question.  This includes districts where 
the majority of the voters were Roman Catholic.  Roman Catholics 
represent the largest denomination in the province at 37% of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that voter turnout in many districts was less than 
50%.  However, there is nothing to show that people were 
prevented from voting.  It remains the responsibility and a right 
of citizens to participate in our precious democracy.  It remains 
the best method of consultation we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some denominational interests that appeared before the committee 
argued that the referendum question left the impression that 
unidenominational education courses would be allowed, that the 
actual text of the proposed resolution was released too late in 
the referendum process to allow for full debate, that religious 
denominations opposed to the amendment were denied government 
funding and that scrutineers were not allowed.  They also 
objected to government funding and advertising in favour of the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, proponents disagreed on these matters.  The 
Newfoundland elections act does not mandate public funding for 
the various positions.  An expert in the international protection 
of human rights, international law, constitutional law, civil 
liberties and anti-discrimination law told the committee that she 
believed that Newfoundlanders were consulted in the ongoing 
process of educational reform.  These consultations included 
public hearings, two referendums and an election which in part 
turned on the government's educational agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party acknowledges that in Newfoundland there 
exists a broad consensus in support of the proposals of the 
government to reform the education system in that province.  We 
are satisfied that knowledge of the wishes of the people of 
Newfoundland on this question was obtained through the best 
democratic means available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment before us gives the provincial legislature 
exclusive authority to make laws in relation to education but 
shall provide for courses in religion that are not specific to a 
religious denomination.  Religious observances shall be permitted 
in a school where requested by parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Denominational interests felt the current denominational system 
could not be adequately replaced by a provincially run system 
which includes courses not specific to religious denomination. 
The Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland and the provincial 
Pentecostal education committee were fearful of what this would 
do to the role of their religion in the proposed school system. 
Its representative said:  “Traditional arguments favouring a 
single public system centre on perceived problems of 
fragmentation and intolerance.  What is not considered, however, 
is the negative impact on children of ignoring throughout their 
school the most powerful influence in many lives, their religious 
faith”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representative went on to say:  “One's religious heritage 
and faith contributes immensely to one's personal and social 
identity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland minister of education told the committee that 
while not guaranteed under the proposed new term, there is 
provision for locally developed religious education courses on to 
the department of education's current local course policy.  Where 
the school board determines that such a local course would be 
desirable then there will be locally developed religious 
education courses geared to a specific denomination and offered 
in the school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others noted that exempting children from religious courses and 
religious observances, which the courts interpret as including 
opening exercises, may be considered inconsistent with charter 
provisions and values.  Others stated that the provisions could 
be implemented in a way that would take into account previous 
court decisions on these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thoughtful presentations were made to the committee that 
minority rights were being sacrificed in favour of the wishes of 
the majority. 
The protection of minority rights is an important aspect of our 
democracy and one which must be cared for with vigilance.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from several presenters concerned with this 
issue, such as the Roman Catholic Education Committee of the 
Denomination Education Commission.  Its representative said the 
amendment completely eliminates Newfoundland parents' 
constitutional rights to choose publicly funded denomination or 
separate schools for their children.  They also said that the 
religious education program referred to in the proposed term is 
limited to a non-denominational, religiously neutral program like 
those in public schools in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada.  They 
feel strongly that this is a radical shift from what has been the 
status quo in Newfoundland for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly a different issue for reasonable people on both 
sides of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland and Labrador Human Rights Association told the 
committee that they are concerned about any effort to take away 
rights, but there are occasions when the rights of others, 
including the rights of the majority, demand the removal or 
curtailment of a right.  It felt the process in Newfoundland had 
been well argued, debated and thought out over a number of years. 
The association supported the amendment saying “with good faith 
on all sides we can develop a publicly funded, non-denominational 
system which includes all people and faiths without special 
privileges for some churches”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A representative of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association 
told the committee that this amendment represents real progress. 
He said “The state of equality and fairness can only benefit by 
the abolition of special preferences for any denomination group 
even if those denomination groups happen to comprise a large 
percentage of the population.  This is an advance, as far as we 
are concerned, for the state of religious equality and 
fairness”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the proposed term 17 removes constitutional privileges 
available to particular denominations, these privileges have not 
been available to all religions.  The committee was told that 
this amendment makes all religions equal, none possessing 
ownership over the primary means of delivering education in the 
province, yet all with the same rights to deliver denominational 
education without public funding.  Further, any future government 
has the ability to extend public funding to denominational 
schools if it desires to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been argued that the constitution is a living 
document that must reflect changes in society.  Newfoundlanders 
who make up these denominations have democratically requested 
constitutional change in their status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of this is that the Roman Catholic community has 
launched a court challenge to the amendment of the term.  The 
Pentecostal Assemblies have not taken similar action but made it 
clear to the committee its preference that this amendment be 
delayed pending the court's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was told by several presenters that international 
covenants on human rights state that human rights are protected 
adequately by ensuring freedom of religion and non-interference 
of religious education and a dissemination of religious views to 
children from parents.  The proposed amendment is consistent with 
these values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the amendment before us not be precedent 
setting for religious or minority rights in other provinces.  To 
that end, the unique history and political circumstances of 
Newfoundland will ensure that no such precedent will exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland's minister of education explained to the committee 
that many people believe this amendment will affect 
denominational rights in other provinces because of the language 
found in section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  The section 
specifies that provincial legislation regarding education cannot 
prejudicially affect a right or privilege with respect to 
denominational schools held by a class of persons at the time of 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, term 17 only addresses the specific circumstances found 
in Newfoundland at the time of union, so it replaces section 93. 
The rights protected in Newfoundland and Labrador are different 
and not comparable to the rights that were guaranteed in other 
provinces.  As a result, rights which apply generally to other 
provinces cannot be applied to Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party accepts that these rights will not be 
adversely affected in other parts of Canada as a result of this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After careful consideration of this issue, the special joint 
committee supports the passage of this resolution amending term 
17.  The New Democratic Party believes there is broad consensus 
for this change and that these changes will not be precedent 
setting for religious or minority rights in other provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to consider something only in the context of 
the unique history and political circumstances of Newfoundland. 
However, we recognize that this issue creates strong feelings and 
passion.  Questions surrounding religion and rights often do. The 
New Democratic Party respects these beliefs and it may be that 
some members may deviate from the party's position on the 
amendment if they feel compelled to do so.  However, all members 
have in their hearts the aspirations of the people of 
Newfoundland.

fairly described the historical context of the debate and the 
importance of this change to the province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think she also understands how different the situation is in 
Newfoundland from any other province in this country and how 
important it is for our constitution to be living, flexible and 
able to change when the provinces make the case that their people

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want her to know that I agree not only with her historical 
perspective, but also with her hope that the people of

which is unique to that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will deal with much of the frustration and anxieties about 
which we have heard.  We can set them aside.  The divisiveness of

</I></B></P><P align=left>When these social programs like medicare were introduced years 
ago Ottawa paid a large portion of the bills, and that was how

that belonged to the provinces like health care and education. 
Today Ottawa still wants to control the programs but it has cut 
the transfers to pay for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government think that the premiers will 
allow it to micro manage social programs after having gutted the

<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

standards and they want the federal government to work in 
partnership with the provinces.  This is exactly what we are 
doing and what we will continue to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

started out the federal government agreed to pay 50% of the 
approved costs.  This year the federal government is down to 
paying 10% of the cash required to run hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers want to talk about one of the key areas in this 
Calgary declaration, the seventh point, about genuinely 
respecting provincial jurisdiction.

it is odd that the hon. Leader of the Opposition would raise this 
issue on the very day on which we are introducing the amendment 
to increase the transfers to provinces next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of next year, indeed as of this fiscal year, we will be 
transferring the cash portion of $12.5 billion to provinces, an 
increase over what had been intended because this government puts 
a priority on health care.  It puts a priority on preserving and 
strengthening medicare in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one answer to this federal-provincial relations problem 
in social programs and that is rebalancing the federal and 
provincial powers.  This is a unifying concept that has support 
in Quebec, more support than the symbolic recognition of distinct 
society and uniqueness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rebalancing of powers is something that both helps social 
programs and unites the country.

reaching an agreement with Canada.

the justice minister is unconcerned about innocent men, women and

the minister's own office indicates that not only are the 
conditional sentences not being monitored but also there is no 
offence for a breach, which is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the justice minister one more time.  Will she amend this

conditional sentencing is working well. However, we have decided 
to monitor the use of conditional sentences very closely.  I want

recently grounded our Sea Kings so that we could check them out

termed the spring gap, those ten weeks yearly when, as a result of

Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, to introduce 
an amendment to this act to eliminate a rule known as the intensity 
rule, which imposes a sliding scale—from 55% to 50%—in the

Bill C-298, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, 1997 
(qualifying for benefit). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, this bill, which seeks to ease the 
qualifying rules, is part of a concerted action by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It proposes, among other measures, to correct two inequities 
affecting newcomers on the labour market, people who return to the 
labour market after two years absence and women who stay at home to 
raise their children. 
These people must work 910 hours, instead of 420 to 700 hours, depending 
on the regional rate applicable to other workers. This creates two 
categories of unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also seeks to eliminate the two categories of unemployed 
created by the current legislation, namely those who worked 700 hours 
and those who worked less than 700 hours. It is impossible for those who 
worked less than 700 hours to obtain parental leave or sick leave. This 
is why we must support this bill.

this fund should be separate from the federal government's general 
operating budget, as opposed to the present state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is twofold:  first, to give the 
Employment Insurance Commission exclusive authority for setting 
premium rates; second, to ensure that there is a specific 
Employment Insurance appropriation account, for the very purpose of 
preventing the Liberal government and perhaps others from 
continuing to dip blithely into the fund belonging to workers and 
employers.

generous man, and I am obviously referring to the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, I am pleased 
to introduce a bill to amend the refund level. 
The purpose of my bill is to allow those with insurable 
earnings under $5,000 to obtain a refund of their EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to extend this refund to all persons 
whose insurable earnings are less than $5,000 so that this measure 
applies to the majority of those who pay premiums without 
qualifying for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a generous bill.  It is a bill with a social

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND)

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today I will be sharing my time with the very distinguished 
member from the great and historic riding of Saint John, New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am standing here for the final time to state my opposition to 
what the House is doing before we take the vote tomorrow evening 
on the proposed amendment to term 17, which is going to wipe out 
forever our province's denominational schools. The right to those 
schools is held by the various faith groups, as we are all aware, 
and there has been absolutely no attempt to get the permission of 
these groups before we forge ahead with what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador held a 
general referendum wherein the rights of the minority were 
subject to the will of the majority.  Ultimately the courts will 
decide on the legitimacy of taking away a minority right without 
the demonstrated consent of the minority.  Such a case is 
currently before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind the House that the supreme court did rule on the 
consensus required to amend the constitution back in Prime 
Minister Trudeau's day.  However, it remains to be seen if the 
court will rule on the scope and nature of the consensus required 
to wipe out a minority right.  Yet we are plunging ahead today 
anyway.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are all aware, the school system in Newfoundland, the 
Christian based schooling of Newfoundlanders, will be a thing of 
the past when this amendment passes.  Religious instruction will 
be replaced with courses about religion and I, as one citizen, do 
not regard that as progress or reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week or so ago I had the opportunity to serve on the joint 
Senate-House of Commons committee that was holding hearings on 
the proposed amendment to term 17.  The MP for Burin—St. 
George's was our regular representative on that committee, but he 
was travelling in Atlantic Canada with the federal fisheries 
committee and I had the opportunity to take his place for a 
while. I would like to share some of the impressions arising from 
my service on that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were passionate presentations before the committee from 
Newfoundlanders who were for and against this amendment.  I was 
around for about 15 or 20 presentations. The 
Newfoundland-Labrador Teachers Association, the Integrated 
Education Committee, the Education First group, which I did not 
hear, all spoke strongly in support of the elimination of the 
denominational system of education.  We heard representatives of 
the Seventh-Day Adventists, the Pentecostal Assemblies and the 
catholics who vigorously defended the maintenance of these 
denominational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the week the committee received a second visit 
from Newfoundland's minister of education, Roger Grimes, but I do 
not feel the minister's second visit was in response to the 
presentations made by Newfoundlanders.  I feel the minister's 
visit was prompted by testimony from a couple of professors from 
New Brunswick.  I want to elaborate a bit on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Donald J. Fleming of the University of New Brunswick, 
faculty of law, and Dr. Patrick Malcolmson, associate professor 
of political science from St. Thomas University in Fredericton, 
had earlier given presentations on the legal implications of the 
new proposed term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no legal background and I have no great legal knowledge. 
I am repeating what I heard from these gentlemen. The bottom line 
on those presentations was that our new term 17 will be subject 
to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that the 
term's clauses will be interpreted by the courts in accordance 
with the provisions of the charter. The original term 17 and the 
most recent term we had, the Clyde Wells amendment as I like to 
call it, were exempt from the scrutiny of the charter because of 
the original Confederation compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1867 the Confederation compromise meant a guarantee of 
catholic minority rights in Ontario and protestant minority 
rights in Quebec.  In Newfoundland that meant a guarantee of 
denominational rights for a number of Christian denominations at 
the time of Confederation back in 1949.  Because these 
Confederation rights were established before the charter came 
into being, the provisions of the charter do not apply to these 
particular rights.  Confederation rights are not subject to the 
charter of rights and freedoms, and of course we all agree that 
is why catholic education today survives in an Ontario education 
system that is otherwise completely secular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new term 17 before us today rejects the denominationalism of 
the original Confederation compromise and is exempt from scrutiny 
of the charter.  Therefore in any future court case provisions in 
the new term 17 for religious education and observances will be 
subject to the charter.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I do not have any legal background.  I am simply 
repeating what I have heard these very learned and distinguished 
gentlemen say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that the new term 17 rejects the denominational wisdom 
of the original Confederation compromise and is not exempt from 
scrutiny of the charter of rights and freedoms.  Therefore in any 
future court case provisions in the new term 17 for religious 
education and observances will be subject to the charter of 
rights and freedoms.  In other words, no matter what the 
intention of the Newfoundland government or the intention of the 
Newfoundland people, it is the Supreme Court of Canada which will 
eventually decide the scope and nature of religious education and 
observances in our new Newfoundland school system.  That is why 
so many people in Newfoundland object to what is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his second presentation to the committee the minister of 
education spoke with passion to the effect that he believed the 
Newfoundland people did not want a totally secular, godless 
school system.  That is the way he put it.  He was back to defend 
their position.  As evidence of that he pointed to the relevant 
sections of term 17 which provide for courses in religion and 
religious observances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing we have to remember is that the minister of education 
spoke as a politician.  He did not speak as a lawyer, he did not 
speak as a supreme court judge, he spoke as a politician.  I 
expected him, on his return visit to the committee, to come 
backed up with a battery of legal arguments about the relevant 
sections of term 17 and how these relevant sections could 
withstand a charter challenge in the courts. However, that was 
not the case.  It was not the case because the Minister of 
Education could not make these legal arguments to say that the 
new terms would not be subject to the charter of rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made no secret of the fact that I support denominational 
rights for the people who want to maintain and exercise those 
rights.  However, assuming that the new term 17 is approved in 
its present form, as it appears before the House, I am not going 
to take any great satisfaction from the courts eventually ruling 
that our new system of education in Newfoundland has to be 
totally secular.  I will not take any great satisfaction from 
that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope the minister is right and that the courts will 
allow for some expression of religion in our schools. However, I 
know what we do have and I am not willing to pin the future 
spiritual education of our children on a hope.  In other words, 
my short service on the term 17 committee has only strengthened 
my intention to vote no when this matter finally comes to a vote.

was such that in the eyes of the witnesses any constitutional 
provision that was made post charter, in other words post 1982, 
could be called into question as to being in violation of the 
charter because it was not part of the pre-Confederation 
compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment if during the course of the 
testimony, expert witnesses provided opinions as to whether or 
not the charter itself would be encompassed within the 
Constitution.  The charter itself having been enacted in 1982 is 
a post-Confederation compromise.  The expert witnesses provided 
testimony that anything that was post Confederation could be in 
violation with some other aspects of the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like the member to comment on in 
addition to whether or not the charter itself falls within the 
purview of the Constitution or is not in itself challengeable is 
whether or not the hon. member believes that the Pentecostal 
denomination should indeed or actually has denominational rights 
protected under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is aware that the Pentecost faith denomination 
received Constitution protection in 1987.  I believe it was Mr. 
Fleming who appeared before the committee and stated emphatically 
that in his opinion, given the fact that the constitutional 
protections to the Pentecostal denomination were provided for in 
1987, he feels extremely strongly that the Pentecosts should not 
have any constitutional protection whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not absolutely sure 
if I understand what the hon. member is getting at, nor do I 
think anyone else understands it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was made perfectly clear to all of us at that committee 
meeting that these two very distinguished gentlemen, Professor 
Malcolmson I believe and Professor Fleming, that the provisions of 
the new term 17 were subject to the scrutiny of the charter of 
rights and freedoms.  It would have been very appropriate on some 
of these questions that the member and other members are asking 
if this court case had been settled and allowed to go ahead and a 
decision brought down before we proceeded with what we are doing 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pentecostal Assemblies he makes reference to were given 
constitutional protection back in 1987.  There is no dispute 
regarding the fact that their rights are protected under the 
Constitution of Canada.  Once this amendment goes ahead, they 
certainly will not protected. All members are fully aware that 
what we have now is not subject to the scrutiny of the charter. 
Any new amendment, such as the one today, will be subject to the 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have any great legal background.  I am only speaking 
after what people such as Malcolmson and Fleming had to say on 
this particular subject. They made it perfectly clear that it 
will be subject to the charter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like my 
hon. friend from Newfoundland, I am also opposed to term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do today is take a look at where this country 
has gone over the last 20 to 30 years and what it has done to our 
young people of today. I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is a 
major concern to me when I look at the direction in which so many 
of our young people are going.   We are not supposed to show them 
any moral values. We are not supposed to talk about religion any 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when we went to school it was there and it was good for us. 
It was very good for us.  We did not have a Morgentaler looking 
over the House of Parliament.  We did not have abortions taking 
place.  We did not have any of these things.  So we just have to 
take a look at today's society and ask ourselves in which 
direction has it been going.  Let me tell you, it has been going 
in the wrong direction and this term 17 is taking us further down 
that wrong road.  It is time for us to turn it around.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to address is the fact that one wants to take a look 
at what the Newfoundland government did in order to get this 
through and to bring it here before this government. I want to 
bring attention to the following points respecting the proposed 
amendment of term 17 of the terms of the union of Newfoundland 
with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1995 the Government of Newfoundland announced that a 
referendum would be held on September 5 of that year to seek 
approval from the electorate to limit the power of Catholic and 
Pentecostal churches to operate separate denominational schools. 
The process involved an amendment to term 17 of the terms of the 
union of Newfoundland with Canada which had provided certain 
guarantees of rights of parents to denominational education of 
their children.  They should always have that right.  Always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of the ensuing referendum was a majority vote of 54% 
of the 52% of the eligible voters who cast their ballots in 
favour of the proposed amendment.  Term 17 was amended 
accordingly by Parliament and became law on April 21, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland amended its own legislation to 
bring into effect the limitation of denominational education 
which is now permitted under term 17.  However in its haste to 
use its newly acquired powers to eliminate religious education by 
denominations in as many schools as possible, it failed to comply 
with the statutes and regulations it had enacted to attain its 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence an application was made to the Supreme Court of 
Newfoundland on behalf of aggrieved citizens alleging violation 
of the law and discrimination by government against members of 
the Catholic and Pentecostal churches. Mr. Justice Leo Barry 
upheld their petition and granted them injunctive relief. In his 
judgment filed July 8, 1997 the learned judge roundly criticized 
government for utilizing unlawful and discriminatory measures to 
implement the provisions of term 17 as amended.  That came from 
Justice Leo Barry whom many of us respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having frustrated its own efforts to change the educational 
system the government blamed its failure upon the Catholic and 
Pentecostal denominations.  It then called a new referendum 
requesting public approval to abolish denominational education 
altogether without having given the amended term 17 a reasonable 
trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are some of the questionable measures taken by 
government to gain a majority vote in the second referendum.  In 
a democracy I cannot believe that any government would support 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 31, 1997 the government announced that the referendum 
would be held on September 2 next, giving the public a mere 32 
days to analyse what it believed would be the government's 
proposed amendment and prepare campaigns to express and promote 
their views.  It failed to inform the public of the text of the 
proposed amendment to term 17 until August 25, just 12 days 
before the referendum. For persons voting in the advance poll 
this meant a notice of less than two days.  Try that one in the 
next federal election and see what happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It declared as one of its reasons to abolish denominational 
religious education in schools that Newfoundland's standard of 
pre-university education was low, intolerably low and that it 
would be greatly improved by getting rid of church influences in 
our schools. However the truth is that the standard of education 
for schools in the province of Newfoundland rates third highest 
across the whole of Canada and that is because they have 
denominational schools and for no other reason.  And they are 
going to lower that standard as well. I want to say as well that 
they rank third despite the fact that they have such a large 
number of rural schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government informed the public that the cost that 
denominational schooling adds to the general system of education 
is intolerably high.  The fact is that the cost of education on a 
per capita basis in Newfoundland is the lowest in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So tell us why they would want to take out the denominational 
schools and the rights for other people in Newfoundland. 
They have the lowest cost per capita yet they are ranked third 
highest when it comes to their educational system.  So tell us 
why.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present denominational schools can only be established where 
viable and where numbers warrant.  This places upon the 
government the responsibility to ensure that costs will not 
reasonably increase.  Its power to do this is unquestionable. 
From the day it announced the referendum, government utilized 
public moneys and resources to finance and support its own 
campaign but it gave absolutely nothing to the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future.  I travelled 
this country from coast to coast.  I was in Newfoundland. 
Students from Memorial University sat with me that day.  I was 
only supposed to be there for four hours.  They asked me to stay 
overnight so I could talk to them.  They said they wanted to talk 
about their country.  They were very special. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future we were told by 
experts that we have a big problem in Canada, that the big 
problem is the charter of rights and freedoms because we did not 
bring in responsibilities for all of them. Yet we are saying what 
we are going to do is what Newfoundland is doing now.  We are 
going to let the Supreme Court of Canada make all the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that those who are sitting on the government 
side in this House of Commons cannot see what a backward step we 
are taking when we eliminate denominational schools.  I ask the 
government from the bottom of my heart to help our children 
today, to guide our children today, to give them the opportunity 
to pick up God's word in that Bible.  It should be in every 
school.  I feel very sorry for anyone who votes against it and I 
feel very sorry for the children of Newfoundland, as I do for 
children in other provinces across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Questions and 
comments.  We have a fair amount of activity in questions and 
comments so I will ask everybody to keep questions and responses 
very brief.  We will start with the member for Calgary Southeast, 
then we will go to the member for Broadview—Greenwood, and then 
we will go to the hon. member for Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. lady for her very principled remarks as well 
as those of the hon. member for St. John's East who I gather is 
the only elected politician from Newfoundland either here or in 
the provincial legislature who has taken a position of principle 
and courage by posing this proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Shame, shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B> He will be treated well by history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the cheap partisan heckling that is 
coming from the other side on an issue that really should 
transcend partisanship. I am a pretty partisan member of this 
place but on issues like this one, when the hon. member is 
speaking from the heart on principle, to be shouting shame and so 
forth is totally out of place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the proposed new term 17, provisions are made for religious 
education and religious observances in the schools, which the 
hon. member for St. John's East spoke to.  Does the member 
believe these provisions will provide the kind of guarantee of 
access to truly religious education that were guaranteed— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member from the Reform Party for his question.  No, I do not 
believe that.  There is no way.  There is absolutely nothing in 
term 17 that will guarantee there will be religious 
denominational teaching as we know it today through our 
Pentecostal churches, through our Catholic churches, our 
Protestant churches, no.  It is not—

she will on this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is a seasoned politician in this country and she 
knows the campaign skills of the premier of Newfoundland, Brian

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member of Parliament who has this experience in 
campaign organizing not believe that the expertise of Premier 
Tobin, probably one of the best political organizers in Canada, 
went a long way in making sure these percentages were such as 
they were? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I certainly do. There 
is no question about that.  I know myself, when I was mayor of 
the city of Saint John, I used to go to Mr. Tobin when he was in 
opposition to help me win certain things for my city. However, I 
have to say that the way in which it was handled was 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would not permit any scrutineers to be present in the 
balloting booths during the voting process or during the counting 
of the ballots or to oversee the measures taken for the security 
of the ballot boxes.  Never have I seen anything like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for saying that he is there with 
us all the way.  I appreciate that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as a Roman Catholic Newfoundlander, I appreciate the 
comments from those outside my province who are suggesting that 
the will and the wishes of the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador are easily manipulated.  I however do not hold that 
view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that the election process was handled with proper regard 
to the intellect of Newfoundland and Labradorians.  I feel very 
strongly that the hon. member should interject with the fact that 
perhaps the reason why Newfoundland and Labrador has the third 
best education system in the country is that the teachers of the 
province who came before this committee on which we sat hearing 
evidence for three weeks suggested that this amendment should go 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to say that if I 
were a teacher, knowing the Premier of Newfoundland as well as I 
do, under his government I would not dare oppose anything he said 
or I would not have a job tomorrow.  There is no wonder they went 
before them and said yes.  I would not lay too much on that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say this.  I am pleased but I want to say one thing to 
the hon. member from Newfoundland.  I had a letter sent to me 
from a man whom I highly respect and I am sure members do as 
well.  That man is from Saint John, New Brunswick.  He is head of 
our catholic church and he said that, if this goes through, there 
is no protection for any minorities including— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Laval West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to join the debate on this very important 
issue today.  This debate represents the second time in this 36th 
Parliament that this House has been asked to vote on 
constitutional amendments to reform school systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this coincidence marks a first for successive 
constitutional amendments.  Let me also add as an aside that this 
coincidence certainly speaks volumes to those who say that our 
system of government is unresponsive and that our constitution is 
inflexible.  To the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, let me first deal with the process necessary to 
enact this constitutional amendment.  Section 43 of the 
constitution provides that bilateral amendments can be made with 
the consent of the legislature of the provinces affected and of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland legislature gave its consent by a unanimous 
vote on September 5, 1997.  I realize that it is too much to hope 
that this place would also show its unanimous support for the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador in their desire to modernize 
their education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let me mention some interesting facts about the vote in 
the Newfoundland legislature.  There were members of the 
legislature who campaigned against the resolution in the 
preceding referendum.  Once the results of the referendum were 
in, they voted for it in accordance with the democratically 
expressed wishes of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MLAs who are members of communities affected by this resolution 
voted for it.  They included Roman Catholics, Anglicans and 
Pentecostals.  As federal politicians from across the country, we 
must remember that these provincial MLAs and their constituents 
are responsible to the very people affected by this resolution 
and to the very people who, furthermore, have directly been 
consulted about this issue through provincial election and 
through the schools referendum. 
Those MLAs and their constituents have voted in favour of this 
amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel we must very clear on the role that federal MPs should 
play in this debate on a subject of provincial jurisdiction.  As 
an Ontario MP, for example, I would not appreciate members of 
Parliament from Alberta or Nova Scotia telling me what was best 
or good for the people of Waterloo—Wellington. I would ask my 
hon. colleagues in this House to consider this in placing their 
vote on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that some of my colleagues will also be speaking to 
the appropriate role of federal politicians in a debate of this 
importance.  One hundred and thirty years after Confederation it 
is appropriate that federal politicians do not play a 
paternalistic role in constitutional amendments.  I would argue 
that it is not appropriate that any member of this place cast 
their vote based on their decision that this resolution is or is 
not good for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue rather that as federal politicians we need to 
consider the following issues.  First, have the the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador been consulted on this issue?  Second, 
have the communities directly affected by this change and 
challenge been consulted?   Third, have these communities 
consented to this change?  The answer, as members know, is 
affirmative to all these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am relying on the report of the special joint committee on 
this issue, as tabled in this House.  In that multiparty report, 
the committee recommends the resolution and states “the 
consensus in Newfoundland and Labrador is such that the federal 
Houses of Parliament should endorse the amendment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard from two witnesses whom I consider to be 
experts on minority rights.  The Newfoundland and Labrador Human 
Rights Association stated the following about minority rights: 
“After 150 years it does not seem unreasonable to stop and 
consider our denominational system in the context of a society 
that is no longer exclusively Christian and a society where the 
religious rights of all citizens are protected by section 2 of 
the charter of rights and freedoms”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second witness whom I would like to try and bring to the 
attention of this House is Mr. Allan Borovoy of the Canadian 
Civil Liberties Association.  Mr. Borovoy, as members know, has a 
reputation as an astute and dedicated advocate of civil liberties 
and has appeared before committees of this House on many 
occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the special joint committee quotes from Mr. 
Borovoy, page 9: “The state of equality and fairness can only 
benefit by the abolition of special preferences for any 
denominational groups even if those denominations happen to 
comprise a large percentage of the population.  This is an 
advance, as far as we are concerned, for the state of religious 
equality and fairness”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does not have these minority rights?  These people are the 
true minorities of Newfoundland and Labrador.  The Jewish 
community does not have denominational schools at this time.  The 
Baptist community, representing .2% of the population, does not 
have denominational schools.  The Pentecostal community, 
representing 7% of the population, does have denominational 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation may represent a historic compromise among 
religious groups but it cannot be considered a true 
minority-majority situation, nor an equitable use of scarce 
educational dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in any debate on minority-majority distinction, many numbers 
are thrown out justifying each side of the debate.  In supporting 
this resolution personally, I am relying on the following facts. 
The first is that 96% of the population have denominational 
privileges.  Second, 74% of the population supported this 
resolution in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to my last point.  Recently Mr. Clyde Wells, the 
former premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, was in Ottawa and 
spoke to this issue at a debate organized by my colleagues across 
the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wells made the following points:  There are 573,000 people 
in Newfoundland, roughly the same size as my part of Ontario, 
Waterloo region and Wellington county, and yet there are more 
school boards per capita than in almost anywhere else in this 
country.  Newfoundland has currently divided its educational 
budget among 27 school boards in 700 communities along 10,000 
miles of coastline.  Why is there such duplication and overlap in 
this province which is already reeling from economic troubles? 
What is the logical solution to this situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to this House that the logical solution is the present 
resolution. This resolution represents a compromise of years of 
public debate, a democratic referendum result of 74% and a 
unanimous vote in the provincial legislature. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will continue to look after the interests of 
all Canadians. Canada's past was remarkable, its future will be even 
more so.

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a comment and a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment is that the hon. member remarked on how education is 
a matter of provincial jurisdiction.  I think he threw some 
question on the fact of whether some of us should even be 
debating this given that it is such a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment is before this place precisely because 
the Fathers of Confederation originally in section 93 of the BNA 
and then in term 17 of 1949 decided that while education ought to 
be a provincial responsibility, this place, this Parliament ought 
to be the ultimate protector of the minority against the wishes 
of the majority when it comes to the nature, character and 
guarantees for denominational education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question follows from that.  The hon. member also suggested 
that there are certain minority groups, sectarian groups such as 
Jews and others, who are left out of the denominational education 
provisions in the original term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with me and many Newfoundlanders 
that the best way to repair that inequity is not to collapse the 
rights for some, but to expand the rights so that they include 
all?  Would the hon. member support an effort to broaden the 
effect of term 17 so that it would provide the right to access 
denominational, publicly funded schools for all sectarian 
minorities and not just those so specified in the original term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the hon. 
member opposite for the question.  As a former secondary school 
teacher, I am well aware of the jurisdictional split with respect 
to the provinces and the federal government on the issue of 
education.  I am quite cognizant of what needs to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the key in all of this is the fact that the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador were consulted and they spoke very loud 
in terms of what they wanted.  I think it is very important to 
listen to what they had to say.  In fact, that is precisely why 
this resolution is proceeding, because we listened closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of fairness and equity, this resolution now 
should proceed accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the fact that he would not 
like someone from another province interfering and that he would 
not want to interfere in the business of another province, or 
something of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the hon. member that the question of the 
constitution is a Canadian concept.  It does not belong to just 
one province.  As a result, I have received a number of letters, 
in bundles of 25 and 49,  from a minority group in Saskatchewan 
asking if the passing of this particular motion in any way 
endangers their minority position of operating a separate 
religious school in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was said, the majority of people have made a distinct 
decision in Nova Scotia.  What happens if that same concept was 
moved to the province of Alberta?  I am asking the member, could 
I really say that the passage of this bill will have no effect on 
that minority group in Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>    Mr. Speaker, I would point out to the 
hon. member that I think we are dealing with the situation in 
Newfoundland and Labrador today, not Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it was important that MLAs who in some cases 
campaigned against the resolution came in to the legislature of 
Newfoundland and Labrador and voted as they should, as their 
constituents wanted after having canvassed the province in a 
referendum with great interest .  Clearly, this is a very 
important debate.  I think it is appropriate that we now move on 
to ensure this is done for all Canadians and especially the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member to please answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that there is a political precedent being set here. 
There is no legal precedent and I think everybody knows that is 
the case.  Is there a political precedent and will it guarantee, 
as my hon. colleague has suggested, that this will not in any way 
jeopardize minority rights in other provinces?

the question.  I think the short answer is no.  We are responding 
to a request from the people of Newfoundland and Labrador who 
have spoken out very loudly in terms of what they want.  It is 
important that we listen to them and do the right thing, which in 
this case is to proceed with the resolution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me to add 
my voice and speak in this debate on the proposed amendment to term 17 
of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time that this matter is brought to our 
attention. I will therefore limit my comments to particular aspects of 
this debate, whose final stage is beginning in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussions around this issue these past few years clearly show 
that the vast majority of Newfoundlanders want to reform their education 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the context in which, in 1990, the Government of 
Newfoundland appointed a royal commission chaired by Dr. Len Williams, 
a former teacher, principal and president of the provincial teachers 
association. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report published two years later, the royal commission 
specifically recommended restructuring the education system in 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  In addition, one of its 
recommendations concerned the establishment of a single 
interdenominational school system comprising the four separate 
denominational systems already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seen as a compromise, an initial amendment to term 17 approved 
by the people in a referendum two years ago was unable to rally 
all stakeholders in the Newfoundland educational community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, an injunction which was sought by representatives 
of the catholic church was granted by the Newfoundland supreme 
court.  The consequence of the injunction was that it stalled the 
entire education reform process in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what happened next.  On July 31 Premier Tobin announced 
that a referendum would be held and in that public consultation 
73% of Newfoundlanders supported the proposed amendment to term 
17.  This proposal carried in 47 of the 48 ridings in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on the Newfoundland school issue is not a new one. 
Discussions, at times heated and passionate, have been going on for some 
time. That is why all I can tell those who claim that the people of 
Newfoundland had but a few days to read the question is that the people 
of Newfoundland and Labrador have in fact been discussing this issue for 
years. It is perfectly normal for any religious minority to try to 
protect its rights and to get the best possible protection for its 
rights. And its officials have a duty to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe however that the constitutional amendment proposal 
received from the Newfoundland government does not threaten in any way 
the situation of the various religious denominations in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must stress the fact that this amendment is in no way intended to 
ban religious education from the classroom in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, it ensures that religious education will be 
provided because, and I quote “religious observances shall be permitted 
in a school where requested by parents”. That is what subsection 17.3 
proposes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the new text specifies that religious 
instruction will be of a non-denominational nature.  Nevertheless 
the new term respects the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and international human rights conventions.  I would like to 
insist on the fact that it in no way forces children to take 
courses or to follow religious practices to which their parents 
would object. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland has told us that it is open to 
the role the churches are called on to play in the new education 
system.  Although the attribution of that role is not guaranteed 
in the constitution it does not diminish its importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The substantial support garnered by the proposal should convince 
everyone of the merit of this initiative, which does not aim to 
give one denomination an advantage over another but simply to 
give the Government of Newfoundland the opportunity to provide 
the province's children with a better quality of education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not negate, quite the contrary, that children already 
receive a good education.  However we have been told that the 
books in the schools date back to 1975.  One of the witnesses 
told us that she found in the library at her child's school that 
its most recent book on the history of Canada dated back to 1975. 
Obviously a great deal of reform needs to be done to that 
system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people expressed concerns about minority rights and their 
protection under the proposed amendment.  The hearings of the 
special joint committee on the amendment to term 17 nevertheless 
revealed to the members of the committee looking into the matter 
that these concerns were not shared by the people representing 
various organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland and Labrador Human Rights Association rightly 
stressed the protection enjoyed by the various religious groups 
under section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fédération des parents francophones de Terre-Neuve et du 
Labrador was satisfied with the protection afforded it under 
section 23 of the charter with respect to its language rights and 
with the policy of the Newfoundland government in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Labrador Metis Association endorsed the 
constitutional amendment.  The committee's report indicates that 
nothing in the proposal would threaten native rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is delighted by the clear support for this 
amendment by the people of Newfoundland.  We believe that the 
consultation process was fair, that the aim of this proposition was 
clear to all, that the question put to the public in the September 
2 referendum contained no ambiguity and that ample support has been 
gathered for the amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders and their government's request before parliament 
is a reflection of their will to move ahead on this matter.  Our 
government believes it has a duty to support this initiative, not 
only because of the popular support the proposal has obtained but 
in particular because Newfoundlanders, with the support of 
parliament, will be able to count on an education system that 
will reflect their specificity and take account of their 
priorities in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Newfoundlanders will be the first to benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also see in this question one more testimonial to the 
flexibility of our federation.  I am the member for Laval West, and 
we are well aware of the questions with which attempts are made to 
divide people on constitutional issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bilateral amendment process will make it possible for 
Newfoundland to reform its education system.  This is the same 
process which should enable Quebec to carry out its own education 
reforms, once the Senate has made its decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our political system thus enables each partner in our 
federation to have tools adapted to its own needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I invite my colleagues in this House to 
vote in favour of this constitutional amendment aimed at putting 
into place a unique Newfoundland school system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is an experienced legislator, perhaps not in this 
House but in another house, and is no doubt aware the curriculum 
that exists in the province of Ontario does not teach particular 
principles, values or ethics to children in grades 1 to 9.  In 
fact that curriculum suggests that a menu of values and 
principles be adopted, depending on what children think ought to 
be right for them.  There is no particular shared position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member suggest the religious education that will take 
place in Newfoundland under the new terms will be a menu of 
values and principles so that there is no particular common 
consensus?  In other words it will be difficult to determine what 
is right or wrong, given the curriculum.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question my hon. 
colleague has asked is a fundamental one.  It is my opinion, having 
worked for a number of years in favour of minority rights, in 
Quebec in particular, that where values are concerned, these do not 
differ regardless of our religion or nationality.  Whether 
Christian, Sikh, Muslim, Pentecostal or Roman Catholic, there is no 
difference. I sincerely believe that all people share the same 
values with respect to the fundamental rights of Canadians and the 
right to religion and the vital element of respect of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where Newfoundland is concerned, what its Minister of 
Education told us very clearly is that his department, and the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, were prepared to allow 
parents so desiring, not only religious instruction but also that 
“religious observances shall be permitted in a school where 
requested by parents”. That is a direct quote from term 17, as 
proposed by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.  The 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is therefore seen as 
willing, not to teach just anything, but to respond to the specific 
needs of parents on the one hand and to comply with the fundamental 
values accepted by all religions with members in Newfoundland and 
Labrador on the other. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand my hon. 
colleague correctly when she says the religious observances will 
be at the request of a parent.  However the proposed amendment in 
term 17 does not extend to the provision of religious education. 
She is perhaps in error and should reread that provision in the 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member thinks that everybody agrees on all this, would 
she then contradict Justice Wilson who said that there should not 
be any one concept of the good life? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not a question here of 
presenting just one concept of religion, life or philosophy with a 
capital P.  The object here is to meet the particular needs of the 
population of Newfoundland and Labrador, which has its own unique 
character, as do we all in our various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that population, there are groups with particular 
religious requirements.  According to the Minister of Education, 
who appeared before the committee, the religious instruction to be 
provided by schools in Newfoundland is very simple.  It would 
present the various concepts of religion, the fundamental values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, when it comes to fundamental values, I would like my 
colleague to tell me how the values of Roman Catholics are 
different from those of members of the Pentecostal Church, or those 
of the Jewish faith.  We all have values that are recognized as 
being humanitarian values respecting the rights of others.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Dauphin—Swan River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we again speak of Canada's constitutional change.  Today 
we speak of Newfoundland's term 17 amendment.  Last month the 
House addressed Quebec's section 93 to permit the arrangement of 
the education system along linguistic rather than religious 
lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the significance of these debates on both 
constitutional amendments this has been an historic session.  I 
am so very honoured to represent Edmonton East in this debate.  I 
am particularly honoured as the representative of my constituents 
to have been a member of the official opposition on both joint 
committees at which these amendments were debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take pride in being a Canadian in a country where any 
so-called commoner can aspire to a legislative role. 
Two short years ago, devoid of political stripe, I held my breath 
with millions of others as Canada barely survived Quebec's 
referendum vote.  Today I take part in a debate on the 
Constitution that guides our nation's laws and which helps to 
bind us together as a country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constitutional amendments affect us all. They alter our national 
rule book which forms the guiding principles for our provinces, 
territories and our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Constitution is not carved in stone.  Our Constitution is 
penned on fragile pulp.  Our Constitution has a permanency of 
time.  Our Constitution is the will of our nation's constructors. 
Our Constitution forms a framework supporting our national 
fabric. Our Constitution has the respect of our judiciary and our 
courts. Our Constitution supports provincial aspirations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should constitutions for all in Canada retain a permanency at 
the will of our elected majority if the majority be polled by 
national referendum?  The answer to this question is a resounding 
yes.  Democracy and Canada are synonymous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to my previous question was the term “for all”.  Our 
Constitution is important as a protection of the rights of all 
persons.  We must also remember that constitutions also exist to 
protect the some.  It is the some or the minority provisions that 
elevate Canada in the eyes of the world, that set Canada 
gloriously aside from all other nations on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great concern at this moment that what is before us is 
wrong.  Should we extinguish a minority with the power and might 
of all?  The process must include an expression of the will and 
in particular of the acceptance of the minority in order to 
consider the extinguishment of constitutionally protected 
minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been made abundantly clear through the course of the 
special joint committee meetings which I participated in that at 
least one of the minority groups, the Pentecostals, are not in 
favour of having their constitutionally entrenched minority 
rights extinguished by the majority.  It is this matter that I do 
find troubling and I express my concerns that it may be precedent 
setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minority rights have been entrenched in our Constitution to both 
reflect our diversities and to protect them.  Members must 
carefully consider whether this request to extinguish minority 
rights is the beginning of the slippery slope starting a slide 
toward general ambivalence with respect to the protection of 
minority rights, be they constitutionally protected or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to please vote with their conscience.  We 
parliamentarians must always remember we are charged with the 
awesome task of being the defenders of the rights of all of our 
citizens, be they minority rights or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not persuaded that this change should be made now.  It has 
not passed the litmus test of satisfying all of three questions: 
Does this constitutional amendment have the democratic agreement 
of the people?  Does this constitutional amendment conform to the 
rule of law?  Are the rights of minorities protected? The 
question that is not satisfied is the protection of minority 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland government held a referendum on the issue of 
school reform.  I am concerned however that the actual wording of 
the question was not finalized and published until 16 hours 
before the advance vote.  Government paid advertising was not 
clear and specific on the implications of voter choices but 
instead was warm and fuzzy causing difficulties in responding no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have been more comfortable if the Government of 
Newfoundland had obtained a ruling from the supreme court on 
whether the rights and privileges of minorities are prejudiced in 
any way.  The question of minority rights strikes at the fabric 
and soul of Canadians.  The rights of minorities for education 
has been a well established fact in Newfoundland for years.  How 
well a country protects its minority citizens from the tyranny of 
the majority is a measure of the quality of its democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protections in the Constitution are clear with respect to 
the education rights of linguistic minorities.  Court rulings in 
Alberta in 1990 and in Manitoba in 1993 based on constitutional 
interpretations clearly established the protections for 
francophone minorities in those provinces affecting numbers as 
small as 300 persons. 
We have not been as vigilant in our protection of religious 
minority rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A petition was signed in 1993 by 50,000 Catholics requesting 
that Catholic religious education be maintained. Fifty thousand 
parents stated, “We support Catholic schools and want to keep 
them”.   The petition was tabled by Dr. Ben Fagan at the special 
joint committee which studied the amendment to term 17 of the 
terms of union of Newfoundland, a committee which I was 
privileged to be a member of.  In my view this remarkable 
expression of minority collective will should not be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that the protections for the education rights of 
Pentecostals are not yet 10 years old.  Former Premier Peckford 
extolled the virtues of Pentecostal schooling and encouraged the 
legislature to enshrine for all time Pentecostal education 
rights.  He said:  “Today we are going to make sacrosanct, if 
you will, make guaranteed in the Constitution of Canada, the 
recognition of educational rights to the Pentecostal Assemblies 
of Newfoundland and Labrador”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to further state:  “I would only add one more thing. 
As time goes on I would hope that the Pentecostal Assemblies of 
Newfoundland with their start into education over the last couple 
of decades will not be tempted and will not fall to temptation, 
that what they have now as an approach and a philosophy to 
education will not get diluted over time as we progress as 
people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All available information indicates that the majority of 
Pentecostals do not support the constitutional amendment.  In 
fact a petition tabled by Dr. Regular at the special joint 
committee was signed by 4,300 people opposing the amendment. 
Again this is a remarkable indication by Pentecostals of their 
wish to retain their denominational education rights which were 
so very recently accorded to them under constitutional 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been demonstrated that there is a will by Catholics and 
an overwhelming will by the Pentecostals to retain their rights 
to denominational education.  It is very troubling that 
consideration of this will was not asked to be expressed 
denominationally in the public referendum.   We parliamentarians 
must be ever so sure that what we say and do is acceptable to our 
collective conscience and in accordance with our nation's 
constitutional contract with its citizens.  Let us not fail in 
this purpose. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very interested 
because I feel that issues of minority rights are important 
issues to be discussed.  When I researched this area in this and 
the last Parliament it struck me that since Confederation there 
were only seven religions in the province of Newfoundland, seven 
minority rights groups in the hon. member's terms, involved in 
the funding of the education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my mind there are more than seven religions currently in 
Canada.  There have probably been more than seven religions in 
the past since Confederation in the province of Newfoundland. 
There could be people of Muslim background and faith, Hindu, or 
Jewish people wanting to educate their children.  There are even 
people who exist in Canada whether we like it or not who are 
atheist and do not want religious education.  Those are different 
minorities that have existed since 1949 and they certainly exist 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about the status quo and the 
protection of minority rights, what about the rights of these 
people to have their faith or lack of it incorporated into a 
system?  What happened in the past in the cases of children with 
different religious persuasions was that they had to be educated 
in schools that did not cater to them or did not have a 
comprehensive ability to deal with the religion they were 
involved in at home and in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put that question very respectfully to the member opposite. 
What would he do about that, knowing full well that we do not 
have the jurisdiction nor do we have the infinite funding for all 
types of religions in their school systems?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an important 
question.  It certainly leads us to believe that those types of 
questions should be answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of denominations mentioned in the Constitution is 
limited and can be seen to be not fair.  However, it is my 
feeling and the feeling of many that rather than throw out the 
constitutional provisions and protections we have, that we 
address that issue, negotiate that concern and come to some other 
solution. However throwing out the baby with the bath water by 
extinguishing rights across the board without the permission and 
polling of the group affected is not the way to approach the 
matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again as one of 
the many Newfoundlanders who have been dealing with this issue 
probably for decades, I appreciate the intervention of members 
opposite who obviously do not quite understand this issue. 
However I respect their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question the hon. member raised as being somewhat confusing 
in his opinion was do they support a single school system where 
all children regardless of their religious affiliation attend the 
same schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite suggested that the question was 
unclear.  However, I will quote from Dr. Melvin Regular who is 
head of the denomination education council for the Pentecostal 
faith. Mr. Regular said that “the clarity of the question makes 
our task easier”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a total abolition of denominational rights and so we are 
able to declare with great certainty to the general population 
that Christian principles in the classroom will erode over time. 
It appears to me the question was very well understood by members 
opposite and by members of the denominations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member opposite, will he conform to the Reform 
policies that were articulated in the taxpayers' budget, the blue 
book or whatever is the Progressive Conservative and Reform mix? 
The Reform Party supports the replacement of the various existing 
formulas for amending different parts of the Constitution with an 
amending formula that replaced the ratification power of 
Parliament and the provincial legislatures with that of the 
people as expressed in binding referenda. At a 73% referenda, 
would the hon. member like to comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when I was alluding to 
the confusion of the question I referred to the question that was 
stated by the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven days prior to the referendum, the interpretation of this 
question was dramatically changed by the introduction of term 17 
itself where it specifically stated that it would be non-specific 
to religious denominations.  That dramatically changed the 
initial question that had been in the advertisements for a period 
of three weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Reform policy, it has been clearly stated in the 
Reform policy blue book that the Reform Party supports minority 
education rights.  It is our feeling however that minority 
education rights could be altered or affected possibly by 
provincial agreement.  This unilateral action to extinguish it

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in this very important debate on the 
amendment of term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found making a decision on this to be very difficult, so 
difficult that actually last week I had indicated to my own 
caucus that I would oppose the amendment but since then, I have 
changed my mind.  I believe that this is about the future of 
Newfoundland much more than about the past. 
I support the motion to amend term 17.  I am certainly concerned 
about the rights of minorities, distinguishing rights if that is 
what they have, and about the flexibility of the Canadian 
constitution.  We need to examine the type of educational system 
that is best suited for the future of Newfoundland.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that having been a teacher for 27 years in the 
public education system will certainly bias my decision to some 
point, but the question I focus on in making this decision is how 
the amendment will affect the future and welfare of students of 
Newfoundland schools.  Does the amendment put the future of the 
students first and foremost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned by members of the House, it is difficult 
being an MP from outside Newfoundland to deal with a Newfoundland 
issue that has been ongoing for many years.  It is difficult to 
step into the shoes of a Newfoundlander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because education is a mandate of the province, I would have 
preferred solutions to have been found in Newfoundland. I would 
have been happier if the issue had not reached this House so that 
the people and legislature of Newfoundland would have come up 
with a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba we have a voluntary separate school system, but most 
students attend a public school system much like that of the rest 
of the country.  The funding for separate schools, many of which 
are religion based, is voluntary on the part of the government. 
Some of them receive about one-third funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba all facets of education rests with the province: the 
school boards, teacher certification, all school funding and the 
curriculum.  It is ironic that with new provincial reforms in the 
Manitoba school educational system there tends to be a new 
direction of focus to give parents more rights in terms of 
determining the schools their children attend, the type of 
instruction afforded to them and the language of instruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, if we amend term 17 we are literally taking away 
religious education in Newfoundland as has been previously 
practised by the minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba there is no compulsory religious education.  As well 
there is no religious observance practised in schools.  In the 
early 1980s Manitoba indicated that the Lord's Prayer was no 
longer a requirement in the public classroom.  Students who 
object to the singing of O Canada have the right to leave the 
classroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Newfoundland has been struggling toward a 
non-denominational educational system for the last 25 years.  As 
I indicated earlier, who knows?  If this process had continued, 
perhaps the legislature would have worked a little harder and it 
could have essentially had a public system much like those of 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we realize it is very difficult for most other 
Canadians to understand and realize that a province such as 
Newfoundland in 1997 does not have a public school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most students are attending interdenominational protestant 
schools in Newfoundland.  I personally believe amending term 17 
will level the playing field for everyone concerned, both 
students and teachers.  No one will be treated as a minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the whole issue of equality will be exercised to 
a greater extent.  Teachers will be hired and fired on their 
professional merit, not on religious association.  I am told a 
generic course in religion will be provided to students and all 
stakeholders will be consulted on its development. 
Religious observance shall be permitted in schools where 
requested by parents.  Academic educational opportunities of 
Newfoundland students will improve.  As well an efficient and 
cost effective system will be created.  All this was recommended 
by the royal commission and has been uttered by other members of 
the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The churches were asked to work together to create an 
interdenominational system but after two years it failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constitution tends to be regarded as a badge of nationhood. As 
such it may reflect the values a country regards as important and 
show how these values are to be protected, for example, as in our 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all countries have the same type of constitution.  Canada's 
constitution is flexible and not rigid.  Regarding term 17, which 
only applies to Newfoundland, it was twice amended under section 
43 by the bilateral amending formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with Ms. Anne Bayefsky, an international law expert, 
that constitutions must be flexible and, as befits the 
description of a living tree, modernized and made responsive to 
the needs of the community over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the lack of funding for parents who choose 
to educate their children in a separate system such as religious 
schools.  Funding will not be guaranteed under the amendment as 
proposed.  Parents should have the option of sending their 
children to a separate school system and I believe that funding 
should be carried with the student. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Manitoba parents have the option of home schooling, separate 
schooling or public schooling.  Outside Newfoundland the numbers 
are growing in separate schools as well as in home schooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religion is deeply entrenched in the educational system of 
Newfoundland.  No doubt many minorities see the amendment as a 
threat to their constitutional right.  Change is never easy. 
Through referendum the people of Newfoundland have spoken loud 
and clear.  There is no doubt they want change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment will set the stage for future educational 
opportunities in Newfoundland.  The children of Newfoundland 
deserve the best education the province can afford to provide.  I 
support the amendment to term 17. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privilege to speak to this very important subject.  It 
is more in sadness than enthusiasm that I rise to speak to it. To 
me it represents the death knell of faith based education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many parents believe that faith based education is fundamental 
to who they are as people and who they are as parents.  In 
reality, we are now replacing faith based education with the 
religion of secularism.  At its core the religion of secularism 
is no more and no less a religion than Christianity, Judaism or 
Islam.  It has its set of priests, an orthodoxy which is 
political correctness, and its rituals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Newfoundlanders expect that by replacing their current 
orthodoxy with a secular orthodoxy they will in some manner 
improve their educational system, I am afraid the good people of 
Newfoundland will be sadly disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To argue that parents will be able to influence the direction of 
their children's education is not a hope based on reality.  It is 
an illusion.  Parents of Newfoundland should consult with their 
fellow citizens in Ontario about how much influence they have in 
the direction of their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government argues four main points: overwhelming democratic 
endorsement, reasonable support among affected minorities, 
religious observances in the schools protected and no effect on 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Points one and two are really one point.  Notwithstanding the 
imperfection of the referendum process, the affected minorities 
have given a form of consent upon which the Parliament of Canada 
can act.  There was a unanimous resolution in the house of 
assembly.  There were two referendums.  There has been extensive 
debate and there was a sincere effort to establish a consensus 
among the affected minorities.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of the Newfoundland and Labrador government to 
obtain consensus and demonstrate consensus to the Parliament of 
Canada are in distinct contrast to the efforts of the Government 
of Quebec.  A request for an amendment a few weeks ago was based 
on a form of obtaining consensus that reflected more of a 
political demand than any efforts to address the concerns of the 
affected minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has met the test 
which can reasonably be expected of a government when requesting 
amendment to the constitution which affects minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's third argument is that religious observance is 
protected.  This assertion misses the point and is specious.  It 
is cold comfort to those who fundamentally believe that faith 
should be at the core of their child's learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religion, properly understood, is not a tag on at the end of a 
school day.  Rather it permeates the learning process.  It is 
part of the math course, the physics course and English language 
courses.  Late Professor Emeritus Northrop Frye of the University 
of Toronto used to say, at the beginning of his very famous 
course on the Bible and the English language, that you do not 
really understand English language culture unless you understand 
the Bible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly Jews, Muslims, Hindus, et cetera, see their beliefs in 
a deity as essential to their learning.  Those parents will be in 
some manner doubly taxed.  First they will have to support the 
secularist based faith and then additionally fund educational 
systems which teach their faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To offer religious observances as a tag on at the end of the day 
is more of an insult than anything else and will be subject to 
charter challenges.  Parents of faith will once again wonder 
whether Canada has freedom of religion or freedom from religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's final point is that it will have no 
precedential value or effect on other provinces.  This is a 
dubious argument.  We do not have seat of your pants federalism 
is this country.  Each bilateral amendment is necessarily looked 
at by other provinces for precedents.  It is fundamental English 
common law that law is created by precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has set very low standards for democratic 
consensus in Quebec which has been greatly exceeded by the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Constitutional lawyers 
will scrutinize the process and the standards when giving advice 
to their government clients.  Even the manner and wording of 
referendums will be examined for their precedential value.  It 
may lend new meaning to a real and clear question.  It also lends 
meaning to what constitutes consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding my reservations I will support the amendment. 
The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have spoken.  While I may 
be skeptical of the path which they have chosen, the Parliament 
of Canada should respect their choice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the 
amendment to term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with 
Canada.  The proposed amendment reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1)  In lieu of section ninety-three of the Constitution Act, 
1867, this section shall apply in respect of the Province of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2)  In and for the Province of Newfoundland, the Legislature 
shall have exclusive authority to make laws in relation to 
education, but shall provide for courses in religion that are not 
specific to a religious denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3)  Religious observances shall be permitted in a school where 
requested by parents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the amendment before us affects only one province, 
parliament has a duty to study it with the same urgency, 
diligence and care that are befitting all constitutional 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to this challenge, parliament created the special 
joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on the 
amendment to term 17 of the terms of union of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour to serve on the committee for it gave me the 
privilege to hear firsthand the witnesses.  I must say that 
witnesses on both sides of the issue were sincere, heartfelt and 
articulate in defending their points of view.  Their testimonies 
did not make the task of the committee an easy one. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was challenged even more to undertake a careful 
analysis of the evidence.  This issue at hand, amending term 17 
of the 1949 terms of union of Newfoundland, gave the federal 
government and the Parliament of Canada the opportunity to show 
federal-provincial relations do work and that the Canadian 
constitution is a living document that provides a mechanism for 
change when change is deemed essential by the citizenry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the people of Newfoundland determined their future when 
the province entered Confederation in 1949, nearly half a century 
ago, the people of Newfoundland today would like to determine 
their future in Canada as Canada enters the 21st century.  They 
now see their future being best served by a single, publicly 
funded school system in which all children, regardless of their 
religion, attend the same schools.  They now see their future 
being best served by giving the House of Assembly of Newfoundland 
and Labrador the power to fully manage and integrate the 
province's existing three school systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed they saw that future in March 1992 when the royal 
commission chaired by Dr. Len Williams released its report “Our 
Children, Our Future”, an appropriate title for the report.  The 
citizens of Newfoundland expressed this vision of their future 
through a unanimous vote of the members of the legislative 
assembly representing all political persuasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have determined to eliminate denominational education as a 
constitutional right while retaining in the constitution their 
rights to courses in religion and religious observances as is 
stipulated in the proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government conducted a referendum on the issue on September 
2, 1997. Although it was not strictly required for the process of 
constitutional amendment, the referendum was conducted to better 
gauge the sentiments of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum question was precise and clear: “Do you support 
a single school system where all children, regardless of their 
religious affiliation, attend the same schools where 
opportunities for religious education and observances are 
provided?”  The essence of the referendum question fully 
reflected the actual text of the proposed amendment as passed 
subsequently by the legislative assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the text of the proposed amendment was made known to the 
people of Newfoundland prior to voting day, I am sure members 
will share my confidence that 73% of those voting clearly 
understood the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that the educational system that has been in 
place in Newfoundland has enjoyed a history that, for its 
citizens, has been woven into the very fabric of its culture.  It 
is no wonder then that witnesses, old and young alike, including 
students from both sides of the issue, displayed tremendous 
sensitivity and passion in their testimonies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we noted that the rationale behind the amendment is to 
reconcile a system of the past and present with the vision of a 
better system for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the people of Newfoundland and Labrador through 
the legislative assembly and government for having the genius to 
cast a constitutional amendment that reflects this vision for the 
new reality of Newfoundland.  I am assured that the proposed 
amendment complies with the international covenant on civil and 
political rights and can stand against any challenge under the 
charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If enacted, term 17 will become part of the Constitution of 
Canada.  Thus, it will be shielded from the well established 
principle that one part of the Constitution—in this instance, 
the charter of rights—cannot be used to invalidate or repeal 
another.  As a result, the provisions in subsection 2 and 
subsection 3 will enjoy a measure of charter immunity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle has been sustained by the Supreme Court of Canada 
in earlier court decisions and I am assured that the amendment 
process was fair.  I am assured that there is nothing in the 
proposed amendment to prevent some future government of 
Newfoundland from funding private schools, should it choose to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am further assured that the proposed amendment would set no 
precedent, that future requests for constitutional amendments for 
any province will be judged, as the present one is, solely on the 
merits of the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs put it well before 
the committee, it would be up to the Parliament of the future to 
consider any future proposal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall not fear to be proud of our national shared values, 
heritage and traditions, in which Newfoundland is rich.  We shall 
not fear change when change promises a bright future for our 
children, our youth and our country.  We shall not fear to face 
the future with confidence, secure in our history, generosity and 
integrity as a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending term 17 is an appeal to our confidence and 
understanding of Canadians.  It sends the message that 
confederation works.  It sends the message that our democracy is 
vibrant.  It sends the message that when we secure a bright 
future for one of our provinces we secure a bright future for the 
whole of Canada.

of the future of all of us.

thank you to my colleagues in this House who have taken the very

respond to it intelligently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members in this House who do not necessarily share the 
the views of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador as reflected 
in the 73% referendum result in favour of this particular 
amendment.  However, to the members of this House, in particular 
members on the government benches, I would like to acknowledge 
that they took the time to understand the issue, to explore it, 
to research it, to review it properly and to review it the spirit 
and the context of what Newfoundlanders and Labradorians 
understood and knew to be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in this Chamber who have suggested that 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians did not understand the question 
put to them.  Some actually suggested it was beyond their 
comprehension.  I categorically reject that proposal.  The people 
of Newfoundland and Labrador understood this question.  They 
voted solidly in favour of it, in complete comprehension of where 
it was taking our education system into the future.  After years 
and years of discussion that is exactly the conclusion we arrived 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to salute the members who did such diligent work in 
the committee as well as in the House who, not withstanding their

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK234">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
the second time I rise to discuss this amendment. The first time was not 
during the 36th Parliament, but during the 35th Parliament. At the time, 
I had the honour of presenting the Bloc Quebecois' position on the 
amendment. The amendment proposed in June 1996 to term 17 of the 
Constitution was not identical to the one now before us, but its thrust 
was the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, it was believed that the time was right. However, 
following a sequence of events I will describe later on, the proposed 
amendment had to come back before the House to be considered again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that, this time, we are proceeding in the 
appropriate manner and that people in Newfoundland will be pleased, once 
the members of this House have done their job, to amend their school 
system as they please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see how, throughout the process, this 
extremely important issue for people of Newfoundland was dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the issue was already debated in the House in 
1996. Before that, a royal commission of inquiry, the Williams royal 
commission, looked at it in 1992. Then, in June 1995, the government 
announced it would seek the public's approval to amend term 17, so as to 
undertake a reform of the education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1995, a referendum was held in Newfoundland. As we 
know, 54% of the population agreed with the proposed amendments, and the 
amendment came back to this House, to finalize the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you also know, a provincial election was held during that 
period. 
A new premier was elected in Newfoundland; he had the same philosophy as 
his predecessor and carried on the work. As a result, in June 1996, the 
House of Commons passed the resolution to amend term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were, however, some challenges in Newfoundland. Certain 
things occurred within certain religious groups. To speed up the process 
and clarify the whole issue, the Government of Newfoundland therefore 
decided to hold a second referendum within two years of the first and on 
a similar issue so as to enable the province to gain full control over 
the management of its schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This referendum was held on June 2, 1997. This time, 73% voted in 
favour of the proposal. It is interesting to note certain similarities 
with the situation in Quebec. 
I think we can make connections because, on the government side, they do 
not mind making their own, saying that federalism is flexible and so on. 
I heard remarks to that effect earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, on our side, can see similarities with the situation in Quebec 
in that, on an issue as important as this one, the province put the 
decision in the hands of the people by holding a referendum. In his 
speech, my hon. colleague from Témiscamingue mentioned a number of 
witnesses who testified before the committee and their arguments on this 
issue. We in Quebec have been hearing similar arguments for some time. 
Certain people in Newfoundland apparently complained about the question 
not being clear. I read the question only once and understood it 
immediately. Let me read again: “Do you support a single school system 
where all children, regardless of their religious affiliation, attend 
the same schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided, yes or no?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to this very clear question was also clear. The contents 
of the question were known ahead of time, but concern may arise from the 
fact that the wording of the amendment per se to term 17 was made public 
only on the eve of advance polling.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can just imagine the comments of the federalists opposite if, in 
a future Quebec referendum, the partnership project, for example, were 
to be spelled out only on the eve of the advance polling, even though 
the question itself had been known for several weeks. I wonder how this 
government would react. I wonder how the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, among others, would react if we acted in this fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not question the process used. I simply want to show that, in 
this House, when it comes to justifying measures and to implementing 
certain rules, there seems to be two ways of doing things: one for 
English Canada and one for Quebec. 
I think the assessment that was made of the issue and of what happened 
in Newfoundland is the proper one. We had to give this power, this area 
of jurisdiction, to the people of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other criticisms we heard related to financing. It was said that 
the two sides, the yes and the no sides, did not have the same means to 
express their views, because there is no law on financing. In fact, the 
no side made rather strong criticisms regarding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point is the lack of specific legislation to regulate the 
referendum. The election act was amended for this process but, again, 
this drew rather strong criticism. In spite of all this, I do not 
question the outcome of the exercise. Again, the federalists opposite do 
not challenge any of this and they accept these rules. 
I think they had to accept them as part of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in Quebec's case—our approach is that much 
clearer, all our cards are on the table, Quebec's plan to achieve 
sovereignty is so clear—the government opposite will be as 
democratic in the next Quebec referendum and will accept what the 
people decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the amendment to Term 17, the amendment 
proposed by the Government of Newfoundland and passed by the 
Legislative Assembly, is to rationalize the province's educational 
system and generate savings of $17 million.  I think these are 
substantial savings and that we should listen to what they have to 
say. 
If the amendment is passed, there will be one rather than four 
educational systems, one system for all denominations.  Religious 
instruction will continue to exist where numbers warrant.  The 
number of school boards will be reduced from 27 to 10, and these 
will be multi-denominational.  These reforms are the result of the 
recommendations by the royal commission of inquiry, as I was saying 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the member for Témiscamingue put it very 
succinctly at the outset when he said that we in the Bloc Quebecois 
have made our bed on this score for a number of reasons, the main 
ones being as follows.  First, although term 17 of a schedule to 
the Constitution was involved, this issue was still completely 
under provincial jurisdiction, meaning that, for us, education is 
a provincial matter and that the province alone must have 
jurisdiction to make any changes and decide on the broad outlines 
of its system. 
For us, this was an extremely important element, and one which 
brought us very quickly over to Newfoundland's side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the Constitution, one can see that indeed section 
93 states that the legislature in each province may make laws in 
respect of education.  Newfoundland's case is no exception.  The 
power to pass legislation in respect of education belongs to the 
legislature of that province, the only difference being that 
Newfoundland assumes that right under term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also—and I think everyone will agree with this—the 
provincial leaders and representatives are the ones in the best 
position to determine what composes an efficient education system 
in their respective territory.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this entire process arose out of referendums on 
an extremely important question for the people of Newfoundland, one 
on which there was a debate and on which a heavy turnout of 
Newfoundlanders made a decision on the direction they wanted for 
their education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would therefore be inappropriate for the hon. members in 
this House to take a position against the constitutional amendment 
called for by the Newfoundland legislature.  We also know that the 
Quebec legislative assembly called for similar amendments some time 
ago. 
Just as we in the Bloc Quebecois were pleased to co-operate with 
the Quebec legislature, we are also pleased to co-operate with the 
Newfoundland legislature in trying to get all of this speeded up 
and ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, our role as parliamentarians is for the most part one 
of ratifying what the Newfoundland legislature has done.  We have 
virtually no say in the matter.  Newfoundlanders are really the 
ones who must have full jurisdiction over this.

union with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consider we should accede to this request, and I encourage 
all members of this House to do likewise, for two reasons. 
The first is that the will of the people has been expressed in a 
referendum.  We saw that very clearly. 
The second is that education is a provincial matter.

<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on 
the remarks by the member for Berthier—Montcalm.  He attempted 
to draw a parallel between the referendum in Quebec, in essence 
about separating from Canada, and a referendum in Newfoundland, 
about building a stronger Canada.  I do not agree with that 
parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I thank the hon. member for his support of the 
resolution now before us and as well his support on the previous 
resolution affecting Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out for the record that the resolution in 
Newfoundland was passed unanimously by all political parties from 
all political persuasions, which is a real milestone.  Even after 
a unanimous decision on the part of the legislative assembly of 
Newfoundland and Labrador on this particular issue, we cannot 
make this a parallel because Newfoundland referred this to the 
Parliament of Canada, as the constitution requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alluded to two rules, one for the east and one for 
the west.  I only know of one rule:  the Constitution of Canada 
is for all Canadians in all the provinces of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me end by saying that when a referendum is for the 
strengthening of our nation, we must rally together.  However, 
when a referendum is for destroying the very nation that we love, 
the number one nation in the world, let us rally against it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member perhaps 
needs to be reminded that the Constitution to which he is referring 
also did not provide for the addition of a new province and, since 
we are talking about Newfoundland, for Newfoundland to join Canada, 
but it happened.  What is not excluded from entering is not 
excluded from leaving either, but that is another problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the member that it is not a 
question of destroying the country or whatever.  What we want to do 
is to build a country called Quebec, in partnership with Canada. 
You will be masters of your own destiny, as we will be of ours.  I 
think you have not understood that yet.  English Canada is 
increasingly taking this in. 
My leader, who is back from western Canada, told me that western 
Canada is increasingly open to the idea of Quebec becoming a 
sovereign nation and increasingly interested in starting to look at 
the possibilities of doing business or continuing to do business 
with a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to make to the member is that, in my 
view, a referendum is a referendum, meaning that a population 
decides on its future during this democratic exercise.  In the case 
of Newfoundland, it decided on its future with respect to 
education.  Is the member telling me that education is not an 
important matter for a province?  Is education not something that 
will have a definite impact on the direction a people will take for 
generations to come?  I think it is extremely important and they 
accomplished it through a referendum. 
In this referendum, the population said yes to changes proposed by 
the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be the same thing in Quebec.  We will have a 
referendum that will be extremely important for Quebec, because it 
will determine the course of future generations towards a very 
specific goal.  I hope the referendum will be successful the next 
time around and that we will have a country called Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the member that, when a people speaks, 
when they make known their views using extremely clear rules, as in 
a referendum, either in Newfoundland or in Quebec, I think that the 
people have spoken and that they should be taken very seriously. 
I do not see any distinction between a referendum on a question 
like the one put to Newfoundland and on a question like that put to 
Quebec on sovereignty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
to the hon. member's speech. I was a member of the joint committee and 
we heard testimony from several Newfoundlanders who expressed their 
concern that certain denominational rights enshrined in the Constitution 
were about to disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say they are a minority and, during today's debate, several 
members of the House also expressed concern about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether he has concerns about the rights of 
minorities in the resolution before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, the answer is very simple: 
no, I do not have any concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the government first and foremost, that is the 
Government of Newfoundland and the population of the province, acted 
very responsibly. I met government officials from Newfoundland, not 
during the 36th Parliament, but I met Mr. Tobin during the 35th 
Parliament and we discussed the issue. No, I do not have any concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they may want to debate this in that province, at some 
point. As I said earlier, our role is really to ratify something that 
was done by the provincial legislature, in an area that comes under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I do not have any concerns. If a debate must take place, it 
will be among Newfoundlanders. It will definitely not be up to the 
Canadian Parliament to get involved in this area of jurisdiction.

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that I am very pleased to take part in this 
debate on amending term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland 
with Canada.  This amendment responds to an important need of our 
fellow citizens of Newfoundland because it will enable them, once 
it is adopted by Parliament, to proceed with the reform of their 
educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has been going on for a number of years in the 
province and the Government of Newfoundland has decided to put it 
to an end by promoting the secularization of the school system 
which has long been church run in the province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment before us thus proposes a solution that is adapted 
to the educational context of Newfoundland and it is also the 
subject of a broad consensus in that province.  It is that 
consensus that led the joint committee on the amendment to term 
17 of the terms of union to recommend that the amendment be 
adopted both here and in the other House. Since it is not every 
day that we amend the constitution, we must acknowledge that we 
are experiencing here today in this House an historic moment in 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not like to spend my time regurgitating the exhaustive 
overview of this debate because the House of Commons has already 
considered this matter on a number of occasions in recent months. 
I would, however, like to talk about a number of the aspects that 
I feel merit the amendment transferral from the parliament of 
Newfoundland, the House of Assembly, and the relevance of the 
joint committee's recommendation for us to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those who have taken the time to study the Newfoundland 
education system in recent years know how strong a call there was 
by the public in that province for educational reform. 
That was the conclusion arrived at in 1992 by the Williams royal 
commission which recommended that the education system in 
Newfoundland and Labrador be restructured to allow the government 
to administer it more efficiently.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next five years were marked by endless bitter debates.  We 
tried an initial revision of term 17 in the last Parliament which 
was approved via the referendum in the province in 1995. It did 
not end the debate, so here we are again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the support was 54.4% in the first referendum of 
September 1995, the adoption of the proposed amendment did not 
end the debate.  A request for an injunction by the 
representatives of the catholic church was granted by the 
Newfoundland supreme court on July 8, 1997, thus blocking the 
reform proposed by the provincial government.  To resolve that 
impasse, Premier Tobin announced on July 31 that a new referendum 
would be held on September 2 to amend term 17 once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when he made that announcement he described the need 
addressed by this constitutional amendment:  “During the last 
five years we have seen every attempt to reconcile these two 
ideas—educational reform and denominational rights—and it has 
ended in more confusion and more conflict”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text of the amendment submitted to Newfoundlanders for their 
approval was very clear.  It read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) In lieu of section ninety-three of the <I>Constitution Act, 
1867</I>, this section shall apply in respect of the Province of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) In and for the Province of Newfoundland, the Legislature 
shall have exclusive authority to make laws in relation to 
education, but shall provide for courses in religion that are not 
specific to a religious denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) Religious observances shall be permitted in a school where 
requested by parents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To express their opinion on this proposed amendment, 
Newfoundlanders were asked to vote again on the following 
question:  “Do you support a single school system where all 
children, regardless of their religious affiliation, attend the 
same schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a single member in this House who can 
contest the clarity of this progress or this process.  In this 
debate we have a responsibility as members of the Parliament of 
Canada first to ask whether the process used by the provincial 
government in this matter allowed the population to understand 
clearly the issue it was being asked to decide upon.  Our answer 
to that must be yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by the joint committee's report, an expert 
commissioned by the committee, Ms. Anne Bayefsky, specifically 
stressed the scope of the consultations held among 
Newfoundlanders, including minority groups in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have a responsibility to ask whether the consensus 
forged by this referendum is sufficient to proceed with the 
proposed amendment.  Again I say the answer can only be yes. The 
proposal was supported by 73% of the voters of Newfoundland.  It 
obtained a majority of votes in 47 of the 48 ridings in the 
province.  Even in predominantly catholic areas where the 
proposal was likely to be more strongly opposed, it garnered 
significant support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 75% of the catholics in Newfoundland and Labrador live in 
three regions:  St. George's Bay, the Avalon Peninsula and the 
Burin Peninsula.  Those three regions respectively supported the 
proposal with proportions of 59%, 72% and 72%. Support for the 
proposal in areas where Pentecostals are concentrated, though 
much more difficult to assess, was also significant bearing 
between 57% and 64%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that public support, the proposal won the 
unanimous support of the Newfoundland House of Assembly.  Four of 
the government members, including two cabinet ministers, are of 
the Pentecostal faith.  Those four members who represent ridings 
in which 25% to 30% of the population are Pentecostal also 
supported the government's proposal in the House of Assembly.  It 
is also noteworthy that a number of the members who had opposed 
the proposal during the referendum process nevertheless voted for 
it in the Newfoundland legislature.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the clarity of the consultation process and the 
extensive support for the proposal, there is a third reason why I 
believe this proposal deserves our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders understand that the proposed changes are 
designed to establish a new school system, not to abolish any 
rights of a specific minority.  They will allow the province to 
proceed with long awaited reforms by establishing a single, 
publicly funded and administered school system.  This reform will 
strike a fair and functional balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new term 17 is in no way designed to take religion out of 
the schools.  It contains a provision obliging the authorities to 
provide courses in religion, stipulating that religious 
observances must be permitted in a school where requested by the 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, it cannot be expected that such a major 
constitutional amendment will garner unanimous public support. 
Nevertheless, as was recommended by the joint committee, I 
believe that the consensus which has been forged to date is broad 
enough and the guarantees to the groups affected are properly 
sufficient to move ahead with the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that there are those who fear change.  However, it is my 
heartfelt conviction that the children of Newfoundland will be 
the first to benefit from this measure. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, this debate we are having is meaningful in another way. 
I am referring to the bilateral nature of the amendment sought under 
section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Yet I consider that, while 
this change concerns only Newfoundland, the whole country stands to 
benefit from it, as it provides Newfoundlanders with a first class tool 
to further their goal: a single education system better suited to their 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, this constitutional amendment will further enable 
Newfoundlanders to be Canadians in their own way, as Albertans and 
Quebeckers are. 
Our country is enriched by this diversity, and our system of government 
makes it possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, a constitutional amendment, such as the one before 
us, demonstrates the flexibility of our confederation.  The 
federation is evolving every day and it would be a mistake to see 
it as something static and impermeable to change.  For example, 
we recently in the House adopted a constitutional amendment 
proposed by Quebec's national assembly.  If it is adopted by the 
Senate, that amendment would make it possible to establish school 
boards in that province along linguistic rather than 
denominational lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have chosen to go step by step.  This is a way which serves 
Canadians well, just as it serves Newfoundlanders in the current 
debate.  That is why I call upon my colleagues in this House from 
all parties to consider this carefully and to support this 
amendment to our constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to comment on what I believe is an inaccuracy. Perhaps 
the member opposite could explain it further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member commented on a difficulty in estimating the 
Pentecostal vote in the referendum.  I am referring to a brief 
which was presented by Mark Graesser from the University of 
Newfoundland.  The figures that were quoted in the brief were 
generally accepted.  They were even accepted in the report of the 
intergovernmental affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some estimates as to what the votes were. 
Specifically, the figures with respect to Baie Verte, Lewisporte 
and Windsor-Springdale would indicate that the support for the 
referendum in those communities of Pentecostals was 32%, 32% and 
30%.  The overall support of the Pentecostals was an average of 
only 32%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These figures show very specifically that the Pentecostals did 
not support the referendum.  I wonder if the hon. member opposite 
could explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to clear 
up the confusion in the mind of the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment was relative to ascertaining the percentage and the 
clarity of the Roman Catholic vote.  If he reads <I>Hansard</I> he 
will see that in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were witnesses who addressed this issue at the joint 
committee. I would refer the member to the report of the joint 
committee which was tabled last Friday.  He will find the answers 
in it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, to the member opposite who is a member of the Reform 
Party, I have difficulty understanding how a member of a 
grassroots party of the Reform persuasion who is constantly 
talking about referendum and listening to the people can stand 
there and be anything other than in support of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When 73% of the Newfoundland population voting very clearly 
indicates that they want this change, I am astonished that 
members of the Reform Party have not spoken earlier today.  They 
are not listening to the very, very clear will not only of the 
people but of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislature in that province unanimously gave its consent 
and forwarded to this.  It is our duty not to do any amendments, 
not to say no, but to follow through constitutionally with our 
duty in this House and to listen to the province.  The province 
has the jurisdiction on education.  I think it has spoken. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yes, the Reform Party—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I might be wrong, Mr. 
Speaker.  I seek your direction.  However, I understood in the 
questions and comments that one member could speak only once in 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Generally speaking, 
but we also try to have opposite sides being represented.  If 
there is a member on their feet in debate, that is normally the 
way we have been doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member from the same party is on their feet alone, then 
obviously that person would be asked to speak.  If there is an 
opportunity to actually engage in debate and have a member from 
another party, it does make sense that that other perspective 
would be represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore on questions and comments, the member for Edmonton 
East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Given the fact that this 
debate has gone on for quite some time, given the fact that we 
have engaged in healthy debate and an unrestricted debate, I will 
indeed agree that this is in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I would like to follow your 
line of reasoning with all respect.  You invoked the need for 
debate.  In fact, in the first instance when comment started on 
this issue, the member you just recognized for the second time 
started the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member from the government side responded to that 
debate.  However for you, Mr. Speaker, to ignore another member 
of this House of equal value to participate in that debate and 
recognized the member who had earlier spoken I think is a sign of 
unfairness to this member, the other person. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  At the outset of this debate earlier 
this morning, the hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
whose motion this is, was permitted I think three or four 
interventions against a member for the Bloc while other members 
of the opposition were standing up to interject in the same 
questions and comments period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly a precedent has been established.  The Chair allowed 
this sort of thing at his or her discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, I mean 
absolutely no disrespect for the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Prime Minister, it has been at least in my limited experience 
that if a member from a party representing a party other than 
that party of a member who has just spoken, it has been the 
convention to recognize the other party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly no disrespect and it certainly does not indicate 
that any members are more or less equal.  In any event, on 
questions and comments, the hon. member for Edmonton East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
felt that it was important to answer the question from the member 
opposite when the member was questioning how the Reform Party 
could have in its blue book and its policies support for the 
referendum process and how that is relative and why I might have 
a differing opinion on this matter seeing that it very clearly 
was initiated through referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is, and I want to explain to the member opposite, that 
the Reform Party also has policies in dealing with minority 
education rights.  That is my point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I fail to understand how 
non-inclusive are the minority rights of the member opposite.  I 
think of the seven religions represented, as I stated earlier 
today to the member.  The Muslims are not included.  People of 
the Jewish faith are not included.  Hindus are not included. Even 
atheists are not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is like choosing which minorities to represent. 
Parliament does not have the ability to cover everybody.  We do 
not have any taxing authority or public financing authority for 
the elementary and secondary school levels in another province. 
Education is an absolute provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are recognizing the will of the people of Newfoundland 
expressed in a very clear question voted on by a 73% majority in 
that province and in the unanimous consent of the provincial 
legislature.  They are coming to us on a section of our 
constitution which allows us to do this in a bilateral way. There 
is no comparable effect on another province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for my voters in Ontario to understand.  I 
answer the hon. member opposite by saying that I think he is 
choosing his minority rights and excluding others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Could I have unanimous consent to 
ask a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister has requested unanimous 
consent to put a question.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for the 
unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the report before us.  Mr. David Schneiderman, 
executive director of the Centre for Constitutional Studies at 
the University of Alberta, said before the committee, on which 
the member who raised the issue sat, that the consent of 
adversely affected minorities was not always required for an 
amendment to proceed.  What is important is whether the minority 
had been consulted or had participated.  Obviously by voting for 
it or against it the minority affected had participated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, by voting against it, is consent unreasonably 
withheld in light of the majority opinion?  I thought I should 
call this to the attention of my colleagues and I thank the House 
for its unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, because 
the comment was directed to her dissertation, has an opportunity 
to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I have spoken 
enough and my colleague is anxiously awaiting his turn. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to 
rise to speak to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues may be aware, I had the privilege and the 
opportunity to sit with my colleague from the Senate as co-chair 
of the special joint committee on the amendment to the terms of 
union of Newfoundland affecting term 17.  I also have the 
distinct pleasure to rise to speak this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue of direct relevance and importance, one that has 
been decided by the people I represent, the people of Humber—St. 
Barbe—Baie Verte and other people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a very engaging debate in the special joint committee on 
this issue.  I was very pleased members from all parties 
participated in representing all regions of the country.  I think 
it was a valuable experience for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from 49 witnesses from various cross-sections 
throughout Canada.  In particular, witnesses from the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador came forward to speak their views.  I 
certainly appreciated their knowledge, their competence and their 
personal feelings regarding this issue.  I felt that my 
colleagues on the committee could not help but be absorbed and 
engaged by the commentary provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are basically discussing an amendment to term 17 that was put 
to Newfoundlanders on July 31, 1997.  It was quite 
straightforward in my opinion. 
The question Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were asked on 
September 2 was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you support a single school system where all children, 
regardless of their religious affiliation, attend the same 
schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided? 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government stated at that time that the proposed new term 17 
would reflect and conform with the position presented in this 
question.  The following was the text of the new term 17 as it 
was unveiled: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Term 17.1:  In lieu of section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, 
this section shall apply in respect of the province of 
Newfoundland. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very straightforward.  Subsection 2 read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In and for the province of Newfoundland the Legislature shall 
have exclusive authority to make laws in relation to education 
but shall provide for courses in religion that are not specific 
to a religious denomination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 3 read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religious observances shall be permitted in a school where 
requested by parents. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new term 17 is as clear and straightforward as the question 
itself.  As a Newfoundlander who has participated in the 
education process as a student, as a Newfoundlander who has 
participated in the education reform process as a citizen, and as 
a Newfoundlander who participated in the education reform process 
as a parliamentarian, I plead with my fellow members of 
Parliament to respect the wishes of the people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador and to pass without haste this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have engaged in the debate for decades.  We have thoughtfully 
provoked the will of the people to come forward and to announce 
the form of a new education system.  That is exactly what the 
people went to the polls with on September 2.  Through very 
thoughtful and engaged debate we understood the question and we 
understood the implications.  We knew what we were voting for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the words and thoughts of a denominational education 
leader, Dr. Melvin Regular of the Pentecostal faith, who said on 
August 11, 1997 “The clarity of the question makes our task 
easier”.  Pastor Clarence Buckle, as well from the Pentecostal 
faith, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that if the people face the question squarely the 
question is clear, as we have said, and if they face it squarely 
the problem faces every one of us, every single citizen of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  Do we want to contemplate the 
possibility of having a single school system in the province in 
which we are not able to provide religious based instruction, 
activities and observances as Newfoundlanders have enjoyed in the 
past? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is evidence to me as a member of Parliament, as a citizen 
of Newfoundland and Labrador, and as someone who understands the 
education process quite well in that province that we understood 
both sides of the question.  We understood its implications.  We 
understood exactly what it was asking of us and we voted 73% in 
favour of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who would stand to suggest today that we did not 
understand the question put before us, that it was not simple and 
was somehow skewed, I say they are incorrect. They are incorrect 
in their assertion that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians do not 
understand the democratic process.  I firmly believe 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians understand quite well the 
democratic process, that we understand the implications of our 
actions, and that we do so quite willingly and quite forcefully 
in the spirit of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who suggest that we do not and cannot control our own 
destiny are categorically false because Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians will participate in this great country as full and 
equal citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply ask the Reform Party and those who would be their 
servants, those members of the House of Commons who would suggest 
the question was not correct, to go back to their blue book.  I 
suggest that they re-evaluate the following quotation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the replacement of the various existing 
formulae for amending different parts of the Constitution with an 
amending formula that replaced the ratification of power of 
Parliament and the provincial legislatures with that of the 
people as expressed in binding referenda.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote on this amendment will be the first test of the 
commitment of Reform members to this idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An overwhelming majority of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians 
endorsed the changes in term 17 in a lawfully held referendum 
process conducted under the elections act.  Moreover, the 
committee heard testimony that the question was clear and 
straightforward, and that its clarity and fairness were never 
issues during the election process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard very clearly that there was unanimous consent in 
the legislature of Newfoundland and Labrador to pass this 
amendment.  That is section 43 and that is due process by law, 
which is what the constitution of the country is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a formula in place.  It requires the consent of the 
legislature and the consent of parliament.  I firmly believe that 
there should be respect for our constitution.  It is a changing 
document.  It changes the aspirations and the ideals of the 
people whom it protects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that over the course of decades of debate we have 
engaged in a process that will provide fundamental education 
reform to our province which we expect and desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those among us who have suggested that it is improper 
for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians to want to do that because 
they do not like it and it goes against their particular values 
as members of Parliament or as parliamentarians from elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure all members of the House that the issue only affects 
the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.  The issue is based on 
educational principles that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians hold 
dear.  It is a principle based not just on members of Parliament 
or members of the legislature.  It is based on the people who use 
the school system, the children.  That is the testimony we heard 
most eloquently and most powerfully from the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those currently in the school system said that they feel there 
should be religious instruction of a non-denominational nature. 
They told us that as Newfoundlanders and Labradorians they were 
spiritual people.  They also see the value of learning about all 
religions.  That was a very noble and proud thing to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have confidence in their own denominational faith.  They 
have confidence in their own ability to guide their spiritual 
growth and development.  Newfoundland and Labrador is all about 
confidence, pride and self-satisfaction that they will 
participate in the Canadian democracy as full equals, not to be 
told by others that we do not think of the process or of the 
implications and that others should do it for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I categorically reject that notion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member used percentage figures in his address. 
I have worked in this business for many years, in fact a 
lifetime. If the constituency I represent were to hold a 
referendum today, it would be more than 73% in favour of going 
with one school system.  I would have to say to constituents in 
Weyburn, Estevan and Radville who have enjoyed a private school 
system, that they have to give it up because 73% of the people 
said they had to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand and appreciate what the member and others have 
said, but do not ask me to make the same application as you are 
making in the House to the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind all members 
to address other members through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are beginning to get to 
the heart of the matter.  It is about Newfoundland and Labrador. 
It is not about the province of Saskatchewan, the province of 
Manitoba or the province of New Brunswick.  It is about 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the home and school federation of the province 
of Newfoundland and Labrador put it quite clearly when he said 
“We knew what we were voting for.  This is what we wanted”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard expert testimony from other organizations and other 
institutions across the province.  They said, “This is what we 
as Newfoundlanders and Labradorians want”.  Mr. Steve Wolinetz, 
head of the home and school federation said, “We are religious 
people in Newfoundland and Labrador.  We are a spiritual people. 
We understood categorically that that is what we were voting for. 
To subscribe or to make the assertion that this is in context of 
what should happen in other provinces is fundamentally incorrect. 
This is what should happen in Newfoundland and Labrador”. There 
is no suggestion whatsoever that this is what should happen in 
other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly if someone were to come forward with unanimous 
consent in another legislature, in another province on a 
particular issue, then I think that we as parliamentarians would 
still have to look at that.  We would still have to make sure 
that there was enough consent within the general populace of the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what the issue is.  There was unanimous consent 
in the provincial legislature of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Members of particular denominations, who may or may not have had 
a particular opinion, voted in favour of this amendment; 47 of 48 
districts within the province of Newfoundland and Labrador voted 
in favour of this particular amendment.  That makes it unique to 
that province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary was the Commons chair of the special 
joint committee.  We heard much debate and we have heard more 
debate here today on the question of minority rights. As a 
Newfoundlander I wonder if he could tell us in this debate on 
denominational rights, who is the minority and who is the 
majority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will draw on my personal 
knowledge being a Newfoundlander and Labradorian, someone who is 
very proud of his particular province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no majorities in the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  The seven denominations currently holding religious 
denominational rights entrenched in term 17 make up 95% of the 
population of the province.  Five per cent of the population who 
represent other denominations have no denominational rights 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very critical question.  It is a very important question 
to ask. Is this a question of the majority stomping out the 
rights of the minority?  Is harm being done?  No.  This is what 
the committee so thoughtfully provoked to come from the 
witnesses. This is the testimony we heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in my heart as a Newfoundlander that this is about 
providing an opportunity for all denominations for the first time 
in the history of Newfoundland being a province within 
Confederation. For the first time all denominations will have 
equal access to religious instruction of a non-denominational 
value.  No one particular denomination which may be a majority 
over a minority can dominate.  That is a very important principle 
that we as Newfoundlanders and Labradorians hold dear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to make a few remarks on this very important issue for 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not much more left to be said that has not already been 
said today and which has already been said in this House a number 
of times before.  As a Newfoundlander and Labradorian, I have 
been wrestling with this issue for many years.  I was an educator 
before I entered public life in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I debated this issue in the house of assembly, the Newfoundland 
legislature a number of years ago when then Premier Wells and his 
administration tried to move forward with educational reform in 
our province. To some degree they were partially successful. 
Then again Premier Wells' administration really did try to 
compromise. They tried to get an agreement between the churches 
and the government that hopefully was a workable solution, but we 
found out after it really was not a workable solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we witnessed in 1997 in the September 2 referendum vote was 
a degree of frustration among Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. 
They wanted this issue dealt with.  That was certainly reflected 
in the 73% yes vote, frustration.  They thought they had dealt 
with it in 1995 when 54.4% of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians 
voted yes. 
They thought the issue had been put to bed then. They thought we 
were going to move forward with educational reform within our 
province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders and Labradorians wanted to improve the quality 
of education inside the four walls of the classroom. That is what 
educational reform in Newfoundland and Labrador is about.  It is 
not about turf wars or power struggles. To the ordinary 
Newfoundlander and Labradorian educational reform is about improving 
the quality of education within the classrooms of Newfoundland 
and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference has been made to the quality of education by a number 
of speakers today.  Some have suggested that we rank third in the 
country.  Unless we are number one and the best that we can be, 
then we will always have to strive to improve the quality of 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a big change in Newfoundland and Labrador over 
the last 10 or 12 years.  There have been big shifts in 
population, demographics, out migration. Our student-teacher 
ratio has changed.  Our student population has declined for a 
number of reasons.  One is out migration and another is declining 
birth rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our student population has shrunk so dramatically over the last 
10 years that it has caused a different environment. There are 
situations where so few students attend some schools that 
consequently staffing allocations were affected and students 
could not access the programs they needed to pursue 
post-secondary careers.  In essence, in many cases the 
post-secondary choices of students were very restricted by the 
course offerings in their schools.  This is where we are in our 
province and that is why Newfoundlanders and Labradorians desire 
educational reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people questioned whether the 53% turnout in the last 
referendum was high enough.  It was democratic. People were 
afforded the opportunity to speak on the issue. The wording was 
very clear.  I held back on the issue for quite a while. People 
tried to pressure me in one way or another, that I should be 
behind the yes forces or that I should be behind the no forces. I 
told them that until I saw the precise wording of the new 
amendment, I would not make a decision.  And I did not make a 
decision until I saw it and felt comfortable with it.  But once I 
did see it, the wording was clear and I felt comfortable with the 
decision that I would support it and vote yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before that if on June 2 there had been a 20% 
turnout of voters in the federal general election and 11% of them 
had voted for me, I would have been so grateful and thankful.  I 
would not have found anything wrong with 11% of the votes.  I 
would not have questioned it at all. If I was willing to accept 
that kind of a vote on June 2, how can I question 73% of 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who voted yes on September 2? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the federal riding of Burin—St. George's there are six 
provincial districts and part of another in that great geographic 
area that takes in the entire south coast of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  Well over 70% of the people in that riding voted yes. 
All of the provincial members representing that riding in the 
Newfoundland and Labrador house of assembly voted yes. How can 
anyone expect me to come here tomorrow and vote any differently? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that people have different points of view and 
different opinions, that they grew up in different ways, et 
cetera.  I understand all of that and I respect everything that 
has been said here today and that will be said here later 
tonight. But the message is clear.  Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians want this Parliament to deal with the issue in what 
they perceive to be a positive manner, and that is to vote yes. 
Let there be no mistake about what Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians want in this issue.  They want this issue dealt 
with. 
It has gone on for eight or nine years.  We thought it had been 
dealt with but it really was not dealt with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1992 in the Newfoundland legislature Premier Wells 
spoke on this very issue.  All the church leaders of the province 
were sitting in the Speaker's gallery.  I remember it very well. 
At that point Premier Wells thought they could reach a consensus, 
that they could reach an understanding on this issue.  They 
thought they had done so but we have seen what has happened 
since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this issue is about governance.  It is about 
governing the province of Newfoundland and Labrador which the 
present government was elected to do.  The Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador was hamstrung.  It was handcuffed.  It 
could not make the decisions about the education system of 
Newfoundland and Labrador that it was duly elected to make as the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador or a part of 
the government administration for Newfoundland and Labrador, I 
would have done exactly what Premier Tobin and his administration 
did on this issue. They were not able to run the education system 
in Newfoundland and Labrador.  That is the truth of the matter. 
They were not able to govern.  They were not able to make 
decisions because every time they tried to make a decision or 
made a decision, someone challenged them and they could not move 
forward on education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it all this past year when schools were supposed to be 
closed and teachers were supposed to be redistributed in the 
province.  Then it all went back up and we had to reopen schools. 
It has turned out to be a nightmare in Newfoundland and Labrador 
over the past eight or nine years as we have tried to get some 
sense of direction and bring about educational reform for the 
benefit of those people for whom we should have been debating it 
throughout those years, the students of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It got off track.  The debate was not about improving the 
quality of education in all of those schools throughout 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  The issue got lost.  It was seldom 
mentioned.  It turned into turf wars.  I feel very strongly that 
the government had no choice but to deal with it.  As part of the 
process the government went to the people for the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not forget this was the second time that a majority of the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador voted for educational reform, 
and this time overwhelmingly.  So the people gave their blessing 
to this reform and to this question.  I do not want to belabour 
the point here today and go on about it for the length of my 
time. I just want to say to hon. members here that I respect all 
their opinions and I respect the way they will vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that within every caucus of every 
party represented in this House there will be people who will 
vote yes and people who will vote no.  That tells us something 
about this whole process.  It tells us about how seriously people 
take these matters.  That is very good and I am proud of that.  I 
am proud to be part of this Chamber and this Parliament which is 
so democratic and which is filled with people who are so strong 
in their convictions.  I say that quite seriously here tonight. 
It is very interesting for me to be here and to witness this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and particularly 
the Newfoundlanders and Labradorians I represent in Burin—St. 
George's, there is no question about what I will be doing 
tomorrow or whenever the vote is taken.  I will be voting yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for his eloquent position on the issue and his support for 
the issue.  He has reassured us that for Newfoundlanders the 
question was very clear and that governance by a province on an 
exclusive area of provincial jurisdiction has to be given due 
recognition by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make only one plea to the member.  The members of the 
Progressive Conservative opposition in the Senate who sat on the 
committee dissociated themselves from the report and the 
recommendations contained therein. Because of what I believe will 
be his persuasion, the member might be able to convince the 
members of the Tory caucus in the Senate.  Since he has come from 
the same caucus perhaps the member could make an undertaking 
today that he will exercise all efforts to ensure that support 
comes equally from that caucus in the other House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, the hon. member for Burin—St. George's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I really 
want an opportunity to respond to that question, but the member 
made a suggestion and I will do my best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I will use whatever persuasive powers I have to convince 
the other chamber to approve this without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said from day one, when I made my position public on this 
issue, that I would not in any way be party to any tactic or any 
group or organization which tried to delay or stall this issue 
and I remain firm in my position tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I commend the hon. member for his remarks and particularly for 
congratulating other members from other parts of the country in 
taking this matter seriously.  This is a matter which affects the 
Canadian constitution and I think that all legislators, 
rightfully, should be concerned about it, whether they are for it 
or against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member relates to the public mood in 
Newfoundland.  He referred to the fact that people are tired of 
the debate which has gone on for nine years, the fact that it 
seems to drag on and on, and that people want to get it over 
with.  Is it possible that some people voted yes in the 
referendum which was held earlier this year in order to get the 
matter done and dealt with?  Were they more motivated by that 
than they were in considering the long term ramifications?  In 
other words, was the referendum result, at least in part, a 
result of public anxiety about the process and wanting to get it 
done without having a full, thoughtful consideration of the 
consequences of voting yes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would not want in any 
way to attempt to diminish the understanding that Newfoundlanders 
and Labradorians had on this issue.  They were well versed on it. 
They were better versed than anyone else in this country, quite 
naturally, because they were living it.  They have lived it for 
eight or nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be very honest, which we all should be, I would say that 
there certainly were people who voted yes in the referendum 
because they were frustrated.  They thought it had been dealt 
with in 1995 and then found out that it had not been, and here we 
go again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have to be honest and say yes, there were 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who voted yes out of 
frustration.  They wanted it to be dealt with.  They wanted the 
educational reform of Newfoundland and Labrador to move forward 
and, quite naturally, I think there were some who felt like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I had the great fortune of being taught by the Basilian 
fathers during most of my high school and university education; 
an order of priests who have set up academic institutions right 
across the country.  They have always believed that education is 
more than the pure academic, that it is the development of the 
whole person.  In other words, from the moment we arrived in the 
school during the day there could be a prayer or there could be 
chapel. There was a prayer before the football game or the hockey 
game. It was a total immersion into the catholic experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Burin—St. George's not feel a bit 
concerned that this responsibility is now being handed over 
totally to the state? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of the hon. member and his concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again to be honest, yes, I do have some concerns about that. We 
are talking about a very important issue.  For me it comes down 
to the quality of education in Newfoundland and Labrador. We have 
gone through very tough economic times.  We have gone through 
severe population changes, out-migration and other things. We 
have to weigh all these things in the equation before we come to 
a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education takes place every minute that we are awake.  Some of 
the things which the hon. member alluded to such as prayer and 
other observances certainly can take place outside school.  I am 
sure that will continue to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parents request it, then they will have religious observances 
within the school.  They cannot be denied.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I have answered the member in the way that he 
wanted but yes, I do have some concern about that.  Again, the 
wording is quite clear in that there will be religious education 
courses developed and offered in the schools, but the courses 
will not be specific to any denomination.  I think that is 
probably what the hon. member's concern is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not as concerned about that, obviously, as the hon. member 
is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wanted to comment.  I certainly believe, as does everybody, that 
Newfoundland conducts affairs democratically.  Two referendums 
have been held, one with a vote of 73%.  That is a powerful 
message being passed along through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer the hon. member to another democratic instance 
in 1987.  That is when the premier of Newfoundland the 
legislative assembly of Newfoundland made permanent, forever, 
entrenched rights of Pentecostals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know how the member responds to this, how he feels 
about something that is specifically entrenched, as Premier 
Peckford's idea was, how this could now be affected when 
obviously from polls and polling only 30% of Pentecostals agree 
with changing their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again it is very 
difficult to sort of respond.  Yes, in 1987 the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador initiated a constitutional change that 
included the Pentecostal Assemblies.  There is no question about 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is 10 years later.  I guess if we could predict 10 years in 
advance on any issue what the situation would be, then we would 
avoid a lot of the problems, a lot of the very difficult 
decisions that we have to make in this country and in our 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government of the day in 1987 thought that it was 
right and proper to include those rights in the Canadian 
constitution for the Pentecostal assemblies, there has been a lot 
of change since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, there have been a lot of changes in our 
province.  There was the dollar crunch.  The student population 
has declined tremendously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the province must have the right to govern and 
to make decisions. If the people do not like the decisions made, 
they deal with the government the time after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess all I can say on that is that times have changed big 
time in Newfoundland and Labrador in 10 years, as they will be in 
2007 from what they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we will be changing it back in 2007, who knows. If I could 
look that far into the future with a crystal ball— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have a quick 
question, 30 seconds and a 30 second response. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question from the 
hon. member from the Reform Party has stimulated another 
question.  Given that constitutions, according to the Reform 
Party, should be entrenched for all time, should we have a Senate 
that is impossible to change and should we do away with section 
43 amendments as the Reform Party has suggested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get 
pulled into a debate between the hon. member opposite and members 
of the Reform Party.  I think I will leave it to the two of them 
to agree or disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are ever changing times.  Who knows in ten years what the 
situation will be in the country. Who knows what will happen to 
the population of Newfoundland and Labrador, what our student 
population will be, what the economics of our province will be 
with the new oil and gas industry, Voisey's Bay, and on and on it 
goes. It is very difficult to answer some of those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is why members are asking them.  They know they are 
very difficult to answer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very interesting debate because what is happening here 
is we are seeing the result of some of the policies that have 
been espoused particularly by the Reform Party but by many people 
in different parts of Canada in relationship to governing by 
referenda.  You should never ask a question if you are not 
prepared to live with the answer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not presume at any time to tell the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador how they should particularly run their 
education system.  Of course as parliamentarians and Canadians we 
are concerned about the quality of education from sea to sea to 
sea, and clearly quality is an issue that we would all be 
concerned about. But what we are seeing here is governance, an 
issue of governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected to the Ontario legislature in 1987 and I was 
appointed as vice-chair of the select committee on education. It 
is a little like deja vu all over again.  It seems that no matter 
what jurisdiction I wind up in, education seems to become the 
focus of the day.  It is very much a political issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the concern that too often we are pulling up the 
roots of the tree of the education system and examining it, not 
leaving it planted, allowing it to grow.  That had very much to 
do with the pedagogy, with the quality of education in the 
classroom, but a great deal less with the governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland have answered a question and I was 
fascinated to hear the member for one of the ridings in 
Saskatchewan say that he would not want to go back with a 70-plus 
vote in favour of one system in his province and tell a certain 
minority that it could no longer send its children to the schools 
of their choice.  The result would be that the decision based on 
the referendum that would have hypothetically taken place in 
Saskatchewan would have to be ignored. This is clearly one of the 
problems we have when we think we can simply, in black and white, 
govern by referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a marvellous speech given by a member of the Ontario 
legislature.  It was around an education system.  He was from the 
riding of Simcoe.  I will not mention his name, for his own 
purposes.  He stood up and said I have done a poll in my riding 
on this particular issue and 50% of my constituents are in favour 
of this amendment and 50% are against, and I am going to vote 
with my constituents.  Interesting comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the push-pull. That is why we were sent here.  I suggest 
it is a very unusual issue where you can get a kind of clear 
answer to a question.  We have to ask ourselves was the question 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the question read in this place and it is pretty 
legitimate and pretty clear and pretty understandable.  Something 
impresses me even more than the 73%.  I hear everyone saying that 
maybe they voted out of fear, maybe they voted because they did 
not understand it.  There was a low voter turnout, all of this. 
Let us set aside the issue of the referendum just for a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I would agree with my colleagues who have spoken from 
Newfoundland and Labrador very passionately about this, I would 
agree it is something they must listen to.  The numbers that 
impress me the most are the ones when I look at how the 
legislature voted in Newfoundland. There are 48 members. 
Thirty-five of them are Liberals, obviously a clear majority. 
Eleven are Progressive Conservative, one NDP and one Independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served for five years in a provincial legislature in 
opposition.  Members from the opposition would understand what I 
am talking about when we can say we can vote against the 
government on this and it will still carry.  God forbid that 
there would ever be a vote cast in this place with that kind of 
thought, but if it is a matter of political expediency, we can 
stand against the government and it will still happen.  It has a 
clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Tories do that?  Eleven of them voted unanimously with 
the government.  Did the New Democrats do that?  Obviously a 
party with a tradition in opposition in this country that 
understands what it means to oppose and quite often just gets up 
in an opposing mood, it voted to support this.  And the 
Independent?  I do not know the person.  We have one in this 
place.  It seems that someone who is truly independent, who is 
elected as an independent, who would be sent to a legislature as 
an independent member, would find very little reason, in my 
submission, to generally vote with a majority government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that they would want to put forward the opposing 
view, that they would see it as an obligation to stand in 
contrast to the majority view of the government.  Did that 
independent member in the Newfoundland legislature do that?  That 
member voted with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the duly elected representatives of that 
legislature voted 100% in support of this tells me something that 
very clearly is important.  The debate took place.  We know there 
was a royal commission.  In 1992 the royal commission recommended 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland is a wonderful part of our land in this great 
country.  One of the real advantages Newfoundland has, I would 
submit, is that in spite of the vastness geographically, it is 
probably possible to talk to everybody in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a riding of 140,000 people.  By the time the next 
election rolls around, 50% of my constituents could be brand new 
to the riding.  It is a very fast growing, volatile changing 
community.  I would say, having spent some wonderful time in St. 
John's, Newfoundland, that it is easy to communicate if you 
represent that part of the country.  You could probably, if you 
really wanted to and I say this with tremendous love for 
Newfoundland and Labrador, call everybody in a reasonable period 
of time and get hold of them.  There would be an opportunity for 
people to voice their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 48 members of the provincial legislature having that 
opportunity, given the results of the vote in the legislature and 
the results of the referendum, we have no right to oppose a 
constitutional amendment in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I know that my folks at home in Mississauga 
are a little frightened of this.  They are a little concerned 
that this is the thin edge of the wedge.  That catholic education 
in the province of Ontario could be in jeopardy.  I want you to 
know that I do not believe that.  Our separate school system, a 
system which I went through—I went to our Lady of Sorrows 
Elementary School and to St. Jerome, a boarding school in 
Kitchener with the Resurrectionist Fathers—has tremendous roots 
in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have full funding of both the public and the separate 
school system.  I believe we are secure in the catholic education 
system which exists in the province of Ontario.  We should not be 
worried that a precedent would destroy that.  We should support 
our brothers and sisters, our friends, our legislative brothers 
and sisters in Newfoundland and Labrador.  We should adopt this 
very historic amendment to our constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very impressed with the confidence the hon. colleague opposite 
has that this will in no way ever affect the catholic education 
system in Ontario.  What evidence does he have that makes him so 
positive that this could never happen in Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, having spent eight years 
in the Ontario legislature, having been the vice chairman of the 
select committee on education under the David Peterson 
government, having served in opposition for five years, I feel I 
have some comfort level in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can ever say never.  The point of the matter is that we 
have a very strong and secure system of education, catholic and 
public, in the province of Ontario.  We then balance that with 
the fact that we have a very clear message from the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  We have a clear message from the 
members who represent that part of Canada in this place.  We have 
an enormously clear message from the people who represent 
Newfoundland and Labrador in their provincial legislature. 
Frankly, I think—

that after the referendum they would feel compelled to vote in 
the legislature the will of the voters.  This indeed happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was reported in <I>Hansard</I> of that legislature that some 
members made speeches and talked to the effect that they had 
indeed voted no, but now they felt compelled to vote yes. Those 
are the individuals who are on record.  I suggest there were 
probably more.  That is the reason for the unanimity.  Would the 
member possibly explain this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if it was in the 
newspaper, it must be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have votes of convenience.  We cannot say that we 
should have a vote on this issue, have it carry and they say 
“Ya, but I don't like the reason you did it”.  There are 
members in this place who will speak against and vote for this 
because they have concerns, but the bottom line is that they feel 
they must support this because of the clear decision of the 
people.  For the Reform Party not to want to listen to the people 
is clearly astounding to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the message and we have a duty and an obligation to live 
up to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point 
out to this House that I am a member of the Roman Catholic faith 
and I voted in the referendum in a particular way.  However, when 
it comes time to vote on this issue I will vote as a member of 
the House of Commons who is speaking on behalf of my 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, as a member of the Roman Catholic faith, I voted 
personally for the amendment.  I will vote as a member of the 
House of Commons for the amendment because that is what my 
constituency said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another point, I would suggest the following to those members 
who are concerned this will have an impact on other 
constituencies and other provinces in the country. I point out 
one simple fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 we added the Pentecostal denomination to the schedule of 
denominations that were provided with specific rights.  We did 
not at that time add other denominations in other provinces.  We 
did not add the Pentecostal faith to the Ontario schedule.  We 
did not add it to the Manitoba schedule.  We did not add it to 
the Alberta schedule so— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The last word goes 
to the member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>   Mr. Speaker, probably the greatest 
single thing about Canada is the diversity in our regions and our 
provinces and the fact that they are so different in many ways. I 
believe that what we have here is a constitutional amendment for 
one area of this wonderful country.  It is an amendment we can 
support. The evidence is in and I will be proud to stand and vote 
and support my colleagues and the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary 
of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased that there is such a good diverse debate on 
this subject.  It is a subject that has been debated in 
Newfoundland and Labrador for many years.  It has been debated at 
length during the last month or so here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my hon. colleague from Mississauga West for 
giving such an excellent presentation.  I also congratulate my 
colleague, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Natural Resources, for the leadership role he played in 
co-chairing the joint committee of the House and the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who know me will know that I have given this topic 
considerable thought.  I made my wishes known in the last round. 
I will speak in support of this amendment before the House 
because I believe it will be beneficial to the children of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that there are no public schools in 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  As is the case in all provinces, our 
education system is a part of our history.  Our first schools 
were sponsored, fostered and indeed promoted by the churches and 
the clergy. 
Governments did not assume responsibility for education until 
much later in our history.  Even when public funding became 
available, the Newfoundland system was still directly and 
exclusively run by the churches.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use the example of my home town in Bonavista which is 
an historic fishing town.  I think this year at the Cabot 500 
celebrations it became known as the landfall of John Cabot. 
Bonavista is famous for that but it is also famous for something 
that is not quite as well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1722, Reverend Henry Jones came to Bonavista where he 
supervised the building of the first church in Newfoundland. Four 
years later, he organized the first school in Newfoundland, in my 
home town.  There is the connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time of Confederation, six individual denominations had 
been granted the right to operate schools.  They still possess 
that right.  It was pointed out in the previous debate that one 
denomination was added in 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in Newfoundland and Labrador, there are four separate, 
distinct and individual school systems with overlapping boards in 
a province with 575,000 people and 110,000 students, roughly the 
size of Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have now asked 
Parliament to give the provincial legislature the authority to 
make changes in the denominational education system.  That will 
be the effect of our amended term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the legislature would have the authority to decide 
and to direct educational issues and the individual denominations 
would not.  While the denominational school system was 
incorporated in the constitution in 1949 for reasons that 
certainly those from Newfoundland and Labrador would be aware of, 
the people of the province through their government now wish to 
make a different arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe that changes must be made to the schools for the 
sake of their children and for their children's future.  The 
decision to make change was not hasty, not arbitrary and came as 
a consequence of a long process of public discussion and 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to quickly summarize for the record, six years ago the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador appointed a royal 
commission on education.  More than 30 years have passed since 
such a study was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission was chaired by Dr. Len Williams, a very 
experienced and respected educator.  The commission recommended 
far-reaching changes designed to give the children of 
Newfoundland and Labrador greater opportunity to prepare 
themselves to lead full, satisfying and productive lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government decided to negotiate arrangements very 
quickly and then Premier Wells and several of his senior 
colleagues had a series of discussions with representatives of 
the denominations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could not reach agreement and eventually the provincial 
government was essentially faced with three options:  to abandon 
the project to make changes believed necessary, to agree to the 
much less far-reaching changes which the leaders of the churches 
were prepared to accept, or the third option, to seek a 
constitutional amendment to give the legislature powers with 
respect to education similar to those already vested in every 
other provincial legislature.  They chose the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes were so important to the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador that a referendum was held.  There was a majority of 
54.8% of those who voted and endorsed the government's reform 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government then asked the House of Assembly to decide on the 
issue and every member of the House, except the Speaker, voted on 
the proposal.  All three parties voted in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1996, for those of us who were here at the time, this 
House debated and passed a resolution amending term 17 as per the 
request of the Newfoundland House of Assembly. The resolution 
then went to the Senate which held public hearings as a single 
Senate committee and passed the resolution with amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the resolution returned to the Chamber, the members decided 
not to accept the Senate amendments and passed the term 17 
resolution for the second time in December 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 3, 1997 the Newfoundland legislature passed the new 
schools act to implement the new education regime in light of the 
new amendments of term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 amendment represented the compromise arising out of 
three years of discussion with the denominational education 
committees.  The attempt to implement this new compromise failed. 
It failed after catholic and protestant committees sought and 
received a court injunction in July 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government complied with the terms of the 
injunction which led to a complete disruption of plans for the 
1997-98 school year.  Those members from Newfoundland and 
Labrador would certainly recall that with great disappointment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point the province had to decide to go back to the 
people to hold a referendum on December 2.  It asked the 
following question:  Do you support a single school system where 
all children regardless of their religious affiliation attend the 
same schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided?  As we have heard in the House, 73% of 
those responding said yes. On September 5 the Newfoundland 
legislature moved unanimously to approve the resolution to amend 
term 17 and to seek the resolution which the House is debating 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last couple of months this issue has been the subject 
of much discussion.  In the last three weeks the joint committee 
of both Houses once again held public hearings. As a result of 
these hearings the joint committee has recommended that both 
Houses of Parliament adopt the resolution to amend term 17 of the 
terms of union of Newfoundland and Labrador with Canada in the 
form tabled in these Houses in November of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of debate.  Quite frankly, as a product of 
that system, I am more than fully persuaded that the amendment is 
an appropriate and proper change.  I have no hesitation in 
recommending it, as I did the previous one, to Parliament. 
Although it is different, it is really asking members on both 
sides of the House and those in the other place to support it for 
the reasons I have given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as do most of my colleagues, that the result will be 
a better education system for the children of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case for this amendment requested by the Newfoundland 
legislature is compelling in my judgment.  Anything which is 
unanimous in that House is compelling.  I speak also as a 
Newfoundlander, as a Canadian and as a member of the Government 
of Canada. I am convinced that the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador will be able to provide the children of my province with 
a better education if we adopt this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have family in Newfoundland who will go through that system. 
It is a very personal decision which I have had to come to.  Each 
time I have examined the pros and cons, and I am pleased to have 
heard them again in the House tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am persuaded on the merits of the amendment.  I am persuaded 
also that it would not threaten or harm the rights of any other 
Canadian.  I am persuaded that its adoption would not require a 
future Parliament to adopt an amendment which would unacceptably 
change the rights of any Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to vote for it for these reasons and on that basis. I 
am going to vote for it because I believe it to be in the best 
interests of the children of my riding of 
Bonavista—Trinity—Conception and in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  I believe they deserve the best that 
the education system of Newfoundland and Labrador can provide.  I 
believe that this amendment if adopted will help to make this so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the hon. member could enlighten us as to whether he 
knows anything about the members of the legislature of 
Newfoundland and their voting patterns. He mentioned that the 
vote was unanimous.  There must have been among those members 
some deeply religious people, perhaps many who had similar 
concerns to what we have heard expressed today from some members 
of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member opposite have any intimate knowledge or does he 
know any of the members of the Newfoundland legislature?  Can he 
explain why they would have voted for the amendment even though 
they have very deeply held religious beliefs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  Yes, I do know most of the members of the 
Newfoundland legislature.  I know some of them very well.  Some 
voted one way in the referendum, but upon reflection when they 
returned to look at the system and what the system was trying to 
achieve, I think they saw it in a different light.  I know one 
member who had second thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who serve the highest courts in the land whether 
they be in the provinces or in this House sometimes have to 
decide whether they want to represent the views of their 
constituents or the views which they believe they must exercise 
on the part of their constituents. 
If they are lucky, they will be one and the same.  With some 
difficulty sometimes they can be different.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not prolong the answer, but if I may, the case of capital 
punishment I think was an issue where sometimes members of this 
House voted with their constituents and other times they voted 
with their conscience. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, a short question to my colleague whom I have always held 
in high regard. I have deep affection for his service to his 
community and country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from downtown Toronto and I consider that we are an 
advantaged community economically.  I have been to the member's 
province many times and know of the deep economic pain that 
exists in the member's community. Does the member think that the 
deep economic pain and the lack of economic resources had 
something to do with so many in the minority not supporting their 
traditional system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have worked with the 
hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood over the years on many 
difficult issues and on many difficult subjects. I want to thank 
him for the passion that he feels for the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we agree on most things, there are certain things we do 
not agree on.  I am not sure how he is going to vote, so I will 
not presuppose this, but I do know the hon. member has concerns 
with this issue.  As I have always done, I respect his concern 
for this issue as passionate as his concern is about most issues, 
but this one in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people decide to vote yes or no on any particular issue, 
there are many reasons for it.  I believe the main reason for the 
resounding vote of 73%—and you cannot question the majority of 
that—stems mainly from the torment that people had with respect 
to putting in place once and for all a system that was more in 
line with the rest of the country and in fact in line with the 
rest of North America. The system in Newfoundland and Labrador 
was unique in all of North America.  I know the hon. member knows 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a torment of those people who had to vote on this 
issue to once and for all put in place an educational system 
which their children would benefit from.  The system would 
operate in a clear cut and decisive manner and would avoid this 
great discussion for 10 years where we have had yes and no and 
referendums and votes in the house of assembly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry, the time 
for questions and comments has expired. Resuming debate.  The 
hon. member for North Vancouver. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term 17 amendment we are debating today offers an 
opportunity for some MPs to take the position that voting their 
conscience is appropriate.  That was mentioned by the hon. 
minister who spoke before me.  They do that even if it is 
opposite to the position taken by their constituents. They say 
they will vote against the amendment for the most part because of 
the need to protect minority rights and/or entitlements from the 
tyranny of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without those MPs being here, there really would not have been 
much of a debate so far, so I thank them for that.  But as a 
result of the position they have taken, they are obliged to 
criticize the term 17 referendums and some unfortunately have 
been doing so using factually unsupportable material or opinions 
that they are representing as fact taken from letters from people 
who were disappointed with the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members had taken the time to call the office of Elections 
Newfoundland to discuss the mechanics of holding those 
referendums, they would have found as I did that a lot of the 
criticisms were completely baseless or were totally inaccurate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before sharing some of that information with members, I would 
first like to remind the House that prior to the first term 17 
referendum, seven specific religious groups controlled pretty 
much all the public schools in the province.  Meanwhile Jews, 
Muslims, Baptists and a whole host of other smaller religions, 
the true minorities, were deprived of any similar right or access 
to the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voters of Newfoundland appear to have recognized that this 
situation was unfair and have voted to level the playing field 
for all religious groups in Newfoundland.  They rejected in two 
referendums an entrenched entitlement of seven major religions to 
reach their hands into the pockets of taxpayers while the other 
religions, in fact the minority, had no such right. The changes 
contained in the term 17 amendment if anything improved the 
situation for minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in terms of those minority rights, the two 
referendums on term 17 offered more than enough opportunities for 
both sides of the argument to make people aware of their 
interpretation of the effects of the proposed changes.  The issue 
was thoroughly discussed at home, in restaurants, at work, on 
television, on radio talk shows.  It is insulting to the 
intelligence of voters to suggest that they did not understand 
what they were voting for or how the rights and entitlements of 
majorities and minorities would be affected by their vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the complaints by critics that a mere 32 days was allowed 
for the actual campaign, 32 days is not an unusually short time 
for a referendum campaign.  The last federal election was only 37 
days of campaign and that was to change the entire government of 
the country with a multitude of issues and complex judgments that 
went along with it. Besides, the term 17 issue had been floating 
around under deep public discussion for many years, as has 
already been mentioned by other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The associated complaint that the government failed to inform 
the public of the text of the amendment until August 25, just two 
days before the advance poll, also has little relevance in terms 
of either the mechanics or outcome.  The fact is that the vote 
was on the question and not on the legal wording of the amendment 
which would enact the question.  There was no obligation 
whatsoever on the government to produce or release the wording of 
the actual amendment at any time and it is questionable how many 
voters would have wanted to read it anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To keep this in context, compare the situation to that of 
placing a clear question to Quebeckers in any new referendum on 
separation.  It would be impossible to have a clear question if 
you had to put the entire bill on the ballot paper.  As I 
mentioned, in most cases the average voter is not interested in 
reading those legal mechanics anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the recent term 17 referendum, the text of the 
question was released on the very same day the referendum was 
announced.  The minister who spoke before me read the question 
into the record so I will not do that again, but the referendum 
related to that question and not to the actual legal wording of 
the amendment which was subsequently voted on in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members will have received letters complaining that the 
Government of Newfoundland used its resources and finances to 
support the yes position during the referendum campaign but that 
opponents had no such resources and should have been given public 
money to fund their opposition.  Opponents were completely free 
to use their own resources to counter the government position and 
they did so.  There was no limit to how much they could spend on 
their side of the argument and they did advertise and promote 
their position very widely just as the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland government said that it spent around $300,000 
to promote its position, but the other side to my knowledge has 
released no figures.  In my opinion there is no convincing 
argument to support the contention that opponents to a government 
position should be given public funds to counter that position. 
If we were to approve of such a measure in general, Canada would 
soon be bankrupt and governments would be paralysed by special 
interest group activities totally funded from the public purse. 
Besides, there is absolutely no evidence in any jurisdiction that 
employs public referendums that the amount of money spent on the 
issue by one side over the other affects the outcome in any 
significant way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in Canada the Charlottetown accord yes side spent 
10 times as much as the winning no side and it still lost.  In 
the 1993 election the PC Party spent something like $40 million 
and had access to huge amounts of free media time but just 
elected two members. 
The Reform Party spent a fraction of that amount, had hardly any 
free media time and elected 52 members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland, members will be interested to learn, the single 
most common complaint received by the chief electoral officer 
during both referendums had nothing to do with spending.  It was 
that too many polling stations were on church property and that 
religious symbols, statues and materials were being used in 
attempts to influence the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those upset by the outcome of the two referendums have 
claimed that the government would not permit scrutineers at the 
polling stations, but in fact the government had no power to make 
that decision.  The determination that scrutineers were not 
appropriate was made by the chief electoral officer as authorized 
by the Newfoundland elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of clearly identified yes and no organizations, 
the chief electoral officer determined that scrutineers would not 
be authorized in the polling stations for either side.  He did, 
however, provide a returning officer, a deputy returning officer 
and an official witness at each polling station.  The job of the 
official witness was to ensure the security of the vote at each 
station, and to date there is no evidence whatsoever of any 
tampering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have criticized the referendum process on the basis 
that only 52% of the people voted, that 73% of that 52% voted 
yes, and that the equivalent of 39% of eligible voters approved 
the question and therefore the results were not valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voter turnout was within normal ranges for this type of 
electoral event in Canada.  To argue that the result is not valid 
leads us down a very slippery slope indeed.  Many MPs in the 
House were elected with percentages well below 50 and percentages 
in the high 30s are not unusual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government won a governing mandate in 1997 with less 
than 40% of the vote, a situation that many would argue has a 
significantly greater negative impact than an amendment to term 
17.  Yet it stands.  I have yet to observe any government member 
arguing that the results of the 1997 election are invalid, even 
though the majority of voters actually voted against the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a dedicated believer in referendums, even those in the form 
of an election, I defend the right of taxpayers and voters to 
make a mistake; to learn that they made a mistake; and to correct 
that mistake, if indeed it was a mistake, via a subsequent 
referendum.  Such an exercise is in the end far more productive 
than having arrogant, self-righteous, genuinely well intentioned, 
biased or badly informed politicians forcing their will upon the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the leader of the Reform Party said earlier today, 
Newfoundlanders were well aware the issue involved not only 
educational reform but the difficult subject of extinguishing, 
granting and balancing majority and minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament should therefore be very careful in presuming that 
its judgment on any of these matters is somehow superior to that 
of the people of Newfoundland.  Let us respect their 
intelligence, their consideration of majority and minority 
rights, and their right to make decisions about the way their 
province operates its system of education.  Let us make sure they 
receive from the House an appropriate endorsement of the term 17 
amendment.

place where we speak for those who need a voice, those who are 
the most disadvantaged, and in this case we know a group in the 
province of Newfoundland is having a right diminished by term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member hold the view that we are here to speak for the 
advantaged primarily, or does he hold the view that there are 
times, even though it may not be popular, when we should consider 
speaking for those who do not have a voice?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has asked a 
question which is difficult to answer because he has not used 
specific examples other than the Newfoundland referendum issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to a paragraph that I used in my speech.  I believe 
in the right of people to make a mistake.  I truly believe that 
in the long run it is a much better experience for politicians 
and for people themselves.  If they make a decision through the 
tool of a referendum we should be obliged to carry out that 
requirement.  They are the ones paying the bills, and we had 
better get used to that.  If we are to carry out their will we 
must do what we can to provide them with sufficient information 
to properly balance opposing points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end it is their decision.  I defend their right to make 
that decision, even to instruct me to do something I do not want 
to do, as I did when I voted for the gun control bill in the last 
parliament.  In the end they will come to see whether or not it 
was a mistake, and if it was they will direct me to fix the 
mistake. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for North Vancouver.  He is probably the 
most tenacious and articulate advocate of direct democracy in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share much of his commitment to direct democracy. I share the 
view, to paraphrase William F. Buckley Junior, that I would 
rather be governed by the first thousand people listed in the St. 
John's phone book than by the faculty of Memorial University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I do think on matters which affect rights, 
acquired rights and constitutional rights, a higher threshold is 
sometimes required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to comment on a couple of the member's remarks.  As 
somewhat of a student of direct democracy and its uses throughout 
the world, I find it peculiar the hon. member suggested it was 
not necessary for the legal text to be associated with the 
question in so far as the referendum was on the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the amendment is before the House.  Virtually 
every direct democracy statute in the world requires that a bill 
or a legal text be put to the people along with the question, and 
that was not the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the hon. member spoke quite rightly against public 
funding for particular sides in a referendum.  I do not believe 
the no side should have had funding in this case.  I believe the 
yes side should have been left to its own resources and not to 
have had privileged access to the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think he is doing his defence of direct 
democracy any good by defending what I would submit were 
questionable practices in terms of this referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those are good questions. The 
member and I have had plenty of discussions in private on this 
matter.  He knows that I consider these to have been 
entitlements, not rights.  That is a point of debate and 
difference which I know is shared by other members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referendums around the world, particularly those initiated by 
citizens, rarely have any type of legal text associated with 
them.  Proposition 13 in California is an example.  We can look 
at the Swiss models.  There is rarely anything other than a 
framework of the legal text that is finally put into practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still maintain it is nice to have those tools available.  I 
would encourage that.  It is my understanding that the 
Newfoundland government set about doing that as fast as it could 
and immediately employed two lawyers to do it.  It was released 
as quickly as possible.  It was not a requirement.  I would still 
say the average person on the street probably did not place as 
much importance on that as they did on the question itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to enter the debate on term 17 and its 
amendment.  My remarks will not be directed toward the democratic 
process, the legality of term 17 or the amendment thereof. My 
remarks will be focused in an attempt to build the case that the 
national interest is being jeopardized by the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will do this from three perspectives.  The provisions of the 
amendment prejudiciously affect the rights of parents to educate 
their children, a right which was declared in the 1948 convention 
by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  It 
endorsed the rights of parents by stating that they had a prior 
right to choose the kind of education that shall be given their 
child.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the political precedent that this creates in Canada 
could be significant.  I will not dwell on that much more except 
to say what I did just now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it creates a severe problem, maybe a series of problems, 
and perhaps even denies the development of a common core of 
values and ethics that underlie a democratic form of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the first of these points, the prejudicial effect 
toward parents to determine the education of their children, it 
expunges the denominational schools but denominational schools 
teach a particular set of values and ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions for religious education that are not specific to 
a religious democracy are to be clearly differentiated from 
courses that have a particular denomination.  What is being 
proposed is not a denominational kind of religious education but 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question, then, that needs to be asked is what kind of a 
religion course will it be.  Will it be the state view of what 
religion ought to be?  Will it be the presentation of a menu of 
values from which individuals may choose whatever they wish? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason to believe that it will probably be the latter. 
I refer in particular to the provisions of the Ontario curricula 
and here I refer to the common curriculum, policies and outcomes, 
Grades 1 to 9, 1995, a document that is in place and operative at 
this time, which reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adapting to changing attitudes is a difficult process for all of 
us and one that can place special demands on students who are 
just beginning to develop and test their values.  It is 
important, therefore, that schools and their programs provide 
both clear guidelines and a climate of flexibility and 
understanding in which independent thinking can thrive and in 
which students can develop values that they themselves consider 
relevant for the life they envisage.  The common curriculum with 
its emphasis on responding to a variety of needs provides the 
basis for such a climate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two principles emerge from that statement in this curriculum. 
The first one is that schools do not teach shared principles or 
values.  Instead there is a climate of flexible, personal values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is that students develop the values which 
they choose, based upon their own perception of the relevance of 
the values to their lives.  This is predicated on the fact that 
there is no right or wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the common curriculum is there a statement that 
students in grades 1 to 9 in Ontario should be taught right from 
wrong.  That is a serious implication.  It is at the heart of our 
justice system and the criminal element in our society.  People 
should know what is right and what is wrong, particularly at the 
beginning of the school system in grades 1 to 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many will argue that values are best transmitted in the family. 
I agree.  That is the most efficient and the most effective way. 
The difficulty is that if a family believes there is a set of 
virtues, ethics and values that should be held, the family 
challenges the state's view which seeks to impart to the young 
that values are after all merely a menu choices and that 
individuals are free to pick what is relevant in what they 
consider to be relevant for the life they envisage.  Such a view 
is also supported by at least on supreme court judge who sits 
today.  That judge states quite bluntly that there should not be 
any one conception of the good life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather clear from such a judge's position that parents 
teaching a particular set of values of the good life is 
unacceptable.  Such a view does not just have implications for 
education.  It removes the basis on which laws themselves are 
formulated.  It removes the basis on which one can judge a good 
law from a bad law, and it eliminates the distinction between 
needs and wants of human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This elimination implies that there is no right desire and there 
is no wrong desire.  There is then also no need to develop the 
ability or the skill to decide what is or what is not a right 
desire.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could have been in the Newfoundland situation an avoidance 
of this whole problem.  It could have been dealt with if the 
opportunity had been presented to the parents to let their tax 
dollar follow their child so that the parents would be able to 
choose the kind of school that they wanted their children to 
attend.   That would have avoided the morass that exists there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree the Newfoundland school system was a mess. The 
organization and administration was a tremendous problem.  I have 
known that for a lot longer than this debate has been going on. 
That had to be fixed. There was a way to fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard many hon. members say the government had no choice. 
That is to suggest that the government had no imagination.  It 
had a choice but it chose not to make that choice.  That is what 
it did.  It chose a particular way and said we had no choice.  It 
is wrong, it is misleading and it is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite aside from the need to have a particular teaching of what 
is right and wrong in the schools, this also I believe has an 
implication for democracy itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest that one of the requirements of a 
democracy is that children know and be taught a program and the 
proper limits of human behaviour.  Unless we know what the proper 
limits of human behaviour are democracy in itself is in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am borrowing here to some degree from David Brown, a Toronto 
lawyer who specializes in commercial litigation with particular 
emphasis on the constitutional provisions in Canada. He says we 
need to have recognized that a common set of values is 
fundamental to the existence and operation of a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989 
injects legal rights into the relationship between parent and 
child.  This was ratified in Canada in 1991.  Justice Wilson, to 
paraphrase this position, observes that these legal rights erects 
an invisible fence around each child which parents will not be 
allowed to penetrate.  We can begin to recognize what the 
situation is here.  There is now a clear distinction here that 
the role of the family in the life of the child is clearly 
reduced by the UN convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the strong possibility that term 17 will also have 
the effect of reducing the role of the family in the lives of our 
children.  Why do I say this?  There is a contemporary view in 
1997 thinking that democracy depends on a core set of values and 
ethics to set the proper limits of human behaviour. There is also 
historical thinking on the very same point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it goes back to 1835 when Alexis Tocqueville travelled 
through the North American continent and concluded that in order 
for the American business to complete itself and to reach the 
proper conclusions of democracy there needed to be a safeguard 
and the safeguard came from the religious and ethical beliefs of 
the people of America.  That is what gave democracy its strength 
and that is what gives it its base.  That is the foundation on 
which our laws rest.  That is also the basis on which we can 
evaluate a good law compared with a bad law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this particular amendment, term 17, to the constitution of 
Canada, not now, in fact maybe not for the next two, three or 
even five years, but the time is coming when we will point to 
this and say that was the beginning of a major rift and a major 
problem with the democracy itself in Canada because our 
youngsters do not have a clear understanding of what is right and 
what is wrong, what is moral, what is ethical and the principles 
with which we should govern our behaviour and set limits on our 
desires. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I was 
confused about the Reform Party's position on this issue before 
and now I am fundamentally confused. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1920"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particular religious denominations are essential, not all, 
because in Newfoundland we had seven denominations which have 
entrenched denominational rights in terms of the educational 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the process of forming legislation and law, what 
exactly is the member talking about?  I would like to know if 
there is such a thing as catholic made criminal law and Jewish 
made criminal law and whether he would subscribe to that view or 
if there is law in the best interest of society and Canadians, 
and that law should apply to all Canadians equally, regardless of 
religious background of the drafters of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask if views held by constituents are valid only if they 
coincide with the views of the members opposite. Clearly this is 
a classic example, 73% of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador 
deciding an issue which is basic to their interests and basic to 
their values.  They clearly articulated their values.  I think we 
have some disagreement. We are citing now international charter 
on why it should not be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed having the 
hon. member as co-chair of the committee.  I learned to respect 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also learned from the question he has just asked that 
sometimes he does not listen as well as he should.  Had he 
listened well he would have heard that I talked not about 
catholic laws, not about the values held by the Pentecostals, the 
Baptists or any other group. What I said was that for a democracy 
to persist and for a democracy to flourish it was necessary to 
have a common set of principles, a shared set of values and a 
shared set of ethics. That is what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no denominational significance given to the particular 
set of values but there had to be agreement on what there ought 
to be.  I will put it in the context of the provision that exists 
in Ontario curriculum where there is no such common principle or 
set of values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has shown that these agreements on the common principles 
and values are held within the particular religious groups.  Many 
of them are shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to deny them and to simply say you have these 
particular sets of values but the school comes along and says 
really it does not matter, there is this clarification that takes 
place and you can choose any one of them, it does not make any 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does make a difference and that is the point I was trying to 
make.  If the hon. member did not understand that, then he has a 
problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member from Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte seems to keep 
referring to members of the Reform Party.  Maybe he will 
understand that this is a free vote where members of different 
parties are taking different positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to take cheap partisan shots and to draw inferences about 
what party is supporting what position is totally inappropriate. 
I wish the hon. member would be a little more responsible in 
conducting himself in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gather the hon. member from Okanagan is saying that unless 
there is in the school system some way of transmitting the basic 
moral values on which any Liberal democracy is founded, they end 
up with a kind of relativism which is itself inimical to 
democracy, that democracy is based on the understanding of the 
inviolable dignity to the human person— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will give the 
last few seconds to the member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would not only create 
chaos, it would also create a society in which there is so much 
conflict that nothing would get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it would do is open the road for tyranny to take place.  In 
fact, it is a perfect building block for tyrants to become the 
governor of the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always held the view that being a member of Parliament is 
a temporal experience.  We are only here, even if we are really 
lucky, for perhaps a couple of terms and then we are back to our 
communities, back with our families on a more regular basis.  We 
have to sit alone at times and say what did we do when we were 
here.  Did we stick to our core values, our core principles or 
did we forget about them and sort of go along with the flow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terrific to have an opportunity in a debate like this 
where it is a free vote.  It does take some of the pressure away. 
Being government members, we have to be extremely sensitive that 
the consensus the government has built or the trust the 
government has built to move the agenda of the nation forward is 
not fractured in any way, shape or form.  But on this motion I 
feel we should be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just been given notice, Mr. Speaker, that I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Ottawa—Vanier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My feeling about this issue is I do not want to get hung up on 
the numbers, whether they were 75% or 25% in terms of the vote. 
I said earlier in the debate today that I have always taken the 
view that we are here to speak for those people who do not have a 
voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an easy town for those who are advantaged.  The 
lobbying, the hustle, the resources if you are from an advantaged 
or favoured group or organization are really not much contest. 
The real challenge for us as members of Parliament is when a big 
wave is coming at you and it seems that you are out of step with 
that wave but you must remember that we are sent here primarily 
to speak for that person who really does not have a voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a view that there are a number of people, and I am not 
judging those who take a different path, who share the path that 
I am on and who would like to preserve the traditional 
denominational system that was in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize quite frankly that if the economy of Newfoundland were 
a lot better this would not be a big issue.  I can say that 
because I can remember many months ago discussing the economics 
of this issue with the premier of Newfoundland.  He said to me 
this is a very expensive system that we have here in 
Newfoundland.  It is a unique expensive decision. If we had lots 
of money this probably would not be such a big issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my friend from Kelowna that we are sometimes driven 
here by economics much more than values.  We are much more driven 
by secularization.  That is the current wave that is going 
through our system right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege, and I consider it a real privilege, to have 
been associated with a teaching order of priests who started in 
this country 147 years ago, the Basilian Fathers. They came from 
France.  They were invited by the bishop of Toronto, Bishop De 
Charbonnel, and they came to teach poor illiterate Irish 
immigrants. Over the last 147 years the Basilian Fathers have 
developed teaching institutions in every region of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was privileged to have the opportunity to attend St. Michael's 
college school in Toronto and I later attended the Basilian 
university in Houston, Texas, St. Thomas. 
I would be walking away from the 10 year experience I had with 
the Basilian Fathers and all the other lay educators that were 
associated with the Basilians if I supported this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a Catholic education is not just about teaching 
the intellect, it is about teaching the whole person.  We are all 
human, we all make mistakes, we all fall.  But there was a 
tremendous experience in being in an environment where the whole 
person was being developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A denominational institution is different from a 
non-denominational institution.  I have been associated with both 
at the university level. I think that we have a responsibility 
and a duty here when we see a right being diminished to say hold 
on, do we really need to do this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to say 75% of the people voted for it and all the 
members of the legislature voted for it, then I would be walking 
away from all those educators who were a part of my life.  I 
would be walking away from those educators who are a part of my 
son's life.  I do not think that would be sticking to my core 
principles or values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, this movement of secularization that is going 
through our country right now is all in the name of fiscal 
expediency.  We tend to cut, shave and eliminate because we do 
not have the resources.  My goodness, some of the founders of 
these traditional educational institutions had more creativity. 
Some of them actually taught in barns and did not have half as 
much as some of our school boards have today. However that total 
experience, the teaching of the whole person was important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 of this term 17 amendment states that the state will 
take over the management of the religious opportunity.  It just 
missed the whole point. This is not about teaching a religious 
course.  A Catholic education is an experience from the moment 
students arrive in the morning until the time they hang up their 
football cleats in the locker room. It is the fact that they can 
walk down a hall to a chapel.  It is the fact that there is a 
daily mass.  It does not mean they have to go every day, but it 
is part of the total environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that really burns me deeply about this amendment is 
that we are showing a lack of respect for the thousands and 
thousands of men and women who dedicated their lives to the 
Catholic institutions, the human capital who really became the 
backbone of this country, be they Jesuits, Basilians or Sisters 
of St. Joseph's, and the ongoing litany of people who worked for 
$5 a week. For that reason I will not be supporting this 
amendment.

moment to acknowledge the very special and meaningful 
conversations the hon. member and I have had regarding this 
issue.  I respect his position on this.  He spoke very eloquently 
and from the heart about a number of his own personal

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in Newfoundland and Labrador who have been 
educated through the integrated education system.  The integrated 
education system is a denominational system.  It is basically the 
Anglican, United and Salvation Army churches that have come 
together and have provided religious education and as well 
religious instruction in a way which is not denominationally 
based.  In fact it is a denominational education classification 
but it offers instruction which is not denominationally based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out something about the students who went to an 
integrated school next door.  I found the moral integrity, the 
values that those students held and their personal development to 
be quite sound and strong.  Frankly, they are very productive 
citizens in society.  They are participating in a good structure 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any particular opinion about whether 
or not it is absolutely essential that denominations and 
denominations only participate in religious instruction?  I found 
an example which we used in Newfoundland and Labrador in 
providing the current drafting of the term 17 amendment, the 
integrated education system, and it works quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Resources.  I 
concur that we have exchanged productively on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not standing here in judgment of any system that is in 
place right now.  What I am concerned about and feel strongly 
about is a system that was part of the arc of Confederation, to 
quote Senator Connolly, and that it was a right that was part of 
putting this whole nation together.  I see that right being 
diminished.  I feel there is the possibility that this thought 
process of secularization could expand and move to different 
regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all of that, in no way, shape or form am I judging 
the character or the contribution to society and to the country 
that any other educational system provides.  It is just that I 
happen to be partial to the institution which I had the 
opportunity to participate in.  I know there are many others who 
have participated in similar institutions across Canada who share 
this view.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in sharing 
my conclusions, I would like to address three points dealing essentially 
with the motion before us. The first one is the education of French 
speaking Newfoundlanders; the second, public support for this amendment; 
and finally, our role as parliamentarians, members of the Parliament of 
Canada and the House of Commons, with regard to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the education of French speaking Newfoundlanders, last year, 
when the House first considered this issue as part of an amendment to 
term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada, I indicated 
that my support was largely based on the fact that, in the process, the 
Government of Newfoundland would be fulfilling its responsibilities 
under section 23 of the charter.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be recalled that, with passage of the Constitutional 
Act in 1982, section 23 of the charter guaranteed official language 
minorities everywhere in the country, from sea to sea to sea, the 
right to education in their language.  That took a while to happen 
in Newfoundland.  Here we are in 1997 finally seeing them respect 
that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dare I speculate that the need, desire or will of the 
Newfoundland government to get term 17 of its union with Canada 
modified is in part what made it aware it might get a poorer 
reception in Parliament—if I can use that expression here—if it 
were not respecting the commitments under section 23 of the 
charter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection I would like to quote a portion of a letter 
from Johanne Lacelle to the co-chair of the joint committee.  She 
was writing on behalf of the Fédération des parents francophones 
de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador. She said “Since June 1997—not 
long ago—francophones in the province have a shools act 
guaranteeing complete control over our school system.  At last we 
can say that language rights are henceforth going to be in line 
with section 23 of the charter.  School administration is now in 
the hands of the francophones.  From now on, under this act, the 
schools will have the status of non-denominational schools, in 
line with the proposed reform the province is calling for”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this letter and the fact that the Fédération did not wish 
to appear, did not feel the need to appear, I think we may conclude 
and state that the francophones of Newfoundland have the management 
of their school system under control, and we hope that they may use 
this to promote the growth of their community in, as she so aptly 
put it, nondenominational schools.  This is another element.  I do 
not think that we have said sufficiently in debates in committee 
and here that the francophone population of Newfoundland seems to 
agree to having their children educated in nondenominational 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the matter of popular will, in committee several 
questions were raised regarding public consultation.  Some fairly 
sharp criticism was directed at the process, the referendum 
question and the way it was held. 
The results were often interpreted to mean that the minorities had 
not agreed to the change.  I have a question on that, which has not 
really been raised up to now.  In my opinion, we should give it 
some thought.  It concerns the fact that the denominational 
classes, if I can call them that, did not insist that the vote be 
taken along religious lines. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they had wanted to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt 
that their own denomination were opposed to the changes and if 
they thought they had a sufficiently large number of people 
within their own denomination that would vote against it, then it 
behooved the representatives of these denominations to ask that 
the vote be done by denominational class, and that was not done. 
We were told in committee by the minister responsible for 
education that that offer was put on the table, not for this 
current vote but for the previous one.  The offer was not taken 
up nor was it asked for during the last vote that occurred in 
early September as a result of the campaign in August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a situation in which those who argue that the minorities 
did not give their consent to this could have found a way to 
demonstrate that, yet they failed to even ask for that to be 
done.  They could have been clamouring for this to be done, to 
have all the Pentecostal votes identified.  When someone voted 
they could have said that they were Catholic or that they were 
such and such. 
We do that all the time in Ontario municipal elections when we 
cast a ballot, yet that was not put forward.  It was not 
requested.  I suspect that suggests quite a bit.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can read into this what we wish.  I have read into it that 
perhaps there is a consensus, even within the denominations, for 
a change to the system in many instances. Perhaps not in all of 
them, but in some of them I would suspect that the reason there 
of no insistence for such a vote was because the result may have 
been somewhat other than some people of those denominations would 
have wanted to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to put this on the floor so that members who are 
opposing it on the grounds that the minorities did not give their 
consent can reflect on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to address what our role is as parliamentarians. 
It is definitely not to rubber stamp.  I am very pleased that the 
three votes in which I have been involved in my short time here 
which have dealt with constitutional amendments using section 43 
of the 1982 act have all been free votes.  It speaks very well of 
the seriousness with which we address these issues.  We rise 
above partisan considerations.  Free votes force members to think 
about the issue.  It removes the cushion, if you will, of the 
whipped vote.  We have to be accountable for our votes.  I 
believe that is the way which we as parliamentarians should 
address a constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although our role is not to rubber stamp, it is certainly not to 
be systematically opposed. I have had a chance in recent weeks to 
sit on two committees, the one studying the bilateral 
constitutional amendment for the Quebec school boards and this 
one.  I have been pleased with the approach taken by all parties 
and all representatives of both Houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method of helping our country, of ensuring that some 
systems and some of our institutions evolve, is very good. 
Perhaps it has not been anticipated to be that useful, but it is 
certainly turning out to be that way.  I want to encourage the 
parliaments of Canada to realize that there are certain ways of 
making systems and some of our institutions progress. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our duty, as I have pointed out, to systematically 
oppose or blindly approve recommendations put to us.  But, having 
sat on the committee, listened to witnesses and considered all the 
arguments, I think we can say without fear of error that the 
amendment is put to us with the approval of the people of 
Newfoundland and certainly the unanimous approval of the 
Newfoundland legislature, which is not to be sniffed at, and is one 
of the most important factors to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I have absolutely no qualms about 
supporting and encouraging my colleagues to support the proposal 
before us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
will come as no great surprise when I tell you that, like my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and other parties in the House, I 
will be enthusiastically supporting the constitutional amendment 
before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to emphasize that this is a constitutional amendment. 
It would obviously be misleading to those listening if the full 
significance of the debate today, and for a number of days now, 
were not made clear.  When we speak about a constitutional 
amendment, the first thing that should be said is that a 
constitution is the supreme law of a nation.  There are two kinds 
of constitution.  Canada has what is described as a written 
constitution.  There are basically five ways of amending it.  The 
constitutional amendment before us is made possible through section 
43. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1950"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT105"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1950

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43, the constitutional amendment we are debating, is 
a bilateral constitutional amendment.  This means that it is 
possible for a province, in an area under its jurisdiction, 
therefore in an area mentioned in section 92 or section 93, to 
amend the text of the Constitution with the consent of both Houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also worth pointing out that federalism has 
three main features.  A system is described as federal when there 
is a constitution and a division of powers between lower and higher 
levels.  The third feature is obviously a court of justice that 
arbitrates disputes or challenges that may arise between partners 
in the Constitution. 
This gives us some idea of the system in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland, headed by the former Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans of this government, is asking to be allowed, for 
all intents and purposes, to establish a public school system. Some 
people might be tempted to do certain things, but not you, Mr. Speaker, 
because I know you are a sensible and informed person. I remind our 
viewers that, throughout your childhood, not that long ago, you took 
great pleasure in reading constitutional law treaties. This kept you 
away from the more “in” crowd, but turned you into a well-informed legal 
expert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This having been said, the issue here is really to establish a 
public, non-denominational school system in Newfoundland, the last 
province to join Confederation, in 1949, under the leadership of Joey 
Smallwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider these issues, we have to keep two things in mind. 
Confederation was initially made up of four provinces. All the provinces 
that joined afterwards had clauses protecting minority rights regarding 
schools. The provinces can be divided in two large groups: those that 
adhered to section 93, and those that obtained other specific rights. In 
the case of Newfoundland, it is not section 93 that applies, but term 
17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be mentioned that, as regards term 17, which is the 
clause governing the terms of the union of Newfoundland with the 
Dominion of Canada—as our country was called back then—there are 
three major aspects. First, as we mentioned, term 17 refers to an 
exclusively denominational school system. Just think of what  Quebec did 
in the sixties—this incredible period of change called the quiet 
revolution, after an English speaking journalist coined the phrase. 
Quebec asked the clergy to withdraw from the school system, which is 
what is now happening in Newfoundland. Indeed, the idea is not only to 
create non-denominational structures, but to establish a public school 
system. In other words, linguistic rights are not the issue here. 
These are not religious rights. We will come back to this later, but 
these are indeed rights related to access to education and the 
organization of a public system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this was a province that did not have a public education 
system when it signed the treaty in 1867. Second, there were seven major 
denominations representing 90% of the population. I can name them to 
show the extent of the denominations involved. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1955"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT106"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT106"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1955
<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was, of course, the Anglicans, the Presbyterians, the 
Salvation Army, the United Church, the Pentecostals, the Roman Catholics 
and the Seventh-Day Adventists. You can easily imagine how this kind of 
religious mosaic resulted in a rather fragmented school system. In this 
respect, one of the forms this fragmentation took, which may seem 
unimportant but can be extremely important in relation to the students' 
quality of life, was described by parents in the evidence they 
presented, which I would now like to share with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evidence can be found in the report tabled by the joint 
committee. 
I will repeat for the benefit of our viewers that there are two kinds of 
parliamentary committees: the standing committees such as the justice 
committee, the agriculture committee and the environment committee, 
which are mandated to review certain bills, and the joint committees 
made up of representatives of this House and the other place, better 
known as the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read the testimony of a parent reminding us of one of the 
problems posed, if only from a transportation point of view, by 
maintaining a system with seven different denominations, in which there 
are essentially no neighbourhood schools. The fact that you live next to 
a school does not mean that your child can enrol in that particular 
school, since enrolment is based on the religion declared by the 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the parents in the Education First group told of the 
case of a child who could walk to primary school.  Now that she is 
in seventh grade, however, she has to leave home at 7.30 a.m. and 
take the bus.  Within ten minutes she passes a Catholic school. 
After 20 minutes, she goes past another school.  Both offer seventh 
grade.  Finally she goes past a third school, which offers grades 
seven to nine, before she reaches her school an hour after leaving 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So one of the striking elements in the organization of the 
Newfoundland system is the distances children face in registering 
not at a neighbourhood school, but at one that provides religious 
education in the faith of their parents.  This is what they are 
going to put an end to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who would be tempted to think this is a recent debate in 
Newfoundland should remember that it has gone on since 1990. 
It is not recent.  Its roots warrant mentioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, a commission of inquiry was set up to consider the 
future of the Newfoundland education system.  You know, Mr. 
Speaker, how important education is to a society.  You know, 
because your education is not lacking, you have a higher education. 
I have been told in fact that you were always at the top of your 
class.  I have not checked personally, but you are sufficiently 
talented for me to believe it.  Education is important.  It is 
important because it helps socialize, but it inculcates values. 
When we want to find out a society's most commonly held values, we 
must look to the schools.  Not only do they teach values, but they 
foster learning. 
And generally, not just any sort of learning, but learning that 
provides a competitive edge on the job market and that provides 
access to the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital to a society.  I think the Government of 
Newfoundland, for partisan considerations, is right to be concerned 
about the efficiency of its school system. 
That is what the commission of inquiry said.  In the early 1990s, 
it concluded that it was important for the future, for the future 
of the young students of Newfoundland, for there to be an 
integrated system with shared schools. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2000"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that came a lengthy process. First of all, in 1995-96, 
there was a first referendum.  You know what aphrodisiac powers 
that word has in this House, it is a word that gets the government 
all excited.  Governments get excited any chance they get, and we 
are dealing now with one that gets really hot and bothered at the 
mere mention of the word referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there was a first one, to be followed by a second in which 
Mr. Tobin's government attempted to strike a compromise between a 
system of education I would qualify as a hybrid, a combination of 
separate schools and the right of certain religious denominations 
to be heard.  In that referendum, 54% supported the government 
resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I feel obliged to specify this?  First of all, because 
I am reminding you that this is a debate that has been discussed in 
Newfoundland since the early 1990s.  Second, because there have 
been consultations of all sorts.  There were public hearings, two 
referendums, not one but two.  The first was in 1995, at which time 
54% of Newfoundlanders voted yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting, strictly from the constitutional point of 
view, because I would remind you that what we are dealing with here 
is a constitutional amendment. 
It is therefore an amendment that will change the most important 
document of a country, its supreme law, its constitution.  The 
government of the time, the same one as today, responded favourably 
to this constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is interesting to recall that it was not two-thirds, 
not 70% of Newfoundlanders, who voted yes, but 54% at the outside. 
The government, led by the same Prime Minister guiding our 
destinies today, followed up on this resolution.  It wrote to the 
Premier of Newfoundland to tell him that, in January 1996, it would 
introduce a resolution asking parliamentarians in the House of 
Commons and the Senate to approve the resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind you that this therefore means that the figure 
of 50% is acceptable in a referendum because, in a democracy, 
whatever is said and done, it is the majority that rules. 
When the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs ventures to tell us, 
in his sometimes high and mighty way, that 50% is not enough in the 
case of Quebec, of national unity, I think we must remind him, in 
all fairness, that there is a precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a referendum in 1995.  Naturally, there was a debate 
in the House in 1996, and we went along, both in the House of 
Commons and in the Senate, with the resolution introduced by the 
government.  This was followed by a court challenge by two 
religious denominations in Newfoundland.  They challenged not 
<I>stricto sensu</I> the constitutional amendment, but the new public 
education act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an injunction.  We know how radical a process that 
is, with its immediate impact. 
The supreme court of Newfoundland ruled in their favour.  This had 
the result of halting the process of reform in which the 
Newfoundland government of Brian Tobin was intensely involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, the premier then and now, the former Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, whom you remember fondly, I believe, Mr. 
Speaker, decided to hold a referendum on September 2. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2005"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT108"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT108"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2005

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum was on a clear question, a question such as we like 
them, that is a question which is immediately understandable when you 
read it, a question which is unequivocal. So, allow me to read it for 
the benefit of those who may not have done so. The provincial government 
complied with the conditions of the injunction. 
It announced on July 31, 1997, through its most important citizen, the 
premier of the province, that a referendum would be held on September 2, 
and that the question would be: “Do you support a single school system 
where all children, regardless of their religious affiliation, attend 
the same schools where opportunities for religious education and 
observances are provided?” The question was clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the question triggered a debate. The debate was not like 
the one in Quebec, since there is no requirement under Newfoundland's 
referendum act, which is in fact an election act, because there is no 
specific referendum act. So, a debate took place, thus giving the public 
an opportunity to discuss what was at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the referendum was over—and I hope this will happen to us 
some day—73% of voters had said yes. 
So, 73% of them authorized the Tobin government to conduct an in-depth 
review of the school system with a view to establishing amalgamated, 
non-denominational schools where religious education will be permitted 
as requested by parents. That is where we are at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this referendum, as required by procedure, another 
resolution was tabled by the executive, which had to be debated by both 
Parliaments. This debate led to the establishment of a joint committee 
and, today, as parliamentarians, we must vote either in favour of or 
against this resolution. It is interesting because the Newfoundland 
situation reminds us of the need to modernize the school system, of 
course, but also of minority rights. It does not deal substantially with 
linguistic rights, section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1867, or even 
religious rights. 
It deals with the right to reorganize the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that consultations, two referendums, were held 
and that this debate had been going on since 1990, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, with his stubbornness that borders on 
neurosis at times, nevertheless insisted on consultations being 
conducted. We went along with this little game and were represented in 
the process by the dynamic Bloc Quebecois member for Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support this amendment because we believe that, in a 
democracy, the voice of reason is always that of the majority. In this 
case, we are talking about an indisputable majority, since 73% approved 
the government resolution. 
I know that, in a not so distant future, when we consider other 
referendum results, we will remember the precedents created on this 
occasion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a question for 
the hon. member.  In 1987 the Premier of Newfoundland made 
specific requests in the Legislative Assembly of Newfoundland to 
constitutionally entrench the rights of the Pentecostals forever. 
He made a permanent gesture for the Pentecostals in the province 
of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on his impression of what a permanent 
constitutional entrenchment would be and whether the permanent 
constitutional entrenchment of a minority as in the case of the 
Pentecostals should be extinguished by the majority?

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the hon. member's 
interest in these matters, and I thank him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pentecostals make up 7% of the population of Newfoundland. 
It could no doubt be recalled that, where constitutional law is 
concerned, a minority cannot be subordinated to a majority.  I am 
prepared to admit, with the hon. member, that there is an 
obligation in a civilized society to ensure that minorities are 
adequately protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is involved here, however, is the right of a government 
to modernize its educational system, because this is first and 
foremost an amendment to ensure that the Newfoundland school system 
will enter the 21st century as more modern, more efficient, more 
responsive to the needs of the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tempted to answer my colleague's question with another 
question.  Does he believe that constitutions are immutable?  I 
myself believe that they must adjust to society, that constitutions 
must adjust to individuals.  There is no reason to believe that a 
constitution or a constitutional amendment is immutable.  Such 
logic would tie our hands and preclude any possibility of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to be taken into consideration, what we must ask 
ourselves as parliamentarians, is the following: Did the 
Pentecostals have the opportunity to make their points of view 
known?  Are there sufficient guarantees that minorities were 
consulted and are in favour of the constitutional amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. member that the two Pentecostal MLAs 
in Newfoundland voted in favour of the government resolution. I 
believe that this is the best guarantee available to us to conclude 
that a democratic debate has taken place and that all minorities 
had a chance to make their views heard. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will answer the hon. member's question.  If the minority is being 
particularly entrenched in the constitution in a special fashion, 
which it was by the Newfoundland legislature, particularly 
mentioning Pentecostal and to be entrenched forever, the way to 
remove that entrenchment would be to consult that minority and 
have that minority's agreement or consent in some form to remove 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it is specifically toward that minority I would think 
that minority must be approached to remove it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand my colleague's 
point of view.  It is a testament to his sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind him that, when his leader spoke, not so long 
ago, about Quebec's section 93 amendment, one of the pre-conditions 
he set for parliamentary approval of a constitutional amendment was 
that a referendum be held, that there be extensive public 
consultations.  I believe that these conditions have been met in 
the case before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I have trouble seeing how the Reform Party's logic 
will allow it to vote in favour of a constitutional amendment 
since, even in very extreme cases, less ambiguous cases where there 
was public debate, where two referendums were held, where 73% of 
people voted in favour, and there are not many democracies that can 
lay claim to that high a percentage of voters in favour of any 
subject, they are not persuaded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I ask my Reform colleague what will be the standard, the 
criterion that will satisfy these people constitutionally that they 
may approve an amendment requested by a province if, when 73% of 
the public has voted in favour, they rise in the House and say nay?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and participate in today's very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the special committee that studied term 17, 
that listened to representations from the people of Newfoundland 
and from others who are concerned about the amendment that is 
before this House.  I thought I would begin my remarks today by 
sharing with this House and the people who are watching the 
debate some of the things that I learned while I was on the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we get to where we are today?  Why is Newfoundland and 
Labrador requesting this change to their terms of agreement, 
specifically to term 17?  The reason that they are requesting 
this is because they want to change their school system.  I found 
that Newfoundland and Labrador is the only jurisdiction in 
Canada, in fact the only jurisdiction in North America, that does 
not have a public school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland and Labrador does not have a non-denominational 
school system.  If you want to go to school in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, you must attend one of the schools run by one of the 
church groups that has denominational rights in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anything wrong with that?  Well, it has caused problems 
in Newfoundland and Labrador.  It has caused problems because 
often children or the parents of those children want the child to 
be able to go to the school across the street, but in order to 
register for a school in Newfoundland and Labrador, you have to 
take your birth certificate.  You have to tell them what religion 
you are and the schools will accommodate first all of the 
children from that religious community and then, if there is 
space available, they will accept the children who are not from 
that denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have the situation where too often, too commonly, children 
are forced on to buses, pass several schools and can sit on that 
bus half an hour to an hour.  We heard of students who spend 
three hours of their school day sitting on buses.  We heard of 
students who could not participate in extra-curricular activities 
unless they could arrange for a lift home after school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have been debating the 
type of school system that they want for their children for over 
10 years.  We heard from people who made representations to our 
committee that it has been a difficult and divisive debate.  We 
heard that eight years ago there was a royal commission and we 
were told that the recommendation of that royal commission some 
eight years ago was in fact the change that is before this House 
of Commons, this Parliament, this Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about that.  Ten years ago the debate began.  Eight years 
ago a royal commission recommended that term 17 be changed so 
that Newfoundland and Labrador could have a non-denominational 
school system.  What happened in those intervening years since 
that royal commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was debate, hot and heavy, passionate debate. That 
debate culminated and a compromise was proposed by the former 
premier Clyde Wells, someone who I did not always agree with, I 
have to tell this House.  We did not see eye to eye on 
everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Wells proposed a compromise and the debate that ensued 
on the compromise was a difficult and divisive debate.  A strange 
thing happened in Newfoundland and Labrador.  That debate became 
a non-partisan debate and at the end of that debate on the 
compromise, after listening to all sides, after a referendum that 
we heard at committee was confusing because it was by its very 
nature a compromise, we heard that there was a unanimous free 
vote in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the compromise solution, the previous changes to term 17, was 
being implemented, problems arose.

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those who opposed the compromise took the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador to court.  In the court's wisdom, the 
compromise was struck down.  The premier of Newfoundland, now 
Premier Tobin, went back to the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador on July 31, 1997, days after the court struck down the 
decision on the previous amendment on term 17.  Within days he 
said we were going to have a clear question.  We are going to ask 
the people of Newfoundland and Labrador if they are prepared to 
support a change, a very significant change.  We are going to ask 
them if they support a change from a denominational school system 
to a non-denominational public school system.  We are going to 
ask them if they want to have religious course offered within 
that school system, but they will be non-specific, 
non-denominational religious courses on world religion.  That was 
a very clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I discovered was that the same percentage of people in 
Newfoundland and Labrador who voted in the referendum that was 
held on September 2 voted in the last federal election.  It is 
true the voter turnout was not high.   It was not 80% or 70%, but 
it was a clear majority.  Fifty-three per cent of the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador went out to vote in this most important 
referendum, a similar number and a similar percentage as had 
voted last June 2 in the federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the people in Newfoundland and Labrador who went to vote on 
September 2, 73% of them supported the clear question which was 
asked in the referendum by their government.  They said we 
support change in Newfoundland, we support a change from 
denominational schools to public non-denominational schools. They 
said that clearly, they said it loudly and they said it after 
almost 10 years of public discussion and public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found most compelling as I listened carefully to the 
passionate and anguished presentations that came before our 
committee was that the ensuing debate in the national assembly 
was again a non-partisan debate.  No one questioned the other's 
motives.  No one attempted to take political advantage.  Everyone 
said, what is in the interests of our students?  What is in the 
interests of quality education for those students?  In 
Newfoundland and Labrador, which is not the richest province in 
this land, they said what is in the interest of cost effective 
quality education in Newfoundland? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that time and again from people who came before the 
committee.  What the people of Newfoundland and Labrador voted 
for was an end to the chaos, an end to the debate which had 
divided communities, an the end to the debate which was divisive 
and difficult for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they came before our committee and asked for was a 
resolution.  Those people who came before the committee were not 
unanimous in their support.  In all of my almost 20 years in 
public life, I rarely have seen an issue where there is unanimous 
support.  In fact I have said, Mr. Speaker, you do not have to 
say it is a controversial issue because if it is not 
controversial, it is not an issue.  If there is unanimous 
support, it is not an issue.  What makes it an issue is that not 
everyone agrees.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They come to this House on this day and say can we in Canada be 
responsive to a province that has had a history such as 
Newfoundland and Labrador, which is unique, different?  Certainly 
Newfoundland and Labrador's history when it comes to education is 
different from that of any other province in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said to my constituents in Thornhill, to those who have 
expressed concerns about what is happening in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, that there are more differences than there are 
similarities between the situation in Newfoundland and Labrador 
and the situation in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that what we are doing in this Parliament is 
going to in any way set a precedent for any other province, 
particularly the province of Ontario.  I do not believe it.  I do 
not believe it because Ontario has a very different history than 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario has a very different education system than exists in 
Newfoundland and Labrador today.  Ontario does not have the same 
kind of terms of union that Newfoundland and Labrador are trying 
to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those people who are raising concerns that what we do in this 
House on term 17 may in the future have some negative 
implications for other provinces, may in the future have 
established a precedent, I say to them that the only precedent 
that changes to term 17 will create in my opinion is the 
precedent that says in Canada changes to our constitution are 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constitution is a living document.  It is not carved in 
stone.  It can be responsive to the needs of individual 
provinces.  It can respond and it can be flexible.  It is not 
difficult to understand why there are those who, for their own 
reasons, resist change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I understand that those who have the power to control 
the school systems do not want to see that changed.  I understand 
that.  It is difficult to make change in a constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has struggled with the desire for that change over 
the course of its history, but if ever there was a clear example 
of when this Parliament should be responsive to a request from 
the provinces, if there was ever an example of due process having 
taken place, of the expression of will from the people at a 
non-partisan free vote again in the Newfoundland House of 
Assembly, this change to term 17 is the very best example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the referendum where 73% of the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador said that they want this change on a clear question, 
there was a non-partisan free vote, unanimous, in the 
Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives supported it.  The NDP supported it.  The one 
independent member of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of 
Assembly who represents a significant Métis and aboriginal 
constituency supported it.  Yes, the Liberal government and all 
the members of that House, be they Pentecostals, be they 
catholics, be they any religion under the sun or no religion, 
they all supported this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know why?  I believe it is because they all want what 
is best for the students of Newfoundland and Labrador.  They want 
to be able to use their resources in the most cost-effective way 
that will give their students the best possible quality education 
and the best possible chance for success in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the members of this House to listen to the voice that has 
been tortured. 
We heard from one delegation that they had been tortured in this 
debate for a decade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us help them put this into their history.  If we do not pass 
this resolution expeditiously in the House they will not be 
prepared to look after their students come next September.  It is 
irresponsible not to move forward if we care about the students 
of Newfoundland and Labrador, if we care that they will have the 
opportunity to receive the best quality, cost effective education 
that can be provided in that province.  Let us give those kids a 
chance.  Let the province get past this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After sitting on the committee, I believe its majority report is 
the best thing for Canada and for Newfoundland and Labrador.  I 
hope members of the House will support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I need a 
little clarification.  The hon. member opposite indicated that 
someone was tortured.  I hope that was not in the physical sense. 
Hopefully it was only in the mental sense. 
Since it was a phrase used in the middle of her ideas without 
connecting ideas, who specifically was tortured and by whom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to clarify 
this point for the member.  If he checks the committee 
proceedings he will see that a delegation of parents came before 
the committee and said that they felt this debate had tortured 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it was mental torture.  It was anguish and it was anxiety. 
It was worry about the students and their future.  It was about 
the divisiveness within the community which divided friends.  It 
was cruel, mental torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying it.  The people of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
the parents who came before the committee, used that word.  They 
also used the words “chaos” and “divisiveness”.  These 
difficult expressive words spoke volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member who asked this important question will talk to 
his colleagues so that we can respond in a positive way to those 
people in Newfoundland and Labrador who have felt tortured by 
this debate and help them to put this in their history books and 
move beyond it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to rise in debate on the resolution to 
amend term 17.  I sat as an associate member on the joint special 
parliamentary committee dealing with this term.  I would first 
like to recognize that it is an extraordinarily difficult issue 
requiring the wisdom of Solomon to determine how to vote on this 
matter.  I appreciate the fact that it appears to be a free vote 
in every caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks I will not be speaking on behalf of my party but 
rather with respect to my own conscience as it was formed in the 
process of those hearings and through the contact I have had with 
many people in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the very passionate remarks of the 
hon. member who preceded me.  She spoke about deep divisions in 
Newfoundland and the witnesses who appeared at the joint 
committee speaking about the “torture” they underwent over this 
ongoing and divisive debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the witnesses that appeared before the committee 
expressed deep and passionately held views in opposition to this 
proposed term.  They are among the minority, perhaps the minority 
of the minority but a minority nevertheless, who feel that this 
amendment would alienate from them a constitutional right which 
is central to their privileges as citizens of Canada and of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By no means is there unanimity in Newfoundland with respect to 
this amendment.  In fact every Newfoundlander I have heard from 
directly as a member of Parliament has been encouraging me to 
exercise our constitutional authority to oppose this application.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise not to oppose a unanimous consensus of the province of 
Newfoundland but rather to speak on behalf of the small number of 
people in that province who feel their minority rights are being 
trounced upon by the process in which we are now engaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this amendment do?  It replaces the original term 17 
that was entered into the constitution at the time of 
confederation of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949, with a new 
term which would continue to recognize education as a provincial 
responsibility, and quite rightly so, and which would remove 
forever and extinguish permanently the denominational right to 
govern schools and school systems in a denominational character 
that was enshrined in 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would replace those rights with a general guarantee of access 
to courses in religion that are not specific to a religious 
denomination and in section 3 to religious observances that shall 
be permitted in a school where requested by parents.  Let us be 
quite clear about what this does.  It removes a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the proponents of this amendment will say that we are 
not talking about minority rights because, after all, 97% of 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians come under the coverage of the 
seven denominations affected.  I think that is really 
pettifogging.  I think it is quibbling with constitutional 
concepts.  Whether it is minority rights, religious rights, 
acquired rights, vested rights or entrenched rights does not 
matter one whit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from an esteemed member of the House, the hon. member 
for Lac-Saint-Louis, in the debate on a similar initiative in the 
Quebec legislature many years ago, “rights are rights are 
rights”.  I do not care how we cut them up, how we parse them, 
what terminology we apply, we are talking about guarantees that 
were extended to certain communities in the formation of the 
country, in this case in the incorporation of Newfoundland into 
this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of rights are we talking about when it comes to the 
rights of parents to direct their children in a particular 
religious tradition?  The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and many proponents of this amendment have said that the right to 
publicly funded denominational education does not constitute a 
fundamental right as long as parents have access to that kind of 
education, be it privately funded or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they say that this is not like the right to 
exercise religion or the right to freedom of expression, which 
they argue are fundamental rights.  Instead they suggest we are 
dealing with an entitlement, namely the entitlement to use the 
public purse to finance denominational education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg to differ, and in so doing I would like to refer to the 
universal declaration of human rights from 1948, a document which 
came out of the atrocious circumstances and the lessons of the 
second world war.  The world gathered together in an effort to 
define once and for all what constituted basic human rights. 
Article 26 of that declaration stated that everyone “has the 
right to education.  Education shall be free at least in the 
elementary and fundamental stages”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to say under subsection 2 that “education shall be 
directed to the full development of the human personality and to 
the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms”.  Under section 3 it stated that “parents have a 
prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given 
to their children”.  It defines education as education that 
shall be free; in other words, publicly funded education at least 
in the elementary and fundamental stages. 
It went on to say that such education will be directed by parents 
who have a prior right to choose what kind of education they 
shall receive.

<A HREF="#LINKT114"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle was further enunciated in the international 
covenant on economic, social and cultural rights in 1966, wherein 
article 13 recognized “the right of everyone to education”.  It 
further stated that primary education shall be compulsory and 
available free to all, and that the states and parties to the 
covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents to 
ensure the religious and moral education of their children in 
conformity with their own convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the 1976 international covenant on civil and 
political rights which stated in article 18 that everyone shall 
have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
Under section 4 it stated that the states and parties to the 
present covenant undertook to have respect for the liberty of 
parents, and when applicable legal guardians, to ensure the 
religious and moral education of their children in conformity 
with their own convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that we are not talking about a mere privilege or a 
mere entitlement.  The right to direct education, as has been 
understood through these international covenants, means the right 
to access publicly funded education, free education at least at 
the elementary stage, which reflects the convictions of parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The abolition of the denominational school guarantees in term 17 
means the abolition of those rights as defined by these 
international covenants.  I think that is very grave indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need a very high standard to alienate such 
rights.  I would argue that the only such standard would be that 
the groups affected, be they minorities or majorities, indicate 
their consent to the removal of such rights.  I submit that in 
the referendum, the unanimous vote of the Newfoundland 
legislature notwithstanding, such consent was not absolutely 
clear.  Why do I say that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing not with one monolithic group of citizens 
affected.  We are dealing with eight denominational groups that 
are affected.  Each one of those groups has a claim to this 
fundamental right.  It would not be appropriate for a majority of 
people from different denominations to alienate the rights of a 
minority of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, it was generally accepted in the hearings of the 
joint committee that the Pentecostal people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador did not give their consent in the referendum and did not 
give it in the consultations, and that they voted in the majority 
in the referendum against the application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also considerable debate as to whether or not the 
considerably large catholic community of Newfoundland supported 
this amendment.  While there is some evidence that a majority of 
nominal catholics may have done so in the referendum, there is no 
way to measure whether a majority of practising catholics gave 
such assent.  One thing that is evident is that the institutional 
church, the Newfoundland Conference of Catholic Bishops, is 
clearly outspokenly opposed to this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also mention parenthetically that it was very 
unfortunate the joint committee chose not to hear representatives 
of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops and 
representatives of other organizations such as the Catholic Civil 
Rights League that would have spoken to the national implications 
of this amendment.  Why else do I question the assertion that the 
affected groups have given their assent to this amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the referendum was conducted in an atrocious manner.  By 
that I do not mean to say the people of Newfoundland did not know 
what they were voting on or were somehow voting in mass sequence. 
That is not my suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion is that the Government of Newfoundland was 
irresponsible in the manner in which it conducted this referendum 
and that it conducted it contrary to the basic principles of 
direct democracy reflected in referenda statutes throughout the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things it has been noted in the debate today that 
the question was released only 32 days before the referendum. The 
legal text was released two days before the advance polls opened 
and only a week before the vote itself occurred. I recall in 
debate on the Charlottetown accord during the referendum in 1992 
that Canadians from coast to coast expressed huge anger that they 
had not seen the legal text of that accord three or four weeks 
before the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, Newfoundlanders did not see it until a couple of 
days before they went to the polls.  And most importantly, when 
the legal text was released it reflected a substantive difference 
from the question that was put on the ballot and to 
Newfoundlanders four weeks before that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question stated:  Do you support a single school system 
where all children regardless of their religious affiliation 
attend the same schools where opportunities for religious 
education and observance are provided?  I am reading from an 
advertisement the government put out called “A Straightforward 
Referendum Question” and it seems straightforward enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the government released the legal text, section 2 of 
the proposed new term 17 made it clear that such courses in 
religion are not specific to a religious denomination, an 
essential qualifier, a caveat which was not reflected in the 
question. Section 3 of the legal text states that religious 
observances shall be permitted in the school requested by 
parents, presumably qualified as well as religious observances 
that are not specific to a particular denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Newfoundlanders who approached me and the committee said 
that the question they were asked implied that the protection of 
religious education meant the kind of religious education they 
conventionally understood to be religious, namely denominational 
education.  But the government pulled a fast one by saying that 
such education would not be denominational in character.  I and 
many people in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador believe 
that non-denominational religious education really is not 
religious education and therefore the question was misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also object to the government's direct intervention in the 
referendum.  The government used the apparatus of the state and 
public tax dollars to support the yes side of the referendum. One 
principle which is consistent to direct democracy legislation 
around the world is that the state must remain neutral on these 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, that is to say the premier, his cabinet and his 
caucus, may take a particular position and can get on their 
soapbox, television or on talk shows and argue their position 
persuasively.  But to use tax dollars for the benefit of one side 
is to unfairly outweigh the outcome, and more importantly is to 
infringe on the basic principle of liberal democracy as best 
expressed by Thomas Jefferson in the preamble to the Virginia 
Statute on Religious Freedom which states that to compel a man to 
finance ideas which he abhors is both sinful and tyrannical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That principle was enshrined at the birth of liberal democracy, 
that the state must remain neutral when it comes to basic 
political and moral differences.  That was a principle not 
recognized by the Government of Newfoundland which spent $350,000 
tax dollars on one side of the referendum while the no advocates 
had no such access to public resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this as a very strong advocate of direct democracy and 
referenda, someone who is somewhat of an amateur student of 
direct democracy.  I find this offensive. If we blindly assume 
the legitimacy of this referendum, we are lowering the standard 
of what constitutes legitimate conduct in a referendum and it is 
not something I think we should do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those who have argued in favour of this amendment say 
that what it really tries to do is to enshrine pluralism, to 
reflect the important Canadian value of pluralism in the 
education system in Newfoundland.  They claim that among other 
things there are groups such Baptists and the Jewish community 
who have no access to denominational education under the original 
term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree it is a legitimate concern.  But the proper remedy to 
that problem is not to extinguish the rights for those who 
currently hold those rights.  It is to expand those rights.  A 
liberal democracy does not create equality by removing rights for 
some.  It creates greater equality by extending those rights to 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Newfoundland government ought to have done in this case 
in my view is to propose an amendment to the term which would 
have included a generic right to denominational education.  That 
would have satisfied the interests of equality but instead some 
people will end up paying the price by not having access to such 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who will pay the price the most are poor people.  I want 
to make this point.  The wealthy can afford to send their 
children to private schools but it is the most disadvantaged, and 
we know that Newfoundland is a disadvantaged province, where 
parents cannot afford the extra $2,000, $3,000 or $4,000 to send 
their children to a private school which is in keeping with their 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what about the courses in religion and religious observances 
provided for in the proposed new term?  My concern and that of 
many Newfoundlanders is that these courses in religion, these 
non-denominational generic courses will in fact be specific to a 
particular world view, a world view that might generally be 
called the secularist world view, a world view which sees no 
important ultimate distinctions in the truth claims of various 
religions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words the courses that are implied by this term will 
not be courses in religion as conventionally understood.  They 
could very well become courses in religious syncretism and 
indifferentism undergirded by a philosophy of moral relativism. 
That is to say philosophies which negate the possibility of 
objective ultimate truth on matters of life and death, on 
metaphysical matters, on matters of religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To tell a Catholic parent or a Pentecostal parent or some other 
parent who comes from a particular religious tradition that they 
will have access to religious education and that they should not 
worry is not adequate.  They are concerned that their moral views 
will be offended by their children by schools providing this—

comments, the hon. member for Elk Island. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
intrigued with the path the member is taking on this argument. 
It is one I think has been quite widely missed in the debate so 
far this day.  That is the intense belief system that people have 
and want to teach to their children. I wonder if he would enlarge 
more on that aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes I can enlarge on it. 
The point is that religious syncretism which is implied by the 
new non-denominational courses in religion under the proposed new 
term is contrary to the basic values that many families hold. The 
values they hold are to look at the world from a particular 
religious perspective rooted in tradition in many cases going 
back 2,000 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people to have to send their children to a school 
where they are going to be taught that there really is no 
difference between the religions, that all the truth claims of 
all the religions are irrelevant and illegitimate, that they can 
pick and choose between the moral values which will guide their 
lives is offensive.   That is why so many parents oppose this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one other point in reference to the hon. 
member's question. This is the point of pluralism. 
What we are doing with this amendment is to impose a monistic 
system of education, that is to say, a one world view system of 
education which is inimical to the pluralism which is 
supposedly a value that is so important to this country.

That is what is reflected in the current education system in 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is pluralism, not a monolithic cookie cutter 
stereotype system where all children are forced to have the same 
kind of educational experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A vote against term 17, the proposed new term, is a vote for 
pluralism and therefore I submit a vote for the ultimate Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member in his comments made reference to section 18 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw his attention to page 10 of the unanimous report of the 
joint committee where it clarifies that Professor Anne Bayefsky, 
the constitutional expert who gave evidence before the committee 
indicated that the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights does not say a state party to the treaty is required to 
provide public funding for denominational rights.  I think that 
is contrary to what I understood him to say in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the member made reference to a right is a right is a right. 
Is he implying then that the Constitution can only be amended in 
the case of unanimity and if so, what is the purpose of section 
43 of the Constitution Act, 1982 that provides for bilateral 
amendments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all with respect 
to Professor Bayefsky's position as quoted in the majority 
report, I disagree with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the other two covenants which I referenced, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that education shall 
be free and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights says that primary education shall be compulsory 
and available, free to all.  In the proper context, it is 
understood that the right to education is a right that is 
exercisable by all parents, including poor parents which means 
through the assistance of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second question, no, I do not believe that 
unanimity is required to make an amendment to the Constitution. I 
indicated during my remarks that the threshold I thought was 
necessary to remove rights given to a particular group was that 
that group clearly and expressly support such removal of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not clear by this blanket referendum process which was 
conducted in Newfoundland. We cannot discern from the results 
whether or not and which groups gave their assent.  We are saying 
that generally a social majority can alienate the rights of a 
social minority. That is a troubling precedent which all members 
of this place should be concerned about not only for the 
educational rights in their provinces, but the other rights 
afforded by the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that Professor Bayefsky and other 
constitutional authorities who appeared before the committee 
argued persuasively that this amendment would subject the new 
term 17 to the application of the charter of rights and freedoms 
and therefore any religious observances or courses which took on 
anything close to denominational character would be imperilled by 
the jurisprudence with respect to religious education in both the 
Zylberberg and civil liberties cases out of Ontario.  Essentially 
these are cases which say that we cannot have publicly funded 
denominational education under the charter because of its 
equality rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the hon. member raised the arguments of that esteemed 
constitutional scholar.  They are arguments which give further 
cause for concern in terms of denominational education.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Reform has proposed three tests.  There has been much discussion 
over the course of this day in regard to them.  I note that 
members on the opposite side of the House and the other parties 
adjacent to us have either inferred or explicitly referred to 
them.  I use them as a bit of a guide for my remarks this 
evening. I also suggest, as I first make remarks on the 
democratic consent, that with this first criteria I differ with 
some of my colleagues.  It does not trump the other two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on remarks of democratic consent.  On September 2, 1997 
it appears the Brian Tobin Liberal government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador took a very knee jerk, malicious approach.  It was a 
very spiteful response to the provincial government ruling that 
it was not appropriately implementing term 17.  As well, we have 
learned from the Quebec situation that a referendum may be 
democratic in theory, but demagogic in reality when the form of 
the question is abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here was a government that was slapped on the wrist, then like a 
spoiled boy decided it did not want to play.  It wanted to walk 
away instead of working it out.  It sprung this referendum on 
July 31, 1997.  The Newfoundland government could have amended 
the legislation to provide a more workable process for 
implementing term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court decision handed down brought into effect the second 
referendum call at the end of the month. There was no debate in 
the house of assembly prior to this announcement, no hearings on 
the proposed amendment.  I would suggest that that would have 
been helpful in getting the issues out, getting them into the 
public debate arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tobin government only unveiled, and it has been mentioned 
often, the proposed new term 17 two days before the advance poll 
and one week before the vote.  As other colleagues have referred, 
it was substantially different from the form of the question 
which was put on term 17 on the polling day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not of the view that the technical and legal language needs 
to be on the ballot.  I am of the belief that the technical and 
legal language needs to concur with the form of the question. 
This is not the case.  This is bordering on fraudulent.  It is 
deceptive.  It is trickery.  It leaves open to question whether 
there was an informed consent of the electorate in general and 
the affected minorities in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quickly note, as others have, that the government used 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to promote the yes side and 
granted not a penny to the no side.  I have looked at some of the 
government advertising.  Who is not for children and opportunity 
and advancement and all of these wonderful things?  That is the 
nature of the government paid advertising, its issues of 
motherhood and apple pie, but no dollars granted to the no side. 
Also being referred to is the fact that there were no 
scrutineers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief, as commented by others, that if we are taking 
this thing of referendum seriously, as the Reform Party does and 
we are out in the forefront on this one, then we need to be 
putting a fair question.  We need proper electoral safeguards, 
scrutineers, et cetera, and equal funding for both the yes and no 
sides or no funding at all.  It is an old saying that justice 
must not only be done, but it must also be seen to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it has not yet been demonstrated that the revised term 
17 meets the test of the rule of law.  The rule of law requires 
that the Newfoundland government demonstrate that its proposed 
reforms do not prejudicially affect the previously granted rights 
of those who desire a religious orientation in the education of 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland government could have addressed this.  It had 
every opportunity by obtaining a ruling, a reference from the 
Supreme Court of Canada clearly establishing that its proposed 
amendment does not prejudicially affect previous rights granted. 
Why get into this?  The government had this opportunity.  It is 
not an issue of whether these rights are discriminatory or not. 
The fact is these rights were granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk from an historical precedent point of view how 
there could no longer or necessarily be discrimination in regard 
to these matters.  The first education act in Newfoundland was 
passed in 1836 and granted public funding to the Newfoundland 
School Society, Roman Catholics and nine school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was amended in 1874 to permit proportional funding to all 
religious groups which at that time included Roman Catholics, 
Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists.  In 
1892 and 1913 respectively other groups were brought in.  Then 
the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada were granted full 
partnership in funding in 1954 and added into the constitution in 
1987.

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that there is no doubt an increasing number of 
families in the province who would not be members of traditional 
Roman Catholic or protestant faith groups but the right of such 
parents to educate their children according to their own faith 
and convictions ought to be upheld, as should be the right of 
Roman Catholic and protestant parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing that precludes there being more groups brought 
in.  The solution proposed by this term 17 will not accommodate 
greater diversity but rather imposes an approach which 
marginalizes religion and excludes it from the general 
curriculum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be expanding, as my hon. colleague said just moments 
ago, the educational rights instead of extinguishing rights.  If 
there are disenfranchised groups that wish to be accommodated, 
that can be accomplished without eroding the constitutional 
protection which other minority religious groups enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also ways of addressing current inefficiencies in the 
educational system which would not require a constitutional 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By press release dated April 24, 1996, the minister of education 
and training announced that a framework agreement had been 
negotiated between the province and denominations. That agreement 
indicates that the government's concerns can be addressed without 
the constitutional amendment requested.  In fact, the churches 
had co-operated with educational reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Tobin made the comment that they were trying to 
frustrate the process of education reform.  Not so, Premier 
Tobin.  In fact, these churches had willingly embraced reform. 
They had entered into dozens of joint school arrangements.  They 
had closed and consolidated other schools, 30-some for the Roman 
Catholics and 7 Pentecostal in the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They co-operated with the government in a reduction of school 
boards from the original 267 to the present 10.  They 
participated in the government operated provincial school 
construction board which controls all school construction except 
that school bus reform is necessary.  On and on we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They in fact endorsed 90% of the commission's recommendations 
and urged the government to get on with implementing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the Pentecostals and Roman Catholics will be 
negatively affected, detrimentally affected by the new religion 
program in term 17 before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This offer of a religion program developed by the Department of 
Education is a cruel joke.  It will be a neutered, generic, 
no-name brand sociology religion class.  At its worst, it will be 
hostile to theistic religions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Newfoundland government has displayed such disdain 
for religious education that there is no reason to hope that it 
will suddenly become conscientious for the rights of parents in 
matters of religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial Department of Education writing the content for 
the religion course is like putting the fox in charge of the 
chicken coop.  It is a cruel joke.  I am of the view that this 
amendment is not in the best interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Brian Peckford in the <I>Hansard</I> record of April 10, 
1987 speaks warmly and extols the Pentecostal Assemblies of 
Newfoundland, the way they operated their schools, their 
uniqueness in terms of their putting forth values, instilling 
manners and courtesy and respect for others and family values and 
so on.  He in fact warns them not to let go of that, not to let 
that be deluded over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Brian Peckford mentions the fact of that danger and 
makes very clear that they should be regarded as a shining light 
for others to adopt and to ensure that that was also part of 
their overall educational system and philosophy.  In righting the 
wrong, he says of the past that he has great pleasure in 
recommending the inclusion of the Pentecostal Assemblies of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, who should run the schools?  Who should decide 
on the nature of a child's schooling?  I do not recognize the 
province's exclusive authority to decide the education of my 
child for Newfoundland or any other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is parents who have the primary responsibility for the 
education of their children.  It is therefore a right to be able 
to choose a type of education that they desire for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More to the point, they should be entitled to take the funds to 
pay for that child's education with them, whether directly as in 
a voucher system or indirectly by funding schools based on the 
number of pupils they enroll, a system known as capitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That approach is finding favour around the world, not only in 
free market Britain or New Zealand as expected, but also in 
socialist countries Sweden and Denmark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public would be better served by acknowledging 
parental choice of a school where their children can be educated 
in keeping with their world view and values for the good of 
Canadian society. 
The Newfoundland referendum is suspect all around.  Rather than 
extinguishing minority rights in this respect, I believe we 
should be enhancing them and expanding them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After serious and careful deliberation, much consultation and 
conservation with others, I stand opposed to term 17 as it is 
before us today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today after hearing compelling arguments put forward by 
members on both sides of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having listened to my colleagues it is a very difficult 
situation for me to make a decision on.  I have thought and 
thought about it.  Especially being a minority myself, this is a 
very important question for me.  Are we trampling on minority 
rights?  There is always the possibility that a majority can 
trample minority rights, and being a minority this is a very 
important issue for me.  I have looked at the issue very 
seriously.  I sat in the House and heard all members talking 
about the pros and cons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do I stand on the matter?  After listening to everybody 
and looking at what we have stated as our policy, I have learned 
over several years that amending the constitution is never an 
easy undertaking.  Nor should it be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution contains the principles and underpinning upon 
which we govern and are governed.  Its influence on the daily 
activities of Canadians is all encompassing.  Therefore our 
constitution must reflect the will of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some who have not followed the issue closely may wonder what 
exactly is happening with this amendment.  Basically by amending 
term 17, the Newfoundland and Labrador school system would change 
its common denominational nature within the province, allowing 
the province to move to a single, publicly funded school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that even with these changes this amendment 
would not take religion out of the schools.  Term 17 contains a 
provision which guarantees that religion must be taught and that 
religious observance must be permitted in schools where requested 
by parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues feel this is not exactly guaranteeing minority 
rights that were guaranteed at the time Newfoundland joined 
Confederation.  I agree that is true, but does it really take 
away a minority right?  That is the question I was wondering 
about.  I personally feel that it does not take away a minority 
right.  It is there.  It may not be in the same manner as it was 
before but it is there.  Therefore I feel that the basic 
principle of a minority right being taken away is not a major 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, children would not be forced to participate 
in such activities if the parents or themselves did not wish 
that.  These issues are very emotional ones which go to the basic 
values of individuals.  Each time this has been debated in this 
place we have heard very eloquent and heartfelt arguments on both 
sides as to why or why not we as parliamentarians should support 
or oppose this resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new parliamentarian I have heard from several concerned 
individuals on both sides of the issue.  This is a decision that 
one cannot enter into lightly.  I have spent a great deal of time 
thinking about it.  After thinking very hard on the issue I have 
come to the conclusion that I am in favour of this resolution.  I 
feel that it follows the democratic will of the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have stated that the question put forward was not 
clear and was changed and that the referendum did not meet the 
criteria of a real referendum.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that this debate has gone on in Newfoundland and 
it is the people of Newfoundland who are ultimately responsible 
for making this decision.  In the second referendum over 73% of 
the people agreed on this issue.  I can share some of the 
concerns my colleagues have expressed and I would agree with 
their sentiment.  However, they have gone through two referendums 
in Newfoundland and in the second referendum the percentage 
increased.  Therefore I am quite satisfied this was a legitimate 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first and foremost principles of our party is the 
equality of provinces and respect for provincial jurisdiction. We 
support each and every province's having equality of status and 
equal powers and Parliament and the Government of Canada's 
treating all the provinces equally. Term 17 deals with the 
provincial power over education and the amendment allows the 
house of assembly to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague who said education should be the 
responsibility of parents.  The primary responsibility of 
education must fall on parents.  The parents who live in 
Newfoundland have made a decision through the referendum that 
this is the way they want to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another principle deals with respect for the equality of all 
citizens.  We are in favour of citizens having equal rights under 
the law.  Under the current system with term 17 there are not 
equal rights for all citizens. What is at issue here is whether 
the existing rights have to be swept away or whether they could 
be accommodated in some other manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another guiding principle refers to the basic right of freedoms 
of conscience and religion.  At issue here is whether the right 
to denominational schools is an element of this freedom or not. 
Under the new amended term 17 education in religion is not 
specific to any denomination but what is guaranteed is the right 
to religious observance for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last two principles deal with the will of the majority while 
at the same time respecting the rights of minorities.  At issue 
here is whether the procedures of the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador were fair and whether the rights and interests of 
minorities were safeguarded, as I alluded to in the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been arguments on both sides that have dealt with the 
fairness of the procedures used by the government in obtaining 
its mandate to reform the school system.  On one side it has been 
argued that the government did not give the citizens enough time 
to make an informed decision, that it was a short campaign during 
the summer months and that the text of the referendum question 
was released only a week prior to the referendum date.  The 
government actively campaigned for the amendment, as my colleague 
mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side,  this was the second referendum in a two year 
period, which supported the changes to the educational system in 
the province.  The second referendum received a substantially 
higher percentage of support than the first one.  As I mentioned 
earlier, the referendum question was supported basically in every 
part of the province and gained the unanimous support of the 
house of assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes down to whether the importance we attach to 
democratic consent and respecting the will of the majority 
outweighs our concern about the impact of this amendment on 
denominational rights in Newfoundland, I think it does.  That is 
why I will be supporting this resolution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my hon. colleague. It is in the nature of 
going back in a time capsule, one might say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this matter of a referendum, important as it is to each one 
of us, are there not some limitations?  Are there not some bottom 
lines?  We can go back in time to our neighbours to the south 
during the time when there was slavery in their country. Had 
there been a vote at the time about whether to allow the slaves 
rights or to keep them in that subjugated, suppressed state, and 
if the vote had left them without rights and kept them 
subjugated, would the member have been in agreement with that 
kind of referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a preface I would say that I stand opposed to that.  It does 
not matter that there may have been a democratic “referenda” 
issue there, I would stand opposed. There are bottom lines. I am 
personally interested in how the member would have voted on such 
an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, is this extended to all areas or are there some bottom 
lines with respect to this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>   Mr. Speaker, there are some good 
analogies there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the question, in the case of slavery, that referendum 
was taking away the basic human rights of someone, treating 
someone as inferior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are talking about a change in the system, not 
about taking away the rights of somebody.  We are talking about 
changes.  That is the way I view it.  I do not view it as 
somebody's basic human rights in the province being attacked. All 
it is doing is changing the basic system which the people of 
Newfoundland people think would be far more effective for them 
and at the same time is giving them religious rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not taking away religious rights or the right to send my 
child to a religious school.  I can keep my child at home and 
teach him religion.  So there are two basic, strong fundamental 
factors here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that in this referendum I do not view that a 
right has been snatched away from someone in Newfoundland.  I 
feel that the referendum has asked them if they want a change in 
the system.  That is the way I view it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member knows of my concerns and the concerns of others about 
minority rights.  We heard earlier that the francophones had set 
up, with full rights, a school system managed by the 
francophones, non-denominational.  But in accordance with term 17 
in and for the province of Newfoundland, the legislature shall 
have exclusive authority to make laws in relation to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member possibly comment on whether he thinks these 
rights could be affected by the slippery slope of the general, 
gradual reduction of rights.  Would that have any effect on the 
francophone school board?  Clearly that school— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will give the 
hon. member for Calgary East a minute to respond to that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I do not think so.  I 
still say that this is a change, not taking rights away.  I still 
feel that parents in Newfoundland have the basic right to educate 
their children in the manner they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that in Calgary those who do not agree with that are 
teaching their children at home. Basically I am looking at this 
through the referendum and the desire of parents of Newfoundland 
who are asking for a change to be made to better administer the 
system. 
As a person who belongs to a minority I would be the first to 
raise the flag if I felt a minority right was disappearing.  I do 
not feel a minority right is disappearing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take part in this debate.  It has been a long day. 
There has been much lively debate since the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs opened the debate at noon hour.  I 
think it has been a very interesting and honest debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on all sides of the House have taken part and have 
expressed their views and opinions.  That is the way it should be 
when we are considering a matter as serious as constitutional 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at a number of issues in making our decision. 
The first has been raised by many members speaking on the issue 
today, that is to answer the question of whether the process was 
fair.  I am referring to the process whereby the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador proposed the resolution that it passed 
unanimously on a free vote in the legislature of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  We need to review that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my pleasure to be a member of the special joint committee 
that studied this matter.  I would like to make reference to one 
of the witnesses who appeared before the committee, Mr. David 
Schneiderman, executive director of the Centre for Constitutional 
Studies at the University of Alberta.  Professor Schneiderman 
indicated to the committee that certain fundamental questions 
must be asked in determining whether the process was a fair one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked: “Was there an opportunity for debate and deliberation 
among the general public?”  The committee had no difficulty 
coming to the conclusion that there had been because testimony 
before it revealed that this debate had been going on for quite 
some time in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further he asked:  “Could the same result have been achieved 
through non-constitutional means?”  We are dealing with a 
request to amend the constitution, which has the effect of 
extinguishing denominational rights.  Whether we are for or 
against it, it needs to be accomplished by constitutional means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next question was: “Was the subject matter of the amendment 
the subject of an election or referendum?”  We know there have 
been two referenda with respect to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last question was:  “Were the communities of interest most 
directly affected consulted and given an opportunity for 
meaningful participation?”  On that point the committee came to 
the conclusion that all parties on all sides of the issue over a 
period of years and leading up to the final referendum of this 
year certainly had those opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the committee had very little difficulty in 
coming to its conclusion.  Members of the government and two of 
the four opposition parties came to the conclusion that the 
process was fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate and also by persons and groups that appeared 
before the committee, it was further indicated that the process 
was tainted in that the government participated in the 
referendum.  I submit that is only reasonable.  The legislation 
of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador was at stake. 
There is a duty on a government proposing legislation to support 
it.  I do not see how that allegation could cause any concern as 
to the fairness and reasonableness of the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in debate the member for St. John's East indicated his 
concern that the charter would apply to the new amended term 17 
and consequently the provisions of 17(2) and 17(3) which provide 
for courses in religion and religious observances at the request 
of the parents would be struck down.  The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs in his submission earlier today gave 
the opinion that clearly term 17 as amended would enjoy the 
protection from the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the member for St. John's East I would also 
make reference to one of the expert and legal opinions that the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador obtained answering the 
question could a provision of the charter or another part of the 
Constitution invalidate the rights set out in term 17.   The 
answer was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has stated that one constitutional 
provision cannot be used to invalidate a provision in another 
part of the Constitution. Term 17 is part of the Constitution of 
Canada. In provinces where the courts have ruled that religious 
observances such as the Lord's Prayer cannot be held in the 
public school, there is no constitutional protection comparable 
to that in term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That opinion was provided to the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador not by a Liberal or someone that could be questioned, 
but rather by a former cabinet minister, the Hon. John Crosbie. 
Therefore, I think the member for St. John's East would give that 
legal opinion some recognition. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's debate, we are hearing a lot about minority rights, 
namely whether the amendments to term 17 are really a matter of 
minority rights.  We must remember that the situation in 
Newfoundland and Labrador is not the same as in the other 
provinces.  First, Newfoundland and Labrador never had a public 
school system.  It is very difficult to determine who makes up the 
minorities and the majority.  For there to be a minority, there has 
to be a majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult in Newfoundland and Labrador where, 
before the latest amendments to term 17, some 96 per cent of the 
population enjoyed denominational rights.  Some of these 
denominations were included in a school system, but only about 4 
per cent of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador did not have 
denominational rights.  It is a bit difficult to say today that in 
the effort to amend term 17 the rights of minorities are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, regarding the results of the referendum, it is 
very difficult to know how the various groups voted. 
There was no way to find out.  In fact, when Minister Grimes, the 
Newfoundland and Labrador minister of education, appeared before 
the committee, he indicated that, in the first referendum in 1995, 
the premier at the time, Clyde Wells, wrote to all denominational 
groups, to all the leaders of religious groups, including the 
Catholics and the Pentacostals, to ask them if they agreed with a 
proposal to have every voter indicate their religion upon arriving 
at the polling station so that the voting pattern of each religious 
group could be known.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Grimes told us that Premier Wells never did get a 
response.  When Premier Tobin proposed the second referendum, there 
was no question of it because it had already been determined that 
the leaders of the churches were not interested in finding out how 
their members were going to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it can be seen that the Catholics, at 37%, are the 
most numerous of all the denominational groups.  It is still hard 
to grasp how that group can be described as a minority, when it 
represents 37% of the population. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Catholics, it is fairly evident in my opinion 
with the Catholics representing 37% of the population, if they 
had turned out and voted en masse to protect their denominational 
rights, they may not have won the referendum but certainly the 
result would not have been 73%. The Pentecostal community 
represents 7% of the population.  It is more difficult to 
determine what the turnout was there.  In fact we had much 
speculation about it at the committee but there is no way of 
determining for certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appendix 1 to the committee's report is the results of the 
Newfoundland referendum of September 1997.  It is broken down by 
percentage of the population who voted, the percentage of people 
who voted yes, the percentage of people who voted no, the 
percentage of the Roman Catholic population and the Pentecostal 
population for each of the various polling stations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at it quickly, one can see that in the areas where the 
Pentecostal population is the highest represented, for instance 
Baie Verte where the population is 25%, the one that strikes me 
the most, is the voter turnout was 45.2% which is below the 
average.  In a polling station where the Pentacostals were fairly 
well represented the turnout of the vote was not any higher.  In 
fact the percentage of the vote for yes was 57.9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly in Exploits, there was 26% Pentecostal population, 53% 
turnout which was about on the average, but again 63% voted yes. 
The riding of Lewisporte, 34% Pentecostal population, 57% a 
little over the average turnout and 59% of the voters voted yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the ridings where the Pentacostals were more highly 
represented than in other ridings, one can see that there is 
still fairly strong support for the resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to subscribe to the argument that what we 
are dealing with is a minority rights issue, that the rights of 
the minority are not being respected.  I do not consider it a 
minority rights issue.  I consider it a question of 
denominational rights which had been entrenched in the 
Constitution. 
Yes, one should not go about the business of amending the 
Constitution without giving it serious consideration, but I do 
not see in this case that it is a question where minority rights 
are being disregarded and the will of the majority is being 
imposed over them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed this is a very tough decision.  It is a very tough issue. 
Certainly the members of the committee, including those who 
supported the majority report to make a recommendation to the 
House and to the Senate that the requested resolution be passed, 
had a great deal of empathy and sympathy for those people who 
came before the committee and indicated that they did not wish to 
see these denominational rights extinguished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed by the evidence that we heard at the committee 
by the Newfoundland Human Rights Association and the Canadian 
Civil Liberties Association.  These two groups exist to defend 
minority rights, to defend minorities. Both of these groups were 
strong advocates in supporting the resolution. I do not see where 
it can really be seen to be an abuse of minority rights when the 
very associations that are there to protect minority rights are 
indeed supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were quite candid in giving their testimony before the 
committee.  They said that they were in a very unusual position 
for them.  They usually oppose government legislation or 
government resolutions, they rarely ever defend them.  But in 
this case, they took that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed earlier this afternoon when the Leader of the 
Official Opposition made his intervention on this issue.  He 
expressed those same concerns of sympathy and empathy for the 
people and the groups whose rights would be extinguished by this. 
There is no doubt that everyone understood that.  If anyone heard 
or read Premier Tobin's speech on the night that he announced the 
referendum, it was very clear and everyone knew that 
denominational rights were being extinguished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that, the Leader of the Official Opposition has 
taken the position that in this case because freedom of religion 
will still exist, because of the respect for the will of the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador he personally is taking the 
position of supporting this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a very difficult process that many of us have had 
to go through but sometimes in your gut you just know the right 
thing to do.  I think those of us who are prepared to support 
this resolution have come to that position through that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to deal with was the question of 
precedent.  The concern is that by the Parliament of Canada, the 
House of Commons and the Senate supporting this resolution and in 
effect extinguishing denominational rights, we are setting a 
precedent that would apply to other provinces should they make 
similar requests. This is something the government has been very 
clear on, that any further requests for constitutional amendments 
will be looked at on their own merits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit there is no other province that has an education 
system similar in any way to that of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
It is a totally different situation and there is no point in 
getting into the niceties between legal and political precedents. 
I do not see where there would be anything that anyone could 
bring forward to argue that because this constitutional amendment 
is being granted for Newfoundland and Labrador the Parliament of 
Canada is bound in any way to grant a similar amendment for 
dealing with educational rights, denominational rights in other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, I encourage all members to support the 
resolution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to expand on the statement of the hon. member.  He was 
talking about clarification he could not find or that the 
committee could not find the clarification for how the 
Pentecostals voted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the sheet that the hon. member was referring to, which was 
produced by Mark Graesser from the Department of Political 
Sciences Memorial University of Newfoundland, it is very clear. 
If we extend over to the third column, it indicates very clearly 
that in Baie Verte, Exploits, Lewisporte and Windsor-Springdale, 
the areas mentioned, the Pentecostal votes in those communities 
were respectively 32%, 32%, 32% and 30% voting in the “yes” 
column. I think it is of import to point out that the 
Pentecostals in those communities voted substantially against 
this resolution and that their “yes” vote was in the 
neighbourhood of 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, throughout the province the “yes” vote 
was calculated to be only 32%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did indicate in my 
comments that indeed there was much speculation.  In fact, there 
was a witness who came and presented the report that the member 
refers to.  Again, that is not proof positive, and that is the 
point that I was making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an extrapolation from the official figures that were 
reported in the referendum and it is taken by riding-riding. This 
individual's credentials I do not quarrel with, but again it is 
an extrapolation, it is an estimate, it is not proof positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my point, that no one can say for certain, with 100% 
certainty if the original proposal that Premier Clyde Wells at 
the time had put forward in identifying the ballots:  a 
Pentecostal voter gets a green ballot, a Roman Catholic voter 
gets a red ballot—if that system had been used, if that system 
had been acceptable to the leaders of the various denominations, 
then we would have more certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point still remains that even if the Pentecostal community 
did not vote for it, it is not a question of a minority right, in 
my estimation, because they would be the only ones with the 
denominational rights left.  The same report indicated I think 
that the Roman Catholics had voted 61% or something in favour, 
again an extrapolation.  There is no certainty, but the same 
method was used to determine it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we know for certain that the Pentecostals did not 
support it, I think this amendment should still go forward, the 
whole scheme.  I do not think they are a minority in the 
traditional minority/majority right, but the whole scheme of 
denominational schools in Newfoundland and Labrador would no 
longer be applicable with only one of the original seven 
denominations still having rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my point of bringing 
this up was to indicate that if the figures were being used for 
the first part to establish the 59% of votes from those various 
communities suggesting that they voted too, therefore we should 
also utilize a third column of figures that definitely indicates 
that only 30% of Pentecostals voted in favour of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if the first two columns are okay, the third 
column must be okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
is confused as to what I was referring to.  I am referring to 
appendix 1 which is in the report, which is from the Newfoundland 
Referendum September 1997.  It is the official results.  He is 
referring to Mr. Graesser's report, which is a separate document. 
We are not referring to the same document.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Education has to be one of the most important things to parents 
and to families.  There is no doubt that the education that 
children receive from the time they are very young until they are 
really old and graduate from university that every day at school 
there is an influence on their lives, not only academically but 
also in terms of their growth as citizens and their growth as 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember—and this will date me—about 30 years ago or a 
little less, the debate hot in the schools at that time was 
whether sex education ought to be in the schools.  I taught 
mathematics at the college level while some of my colleagues 
taught physics.  One of my colleagues, in addressing that 
question, said “Well, of course, sex should be taught in the 
schools.  If the schools do as good a job of teaching that as 
they do of teaching math and physics then the children will lose 
all interest in it”.  I do not think that is probably true, but 
that was his statement at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me into the part that I want to talk about in this 
debate, and that is that there is so much more to education than 
simply the academics.  There are many studies that show this. 
All of us who have had children have observed it and anyone with 
common sense would agree that children behave not only in the way 
they are taught but also in the examples that are given to them. 
The values and beliefs that are held by the significant adults in 
their lives are going to be the values that the children adopt in 
their own lives.  That is very true and there are very few 
exceptions to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are some.  In my own case, I went through a few 
years at the latter end of my teens when I rejected the values of 
my parents.  I rejected their religious faith and ran away from 
home when I was 17.  I know members will not believe that but I 
really did.  Eventually I was reconciled not only to my parents 
but also to God and my life has been totally different since 
then.  This was a very important and integral part of my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly that for parents who want to have a 
Christian education or some other values-based education in their 
children's lives that they should have the right to do so.  I do 
not believe that it is the role of any government, be it federal, 
provincial or municipal, to take away from parents their rights 
and responsibilities to provide for the education and training of 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again emphasize that I believe that those are two things that 
work together but are not synonymous since training and education 
are two different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in this debate one of the questions which we must 
answer is to what degree is that right being taken away.  This is 
a real tug of war in this debate because on one hand we want to 
vote for it.  There are many strong, compelling arguments to vote 
for this amendment but there are also some very compelling 
arguments to vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons to vote for it is that this levels the 
playing field.  The fact of the matter is that in Newfoundland 
there were certain groups that had the right to run the schools 
and their children could go to those schools while other groups 
were excluded from it.  In a sense that is a reason to vote for 
this amendment.  It will provide them all with an opportunity to 
send their children to the school of their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the old days when Henry Ford started the Ford 
Motor Company.  I do not know if you remember, Mr. Speaker, but I 
remember when the Model Ts first came out the advertising was 
“You can have a Model T in any colour you want so long as the 
colour you want is black”.  This is exactly the same as the 
public school systems.  Everybody can go to the public school of 
their own free will because that is the only one that is going to 
be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is a right decision to make.  I speak not 
only to the province of Newfoundland, I also speak to the 
province of Alberta where this debate is currently going on in 
terms of funding of schools which are not part of the public 
school system, and to every province in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wish that we would truly recognize the rights of 
parents on all the different positions they hold on this issue to 
have the right to choose for their children the kind of training 
they want.  While I say that parents have this right and 
responsibility, and it is not to be taken lightly, I believe that 
the role of government is to provide the freedom for parents to 
make that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing to say.  Any parents who really feel strongly 
about this issue can start their own schools and run them as 
private schools with no other funding.  I have been in that 
position.  My wife and I chose to send two of our children to a 
private school.  At first that private school received no 
funding.  Now it receives about 20% to 25% of the funding that 
public schools in Alberta receive.  We made that sacrifice 
because to us it was very important, but we had to make a 
considerable financial sacrifice in order to provide that 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could argue that I did not have full exercise of freedom 
because there was a price for it.  For example, we might say that 
we have the freedom of movement across this country, but if one 
of the provinces were to put up a tollgate and charge everyone 
$1,000 to come into that province, then we could say that now the 
freedom is somewhat curtailed.  It is a little less freedom than 
before.  We still have the freedom to go there but we have to 
plunk down the bucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contend that people who make choices about their children's 
education should have a free choice.  I do not mind a certain 
amount of financial commitment having to be made for that.  It 
deepens the commitment if nothing else.  At the same time I 
believe the people who make those choices should not be cut out 
of the educational funding dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an argument that public funds should not be used to 
support private schools.  This Liberal government uses that 
terminology too yet it quite clearly uses public funds to support 
private business.  I cannot forget about Bombardier which is a 
private business.  The government gives piles of public funds to 
it.  I am saying that is really no different.  In the case of 
schools, the parents are taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use this analogy.  Let us visualize it as a big barrel. 
All of the taxpayers put their money into the barrel for the 
education of the children in this province.  Why should some 
parents be able to take the money out of the barrel to provide 
education for their children?  In our province of Alberta it 
happens to be people who choose the secular based education in 
the public school system in which God or any mention of religion 
is anathema, or they can choose another system if they are 
catholic.  They have the right and others do not.  To me that is 
curtailment of a freedom of choice which I think we should really 
value in this country.  I am saying the same thing for the 
province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have been delighted to vote for this measure if the 
provincial government of Newfoundland had instituted a plan like 
a voucher system in which there is public money from the 
taxpayers.  If there is a group of parents that can set up a 
school for their children based on their deep values then that 
public money or at least a large proportion of it should be 
available for that education system.  To me that would have 
solved the problem of whether their rights were prejudicially 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not believe we should be forcing people to go to a 
religious school if they are not so inclined, but at the same 
time we need to recognize that the secular school where there is 
no religion is also teaching a form of religion and the message 
to the students has to be confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that at home we deal with the reality of the existence 
of God?  Why is it that at home we are taught to integrate this 
belief into all areas of our life whereas in school it cannot be 
mentioned?  To me that is a contradiction and one which we should 
be correcting, and one which the Newfoundland government had an 
opportunity to correct. I wish it would have done it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the point has been made that the parents have the 
primary right and responsibility.  The government's 
responsibility should be to provide the opportunity for the 
parents to exercise that right without undue financial penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, I believe also that there is really no such thing as a 
values free education.  I am thinking of this training. The 
member for Broadview—Greenwood put it well.  He came from the 
Catholic tradition.  He pointed out in a way I can certainly 
relate to, and I put this so it is properly understood, there are 
some people whose religious belief and faith is more nominal. 
They have the label, they live good lives and there is no problem 
with it.  But there are others for whom it is a deeply held value 
and one which they are not content to take lightly.  They 
integrate it into their own lives and they want to do this also 
with their children. In saying that, I think we need to provide 
the ability for parents to do this without great financial 
penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some for whom this is not important.  I believe in our 
present society they are probably in the majority.  We have 
become secularized.  I was talking to a person the other day and 
we got on to this subject.  He is about my age and so we have all 
this wisdom.  We can look behind us and see the ripples and the 
waves from the boat that has just gone by.  We look back and we 
can see how it used to be calm waters and now it seems to be a 
little more stormy.  He said one of the big reasons for the 
increase in crime and for the increase in some of our societal 
values toward women and toward children which are so disturbing 
to us all is the secularization of our society.  We have 
basically in our society written out that impact which a deep 
religious faith has and did have for many years in the majority 
of Canadians. This is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the Government of Newfoundland taken what I urge all 
provinces to do, arrange their administration of school funding 
so that it would bypass that built-in bias, I would have total 
freedom to go through this because there is so much in this 
amendment that is plausible and positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because I am not convinced at all that the rights of 
these parents which were put into the constitution have been 
prejudicially affected, I believe that they are losing rights. 
Consequently I cannot support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In thinking about the courses they are going to have in these 
schools where they want them, courses about religion, I thought 
of an analogy.  I taught young people all my life, and this was 
my job when I taught at the college level.  Take one of these 
young people and say instead of ever getting married what we are 
going to do is teach you all about marriage.  We will have 
courses about marriage.  We will have courses about how men and 
women relate to each other, how they should get along and all 
these other things. But you will never be able to get together 
with another person and form a marriage bond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really in a way a course about religion is about at the same 
level.  It will talk about it but it does not give the children a 
clear example of what it means to be deeply committed to a faith 
in God or to a faith in whatever it is the particular group is 
promoting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I rest my case.  I urge all members in the House to 
think carefully about what choices they are making when they vote 
for this.  I believe that we should defeat this amendment and 
send it back to the people in Newfoundland, to the government in 
Newfoundland so they can fix this inequity. Then when they bring 
it back we would be pleased to support it if they showed that 
they did not prejudicially affect the parents who are quite 
clearly prejudicially affected by this amendment and by the 
changes the provincial government is proposing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for my hon. colleague with respect to the analogy 
he fleshed out for us.  In Newfoundland and elsewhere parents do 
have the right to send their children to another school, as he so 
rightly said.  I have found that low income people are not able 
to do that.  They simply do not have the means to pay the taxes 
and send their children to a private school. What has been the 
member's experience with respect to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the 
question of my colleague about the financial penalty, the people 
who do not have the financial ability.  We made some sacrifices 
in our family which meant almost no vacations.  It meant driving 
old cars.  In fact, I still have my 1959 Meteor.  I do not drive 
it anymore. But it meant keeping a car four times as long. I am 
still driving my 1982 Chevy Suburban. We made those sacrifices 
because the money had to go to tuition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on the board of the school I attended and we made the 
decision that in order to make it easier for children to attend 
our school, we would try to reduce the financial barriers.  We 
set up a tuition plan so that for a family with more children the 
tuition rates were steeply reduced.  As a matter of fact, if 
there happened to be a family with more than four children, after 
the fourth child's tuition was paid the rest were free. They were 
allowed into the so-called family plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly that should not be necessary.  It is a great hardship 
for these private schools to endure the costs when there is a 
very uneven playing field.  That was our solution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
since the hour is growing late I will try to keep my comments 
rather short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of points my colleague from Elk Island raised I would 
echo as well.  Being a former teacher, education is very 
important and being the father of four children, education is 
very important.  In fact, my wife and I have made the decision to 
home school our children in order to impart the values we feel 
are important.  Notwithstanding that others choose other options, 
which is totally within the rights of an individual, we have made 
the decision for ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must turn to the point of minority rights in the debate which 
was raised by a number of my colleagues. This amendment would 
extinguish, in my mind beyond a shadow of a doubt, rights 
currently granted to individuals in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, referendums have been held and democratic consent has been 
given, yet we must consider the minorities in this case, the 
people whose rights would be extinguished by this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned, the idea of including religious 
courses as an option to replace these denominational schools 
simply does not have the same impact as having a denominational 
or a complete religious orientation at a school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to a private Christian college at great expense.  I had 
to work hard during the summers to go there.  However, what I 
learned there was a way of looking at the world, a world view, 
not simply religion second hand but trying to integrate that into 
every walk of my own life.  I know how much of an impact that had 
on me.  I see this also as being important that the children of 
Newfoundland have that opportunity under the existing system. 
This amendment would alter that opportunity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the notion of schools of choice was mentioned and that 
providing funding to the institutions where the children go would 
be a good solution to this problem.  That is a provincial 
responsibility.  It might be a solution to look at in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the moneys that would go with a child to the school 
of choice would help to increase the accountability factor of 
that school.  It would also give the parents the right and 
opportunity to send their child to the school of their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened with great interest to the tone of the debate 
throughout the day.  I have noticed that there are members who 
are for and against this amendment from the government benches as 
well as the opposition benches.  It has been a good debate. 
Members have had the opportunity to express their views in a 
non-partisan nature.  I have appreciate the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my remarks by stating again that I believe this 
would extinguish the rights currently held by individuals in 
Newfoundland and Labrador and that is why I cannot support the 
amendment and will be voting against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make one brief point.  The hon. member indicated in his speech 
that he attended a Christian college and he wished this option 
would be available for the people of Newfoundland.  It will be. 
There is nothing in this amendment which will prevent private 
Christian or private schools of any sort.  I just wanted to bring 
that to the member's attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
pointing that out.  I guess I did not make myself very clear on 
that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point was much larger.  It was that the opportunity which I 
had shaped my world view, the way that I interact with 
individuals and the frame through which I see life in general.  I 
am basically saying that there would be a difference in the 
religion courses offered in Newfoundland versus a holistic or 
religious perspective which would incorporate all aspects of a 
child's education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to this extraordinarily important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are often cautioned when we are growing up never to mix 
religion and politics, and that is precisely what we are doing in 
this debate.  Having said that, I am going to plunge head long 
into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue, of course, is the extinguishment of the right to 
education in denominational schools in Newfoundland, 
denominational schools which until this point have received 
public funding.  I stand four-square against what the Government 
of Newfoundland is proposing and what many hon. members of the 
House are prepared to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House why I oppose term 17.  I propose it 
primarily because I believe it really does shrink the ambit of 
personal freedom in this country.  On so many occasions we see 
our freedoms being eroded, taken away from us.  I can point to 
any number of examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the charter itself.  In 1982, when the charter 
came in, we saw all kinds of new things added to the charter of 
rights and freedoms which a lot of Canadians would probably 
disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 22 affirmative action is proposed.  That is something 
I disagree with.  It limits our freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see an erosion of our economic freedom when the government 
claws away more money all the time.  That means we have fewer 
options.  In fact, we have fewer options to send our children to 
the schools we wish to send them to, including private schools 
and religious schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are seeing the extinguishment of really what 
amounts to a very ancient right, a right which the Government of 
Newfoundland secured for its people in 1949 when it entered 
Confederation.  It was an issue that was extraordinarily 
important to the people of Newfoundland when they entered 
Confederation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways the people and the Government of Newfoundland at 
the time were much more forward thinking than the rest of the 
country.  They had essentially secured the ability of people to 
send their children to the school that best reflected their 
beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinarily important whether somebody has a secular 
world view or whether, and probably especially, somebody has 
strong religious convictions.  The ability to steep their 
children in the faith of their fathers and grandfathers, their 
forefathers, is extraordinarily important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people with strong convictions that is essentially being 
wiped out by what is being proposed.  People will have the right 
in law if they can find the money, even though as I pointed out 
before the government has taxed so much of it away.  They still 
had the right but it makes it extraordinarily difficult for 
people to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should declare my bias.  I have two children in a separate 
school, a catholic school in Alberta.  I am pleased that I have 
the ability to do that.  It means a lot to me.  The ability to 
teach children not only at home but through a chosen school 
system the values of right and wrong, the old fashioned idea of 
virtues, is very important.  My friend from Elk Island did an 
admirable job of pointing how important that is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago I read an article by Richard John Neuhaus, a 
theologian who pointed out that one of the quickest ways to 
essentially kill religion in a country was not necessarily to 
deprive the fundamental freedoms but actually to find ways to 
kill the institutions.  The way to kill the institutions is to 
deprive them of the things they traditionally have done, the very 
practical things that they do every day, things like providing 
education for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that right is essentially taken away it goes a long way 
toward killing those religions.  Frankly that is what has 
happened to a large degree over the last probably 40 or 50 years 
as governments got bigger and crowded religious institutions out 
of some of the things they did in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen those institutions become sort of less valuable in 
a practical sense to their communities.  We have seen them shrink 
as a result.  That concerns me greatly.  That is exactly what is 
happening in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the idea that my friend offered and that others have 
suggested.  It is time to start to empower people at the local 
level to allow them to choose the education system that reflects 
their values, their world views.  We now have a system that will 
effectively represent one world view, that is the secular world 
view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine.  We do not have a problem with people choosing to 
put their children in that situation.  It is absolutely up to 
them as far as I am concerned, but I believe we should all have 
the right to send our children to a school that reflects that 
world view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe like my friend that it is time to examine the whole 
idea of vouchers.  The province of Alberta has gone to a 
chartered school system which goes some distance toward that 
goal, if not quite all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a necessary revolution in education when we already had 
an orderly evolution occurring.  We already had the Pentecostal 
schools and the Catholic schools agreeing to some reforms. That 
was starting to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments at the time had gone through this twice.  This 
is the second time we went into a referendum with the government 
asking for a constitutional amendment to fix the problem. Instead 
of co-operation, partnership and working with the schools, the 
Government of Newfoundland acted with a sledgehammer when it 
really was not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members have pointed out when we start to change a 
constitution it is an extraordinarily serious business. 
It could have ramifications far beyond the ones being suggested 
for Newfoundland.  It could have ramifications for other 
minorities.  People have pointed this out.  It is an 
extraordinarily important point to make again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing we want to do in a country like Canada is to use 
a democratic tool to effectively wipe out a minority right.  That 
is really what we are doing in Canada today.  It raises the point 
whether or not we can use what is traditionally a democratic 
tool, a referendum, to determine something like a minority right. 
It may be democratic, but a more important question is whether it 
is just.  I am not convinced it is just in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this whole idea is necessary?  Is it necessary to have a 
constitutional amendment?  For 1,000 years the church has 
preserved education.  Where do people think education came from? 
It did not come from Brian Tobin.  It did not come from Clyde 
Wells.  It has been preserved by the churches over the last 1,000 
or 1,500 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were the repositories for all the knowledge accumulated 
from Greece, Rome and the early church.  They were the 
repositories of knowledge.  They were the ones that established 
the great universities.  They were the ones that added to the 
body of knowledge, people like St. Augustine, St. Thomas and St. 
Anselm on up through the reformation.  All their ideas became 
part of the great body of knowledge that helped form our modern 
society.  They were the ones that helped give birth to the whole 
idea of having rights entrenched in a constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the American experience, very much was influenced 
by the religious ideas that had accumulated until that time. The 
preamble to our charter says “Whereas Canada is founded upon 
principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of 
law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this country were founded upon a principle that recognizes 
the supremacy of God, where do we think the idea came from?  It 
did not come from the public school.  It did not come from Brian 
Tobin.  It came from denominational schooling and from parents 
who we believe are the ones who should be driving what kind of 
values their children learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education would occur from the churches and from denominational 
schools as it has for the last thousands of years.  Reform was 
already under way.  Things were changing.  Schools were doing 
their best to ensure that there was efficiency and that people 
were getting the best bang for their buck.  What the government 
has done goes well beyond what was necessary to achieve the 
reforms it was seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forgive me if this seems a little ancillary, but we often talk 
in this place about how we are a multicultural society.  We are a 
pluralistic society.  I hear it all the time.  We have a 
department of multiculturalism.  While I disagree with what the 
government means by multiculturalism, I think we have a 
multicultural society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My people come from Norway, Ireland, Holland and England.  That 
is my background.  We have a multicultural society.  We have all 
kinds of religions that come here from all over the world. We all 
believe we should celebrate that.  We believe it is important to 
be pluralistic.  We need to find ways to accommodate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have that in the current system in Newfoundland.  We have 
pluralism.  We have ability for people to celebrate their faiths 
through the education system and still pick up a good 
understanding of all things that traditionally constitute an 
education.  They have the ability to teach children the world 
view that is so incredibly important to them.  Unfortunately the 
government does not seem to see this as an issue of pluralism or 
multiculturalism. 
In fact, what we are seeing now is them suggesting through their 
support of this that all of these multicultural values or 
pluralism that we think are important are going to be essentially 
extinguished, at least in the context of this debate in 
Newfoundland, in favour of a system where we have one big central 
school system that effectively diminishes all that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We travel the world to see all these different cultures and 
religions and we are doing what we can in this particular 
instance to effectively diminish them in Canada.  I think we are 
making a big mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to answer some of the objections that have been raised by 
people who are in support of term 17.  The first was that it was 
a democratic process that brought about the government's 
initiative to introduce the amended term 17.  I do not disagree 
with this.  It was a democratic initiative.  I am not going to 
get into a fight about whether or not 32 days was long enough and 
all those kinds of things.  I want to put the question:  Is it 
possible to make a determination on minority rights using a 
referendum?  I do not think it is.  It certainly is not possible, 
I do not think, when we are talking about getting a bare 
plurality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point maybe someone down the road in the past should 
have said that when it comes to issues like minority rights we 
must have a higher standard.  Maybe it has to be two-thirds, I do 
not know.  However, I would argue that in this particular case it 
is extraordinarily difficult to make the argument that someone 
can extinguish minority rights on the basis of the voice of the 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my friend across the way say “But, you know, in such 
and such a district, which was mostly Pentecostal, people did not 
show up in the numbers to vote that they should have”, and blah, 
blah, blah.  However, that is not the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that people who believe strongly in these things 
came out and voted against it.  To these people, these rights are 
real rights, not abstract rights.  They are rights that mean a 
tremendous amount to them.  Therefore, can we really extinguish 
them?  Can the people who do not have religious convictions or 
strong religious convictions just arbitrarily say “I don't 
believe in these things, therefore I am going to wipe out your 
rights?”  I do not think they can.  It is not fair and it is not 
right.  I disagree with the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, some people say this was necessary for school reform. 
Maybe I have tilled that ground already, but I do not think it 
was.  It reminds me of a quote from Alexis de Tocqueville, the 
gentleman who wrote <I>Democracy in America</I>.  I remember he 
was commenting one time on the French Revolution.  He said “We 
were already speaking of the French aristocracy.  We were already 
half way down the stairs when they came up and threw us out the 
window to get us to the ground a little faster”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened in this particular case.  The reform was 
already well under way. The government just could not wait.  It 
could not co-operate with the denominational schools and decided 
that it would just bring in the sledge-hammer and put an end to 
and extinguish ancient rights, rights that are very important to 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members how important they are.  I have had letters, 
as I am sure my friends have had as well, from people in 
Newfoundland who are begging us not to extinguish those rights 
because they mean so much to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people argue that religion has no place in the school 
system.  I think my friend from Elk Island touched on this but I 
must say it again.  I would argue that people always bring some 
kind of a belief system to the table.  They bring a world view to 
the table.  Now we are going to be in a situation where all the 
people of Newfoundland essentially pay to support one world view, 
a secular world view, that is taught in the schools.  As my 
friend said, it simply cannot be otherwise.  If we are going to 
teach people something, they are going to end up learning a set 
of values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say parents should be the ones who determine what those 
values are.  When it is their tax dollars, that money should be 
used to teach their children their beliefs and their world view. 
That is what we believe.  I am speaking on behalf not of my party 
but on behalf of some of my friends who I think support the same 
point of view as I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth point is that some people say this does not 
prejudiciously affect rights granted in 1949 because they are 
going to offer religious observances and religion classes.

<A HREF="#LINKT136"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will argue that there is a world of difference between 
comparative religion and allowing somebody to be imbued with the 
values that permeate a whole school and reflect the actual faith 
that the students' parents believe so strongly in.  To sit like a 
sociologist and say here is what Muslims believe, here is what 
Hindus believe, here is what people at the Solar Temple believe, 
here is what Christians believe, and here is what people who are 
whatever believe, and to say are the differences not interesting, 
is 180 degrees away from what people believe in who want to have 
their children go to a denominational school. It is a completely 
different thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People send their children to a denominational school not to 
learn about religions but to get the faith, to be imbued in the 
faith.  They send them there to learn the virtues that are part 
of the faith.  They learn about right and wrong.  They do not go 
to those schools to learn about comparative religion.  That is 
fine and that is probably a good thing to learn but it is not the 
same thing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religious observances are fine but in a denominational school 
religious observance happens every day.  We do not wait for the 
three or four days when the rest of the secular world celebrates 
religious holidays.  Religious observances are essentially every 
day.  While those things are nice tokens, I think they are 
virtually meaningless to people who hold their religion 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with a fifth point which I have heard myself.  Some 
people say that denominational schools cause divisions.  Some 
people are taught something which is quite different from what 
other people are taught and this sets up divisions.  But all 
freedoms do that.  Freedom of speech causes divisions.  People 
disagree.  This is also true for freedom of belief and freedom of 
conscience.  All these freedoms cause divisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the charter we recognize in Canada that religion plays an 
extraordinarily important role.  That is under the charter which 
a Liberal government brought in.  The current Prime Minister was 
justice minister when the government brought the charter in.  It 
included in the preamble “whereas Canada is founded upon 
principles that recognize the supremacy of God”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is unreasonable to allow schools to teach 
about the principles upon which our country is founded.  That is 
all we are asking for.  For that reason I am asking members to 
oppose term 17 as it is amended and to consider very carefully 
the effect this initiative will have on minority rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the 
hon. member for stating his bias from the beginning.  However, I 
remind him that this debate is not about Catholic education in 
Alberta.  It is about the denominational school systems in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. We have to keep that in mind when we 
are dealing with this issue and the express wishes of the people 
of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to multiculturalism and pluralism.  The 
member for Calgary Southeast also referred to pluralism.  They 
said that a secular school system somehow flies in the face of 
our Canadian value of pluralism.  I suggest the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system promoted by the member is one that provides for 
segregation as opposed to integration.  A Canadian value that is 
more respected is that children of all the various denominations 
and religions can go to school together, live together and 
experience life together.  That is something that Canadians with 
Canadian values would like to see.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to a way to get rid of religion is to kill 
the institutions.  I honestly think that was an exaggeration.  I 
do not think there is anyone who would seriously suggest that 
this honest effort by the Government of Newfoundland supported by 
all the opposition parties in the legislature of Newfoundland and 
supported by 73% of the people who showed up to vote in the 
referendum could really be described as an attempt to kill the 
institutions or to kill religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member does the people and the Government of 
Newfoundland a disservice when he uses that kind of language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, dealing with the last 
point first, I am not suggesting that what is being done in 
Newfoundland is being done maliciously, not at all. I think they 
are missing a very obvious point, that if we effectively take 
away something the churches have done for a long time, which is 
to provide for religious education in Newfoundland, then 
effectively we are taking them out of the lives of people in a 
very meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take away all these things that the churches used to do, 
practical things, things that affected people every day, then 
effectively we are removing them from people's lives in a very 
important way.  I do think it has an impact on them ultimately. I 
think it makes them less relevant overall. We have seen the 
churches in decline over the past many years. Religion cannot 
survive and it is not just a matter of conscience. It cannot 
survive in the public square alone with the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the best possible situation is when there are 
large institutions that serve as a check against a big 
government. It is a good idea to have vibrant and strong 
churches.  I think that is a really good idea.  They serve as a 
check on some of the things the government wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen other controversial issues come before this place. 
We have seen churches stand up and say, “We really disagree with 
that”.  I think that is good and that is healthy. But when we 
start to marginalize the churches by taking away these abilities 
that they have had until now, then effectively we are making them 
less effective.  I do not think that is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am not saying it is a malicious thing.  I am not saying 
they are trying to do that.  It is something that is a very 
unfortunate effect though of what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that segregation will divide people.  I 
would point out that one of the things churches teach, and I am 
sure my friend will remember this from his own religious 
upbringing, is that churches teach people to love their 
neighbour. That is something churches typically teach.  That is 
something we will find in denominational schools, love your 
neighbour as yourself.  I do not think that is particularly 
harmful.  I think it is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things, those virtues that are taught by churches 
through denominational education strengthen the social fabric of 
the country.  They make us better neighbours.  They make us 
better citizens.  They do all kinds of good things that would not 
get done if it was not for the churches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree completely with what my friend has said.  I would 
argue that sometimes by neglect, by not teaching positive things 
we end up allowing negative things to become part of what our 
children believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have forgotten the first point that my friend across the way 
made so I will sit down now, Mr. Speaker.  I did not write it 
down but if he wants to ask again, he is welcome to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to take the opportunity to comment on the comment 
made by the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. His comment regarding pluralism really 
strikes at the heart of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fashionable idea among secular small <I>l</I> 
liberals, and I do not mean to include the hon. member in that 
category. 
The idea among secular liberal intellectuals is that pluralism 
really consists of removing differences and creating a kind of 
monolithic secular culture and society unleavened by the 
differences of world view between people of different faiths. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT138"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not pluralism.  It is by definition monism.  It is a 
monolithic view of society and culture which is not informed by 
differences of conviction and differences of religious world 
views.  That is precisely what is being assaulted.  That 
authentic pluralism, which the current Newfoundland school system 
is an exemplar of, is being undermined by this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this most worrisome.  In the final paragraph of the 
report of the special joint committee, it quotes an unnamed 
Newfoundland school student saying: “I think that is the kind of 
religious course that we should be offered in schools”—namely a 
non-denominational one—“ethical choice in comparative 
religion”—and the committee adds—“because most of the wars 
and disturbances between countries, most civil wars are brought 
upon on the basis of different religions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on this.  It is just 
absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really must rise to the 
bait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I do believe that what the Government of Newfoundland is 
proposing will lead to a bland homogeneity that we will all 
regret some day. I have heard this red herring before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we cast back over the 20th century and look at the great 
disasters that have occurred around the world, they were not in 
the name of religion. Quite the contrary.  They are quite 
contrary to what all religions believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the first world war and the second world war.  Look at 
what happened in the Soviet Union.  Fifty million people lost 
their lives because of an ideology, not because of a religion. 
Look at Pol Pot and what has occurred in Cambodia where two 
million people lost their lives, not because of religion.  Look 
at Hitler.  We look at an ideology again and millions of people 
lost their lives, not because of religion, to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that even a religious war proves what people have 
always said, that people have a fundamental flaw in their 
character, original sin and all that kind of thing which is why I 
believe it is a good idea to teach people about these things.  It 
helps to remind them that there is a problem of original sin and 
we have to be on guard for it.  That has been reflected in a lot 
of the disasters in the 20th century.
