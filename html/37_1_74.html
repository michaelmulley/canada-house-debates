</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I move 
that the first report of the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs presented to the House on Tuesday, 
March 20, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with mixed emotions 
that I rise today to speak to this motion as it concerns an issue 
very much in the minds of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procurement process to replace the Sea King helicopters is 
one that we have followed for some time but that has only 
recently seized the attention of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was last May 18 that my colleague, the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead, raised the prospect of this government using 
the contract for political means.  At that time, and then an 
opposition member, my colleague, suggested that the government 
had a secret agenda, an agenda that involved a specific company. 
The government said that my colleague's claims were laughable. 
The government said that there was no plan to place one 
competitor above another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only three months ago the government introduced a procurement 
process that was biased in favour of one company only.  The 
process introduced called for the lowest price compliant bid to 
win the day, not taking into account whatsoever fleet commonality 
or, more important, better value.  This was when the treasury 
board's own guidelines specifically urged all government 
departments to abide by a best value criteria when launching a 
procurement process.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told that in the strict legal interpretation of 
Treasury Board guidelines 9.1.1 and 9.1.2, no laws have been 
broken.  However I must ask a question.  Why did the government 
choose to avoid the generally accepted practices that have guided 
our military purchases in the past? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter whether it was a Liberal or Conservative government in 
the past, it never followed those types of guidelines.  We have 
been told that it was to expand the number of Canadian bidders. 
Yet in retrospect it is clear that only one wholly owned Canadian 
company is in serious competition for any of the related 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That takes me to the second problem I have with this contract, 
which is the fact that the government chose to split the contract 
into two parts, one for the basic vehicle and another for the 
critical mission systems.  If I wanted to play politics with this 
one, like some of my colleagues are, I would vote for that 
because it would create some jobs in the province of New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was taken out to dinner by the company I said that I 
would only have a bowl of soup because no one buys me with 
dinner.  No one buys me with anything.  To this date, no one 
does.  I guarantee that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also say right here and now that when it comes to the 
men and women who wear uniforms, we should take the politics out 
of it.  We should give them the tools to do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an engineer.  I do not have a full appreciation of the 
technical difficulties that might come to pass as a result of 
buying two independent products.  However we all know the reason 
this is being done.  It is for political reasons because in 1993 
the government of the day cancelled the EH-101 and wasted $800 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what we have been told, this is the first such split 
contract of its kind since the House of Commons has been in 
place.  The assistant deputy minister responsible said that this 
was the first of its kind, which seems to me to be a very risky 
proposition.  We must give our Canadian Armed Forces the best 
equipment to do their jobs, not only because it is the right 
thing to do but because we give them complicated tasks that 
always put them in harm's way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am unsure of the ethical or moral reasons that we would 
put in place a procurement process that would buy the cheapest 
helicopter but not necessarily the best.  I have for some time 
asked the government to reconsider the procurement process.  One 
potential bidder, E.H. Industries Ltd., has gone to the length of 
filing a complaint with both the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal and the Federal Court of Appeal on this matter.  The 
company believes that by facing this competition on the lowest 
price alone, it is at a significant disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will recall that it was E.H. Industries that 
manufactured the EH-101 purchased by the previous government.  I 
am sure the House will recall that in the election of 1993, as I 
have stated, the issue of EH-101 featured prominently in all 
debates.  The House will certainly recall that the Prime Minister 
held his pen up high and said that he would purchase no new 
helicopters.  Zero helicopters is what was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems very strange that the only red book promise that 
has been kept by this government was the one promise that related 
to these helicopters.  The GST, free trade and a range of other 
promises were quickly forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government is not choosing to instigate a procurement 
process that would prejudice E.H. Industries' helicopter, the 
Cormorant, solely on the basis that it was the successful bidder 
10 years ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes this issue so important to us all is that the 
helicopters currently in use are so dangerous.  Some of the 
pilots have already lost their lives, just outside my city. Some 
of the parents of the pilots came to see me.  They asked me to 
take up their cause and force the government's hand in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sea Kings have given yeoman service to this country for 
almost 40 years, and they have earned their retirement.  I have 
great compassion for the men and women in uniform who must use 
the Sea Kings on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence has repeatedly said that unsafe 
helicopters will not fly, but cannot explain why our choppers go 
down in places like Hawaii, East Timor, and even on the coast of 
Nova Scotia.  If we cannot predict when a Sea King is safe, how 
then do we know which ones to fly?  How can the minister make 
this guarantee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, I believe the Minister of National 
Defence and the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
will have a lot to answer for in this process.  I believe the 
Canadian people are sick and tired of the government playing 
politics when it should be watching the backs of our Canadian 
forces personnel and doing what is right for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was mayor of Saint John I did a number of major capital 
purchases, so I can speak with some experience when I say that 
this contract process is wrong.  It is unfair and places bidders 
at a significant disadvantage.  Whenever we have the public 
challenges to a procurement process, as we have seen with the 
maritime helicopter program, we know that something is amiss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased, therefore, that in the next sitting of our 
parliament the other place will undertake a committee of the 
whole to review this entire process.  I applaud our colleagues in 
the other place for their diligence to duty and their courage. It 
is my hope that in the consideration of the Sea King and the 
challenges we face in replacing them, we look in the mirror and 
recognize we have a duty larger than just helping out some of our 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 30 of the procurement study also refers to the fact that 
the Government of Canada should convene a national round table on 
shipbuilding in Canada with a view to establishing a national 
shipbuilding policy.  We brought that report in asking for a 
national shipbuilding policy in June 2000.  We said there should 
be a naval shipyard in Canada where we would build all our navy 
ships.  We should not be buying used submarines in London, 
England, only to find out they cannot float, then pay $800 
million to try to get them to float.  That is an insult to our 
men and women in uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having sat on the defence committee since 1993, I am really 
worried when I see what the government has done and the politics 
it has played with our military.  The duty of government is 
clear.  The recommendations of this all party procurement study 
by the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs are clear, and our job is very clear.  There was 
unanimous all party support for the procurement study of June 
2000, yet here it is June 2001, a year later, and the government 
did not even listen to its own people who chaired the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say let us do what is right.  The government has not done 
anything that is right when it comes to the military.  Men who 
flew home from Kosovo were asked to take their boots off so they 
could be given to those men who were getting on the planes to fly 
to Kosovo.  If we cannot afford a pair of boots for our men and 
women in the military, that is a shame.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ashamed of what we are doing with the helicopter 
procurement process which is being used.  I ask the government 
today to please take the politics out of it, put out a tender, 
allow everyone to bid, and then bring in its recommendations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the part of this equation that the Canadian public does 
not understand is the $497 million it cost the taxpayer to buy 
out the lawsuit.  When the present government cancelled the 
original helicopter deal after the 1993 election, it did so at a 
huge cost to the taxpayers.  It cost taxpayers a half a billion 
dollars to cancel a deal which the Liberals raged against in the 
election, for no other reason than pure politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member for Saint John for her impression of 
whether or not that is the number, and how many lives the 
cancellation of this deal has cost?  When can we expect 
helicopters, given the present set of circumstances under which 
we are operating and given the government's position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, defence has been 
determined that over $800 million has been spent because of the 
cancellation of the EH-101 contract.  Now not all the Sea Kings 
can be replaced.  There will be fewer helicopters than what we 
had when all Sea Kings were flying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have major concerns.  When we put the amount of money which 
has been spent trying to keep these old helicopters flying on top 
of what it cost to cancel out, it will cost taxpayers more in the 
end to get a helicopter that cannot fly the distance a Sea King 
can.  I have major concerns about what is taking place here 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it seems to me that what the hon. member for Saint John 
and her colleagues are saying is quite true, that this was the 
object of some politics in 1993.  I remember it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were good reasons to be against the EH-101 contract, but 
the fact remains that the Liberals having cancelled that contract 
and having paid a very hefty price for doing so, then did not do 
what should have followed from that, and that was to act 
expeditiously to get some other helicopters.  That is the main 
point here, not trying to relive 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest fault of the Liberals is not that they kept that one 
election promise.  They kept it not because they are promise 
keepers but because they wanted a few high profile promises to 
keep so they could then break a whole bunch of other promises 
with impunity.  However that is neither here nor there. The real 
tragedy of this is that they have taken eight years to replace 
the EH-101s and we are still a long way off from replacing those 
helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real tragedy, the real crime which has been 
committed by the Liberal government.  The people who depend upon 
those helicopters in the armed services and people who might 
depend upon them in various situations will still be waiting 
years from now thanks to the fact that the Liberals did not 
complete the process.  When having cancelled the EH-101 contract, 
they should have then proceeded expeditiously to replace them 
with other helicopters.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, from the information we 
have been receiving through national defence, it could be the 
year 2007.  Some have said 2005.  Think about that.  That is 
unbelievable.  We are not going to have any helicopters flying at 
all.  I cannot believe that anyone— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He said we do not need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Who said they do not need them?  That 
is sad.  I cannot imagine how the members on the government side 
can sit there with smiles on their faces and not be worried about 
jeopardizing lives of people in the military.  I cannot believe 
that I see that happening in the House this morning. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is a wonderful place for bombast to be continued. I 
recognize that a lot of members engage in it so that the practice 
will not go into disuse.  However, in the course of generating 
the necessary requirements for engaging in bombast, we sometimes 
overstep the bounds, as I said the other day, of reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have on the table an order that will be delivered for 15 
search and rescue Cormorants which will replace some of the 
equipment that the members opposite are saying is obsolete, even 
though it is still functional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member to suggest that there will not be a delivery of 
equipment that is world class, necessary and appropriate for 
Canada's needs is to engage in bombast of the worst variety. 
Maybe she should reflect on the negatives that she is putting 
forward by perpetuating this perception and a wrong-headed view 
of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad I have this 
opportunity to respond.  It shows that those on the government 
side do not understand what has been happening.  What he is 
talking about now is the replacement of the Labradors, not the 
Sea Kings, which are still flying, and they are going to have 
less numbers than before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members want to know what happened to the fishing problem in 
Newfoundland, for heaven's sake?  The government did not have Sea 
Kings that could look after the 200 mile limit.  Foreign ships 
were coming in and dragging the bottom of the ocean.  All these 
things have had a negative impact, and they sat there.  This has 
been strictly politics, nothing more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason the government and those who were elected in 
1993 said they would cancel the EH-101 was because they thought 
it was a popular thing to do, not the right thing to do, to get 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should go and talk to those men and women in the 
military like the rest of us do and see how they feel.  They are 
not allowed to come in here and say anything. They are not 
allowed to open their mouths, so I am here to tell the government 
what they are telling us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging to hear the hon. member for Saint 
John try to clarify some of the misperceptions and the misnomers 
about what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contract was cancelled in 1993 for blatant political 
reasons, and it has been perpetuated.  The real crime in all of 
this, to use the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona's words, is 
the further delay, the further politics which are going on with 
deliberate attempts to not buy the same helicopters, and having 
to display some hubris or eat their own words.  We have an 
attempt to split the contract to somehow try to avoid buying the 
same helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite spoke of the Cormorant.  That was the 
stripped down version of the EH-101.  The Prime Minister can talk 
with great distinction about the costs that are being saved. What 
about the cost in human lives?  What about the cost of those 
airmen and airwomen who are flying them?  What about the costs of 
those who are at jeopardy at sea or in some emergency situation 
and these current helicopters are unable to aid them the way they 
are supposed to?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what my hon. colleague has 
stated is the exact the position we are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to speak from the heart.  The hon. member referred to 
the fact that we are talking about lives.  I want all members in 
the House today to think about their own child or grandchild who 
may be a pilot on one of the Sea Kings.  We would not want a 
family member to be a pilot on one of the Sea Kings today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to continue to do peacekeeping, we must equip our 
armed forces with the best tools available so they can do what 
they need to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
have begun today in routine proceedings with a motion to adopt a 
defence committee report that was tabled not long ago in 
connection with helicopter acquisitions by the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the debate so far, although we have really only 
had the one speaker from the Progressive Conservative Party, that 
the PC Party still appears to be apologizing for the EH-101 
helicopter deal that was in place in 1993.  It has been indicated 
that the contract was cancelled for political reasons.  My 
recollection was that the contract was cancelled for what we 
regarded as blatant profligacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the contract was in play, Canada had a $43 billion 
deficit, not to mention the accruing debt.  Financially it simply 
was not sound.  The equipment that was intended to be purchased, 
was a helicopter that many regarded as very capable and 
multi-tasked in terms of its role, but really a Cadillac capable 
of filling many different roles and perhaps more roles than we 
needed.  Therefore, the decision was made by the Liberal 
government, which was elected in the fall of 1993, to cancel the 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Cancel the pay raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  We have obviously touched a cord here with 
the Progressive Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue I want to bring up at this time has to do with 
this envelope of equipment acquisition by the Department of 
National Defence, specifically helicopters.  We all know that the 
military has been acquiring new helicopters for about five to ten 
years.  It was necessary to replace virtually all its equipment 
but we were not going to do it in one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first helicopter equipment to be replaced was the HU series, 
sometimes known as the Huey helicopter.  These were 1950s and 
1960s vintage helicopters and they were replaced with the Griffon 
helicopter.  Those deliveries were commenced and completed over a 
period two to four years ago.  The Griffon helicopter is 
successfully fulfilling its new role in the Canadian armed 
forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then got to the search and rescue helicopter, which is a land 
based dedicated search and rescue piece of equipment.  We have 
been flying a Labrador twin rotor helicopter on both coasts for 
many years.  It is manufactured by Boeing and is a good piece of 
equipment.  It has stood the test of time but it has outlived its 
lifespan. 
After the cancellation of the EH-101 in 1993-94, the government 
commenced the acquisition process for a replacement of the 
Labradors.  That particular replacement is known as the 
Cormorant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone will realize, a period of time is required to 
commission a replacement, design it and get it constructed. These 
are custom designed pieces of military equipment for particular 
countries.  Canada wants a certain helicopter that will do a 
certain job.  The frame of the helicopter is essentially off the 
shelf but the components and the equipment necessary to allow 
that equipment to do its specific role has to be customized and 
prepared carefully.  The process of replacing the Labradors is 
underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are just a few weeks away from the delivery of the first 
search and rescue Cormorant.  I am hopeful that Canadians will 
get a chance to see the first one on the front page of one of the 
newspapers.  This process has been in play for approximately five 
years.  I remember, as other colleagues will, when that contract 
was being dealt with by the government.  We had a number of 
incessant repeated questions from the opposition in question 
period, scrutinizing, questioning and criticizing the process of 
acquiring that particular replacement helicopter.  That process 
is virtually completed now.  Deliveries are imminent and I am 
looking forward to the first delivery, as are the armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite put her hand on her heart.  As people, do we 
care about the men and women who fly this equipment?  Of course 
we do.  We have replaced the Hueys, we are about to replace the 
Labradors and now we are embarking on the replacement of the Sea 
Kings, which are old inventions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that Canada is not the only country 
flying Sea Kings.  A lot of countries, including NATO countries 
are flying Sea Kings.  All of us know they are outrageously 
expensive to maintain, which is one of the reasons why we are 
replacing them, but they have served their role well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of our armed forces personnel will fly in an unsafe Sea 
King, nor will any member of any armed forces of any country. 
They are all safe to fly.  It is one of the reasons it costs so 
much to maintain them.  To maintain them properly so that they 
are safe and effective in their role takes a lot of bucks and a 
lot of downtime, but when they fly, they are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once in a while we have a Sea King that gets a flat tire.  My 
own automobile gets a flat tire from time to time.  I do my best 
to maintain it.  I drive it safely and our military flies its Sea 
Kings safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are in a process of replacing the Sea Kings.  The 
government has made a decision to enhance the prospects for 
competition, in part to ensure that we get the best price 
available.   As I said earlier, the frame for the new helicopter 
will probably come off the shelf from a multinational aviation 
company that produces helicopters and it could be one in Canada. 
The components and equipment that go into the helicopter for its 
maritime purpose and to primarily fly off the back end of a naval 
ship, among other roles, has to be carefully designed and sourced 
among competitive sources for price.  Therefore, the contract has 
been split in two.  Rather than being stuck with a situation 
where we might have had one, two or three sole source suppliers 
for one contract, we now have approximately 13 potential 
suppliers for various components of the replacement helicopter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go forward, I fully expect the opposition to ask many 
questions and allege many things about the process here.  I would 
just like all of us to get a grip and to understand the 
perspective.  We are irrevocably embarked on an acquisition 
process to replace the Sea King helicopter.  We will get one as 
soon as we can for the best price that we can, and we will get 
the best possible equipment that we can.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PATENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK18">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 5 consideration of the motion that 
Bill S-17, an act to amend the Patent Act, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for the sake of the House and those interested in the 
process and in patent law, I will go through some of the 
technical reasons the bill is before the House.  It is a bill 
that our party is supporting, much to the surprise I suppose of 
many across the way.  It is not often that we stand in this place 
and support a bill brought in by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a recent World Trade Organization ruling, the bill was 
introduced to bring Canada's patent laws into conformity with our 
trade obligations.  Under the bill, all patents would last 20 
years beyond the date applications are filed.  Currently patents 
filed prior to October 1, 1989, under the old act, expire 17 
years after the date they were granted.  We are talking about a 
three year extension of the Patent Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 would not apply to patents that have already lapsed so 
the arguments we have heard in the House regarding that do not 
apply.  As well, in cases where the old rule provides a longer 
period of protection than the new rule, the old rule would still 
apply.  This would happen in cases where more than three years 
have passed between the time a patent application was filed and 
the time it was granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 would repeal subsection 55.2(2) of the Patent Act 
which has allowed for stockpiling of a product prior to the 
expiry of the patent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about patent protection, what are we talking about? 
We are talking about copyright laws that would apply, for 
example, to writers, other artists, inventors and so on.  Patents 
give their holders time to benefit from their research and ideas 
and from the money they have spent in developing them.  In other 
words, they give them time to profit from their work, in many 
cases good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are talking about patent drug laws.  We are 
talking about sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars being 
invested by drug companies to develop new drugs to help combat 
disease and prevent death.  They do that at great expense.  By 
refusing to invest here until we modernized our patent laws, 
these companies were sending a signal to Canada that they would 
not build factories and research facilities here unless they had 
patent protection to prevent others from copying what they do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research communities in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and other 
parts of Canada, not just in big cities but in smaller areas, 
were being denied the benefits of that type of research and the 
jobs and prosperity it brings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties in 1987, the major opposition party at 
the time being of course the Liberal Party, raged against the 
legislation we brought in, Bill C-22, the first act we brought in 
to protect patents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 we did the same thing again and made further changes to 
improve the intellectual property protection given to 
pharmaceutical companies while strengthening the powers of the 
Patented Medicine Prices Review Board Canada.  The argument that 
the Liberal Party and the NDP waged at the time was that it would 
increase drug prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very basic sense, the Liberals asked us why we would 
provide drug companies with patent protection which would not 
allow generic companies to copy their products and which would 
outlaw copycat drugs for 20 years.  They said that it would not 
help or enhance the health care system but that it would hurt and 
harm it.  They said that it was the wrong thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals at the time, including the present Minister of 
Industry, who is now spearheading the bill through the House, 
argued that it would be wrong and railed against it.  We have had 
many quotes in the House over the last number of days.  Some of 
the quotes come from famous statements the present minister then 
made in committee and on the floor of the House railing against 
the very bill he now supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that what we did then, although some might 
disagree, and I know that even some government members disagree 
with the present bill, was the right thing.  We created thousands 
of jobs in the pharmaceutical research industry in Canada.  The 
evidence is there.  Members opposite will tell us that the goal 
of the bill was exceeded in terms of jobs and investment in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often talk about the brain drain, and there are a number of 
reasons for it.  Obviously one of them is our tax regime.  Unless 
we bring our tax regime in line with our partner to the south we 
will always have people leaving Canada to go where they will be 
rewarded for their work and not taxed to death.  To a degree that 
argument is true, although there are other things that hold 
people in Canada simply because of our style of life. 
Considering the health care and other benefits we have in Canada, 
not everyone is attracted by high wages and low taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing a lot of top notch people to the south who go to 
work for pharmaceutical and research companies in the United 
States.  The bill we introduced in 1987, Bill C-22 at the time, 
followed by Bill C-91 in 1992, completely stopped the transfer of 
talent from Canada to the United States.  They worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strengthening of the Patented Medicines Prices Review Board 
Canada also worked.  As evidence of that, in the United States 
today there is a raging debate about drug prices and the high 
cost of patent medicines.  Why are they so much higher in the 
United States than in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  There is a 40% exchange rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Considering the exchange rate, and I 
know the member for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge.  There is a 
40% difference between Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, please take note of the 
member on the other side of the House who is speaking and allow 
him to get up during questions and comments.  I will deal with 
that when the debate is over.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that, excluding exchange rates, drug prices in 
Canada are cheaper and for a number of reasons.  One is the 
strengthening of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board 
Canada.  The other, which I think even the legal minds on the 
government side of the House would recognize, is that in Canada 
litigation does not play as big a part in the overall cost of a 
drug as in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our legislation worked in the past and it is working today.  The 
result is that we have lower drug prices than many industrialized 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through Tuesday's debate to point out what my NDP 
colleague next to me, the member for Winnipeg North Centre, had 
to say.  On page 4651 of June 5, 2001 <I>Hansard</I> she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the question about the profitability of brand name 
drug companies is a very important one because members of the 
four parties who support Bill S-17 feel that the excessive 
profits of these drug companies should be allowed to become even 
more exorbitant.  Profits for brand name drug companies are 
already triple the industrial average and this industry is 
probably the second, if not the first, fastest growing industry 
in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to talk about high drug prices in Canada. 
However facts point to something different.  We do not have the 
highest drug prices in the world in Canada.  If we compare drug 
prices in Canada to drug prices in other industrial nations, we 
are at the lower end of the scale and not the higher end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we passed is working and the current bill will work 
because we must provide intellectual protection for this type of 
research to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a new drug called Gleevec was just approved in the 
United States.  I am not sure how long it will be before it is 
approved in Canada.  It is a new cancer fighting drug that was 
brought to market at a huge cost.  It cost hundreds of million of 
dollars in research to bring the drug on line.  It is being used 
to cure some forms of leukemia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In strictly layman's terms, Gleevec attaches itself only to 
cancer cells.  It does not destroy good cells as does a lot of 
chemotherapy, hence the significant side effects of being treated 
for cancer.  Not only are patients cured but they do not have the 
extreme nausea and sickness that comes with normal chemotherapy 
treatment.  That is a huge advancement and it saves lives.  The 
question is, would the drug be on the market today if the 
company, Norvartis, had not been given patent protection?  The 
simple answer is no.  We would not have the drug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another drug, Retuxin, was brought in by another huge 
international drug company.  The company spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars to develop the drug, which helps those who 
suffer from non-Hodgkins lymphoma and other cancers.  That is a 
huge cost.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hoffmann-La Roche brought that drug online and waited for months 
for it to be approved in Canada.  Again, it saves countless lives 
and frees up our health care system because it means that we can 
take a drug at home and be cured outside of the hospital.  That 
is a net saving to the system.  The truth is that we will either 
use that drug or something else that has been around for a few 
years but has not proven to be as effective.  Obviously this is 
like anything else, supply and demand, but the truth is that this 
type of research will dry up unless these companies have the 
protection they deserve.  That is what the bill would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the industry minister has had to swallow his own 
words on the bill.  I want to quote the industry minister.  This 
is the quote that usually sets the members on the government side 
ballistic.  This is what they call an about turn, an about face, 
a complete reversal of position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did it occur?  One of the reasons was of course that the 
Liberal Party went from opposition to government.  It is sort of 
like a lynching in the morning:  it kind of focuses the mind. 
Once in government the Liberals then say there are certain 
realities they have to deal with when they are in government. One 
is that they just simply cannot hide from the truth.  When 
something is working they have to embrace it even if they have to 
do a complete flip-flop on it.  Obviously the GST was one of 
those realities.  Of course they are trying to do a complete 
about face on the helicopter deal and so on and so forth.  We 
could rage on forever on this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the minister changed his mind.  Why?  Because 
he was wrong.  This is what the Minister of Industry, the former 
premier of Newfoundland, often referred to as Mini-Me, had to say 
about the bill a few years ago.  If only I were a good mimic.  I 
can see the hands waving now.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inconceivable to me that Parliament finds it necessary yet 
again to deal with yet another measure proposed by the Government 
because it is bound and chained to some ideological dictate which 
says this kind of Patent Act is necessary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that we would be taking money out of the 
pockets of old age pensioners and so on and so forth, that we 
were basically robbing the people blind by giving the patent 
protection act some thought here in the House of Commons.  The 
idea was that it would pass at a huge cost to the Canadian 
public.  He has eaten those words because we have the 
pharmaceutical jobs in Montreal, Toronto and other parts of 
Canada to prove that we were right and he was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the minister some credit.  He did stand up in Geneva 
not too long ago at a World Trade Organization meeting and say 
that Prime Minister Mulroney was right in terms of the free trade 
agreement at the time.  He basically said that he railed as a 
member of the Liberal Party but time has proven that Mulroney was 
right, the Conservative Party was right, that free trade does 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to give him credit for that.  That is much more than 
just about every member sitting on the government side today 
would do.  They railed against it.  The fact is that the Canadian 
economy has expanded dramatically because of that free trade 
agreement, not to mention the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a bill that would do the same thing, which the 
government of course now embraces, with the exception of some of 
the members now in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Liberal logic at its worst.  I have taken the time to 
identify some of those members who have actually stood up in 
their places in the House and railed against this bill.  They 
have actually railed against the very bill that the minister has 
now on the floor of the House, Bill S-17.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge railed against the bill 
the other day in the House, as did the members for 
Toronto—Danforth and Eglinton—Lawrence, but guess what?  When 
push comes to shove and it comes down to the final vote, every 
one of those members will be standing like lame ducks, voting in 
support of the very bill they railed against in the House.  It 
almost reminds me of the free trade debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member the other day said that we Conservatives air our 
dirty laundry in public.  That is true.  We do air our dirty 
laundry.  The difference is that those people wear their dirty 
laundry year after year. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I realize 
there is a lot of interest in asking questions of the hon. member 
on the other side of the floor.  We are all very interested in 
this issue and the bottom line is the high cost to our taxpayers 
and our consumers out there.  That is what is of interest to all 
of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the issue was before the Senate, the Conservative members 
of the House were also very concerned about the issues of 
compliance and the regulations.  Can I gather from the comments 
the hon. member made that in the fall when the minister comes 
forth to the industry committee and to parliament, as he has 
indicated he will do, the member would support a complete and 
thorough review of those regulations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we would support a 
complete airing of any issue, unlike the party opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good and very thoughtful question.  It allows me in 
response to talk about a private member's bill I introduced in 
the House entitled Bill C-338.  The NDP House leader has been 
quoted—it will show up in <I>Hansard</I>—as saying that it is 
exciting.  It is indeed exciting.  I thank the leader of the NDP. 
It is an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act regarding the 
process of approval for new drugs.  That is one of the things the 
government has to look at in addition to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Eglinton—Lawrence, I think it is—I can never 
get these Toronto ridings right, there are just too many Liberals 
in Toronto—is right in some of what he says.  I do not want to 
discount that.  On a very serious note, some of what he is saying 
is absolutely right.  One of the problems, which I think the 
government will recognize, is the fact that the drug approval 
process in Canada is excruciatingly slow and very cumbersome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the delay in the approval of drugs in Canada 
costs consumers a lot of money.  In fact it most likely costs us 
lives.  For example, it will be months before the new cancer 
fighting drug Gleevec, which I mentioned earlier, will be 
approved in Canada, at a big cost to the health care system and 
individual lives.  That is what Bill C-338 would do.  It outlines 
a process under which we could move the approval process along a 
little faster.  The bill does not suggest something that has not 
been proven.  It would be modelled after the European Union 
example. 
That is very important, because used in conjunction with this 
drug it would actually accomplish much more than would be 
possible with this present piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In private conversations with the health minister he agrees with 
me.  The health minister says “Listen, Mr. Thompson”—or Greg 
or whatever he calls me on that particular day and sometimes he 
is not quite that polite—“the truth is I think it is a good 
bill”.  However, the money to get this new process going within 
Health Canada means he would have to take money from one part of 
the department and put it into another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that it is something we have to examine.  In this 
whole process the trick is to move these drugs onto the market as 
safely and as quickly as we can, but following experiences of 
other nations.  If we are part of that bigger community in terms 
of trading partners, we should be able to share some of that 
basic scientific evidence which allows those countries to use 
these very drugs that are being delayed in Canada under the 
approval process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has been interesting to listen to the member for New 
Brunswick Southwest struggling to defend an untenable position. I 
have a great deal of respect for my colleague as a person.  It is 
his policies that we have a great deal of difficulty with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure hon. members would find it interesting to observe this 
debate and note that it is the Conservatives in the Chamber who 
are promoting the position of subsidies for the wealthy and 
public assistance for the corporate sector, while we New 
Democrats in the House are pushing hard for competition in the 
drug sector to ensure that prices remain reasonable and our 
health care system is sustained and supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is as follows.  He will recall that 
prior to his former leader, Brian Mulroney, we had a reasonable 
system in place which included compulsory licensing and 
reasonable limitations on patent protection.  Since the Mulroney 
era and the beginning of the end of proper and decent public 
policy in this regard, we have seen drug prices increase in the 
last decade alone by almost 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the member realizes what that does to people's access to 
necessary medications.  Surely he understands that the return for 
that kind of public investment in brand name drug companies is 
not at all commensurate with the development of innovative drugs 
and breakthroughs for health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that shows members how 
much civility there is in the Chamber from time to time.  Here we 
are side by each and we can agree to disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However members knows they are in trouble when a member stands 
up and says that it was an interesting speech or that it was 
interesting to listen to, because that is basically the end of 
the good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member used the term reasonable.  She was talking about a 
reasonable solution to the problem, saying that we had a 
reasonable law prior to 1987 and prior to the patent law.  We did 
not.  It did not work.  It was not reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Oh balderdash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  The evidence is the fact that 
companies were leaving Canada and refused to invest in Canada. 
The truth is that the research community in Canada was suffering. 
The truth is that there has been a completely turnaround in 
regard to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other fact, as true as I am standing here, is that drug 
prices in Canada are lower than they are in the United States, 
lower than they are in most European countries, and they are 
saving lives.  There is a cost to research and there is a cost to 
not doing something.  We can sit down and go on forever with what 
we have, but if there is a way to improve it a government takes a 
risk and does it.  That is what we did.  That is what the present 
government is doing and I applaud it for that.  We need the 
research.  We need those new drugs and we need those lives saved. 
It is as simple as that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know time is of the essence, 
so I will be very brief.  I listened to the comments of the 
member for New Brunswick Southwest.  The bill would bring the 
Patent Act into compliance with the World Trade Organization.  I 
think most people would accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the 20 year patent protection is very appropriate, but 
there are generic companies in my riding that talk about the 
notice of compliance regulations which, they say, provide these 
companies with another three years of patent protection.  I know 
that regulatory issues are not really tied to the legislation, 
but I am sure the member for New Brunswick Southwest has made a 
holistic study of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he support the notice of compliance regulations which 
appear to add more time to the 20 year patent protection?  This 
is a provision that was brought in by his own government in 1993, 
so I assume that he may support it on that basis alone.  I wonder 
if he has any policy rationale for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, basically a lot of what 
could happen could actually happen within the bureaucracy, if we 
talk to people who know the issue within the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These timely reviews of drug submissions are very important, but 
the fact is that we are lagging behind the rest of the 
industrialized world, notably the United States and European 
countries.  I am suggesting that we follow the same model that is 
followed in the European Union.  It is not new and it is not 
innovative.  It is basically the bill that I have written.  We 
took a hard look at the process in Europe versus the process here 
in Canada.  We are suggesting that without too much money and 
without a lot of time we can actually change and improve it. When 
we do that I think it will be good not only for consumers but for 
the companies involved as well, and certainly for our health care 
system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the debate on Bill S-17 is very helpful for those 
Canadians who may be listening by helping people to see more 
clearly the kind of ideological and policy monoculture that we 
have here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for New Brunswick Southwest remarked on the fact that 
he as a Conservative was supporting the bill brought in by the 
Liberal government.  The implication was that this was somehow 
exceptional or aberrant or not something that he would normally 
be inclined to do, but I beg to differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to Bill S-17, to the extent that Bill S-17 is part 
of a larger way of looking at the world, looking at the economy, 
looking at the relationship between property and health, I think 
that in fact there is a great deal of agreement between not just 
the Conservatives and the Liberals on this, but among the 
Conservatives, the Liberals, the Alliance and the Bloc, with 
really only the NDP standing out as a party prepared to defend 
human health and the Canadian public interest over and against 
the property rights, as they are delineated in patent law, of 
multinational pharmaceutical companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would criticize us for this.  They would say that we 
are not accepting enough of various economic realities.  When 
they say that what they are really saying is that we have not 
accepted that the power of the multinational pharmaceutical 
companies should be a power that is acceded to in the way that 
all our other political colleagues have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for New Brunswick Southwest cited the fact that in 
1987 a Conservative government, long before the WTO and even the 
NAFTA and the FTA, had moved to change the compulsory licensing 
system we had in this country by which generic drugs were able to 
be produced after only two years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My memory of that system is that it worked very well.  My memory 
of that system is that it coincided with a time in which health 
care costs in Canada were not soaring in the way they are soaring 
now.  One of the reasons health care costs are soaring now is the 
soaring price of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative member might want to argue that there is some 
kind of differential between the price of drugs in Canada and the 
price of drugs in the United States.  If that is true, that can 
hardly be blamed or credited to the fact that we got rid of our 
generic drug licensing system because the United States has 
exactly the same system.  It is an argument that does not make 
much sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that at least with the Conservatives 
we kind of know what we are getting.  In 1987 they did not hide 
behind a free trade agreement, a North American free trade 
agreement or the World Trade Organization.  They said this was 
what they believed.  I think it was done largely in the interests 
of big multinational pharmaceutical companies located in Quebec 
at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless it was also consistent with their philosophy, with 
their ideology, having to do with property rights, patent rights 
and the right of people to exploit each other in the marketplace, 
which is one of their fundamental beliefs.  They did not hide 
behind any agreement although there was some suspicion at the 
time that they were setting the stage for the Canada-U.S. free 
trade agreement, that in effect it was some form of laying the 
groundwork for that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving that aside, at least they were acting on the up and up, 
so to speak.  In 1987 when they did this, and of course during 
the free trade agreement in 1988 and even leading up to and 
including the debate on NAFTA, we had many crocodile tears from 
Liberals, crocodile tears of opposition to what the Conservatives 
were doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the Liberals went on to sign the NAFTA.  They went on to 
join the WTO and to be part of a system which now enforces the 
very thing they said they were against in 1987 when the Tories 
first moved to get rid of our generic drug laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a kind of political monoculture in which the power of 
property and the power of corporations are ultimate.  Whatever 
they want they seem to get.  It has been particularly tragic for 
our health care system.  As the member for Winnipeg North Centre 
has pointed out time and time again, the price of drugs has gone 
up some 100% in the last decade or so.  This what is breaking our 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other stresses on our health care system: the 
demographic situation, the development of new technologies and 
the development of higher expectations.  All kinds of things are 
putting pressure on our health care system, but it is very clear 
that the price of drugs is one of the main stresses on our 
system, so much so that it not only stresses the system but it 
changes the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons people are being sent home earlier from 
hospital is that the hospitals do not want to pick up the cost of 
drugs.  As soon as they go home they are on their own.  They may 
have some kind of provincial or private plan or they may not, or 
it may not be a very good plan.  Both the system itself is being 
stressed by the high price of drugs and people themselves are 
being stressed economically and psychologically by the high price 
of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars.  We are 
really not talking about virtue when we think that the same drug 
companies the member for New Brunswick Southwest rose to defend 
were trying to hold out for their right to make hundreds of 
millions of dollars on drugs that treat AIDS.  They wanted to be 
paid in Africa exactly what they were paid in a clinic in 
downtown Toronto for those drugs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They have finally backed off, but did they back off out of the 
goodness of their hearts or did they back off because it was a 
public relations disaster?  I guess in the end, at one level 
anyway, it does not really matter.  The fact is they backed off 
and perhaps we will be able to get some of those life saving 
drugs to the people in Africa who need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a much smaller scale that reality plays itself out across the 
world, even in the industrialized world and with respect to 
diseases other than AIDS.  We have a system which puts the 
profits of these companies foremost in the minds of public policy 
makers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is that this leads to more research, which leads to 
newer drugs, et cetera, but I am not convinced that in order to 
get the kind of research we want in the development of newer more 
effective drugs, something of which we are all in favour, we need 
the kind of regime that is now in place through the WTO and to 
which the bill is responding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much opposed to the regime that has been set up at 
the WTO through what is called the TRIPS agreement.  That is one 
of the acronyms we find in WTO negotiations and discussions about 
the WTO.  TRIPS means trade related intellectual property and is 
one of the tables at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be further attempts to exploit the kind of knowledge 
that people arrive at through research to patent things that in 
our judgment should not be patented.  The unfortunate part of the 
debate is that there has not been enough opportunity to go into 
the ways in which that will happen.  The drug patenting system is 
a foreshadowing of what the multinational corporations would like 
to do in a whole lot of other areas, particularly with respect to 
biotechnology, gene therapy, et cetera.  What we have in the 
patenting of drugs is a paradigm or a model for what they would 
like to see happen with respect to a whole lot of other 
treatments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met not so long ago with some people in the medical community 
in Winnipeg who were very concerned, and they have written to the 
Minister of Health about it, that once various gene therapies 
have become patented they will not only be bad in principle, to 
the extent that I do not think these kinds of things should be 
patented, but may also again drive up the cost of health care in 
Canada.  To the extent these therapies become more and more 
accepted as ways of treating certain conditions, if it is the 
case that every time it is used in a Canadian hospital some kind 
of royalty has to be paid to a multinational corporation, that in 
itself will drive up the cost of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some related issues which we have not had a chance to 
debate as much as we would have liked.  The government is intent 
on getting the legislation through.  We understand that; there is 
a deadline it has to meet.  Is it not interesting that we as a 
parliament, a sovereign parliament, are having to do certain 
things that are required of us by the WTO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really what many people are concerned about.  They are 
concerned about the fact that what once would have been a matter 
of national public policy making, what once would have been a 
matter of domestic decision making, what once would have been a 
matter for the Canadian parliament to decide, is now a matter for 
the WTO to decide.  It is now a matter for unelected trade 
bureaucrats and trade lawyers to decide.  It is now a matter for 
them to decide on the basis of rules designed by and for the 
multinational corporations to protect their investments and to 
protect their profit strategies. 
We cannot figure out what is democratic about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my colleagues on the right, both in the 
Conservative Party and in the Alliance.  They sometimes talk 
about the way they do not like the power of parliament being 
usurped by the courts.  They are very concerned about the power 
of parliament being eroded.  Yet they do not seem concerned at 
all with the power of parliament being usurped and eroded by 
international global and regional trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  Why is there a double standard when it comes to 
the loss of parliament's power?  I would like that to be 
explained to me some day by my colleagues on the right.  Why are 
they so eager to support the Liberals in their abdication of 
their power through their complicity in the WTO, NAFTA, the MAI 
had it passed, and the GATS discussions coming at the WTO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are governments around the world, some unwillingly but 
apparently willing when it comes to Liberal, Conservative and 
Alliance members in Canada, so willing to give up their power? 
What kind of sickness is this that makes governments and 
political parties that ostensibly want to be able to act in the 
public interest or on behalf of the common good so eager to 
embrace self-inflicted powerlessness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be one of the things that many theses will be written 
about in years to come.  What caused this?  What kind of 
intellectual virus inhabited the brains of many politicians in 
the late 1980s and 1990s of the 20th century and in the early 
part of the 21st century and caused them to willingly give up the 
role and the trust that had been granted them by their electors 
and turn them over to unelected people who were making decisions 
based not on what is in the interests of health, the public or 
the environment but on what constitutes a barrier to trade, a 
barrier to investment or a barrier profit, as if it were the 
ultimate measure of all things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP do not think trade is the measure of all things. 
We believe the measure of all things is what contributes to the 
health and well-being of Canadians and people all around the 
world.  We find ourselves very much at odds with all four parties 
in the House.  We look forward to the final vote on the 
legislation so that it will be very clear where we stand and 
where others stand on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the debate.  I think members on 
both sides have taken the opportunity to express their views with 
respect to how this piece of legislation does work, will work and 
ought to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little disappointed that I did not get a chance to 
intervene when my colleague from the Conservative Party spoke a 
few moments ago.  Again, as in the discussions the other day, he 
made allegations that were personal in nature but steered away 
from the importance of discussing the issue itself.  The member 
who just spoke is from Edmonton Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  Winnipeg, the hotbed of reform.  I 
think it is just outside Toronto.  The member raised a couple of 
very important questions which I think deserve our attention. 
First, from a philosophical point of view there is some 
disagreement. Second, I am not sure it is very productive or 
useful to discuss the issue of battles that have been fought and 
lost, as we cannot redo those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue I wanted the member to raise and wondered whether he 
would address himself to it was his perception of the material 
impact of the maintenance of the regulations under Bill S-17 with 
which he appears to disagree so wholeheartedly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of maintaining a discussion that is factual and 
has something to do with the health care system and the health of 
Canadians, would he be substantive enough to give us an 
indication of the specifics about how that would work or would 
not work.  Otherwise, we are left to assume that there is nothing 
wrong with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has spoken with 
his usual precision and has left me wondering exactly what he 
might have been asking me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly understand why he does not want to talk about 
battles fought and lost.  I thought the Liberals won the election 
in 1993.  They won it on the basis presumably that Canadians 
liked some of the positions they had taken prior to 1993.  This 
is another case of self-inflicted powerlessness.  Even when the 
Liberals won the election, they thought they had lost, unless of 
course the member is referring to the fact that we lost.  We all 
lost.  Everyone who thought the Liberals were telling the truth 
prior to 1993 lost.  In that sense we did not lose because we 
never believed them in the first place.  We knew that there was a 
convergence behind closed doors on Bay Street and other places 
between the Liberal and Conservative Parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were the member from Eglinton-Toronto or Toronto-Eglinton, 
at least I got the words right, it would not take much for the 
rest of us in Canada to know more about Toronto than the member 
from Toronto knows about the rest of us.  He cannot even get 
Edmonton and Winnipeg straight for heaven's sake.  It is all just 
west of the Ontario border as far as he is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe:</B>  West of the 427. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  West of the 427, Mr. Speaker.  That is 
what the people in Thunder Bay say too.  People living in Thunder 
Bay, Kenora, Rainy River or Fort Francis all feel like they might 
as well be in Winnipeg.  A long time ago, if we had drawn the 
boundaries of this country properly, they would have had the 
benefit of being part of the great province of Manitoba instead 
of being a neglected hinterland of metropolitan Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  We are straying away 
somewhat from the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will go back to what I 
said about self-inflicted powerlessness or this deep political 
pathology that so affects the Liberal collective mind.  They 
signed agreements which make them do things that they used to be 
against.  Months and years hence they say they have to respect 
their international obligations.  How did they come to have these 
obligations?  They came to have the obligations because they 
signed agreements in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member might want to seek out therapy or something as to why 
he finds this to be an acceptable form of political 
consciousness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an important debate and I would 
like to make a comment, because I believe that much has been said 
that actually gives the wrong impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not questioning the motivation.  However, I question the 
ideology of the member of the NDP who denies the reality that 
Canada is a trading nation and that we benefit from fair, good 
and clear rules.  Trade creates an enormous number of jobs in 
Canada.  Without jobs and prosperity overall we do not have good 
health.  We know that unless people have the opportunity to work 
and no matter how many pills they take, their health status will 
not be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been one who has supported fair trade rules and as 
open and free trade as possible.  I have been critical of trade 
agreements in the past that I did not believe provided good and 
fair access to markets.  However, if the member were being 
realistic, he would know that the World Trade Organization and 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade has benefited all 
Canadians.  We have seen our economy grow and prosper as a result 
of those trade agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the member to bring his thinking into the 21st 
century and realize how important trade is to all Canadians and 
to our prosperity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is part of the big 
lie, that because we do not like the WTO or the NAFTA we are 
somehow against trade.  Of course we are not against trade.  We 
realize that Canada is a trading nation, and we are in favour of 
multilateral trade rules that set up regimes that make fair trade 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister who spoke talked about fair trade.  The fact is we 
do not have fair trade agreements.  We have free trade 
agreements.  She said she was critical of certain agreements in 
the past that did not provide for fair trade.  I wish she would 
have named them because had she done that they probably would 
have been agreements still in force that her own government 
signed, like the NAFTA.  I notice when she listed particular 
regimes she did not list the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone can be for global trade without having to be for these 
agreements.  It is an intellectually dishonest argument to 
constantly paint people who do not like the multilateral rules 
that we have now, which are designed by and for the multinational 
corporations, as people who do not like or are against trade.  We 
are not against trade. We are for fair trade and not free trade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
have been numerous comments certainly from the member from the 
Conservatives and from across the way with regard to the 
agreements.  I have a couple of comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona will remember back to this 
time.  He may not remember the exact words and my guess is he may 
not remember from which party the comments came.  As we are 
seeing today, it is not a matter of a different position from the 
Conservatives or the Liberals, it is a matter of the same 
position given at different points depending on whether they are 
in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
said in 1992 when he was in opposition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking Canadian consumers to pay roughly $4 billion more 
in drug costs in the next 20 years in exchange for $150 million 
in research and development.  Can you imagine, what kind of 
negotiator I would have been in my previous life if I came back 
to the membership that I used to represent and gave them those 
numbers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Minister of Industry made this comment about the 
government when in opposition.  I would like the member's 
thoughts on this because I know he was in the House the time.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member and all those members who at some time, 
when they screw up their backbones and the courage to do it, have 
to go back and face their constituents:  Are they really serious 
when they say that they expect the sick, the poor, the elderly, 
and those who live on fixed incomes have to subsidize R and D in 
Canada? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, such was the Liberal's 
charade prior to 1993.  Shame on the Liberals for all the lies 
they told the Canadian people about their views on these 
subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  That is too far, Mr. Speaker.  The 
first time it was a lie.  Now it just a big lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  There is nothing unparliamentary about 
referring to lies that are told by collectivity.  It is only when 
individual members are accused of doing so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was remiss.  I could not count the time yesterday, so 
I did not have an opportunity to finish what I had said in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to ask the indulgence of the House to at least 
consider modernizing our thoughts on what the bill really means. 
I think we all agree that the bill is about ensuring it would 
comply with the WTO, but there is an opportunity to make it more 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I had an opportunity to intervene on this yesterday, a 
significant landmark ruling occurred in the United States with 
respect to the automatic injunction provision for Canada and the 
United States. 
I point out to members, Conservative, Bloc, Alliance and of 
course Liberals and New Democrats, that the automatic injunction 
gives a de facto extension of patent protection beyond 20 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the hon. member from the Conservative Party shaking his 
head saying no.  Let me summarize what his senators said in the 
Senate just two months ago as they looked at Bill S-17.  It 
states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, it is the Committee's view that courts are fully 
capable of determining appropriate procedures, which should not 
differ substantially from one industry to another.  Regulatory 
interference carries a risk that an unfair advantage may 
inadvertently be provided to one side or the other. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern therefore is well-founded, not only on the wisdom of 
the Senate of the other place, but also in the landmark ruling of 
the U.S. federal court yesterday on the question of patent 
infringement, bearing in mind there are only two countries that 
have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patent infringement claims were made by AstraZeneca PLC, 
Europe's largest drug maker, with respect to a product known as 
Prilosac, the largest selling drug item in the United States of 
America and in Canada.  In Canada the drug is known as Losec. The 
same issue occurred here where the same individuals tried to 
stall this very important product beyond the patent protection 
period.  It is very clear, with sales of $340 million a month, 
why the drug industry wants to maintain its stranglehold even 
beyond the agreed 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members, especially in the Conservative Party, I think fail to 
understand that what they are giving licence to here in 
regulation is well beyond anything that was intended by this 
parliament.  They can go back and talk about what happened 10 or 
15 years ago, but I think the people are asking us to address the 
current problem for which there is no obligation for Canada to go 
beyond the 20th year.  The effect of this is not only a means of 
destroying due process, but it is disrespectful of the courts of 
this country.  It confers a privilege that is available nowhere 
else in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is we have a situation that we must knock out.  It 
is called the automatic injunction.  My belief is, and I think 
the belief of those who have looked at this, that there was an 
opportunity to deal with this.  Unfortunately, I would ask the 
hon. members to consider the millions of dollars that it is 
costing the provincial drug plans of their Conservative, Liberal 
and New Democratic governments across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, there are a few issues that have come up as a 
result of the comments made by the member for New Brunswick 
Southwest.  I will not answer all of them, but it is important 
for us to also consider the flawed and false methodologies of the 
Patented Medicine Prices Review Board of Canada.  To suggest that 
$900 million in research and development should justify these 
extended patents is simply wrong.  More than half that money is 
nothing more than advertising.  There is a push today to make 
sure that people get even more advertising from these drug 
companies to create the kind of chaos we see in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was trying to intervene the member for New Brunswick Southwest 
on the fundamental question he raised with respect to the price 
difference between Canada and the United States.  It is very 
clear to me that the only difference between Canadian new drugs 
and drugs being brought in from the United States is the 40% 
exchange rate.  We do not even have a brand name manufacturer 
giving us the courtesy of establishing a head office here in 
Canada to give us the kind of benefits we normally see.  Instead, 
we see ourselves in a situation where we are paying the highest 
prices in the world without the privilege of having anything more 
than a few warehouses on the island in Montreal and in 
Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the hon. members, certainly in the 
Conservative Party, but others who lost the opportunity and did 
not see it, there is a chance to change this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let us deal with the issue of AIDS in South Africa. 
There is an opportunity here for us to return to compulsory 
licensing.  I ask the indulgence of members of parliament to 
consider that.  There is a pandemic occurring in the world and it 
is very clear that the brand name manufacturers have egg on their 
faces because they are more willing to be concerned about what 
goes in their pockets as opposed to helping the people who are 
dying and suffering and where an entire civilization is breaking 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members wake up on this one.  I urge and implore all 
members to get together and protect the health care system in the 
country.  We have three months to get it together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not question the Liberal member's sincerity on this 
matter, but I have to say we are having a heck of a lot of 
difficulty stomaching this kind of policy from the Liberals of 
the House. 
A couple of members have suggested that the Liberal position is 
otherwise.  We are dealing with a Liberal government decision to 
bypass its own promises made to the Canadian people.  We are 
dealing with a government that has had ample opportunity to 
correct the situation and deal with such matters as the 
elimination of the automatic injunction that gives patent drug 
companies another two years of protection on top of the twenty 
years they now get. We are talking about a Liberal government 
that promised the Canadian people a national pharmacare plan and 
has done nothing since.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing for the member to stand up in the House and be a 
maverick but it is another to work steadfastly to try to convince 
his own colleagues to change the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did he do in 1998 to stop the Minister of Industry from 
bringing in notice of compliance regulations that actually made 
the situation with respect to the automatic injunction worse? 
What has the member done to convince his colleagues to implement 
their campaign promise of 1997 of a national drug plan, which 
would help today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member turned 
the clock back four years, she would remember that it was only I 
who put forward a motion before the scrutiny of regulations 
committee to basically strip the Patent Act, or Bill C-91 as it 
was then known, of all of its offensive notice of compliance 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not lost on some members on this side of the House.  It 
was certainly not lost on the then leader of the opposition, the 
hon. Lucien Bouchard, who lambasted and insulted our government 
by saying that it was a humiliation to Quebec that the cost of 
drugs would be so high but that instead it would be able to get a 
few investments from various companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the hon. member's concern about my acting like 
a maverick, I can tell her that rather than simply talking about 
things, I have acted.  These are perhaps some of the reasons why 
I quite willingly talk about issues when I see that consumers are 
being badly hurt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not required to do anything more than what its 
international obligations are under the WTO.  The battle between 
generic manufacturers and brand name manufacturers has divided 
members of parliament depending on whether they have brand name 
or generic companies in their riding.  However, that battle is 
over.  Incidentally, I have two brand name manufacturers in my 
riding so I am not speaking from the perspective of those who 
might think that it is because I favour generic manufacturers. 
People within my own party thought the reason I was concerned 
about this issue was that I had a generic manufacturer in my 
riding.  I can assure the hon. member that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put a motion before the House of Commons with regard to the 
issue of automatic injunctions and I thank my colleague from 
Churchill for supporting me.  Unfortunately, I could not convince 
members of other parties to join with me but I am still fighting 
as hard as I can.  I have been alone before but I know I have a 
lot of company with thousands of Canadians who today cannot 
afford the decent medical care they deserve because the cost of 
drugs is so high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the question of pharmacare, I believe if we 
cannot resolve this issue and we are not prepared to stand up to 
the multinational drug manufacturers in Canada, the Government of 
Canada will need to come down and put its money where its mouth 
is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know the member wanted to express a greater view on 
what the net effect of some of the regulations might be in other 
areas of the world.  I took particular interest in his discussion 
of the sub-Saharan AIDS epidemic and the impact that some of the 
companies here might be able to have on that were they given the 
tools to do it.  I wonder if the member could comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there have been ways in 
which we can neuter the offensive section on automatic 
injunctions.  We can repeal section 55.2(4) of the Patent Act to 
achieve that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the member's question dealing with the AIDS 
epidemic in Africa, Canadian drug manufacturers, particularly 
generic drug manufacturers, could provide a solution in terms of 
the cocktail of drugs that might be made available.  However 
there are very few of these manufacturers because they are dying, 
seemingly by the day.  Some are doing very well but most are 
either being purchased or are not increasing their viability. 
I have met with Médecins Sans Frontières and Oxfam on this issue. 
They believe they can do it in concert with the minister 
responsible for CIDA as well as with the co-operation of the 
government.  I believe we are heading in that direction.

<A NAME="LINK32">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-25, an act to 
amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, as reported (without amendment) from 
the committee.

<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before we begin debate there is a 
ruling that I must render.  There are three motions in amendment 
standing on the notice paper for the report stage of Bill C-25, 
an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 1 to 3 will be grouped for debate and voted on 
separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before putting the motions to the House I wonder if I might call 
upon the member for Crowfoot to seek consent to move the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  There have been 
consultations among all parties present and I think that you 
would find unanimous consent of the House to have the report 
stage motions in the name of the member for Cypress 
Hills-Grasslands transferred to the name of the hon. member for 
Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, again it is a privilege to stand in the 
House to debate some amendments to Bill C-25, an act to amend the 
Farm Credit Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my privilege to attend committee meetings and to hear the 
witnesses.  We were fairly apprehensive as we went into the 
exercise of looking at Bill C-25.  After the committee meetings 
we were even more apprehensive and maybe more concerned about 
some of the legislation that was being brought forward in this 
change. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment is designed to address one of our party's 
most serious concerns about Bill C-25, that the corporation would 
lose its focus of providing service to farmers because of its 
involvement in off farm businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern of the Canadian Alliance and other members is that 
the Farm Credit Corporation would move away from being directly 
involved to the extent it is now in the family farm into a new 
realm that is currently controlled or benefited by other 
corporations.  Consequently we believe the legislation would 
allow the Farm Credit Corporation to fund, help and provide 
service to larger businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the current wording of the bill, the FCC could loan 
money to any agricultural business no matter how large or 
lucrative.  For example, if an application were made by the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool to the government, the government could 
conclude that the FCC could help with the financial requirements 
the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool would be after.  The amendment would 
ensure that any services offered to non-farm operations would 
only be given to small and medium size businesses and not to 
large corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee the FCC and government officials said they would 
have no reason to fund the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.  That would 
move beyond the FCC's mandate.  However the legislation as it is 
would not limit or prevent that from happening.  If that 
financing began to happen we would soon see that the family farm 
would be put on the back burner and would lose another 
opportunity for funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment is designed to ensure that the federal 
government does not actively compete with private financial 
institutions, banks or credit unions.  One of the interesting 
facts that came out of our committee meeting was from 
representatives of Canadian credit unions.  They made very clear 
that in a number of instances the Farm Credit Corporation was 
directly competing for business the credit unions had already 
had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one instance the Farm Credit Corporation after hearing what 
interest rate percentages the credit union was offering competed 
by lowering its interest rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Competition is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Competition is good.  I hear the 
Liberals questioning and heckling about competition.  We love 
competition and a competitive economy, but businesses do not want 
to compete with the federal government.  They do not want to 
compete with their own tax dollars.  They do not want to compete 
directly with a federal corporation or institution in which they 
have put tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned that the expanding powers of the FCC would 
simply duplicate the existing authority of other public financial 
institutions such as the Business Development Bank.  The Business 
Development Bank, which realistically does not have a great track 
record, would then perhaps move out of areas dealing with 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that Farm Credit Corporation would simply deal 
with agriculture and not the farm.  Its name is to be changed to 
Farm Credit Canada.  Maybe it should just be changed to 
agriculture because they have forgotten the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment would ensure that FCC's new powers do not 
duplicate the authority problem that is currently present in the 
Business Development Bank.  We are also very concerned about one 
aspect which we brought to committee and which the hon. member 
for Cypress Hills—Grasslands raised in the House on a number of 
occasions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that Bill C-25 will allow Farm Credit 
Corporation or Farm Credit Canada to become a significant land 
holder.  The amendment is designed to ensure that the federal 
government does not become a major holder of Canadian farmland. 
By so doing it would not influence the market price of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would agree on all sides of the House that we have 
seen places and times in Saskatchewan when there was a great land 
bank.  The government owned land that had been turned back to it. 
We want to see changes that would prohibit the owning of farmland 
by the government, thus influencing the market value of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concerns on this subject were increased during the clause by 
clause debate in committee.  The chairman of FCC indicated that 
it could consider taking possession of land in the government's 
yet to be announced plans to facilitate intergenerational 
transfer of farmland.  FCC and the government should have no 
objections to this motion because the FCC has stated in testimony 
before the committee that it was not its intention to become land 
holders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen time and time again that intentions may be the 
best, but obviously sometimes legislation allows for loopholes or 
just the opposite.  Farm Credit has also testified that it works 
to ensure that land is sold at prevailing market prices and that 
FCC does not influence land values.  All members of the House, 
even those on the other side, believe that the longer a federal 
government corporation holds on to land it will not sell it for 
this price because it has money vested in it.  As long as that 
happens it will influence the value of that land on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 is similar to an amendment we brought forward at 
committee.  With the consideration and the wisdom of the House I 
believe that all three amendments and recommendations will be 
accepted. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am hugely pleased to speak today in the context of 
Bill C-25, an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to announce to my colleague in the Canadian 
Alliance that the Bloc Quebecois will support the three 
amendments he has proposed. Both the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Canadian Alliance tried everything in their power, while the 
committee was studying the bill clause by clause, to propose 
amendments.  In some instances, the Canadian Alliance presented 
an amendment similar to our own, and we withdrew ours in order to 
debate theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we had the annoying experience of running headlong 
into an arrogant government, and an even more arrogant head of 
the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noted that, basically, we were coming to parliament, but the 
die had already been cast.  The members can take that as they 
will, that is their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came here to legislate what the board of the Farm Credit 
Corporation had already decided. So much so that, at one point, 
the Bloc Quebecois had proposed an amendment to limit loans to $1 
million.  In discussions, we went as far as $5 million; actually, 
FCC loans should not exceed $5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members will be very interested to learn that the head of 
the Farm Credit Corporation said “There is no point your 
introducing this amendment, my board of directors has already 
decided that the maximum loan would be $20 million”.  Of course, 
we looked completely silly wanting to limit loans to $1 million 
or $5 million, when they had already decided they could lend up 
to $20 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that the Farm Credit Corporation wants to change its 
mission. 
Until now, the Farm Credit Corporation had been helping primary 
producers. It tried to help businesses which, very often, had not 
been able to get loans from traditional financial institutions. 
The FCC was there for the small farmer, the family farm that had 
problems making it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the Farm Credit Corporation will have a new name. It will 
be called Farm Credit Canada. It is intended that this new 
corporation will lend up to $20 million. It remains to be seen to 
whom that money will be lent. This suggests that we could have 
unpleasant surprises, because the Farm Credit Corporation could 
end up funding businesses that are either upstream or downstream 
in relation to traditional farm production and to traditional 
small farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the figures that we were given, currently, 94% of 
the corporation's loans are made to primary types of farm 
productions. We wanted to put it in the act that we were giving 
them a chance. We said that at least 80% of the loans should be 
made to primary farm productions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are truly concerned that the Farm Credit Corporation will 
fund mega-industries. When we look at how this government is 
behaving, that concern is justified. Since the past is indicative 
of the future, we are justified in being concerned by the 
government's action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government told us “We held consultations in Quebec. 
Everyone in Quebec agrees with this”. Everyone in Quebec was 
opposed to Bill C-7, but it did not stop the government, which is 
now telling us that “Everyone in Quebec agrees with us. They all 
agree with the Farm Credit Corporation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We contacted the UPA, or Union des producteurs agricoles du 
Québec. In a press release—not written by the Bloc Quebecois, but 
by the UPA—the union said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reservations about the Farm Credit Corporation 
broadening its current mandate to include the funding of 
non-farming businesses that are not majority owned by farmers and 
to provide venture capital to businesses related to agriculture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the UPA's position, not what we were told, which was 
that the UPA was in complete agreement with the government's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went further in my quest to check out what I was told.  I 
always make a point of checking things out.  The Fédération des 
caisses populaires Desjardins du Québec also told us it had 
reservations about the Farm Credit Corporation broadening its 
mandate to include companies upstream and downstream of 
agricultural production.  In the lower St. Lawrence region prior 
to 1998, the corporation was not very present and it existed 
alongside the Société de financement agricole du Québec and the 
financial institutions present in the lower St. Lawrence region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the corporation's interest rates were higher, credit 
conditions were more stringent, and the Farm Credit Corporation 
was less aggressive on the regional market. In those days, the 
Farm Credit Corporation was an alternative for farmers when they 
were turned down for a loan by the financial institutions or the 
Société de financement agricole du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1998, the situation has changed completely.  It must be 
remembered that, when the Farm Credit Corporation lends money, it 
gets it out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers; this is the 
public's money.  The corporation takes this money and engages in 
unfair competition with caisses populaires and financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Farm Credit Corporation do?  It sends its 
officials out to the 5th, 6th or 7th concession to visit farms. 
They knock on doors and ask “You wouldn't happen to need any 
money, would you?”  No longer need a farmer go and visit the 
banking institution.  Now the banking institution leaves Ottawa 
and heads for the best farms in Quebec.  They are hard to miss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They find the best, most productive farms, knock on the door and 
ask “Could we by any chance lend you some money?  Do you happen 
to need any?  We will give you a great deal.  We will lend it to 
you at at least 0.5% less than any other financial institution”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the City of Laval, they even went so far as to make a loan at 
1.5% under the going rate; in Nicolet, for some loans the rate 
given was 1.1% under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are told that people in the financial institutions are 
satisfied, it remains to see what the banks have to say.  The 
banks submitted a brief to the Standing Committee on Agriculture 
and Agri-Food in which they stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's banks are in favour of competition in the marketplace 
by institutions that are all subject to the same regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, however, of the opinion that government agencies such as 
the Farm Credit Corporation, which operate thanks to government 
support and are not subject to the whole range of prudent 
regulatory requirements, ought not to be mandated to be in direct 
competition with private sector financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a mandate falsifies market competition by enabling such 
suppliers of services to carry out activities under conditions 
that are not only different but less stringent than those 
applied to others in the same field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a bill that is extremely dangerous for the 
financial institutions of Quebec and Canada. This will be an 
institution, an agency, in unfair competition with the financial 
institutions, which are governed by very, very strict rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, although we in the Bloc Quebecois will support the 
Canadian Alliance amendments, we are unfortunately obliged to not 
support the government in the passage of Bill C-25. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I seek unanimous consent of the House to introduce a 
motion, seconded by the member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley, that the House of Commons resolves that Nelson 
Mandela be declared an honorary citizen of Canada and that a 
message be sent to the Senate requesting that house concur in 
this resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have consent of 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate this afternoon to make 
amendments to the proposed changes to the Farm Credit Corporation 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Canadians will know that the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has been considering this legislation 
over the past short while.  We have heard from some of the groups 
that would be affected by the legislation.  In opposition to what 
we have heard in the last two speeches, the New Democratic Party 
caucus does not have major concerns with what has been proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation was established in 1959.  Although 
it was originally the lender of last resort to family farms, that 
role has changed over the years.  Probably most of those changes 
were introduced after 1993 when it became a self-financing 
operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry has been changing dramatically since the act was 
amended.  There are active farmers in the House of Commons today 
who can attest to that only too well.  There is an ongoing 
revolution in Canadian agriculture and perhaps around the world. 
It is more complex.  There is much greater interdependency among 
suppliers, producers and processors than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers are growing new crops.  In the standing committee this 
morning we had a lengthy debate on organic crops that have been 
multiplying enormously over the past 15 years or 16 years.  They 
are growing new crops.  They are diversifying into livestock 
production. 
They are entering into long term contracts with suppliers and 
buyers.  Farmers are forming alliances to increase their 
purchasing and selling power.  These are called new generation 
co-ops among other things.  Some producers are exploring new 
generation co-ops and others are expanding into value added 
manufacturing.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this environment producers need a broader and more complex 
range of financial and business management services to help them 
achieve the long term success they are striving for.  Farm 
related businesses need greater access to capital, including 
equity and venture capital in order to achieve that growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the winter of 2000 the standing committee was told by the 
chief executive officer and other senior officials of Farm Credit 
that they had held a number of stakeholder consultations with 
more than 100 national and regional organizations to discuss the 
proposed changes to the legislation.  Almost all those 
organizations, we were told, were supportive of the amendment. 
Their main concern was that Farm Credit Corporation should 
continue to maintain its focus on family farms and on primary 
production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that one farm organization which was strongly 
opposed was the National Farmers' Union.  The NFU's main 
objection, as we heard it and understood it, was that the 
proposal before us would allow the Farm Credit Corporation to 
finance farm related businesses which were not farmer owned and 
controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a significant piece of the proposed change to the 
legislation.  Until now it has had to demonstrate amply that it 
is farmer owned and controlled.  This change is one that the NFU 
believes would enable Farm Credit to act like a private lender 
with its only goal being that of maximizing its profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NFU believes that Farm Credit should focus only on family 
farms.  It is concerned that if Farm Credit is allowed to lend to 
agribusiness that is not farmer owned or controlled it will 
emphasize operations geared to the export market instead to 
domestic family farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have considered that point.  We listened carefully to people 
who made representations to the standing committee on 
agriculture.  Notwithstanding the concern expressed by the 
National Farmers Union, notwithstanding what my colleagues from 
the Bloc and perhaps the Alliance said, we think on balance the 
changes are warranted and support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the Alliance recommendations, there is a name 
change.  The acronym FCC would be the same but it would now be 
called Farm Credit Canada.  Farm Credit Canada would be allowed 
to provide financial services to farm related business on the 
input or output side of primary production.  For the first time 
FCC would be able to lend money to non-farmers.  That is a change 
as I mentioned a moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, equity financing would be extended to producers and 
farm related businesses either directly or in partnership with 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  That is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Yes, I think it is a good idea.  This 
financing would be aimed mainly at new businesses on a venture 
basis.  There would be a statutory limit on the percentage Farm 
Credit Canada would be able to take.  There would also be a fixed 
date by which the FCC would be required to sell its share back to 
the majority owners of the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm Credit Canada would be able to offer a range of business 
management services to producers across the country either 
directly or in partnership.  These consulting and support 
services would include business and financial planning, risk 
management, succession and estate planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC's ability to offer lease financing directly or in 
partnership with agriculture producers would be clarified. Farm 
Credit Canada would be able to create subsidiaries to enter into 
partnerships with other organizations and offer expanded 
financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just on that point, we heard from the Credit Union of Canada. It 
was generally supportive of the legislation.  We heard a 
different approach from the Bloc member about caisses populaires, 
and perhaps it was true, but the Credit Union of Canada 
represents caisses populaires, as I understand it, and was 
generally supportive of the provisions contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation would also have access to additional financial 
management tools to secure its portfolio and fund additional 
services.  Overall the changes are positive so long as Farm 
Credit Canada continues to focus on primary production.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that those who came before the committee were 
largely supportive.  Let me read into the record a couple of 
their comments.  The Canadian Federation of Agriculture said it 
had no objections to the legislation.  The Credit Union of 
Canada, to which I referred a minute ago, said it had formed a 
committee to study the legislation.  During the consultation 
process it fully supported the proposals as long as credit unions 
could participate in some of the new services, equity financing 
and partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the NFU is concerned that Farm Credit Canada will 
soften its focus on family farms and primary production, the 
government and Farm Credit have made a commitment that farming 
and the primary producer would continue to be the main focus of 
the corporation's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that 94% of Farm Credit Canada's lending is 
directed to primary producers.  An amendment to the act requires 
that the primary focus of the activities of the corporation shall 
be on family operations including family farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to the recommendations before us today.  There are 
three from the Alliance.  One is on family farms.  The Alliance 
amendment, as we understand it, would remove the references to 
family farms.  We believe it is important that a reference to 
family farms be maintained in the definition of the corporation's 
purpose and primary focus.  Therefore we oppose Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 2 the Alliance remains consistent in opposing any 
FCC financial services that it feels might compete with the 
private sector.  We heard the member for Crowfoot on that point a 
few moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion this would be detrimental to the agricultural 
community.  A number of private lending institutions in rural 
Canada have recently gone out of business.  Some of them have 
been taken over by smaller credit unions, at least their work and 
their mandate.  There is not a lot of competition out there. 
There is not a lot of choice for farmers to secure a loan.  We 
oppose Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also oppose Motion No. 3.  The Alliance was concerned that 
FCC could acquire large blocks of land through acquisition, which 
would be harmful for private enterprise.  John Ryan, the very 
well respected president and CEO of Farm Credit Canada, responded 
directly to the concern at committee by stating that it was not 
the corporation's intention to acquire blocks of land or be in 
the land management or land banking business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also noted that young farmers in Canada suggested that as 
long as there was this kind of leasing arrangement there would be 
an opportunity for intergenerational transfer and for new farmers 
to get on the land.  We support the bill and we oppose the three 
Alliance recommendations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak specifically to the three amendments to Bill 
C-25 proposed by the Canadian Alliance Party.  I begin by saying 
that all three Alliance amendments before us today were discussed 
and debated at committee, as I understand it, and were changed 
slightly and brought back to the House.  Although the member of 
parliament for Cypress Hills—Grasslands has modified them 
slightly, he has not modified them enough to suit the member for 
Brandon—Souris, our agriculture critic, and therefore the tenets 
of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 would actually remove the words family farm from 
the bill, as was stated by my NDP colleague. Members 
of the House and people across Canada have different definitions 
of what a family farm actually constitutes, but our party 
believes it is important for family farms to be recognized 
specifically in the mandate of the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said at other times in the House that I grew up on a very 
small family farm.  The farm I actually own today is one piece of 
land.  It is a piece of woodland and not an actual piece of 
agricultural land.  It is a very small piece of only 20 acres, 
but it has been in my family for five generations.  My sons, if 
they inherit that property, would have that piece of land for a 
six generation.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those of us in the House who are not far away from the 
family farm.  I am quite shocked and surprised the Alliance that 
claims to represent large segments of rural Canada would allow 
itself to be divorced or separated from the notion of the family 
farm, which I think many of us hold very near and dear to our 
hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family farm and primary production should be the primary 
focus of the activities of the Farm Credit Corporation, not 
simply farming operations, agribusinesses or something that is 
divorced and removed from the word farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the next to go?  Will it be not just family farms but 
farming operations altogether?  Suddenly those of us who were 
farmers in another life will be not farmers any longer but 
producers.  I am very proud to say I was a farmer and expect to 
be a farmer again some day, not a producer which does not mean 
anything.  I could produce cardboard boxes.  A farmer is a 
definition that holds a totally different meaning from the word 
producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By eliminating family farms from the clause would definitely be 
a step backward.  It would actually do a disservice to family 
farms across Canada by omitting them from the bill.  Furthermore, 
as was mentioned already, John Ryan, president of the Farm Credit 
Corporation, stated in the standing committee that discussions 
were held with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture on the 
wording of the bill and ultimately it was satisfied.  He also 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we clearly do, very seriously, take the fact that it's primary 
production that's our focus. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with that being said, we will not be supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 speaks to the issue of competition.  I find it 
difficult to believe that the Alliance Party has actually 
introduced this amendment again.  The amendment is not only 
restrictive and limiting to Farm Credit Corporation activities 
but it speaks against the idea of competition.  Perhaps it is 
another policy shift for the Alliance Party and now it does not 
support open competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation should be allowed to compete with 
other financial institutions.  Competition is healthy.  The 
mandate of the FCC has been significantly expanded since its 
creation.  It is no longer a lender of last resort.  Nor should 
it be.  It has tailored its operations to the agriculture and 
agribusiness community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If commercial banks want to enter those areas, and I think we 
should encourage them to do so, they are welcome.  It is pretty 
difficult as a farmer to get any kind of serious loan from a 
commercial bank based on the merits of a farming operation.  The 
competition will only benefit farmers in the end.   Again the PC 
Party will not be supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 speaks to the issue of farmland ownership.  Once 
again this matter was discussed during committee deliberations. 
The amendment could place limitations on Farm Credit Corporation 
activities.  Let us take the example of young farmers and the 
opportunity for an intergenerational transfer of farms: for one 
to be able to acquire land directly from family members and lease 
it back to them over a long period of time so they can eventually 
acquire ownership.  The amendment could prevent it from happening 
if a time limit were imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Farm Credit Corporation stated in committee 
that he would be quite comfortable with a five year limit.  That 
was consistent with remarks he made at a previous committee 
meeting.  The average time for land disposal at the Farm Credit 
Corporation is actually about eight months, which allows for more 
than enough time set out in the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of what the president of the Farm Credit 
Corporation said, the PC Party will consider the passage of the 
amendment, but it is certainly one that we do not look at 
lightly.  We have deliberated on it and put some serious thought 
into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I urge all members of the House to remember that 
many of us in the agriculture business are representatives of 
family farms or people who are first, second, third, fourth, 
fifth, sixth generation, or even more, on family farms.  For 
goodness' sake, let us remember the family farm is an important 
institution and should be preserved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you very 
much for the opportunity to speak to the bill.  Farm Credit 
Corporation has been very successful across the country and it 
certainly looks forward to working even more for the benefit of 
the farmers and the primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to note that I was very glad to hear that 
at committee in the past week or two one of my colleagues from 
the Alliance Party put the fact on the table that the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food still has the reputation 
of getting along better for all the right reasons than any other 
committee, in support of farmers across the country.  I trust 
that we can work together in future in the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to Motion No. 1.  Farm Credit Corporation's 
proposed amendment in Bill C-25 is consistent with the current 
legislation, with the exception of the following add-on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary focus of the activities of the Corporation shall be 
on farming operations including family farms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm Credit Corporation held consultations on the future role of 
FCC with over 100 regional and national groups across the 
country, more than 100 farm and agribusiness organizations and 
all major financial organizations in each and every province, as 
well as institutions and provincial governments.  Over 400 
individuals participated in the consultation meetings across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, concerns were expressed that Farm Credit Corporation's 
focus could be diverted from the primary producer.  However the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture appeared before the House of 
Commons standing committee in regard to the bill.  The CFA 
represents some 220,000 Canadian family farms, many in your 
riding, Mr. Speaker.  The CFA asked that FCC maintain the focus 
on the primary producer.  That is what the bill would do. The 
CFA's exact words were: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that primary producers must always have the first 
priority in accessing FCC financing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the corporation continues to meet the needs of 
primary producers, FCC formulated the wording of the clause in 
collaboration with the CFA's board of directors.  The wording of 
the bill expresses the concerns of the CFA word for word.  Let me 
repeat that it is word for word.  The wording is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary focus of activities of the Corporation shall be on 
farming operations including family farms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>FCC recognizes the necessity of serving farm related businesses 
to benefit producers and rural communities.  The corporation's 
number one focus will continue to be primary production. 
Currently more than 90% of FCC's financing is directed to farming 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, 98% of farms are family owned 
and operated.  This means that the great majority of FCC services 
is directed to family farms and to farm families.  For this 
reason it is very important that the bill go forward with the 
wording as proposed by the FCC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the importance of the family farm for the social and 
economic fabric of rural Canada, the words family farm were 
specified in the legislation.  The government supports the new 
legislation as an important contribution to sustainable growth in 
rural Canada and recommends that Bill C-25 not be changed to 
remove the words family farms from the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one definition exists in common usage that clearly defines 
the levels of business enterprise.  The continued growth of the 
value added industry means that the definition of small and 
medium sized enterprises will continue to evolve.  FCC's role is 
to provide an environment for the growth of the agricultural 
industry to occur by continuing to meet the needs of the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FCC's lending limit established by the board of directors is 
currently $20 million and has been since 1995.  Limits such as 
these clearly indicate that all FCC loans will be to small and 
medium sized businesses related to agriculture.  It should also 
be noted that FCC's average mortgage loan size is $106,704 to 
primary producers and $498,909 to agribusiness clients.  The 
average non-mortgage loan size for personal property loans is 
$31,000 to primary producers and $42,000 to alliance clients. 
There are currently no plans to increase this lending limit.  In 
fact our emphasis has shifted over the past few years from doing 
full proposals on our own to joint financing with other 
institutions.  Therefore, the government supports the 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Motion No. 2, as introduced by the Canadian 
Alliance, it is too limiting.  I was glad to hear that my 
colleague from Palliser agreed.  More than 100 organizations 
across Canada also agreed.  We cannot agree to Motion No. 2 
because farming operations are growing more complex and the 
marketplace is more competitive.  In order to achieve long term 
success, producers and farm related businesses need access to a 
broader range of business management services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Services can be significantly different by geography, making it 
difficult to serve those who need a particular service not 
available from other institutions in any given area.  As a 
national organization, the FCC can dedicate its efforts to 
delivering services where services are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultation process, it was identified that there 
was a gap in business services in rural Canada.  Certainly we all 
agree with that.  The Canadian Young Farmers Forum 
enthusiastically endorsed FCC complimentary services on a fee 
basis, while several groups noted that the FCC does not provide 
services already being offered in the private sector.  As a 
result of this input, Bill C-25 states that the FCC's intent is 
to provide business services and products that complement those 
available from the public and the private sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business management services that the FCC proposes would 
complement existing services, not compete directly with other 
providers.  The FCC would work in partnership with existing 
service providers to increase access to business services through 
its network of 100 offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the strengths of the FCC is that most of the people who 
work with the farmers and the producers have a farming or a farm 
related background and do a great job across the country. The FCC 
only intends to offer business management services where a clear 
need is identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC would work in partnership with public and private sector 
organizations, wherever possible, to enhance the product and 
service offerings available to rural Canada.  The FCC has a 
memorandum of understanding with BDC and has 27 partnership 
agreements with public and private sector organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time, financing needs of producers and farm related 
businesses change quickly.  Private institutions respond to 
providing services based on the profitability of products which 
can change based on the number of clients in a particular area 
and the level of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not support Motion No. 2 because it is too 
limiting.  The government and I appreciate the hard work of all 
our colleagues from all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to be able to say that we will support Motion No. 3 
as moved by the Canadian Alliance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to speak on 
the amendments put forward by the Canadian Alliance to Bill C-25, 
an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-25, in Clause 5, be amended by adding after line 44 
on page 2 the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(f.4.1.) dispose of farmland acquired by it, provided that the 
disposal is at fair market value and is done as quickly as 
possible, and in any case no longer than five years, after the 
acquisition.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is concerned that Bill C-25 would allow 
the Farm Credit Corporation to become a significant landholder. 
We are seeing that especially in the province of Saskatchewan. 
The amendment is designed to ensure that the federal government 
does not become a major holder of Canadian farmland and does not 
unduly influence the market price of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to many farmers who have told me that the Farm 
Credit Corporation has had an effect on farmland prices.  The 
hon. parliamentary secretary can come to Saskatchewan and visit 
my riding to see the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  I have been there and it is a great

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is on the record 
that this committee has wonderful working relations.  We also 
tend to take pride in our own working relations in the House. The 
parliamentary secretary just had the floor and the House was very 
attentive.  I hope the same courtesy will be given to the member 
for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.  I would guide or a little bit 
by reminding her to make her interventions through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our concerns on this 
subject were increased during the clause by clause debate in 
committee.  The chairman of the FCC indicated that FCC could 
consider taking possession of land in the government's yet to be 
announced plans to facilitate the intergenerational transfer of 
farmland.  As a mother who has lost two sons from the farm, I am 
very concerned about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC and the government should have no objections to the 
motion because the FCC has stated, in testimony before the 
committee, that it is not FCC's intention to become a landholder. 
The FCC has also testified that it works to ensure that land is 
sold at prevailing market prices and that FCC does not influence 
land values.  I know in my own riding that it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-25, in Clause 5, be amended by replacing lines 32 and 
33 on page 2 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“that complement but do not directly compete with those 
available from the private sector, or that complement but do not 
duplicate those provided by other publicly owned institutions;” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is designed to ensure that the federal government 
does not actively compete with private financial institutions, 
such as credit unions and the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee review of Bill C-25, representatives of 
Canada's credit unions indicated that the Farm Credit Corporation 
currently actively competes for business.  I know it does in my 
own riding.  One witness testified that his credit union lost a 
customer because the FCC dropped its loan rate after learning of 
the rate offered by the credit union.  The expansion of the FCC's 
powers would make this active competitive behaviour much more 
likely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned that the expanded powers of the FCC would 
simply duplicate the existing authority of other public financial 
institutions ,such as the Business Development Bank which, as we 
all know, does not have a good track record.  The motion would 
ensure that the FCC's new powers would not duplicate the 
authority and problems of the BDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-25, in Clause 5, be amended by replacing lines 12 to 
18 on page 2, with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“services and products to farming operations and to those small 
and medium-sized businesses in rural Canada that are businesses 
related to farming.  The primary focus of the activities of the 
Corporation shall be on farming operations.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is designed to address one of our most serious 
concerns with Bill C-25; that the corporation could lose its 
focus on providing services to farmers because of its involvement 
in off-farm businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the current wording of the bill, the FCC could loan 
money to agriculture businesses, no matter how large or lucrative. 
For example, the Farm Credit Corporation could give a loan to the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool if the government concluded that this was 
the direction in which they wanted to go.  The motion would 
ensure that any services offered to non-farm operations would 
only be given to small and medium sized businesses and not large 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the FCC should not object to the motion 
because they have repeatedly stated that they have no interest in 
providing financial services to large corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members sitting opposite to look at our motions and, on 
behalf of the rural residents in my riding of 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, to respect our opinion as farm 
people from western Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by saying that all the motions before us today were 
introduced by the Canadian Alliance.  The member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands has modified them slightly but they are in 
essence the same motions that were presented during clause by 
clause study of the bill in committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 would remove the words “family farm” which are 
already in the bill.  I know members of the House and a lot of 
people across Canada have different definitions of what 
constitutes a family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not grow up on a farm but my family and I have a lot of 
friends living on farms.  I have to say that there are different 
definitions, as stated, of what constitutes a family farm.  The 
PC Party believes that it is important for family farms to be 
recognized specifically in the mandate of the FCC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the family farm and primary production that should be the 
primary focus of the FCC's activities, not simply farming 
operations in general terms.  By eliminating family farms from 
the clause, we strongly feel that it is a step backward and 
actually does a disservice to family farms across Canada. Not one 
of us would be sitting here today, not the young pages nor anyone 
else, if we did not have our farmers who produce the carrots, 
potatoes, vegetables, milk and meat that we need to survive. 
These are produced by our farmers and their families from 
generation to generation.  The farm is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the FCC stated in committee that discussions 
were held with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture on the 
wording of the bill and that ultimately the CFA was satisfied. 
He also said that the FCC took very seriously the fact that 
primary production was its focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the PC Party will not be supporting the motion. 
It is very important that family farms be referred to in the 
bill.  There is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went out west in 1993, I met with the Canadian Federation 
of Agriculture.  We had a discussion at that time that really 
shocked me.  Where I come from, a large city in the province of 
New Brunswick and the greatest city in the east, the farmers and 
the people are hurting.  When we forget about the family farm by 
removing it from the bill, we create a major problem.  That will 
only be the first change and, before we know it, the needs of the 
farmers will not be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 speaks to the issue of competition.  I find it 
rather difficult to believe that the Canadian Alliance has 
actually introduced this motion.  It is not only restrictive and 
limiting to the FCC's activities but it speaks against the idea 
of competition.  It is another Canadian Alliance policy shift. 
Now it seems it does not support open competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to have open competition because that is when we get the 
best prices.  The FCC should be allowed to compete with all other 
financial institutions.  Competition is healthy and no matter 
whether it is, farmers, car dealers or whatever is being sold, 
competition is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the FCC has been expanded since its creation and 
it is no longer a lender of last resort, nor should it be. 
It has tailored its operations to the agriculture and 
agribusiness community.

I have to say that the PC Party will therefore not be supporting 
this motion either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 speaks to the issue of farmland ownership.  Once 
again this matter was discussed during the committee's 
deliberations.  This amendment could place limitations on FCC 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the example of young farmers and the opportunity for 
an intergenerational transfer of farms.  It does not matter 
whether we live in rural areas or in cities, towns or villages. 
Parents who own their home, their car, a business or a lot want 
to leave them to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the farm is their home, their business.  That is 
the way it is.  They want to leave it to the family.  It is the 
family farm that they want to pass from generation to generation. 
This was discussed during the committee's deliberations.  This 
amendment would place limitations on that.  People should be 
allowed to acquire land directly from family members.  They would 
lease it over a long period of time and eventually acquire 
ownership.  If this amendment's time limit were imposed it could 
prevent this from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the president of the FCC stated in committee 
that he would be quite comfortable with a five year limit, which 
was consistent with the remarks he made at the previous committee 
meetings.  The average time for land disposal at the FCC is 
actually about eight months, which allows for more than enough 
time set out in this amendment.  The PC Party will support this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that if members take a look at FCC and how long it 
has been in place, they will see it has been there to work for 
the farmers, to make sure that the farmers are indeed viable and 
that their farms will be there for their children and for all of 
us.  We must bring forth legislation that is good for the 
farmers.  The farmers know what is good for them and when they 
say it is good for them, then it is good for us.  That is why we 
have to work with the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first 34 years of FCC and the Farm Credit Act there 
were many evolutions and many changes had to take place.  The 
farmers came forward and spoke about it.  I have to say that I 
have major concerns about these motions, as do my colleagues and 
my colleague who sits on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues in the PC Party I want to state that 
we are addressing these concerns.  We hope the House will take 
our concerns under advisement.  Perhaps there will be amendments 
so that we can support all the motions, but as it stands now we 
cannot do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened to the various members speak on the bill, some of 
them extremely familiar with the farming sector, and some not so 
much, but who do have a concern for the principle of providing 
funds to those who need funds in a way that will enable them to 
continue to work and make a living and to hold on, in a lot of 
cases, to the property they own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own case I cannot claim to be familiar with the farming 
area to any great extent, although certainly in my district we do 
have farms, despite what people think about the province of 
Newfoundland.  A lot of people think it is a rock because it is 
referred to as The Rock, but it is a very big island, as we all 
know, and there are many very fertile areas on that island where 
we have large farming operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we are talking about here is not unlike an 
industry with which I am much more familiar, and that is the 
fishing industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about agencies, whether it be the Farm Credit 
Corporation or whether we call it Farm Credit Canada or whatever, 
what difference does it make as long they do the job that the 
farmers want it to do?  If it will be costly to start 
implementing changes, although I cannot see why it really would 
be, then we certainly should look at why the name should be 
changed.  Other than that, the bill itself basically is one that 
is supported by farmers.  The amendments would not be, certainly 
not Amendments Nos. 1 and 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the fishing industry.  There are commonalities. 
Within the fishery we also have agencies that provide assistance 
directly to the people in the fishing industry.  If they were not 
there, the people who participate in the fishing industry would 
have no one to turn to, especially the little fellow, as we say, 
the person who is operating on his own, who is not backed by a 
major company, who is not owned by a company or corporation, who 
is trying to operate his family fishing business the same way as 
a farmer would operate a family farm, quite often when the going 
is tough, whether it is a poor fishing season or a poor farming 
season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we did not have such agencies it would be the regular bank we 
would have to turn to.  Banks are great.  If we have money in the 
bank and are worth a few bucks we have absolutely no trouble 
getting money from a regular chartered bank.  However if we have 
no money in the bank and times are tough, try getting money from 
the bank then.  A lot of farmers and a lot of fisherpersons are 
really left in a bind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we have assistance groups such as credit corporations 
dealing with the various sectors, many of the people who are 
trying to operate within these sectors, in most cases 
successfully, find the going very tough in times of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada in particular, unless we have a change in the 
weather, this year could be an extremely tough year for farmers. 
Mother Nature is a very rough person to try to fight, and as many 
of us have learned, whether we are farmers or operate on the 
ocean, it is a battle we cannot win.  As we debate legislation 
that is so important to them, they are undoubtedly wondering if 
the protective clauses will be there to protect them if they need 
assistance from such agencies during the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we proceed through this legislation, we should try to protect 
those who most need the protection.  Those who need the 
protection most generally are the family farm owners, the small 
boat fishermen, the family enterprises.  They do not have the 
support of the major corporations.  They are not owned and 
manipulated by the big corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear the words family farm and we hear people talking 
about the difficulties some farmers and some families go through, 
we all think of the old westerns that we watched when we were 
growing up.  They are almost gone from the screen.  It is very 
difficult to see a good John Wayne movie or any other movie.  It 
may be because of the violence.  If those movies caused violence, 
we would all be pretty violent people, I would say, looking 
around here.  We ran around with guns strapped to our hips when 
we were young and playing cowboys.  However, many of these old 
shows talked about the family farm, with the bank holding the 
mortgage and calling in the mortgage, whereby the family would 
lose the farm except for the hero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in this scenario here the hero is actually the Farm 
Credit Corporation or Farm Credit Canada or whatever we want to 
call it.  It is agencies such as this that the owner of the farm 
now has to depend on to make sure that he is not just swallowed 
up in the process, that when he is paying his bills there is not 
a problem, and that when he runs into difficult times, as we have 
seen in the last couple of years and as we may looking at this 
year, he needs a crutch to lean on.  It is up to government to 
ensure that the crutch is there and that the family farm and 
farms generally will exist beyond the period of drought, beyond 
the period of fires and beyond the period of rough agricultural 
times.  One of the things we have to remember is that it is the 
farmers and the fishermen of the country who provide the 
sustenance needed to keep the country going.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear people talk about subsidies.  What is the alternative to 
farming and fishing in this country, the provision of the very 
food we need to keep the country going?  We must make sure these 
people have every break they can get in order to carry on such 
worthwhile industries, because they are such worthwhile 
contributors to the country themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill.  We cannot support Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 
at this stage because of the effects they might have on the 
smaller operations within the farming system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for the opportunity to join with my colleagues here in the 
Progressive Conservative Party to speak to this group of 
amendments with respect to the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crux of our difficulty is that although we as a party are 
indeed in support of the bill itself, as the member for St. 
John's West said a few moments ago we have grave concerns that 
the amendments before us in this group will indeed have a 
detrimental effect on smaller farm operations, the family farms. 
As the hon. member for Saint John said, they are indeed the 
cornerstone of rural Canada and small rural towns.  Those family 
farms in fact essentially represent the main street of rural 
Canada.  They are where people live.  They are where they earn a 
living.  They also provide for the infrastructure that we have in 
rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding, the great riding of Fundy—Royal, is one of the dairy 
capitals of this great country.  Over half the milk production 
for the province of New Brunswick is from Fundy—Royal.  Some of 
the farm operations are small farms that make a valuable 
contribution to the rural community despite the fact that they 
may only be milking 35 or 40 cows.  The average is more often 
than not in the neighbourhood of 80 cows.  Whether we are talking 
Jerseys, Guernseys or Holsteins, the role that dairy farms play 
in my riding in particular and the role these small operations 
play are intrinsic to rural Canada and that way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In point of fact we know that the government's record with 
respect to agriculture on a broad stroke of issues has been 
suspect at best.  Members probably recall the federal 
government's inability and almost unwillingness at one point to 
actually fight on behalf of potato farmers and those small, 
vibrant businesses on Prince Edward Island.  At that time the 
government needed to defend the interests of P.E.I. potato 
farmers and point out that the potato blight that was detected 
was in one corner of one field and by no means had any kind of 
detrimental effect with respect to the potato crop on Prince 
Edward Island as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada really did not step up to the plate for 
this.  The efforts were made by the Progressive Conservative 
Party, by our agriculture critic, the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris, and in particular by the member from the 
neighbouring riding across the Northumberland Strait, the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, who brought up this 
particular issue on the floor of the House of Commons time and 
time again.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that it was the Liberal Party of Canada who 
gave us the credit.  The Liberals thought they had made the first 
correction with the Americans and we were the first people they 
tried to attack, to point to, saying that they had solved the 
problem.  They looked over toward us because they knew it was the 
Progressive Conservative Party that was defining the P.E.I. 
potato blight issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is an ardent 
supporter of the supply management regime we have, particularly 
in dairy products.  If we look at all the other commodities 
within agriculture that have difficulty because of international 
subsidies, we know that our supply management regime has been 
critical to our capacity to maintain a solid market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to have proper protection for supply 
management.  I know the NDP agriculture critic has been an 
advocate of this issue as well.  We cannot have supply management 
unless we protect our borders.  It was shameless of the 
Government of Canada to do what it did when we went to the WTO 
with respect to agriculture issues and protecting supply 
management.  In place of article 11 we accepted the tariff rate 
quota regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what happened when the Minister for International Trade 
provided ministerial permits so that, in this case, cheese sticks 
could come into Canada.  That actually consumed the equivalent of 
the production of 70 Canadian dairy farms.  We gave that away 
unilaterally.  To show how disingenuous that actually was, it was 
done without even informing the agricultural or dairy community 
of the country.  The government did it unilaterally.  It was 
almost by accident that the Government of Canada was outed on 
this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the dairy farmers of Canada are saying quite clearly that 
they are very suspicious about whether the Liberal Party is in 
fact a supporter of supply management to the degree that it 
should be.  I do not think it supports the same position that I 
know the Bloc, the New Democrats and the Conservatives have with 
respect to supply management in dairy farming in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be here on this side of the House to ensure that the 
Liberal government does not squander livelihoods with respect to 
supply management and small farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another case where the Government of Canada did not 
defend the rights of the dairy community.  It permitted, with 
hardly a fuss, the importing into Canada of butter oil and sugar 
blends.  These butter oil and sugar blends are essentially a 
dairy replacement and replaced almost $50 million worth of milk 
quota that actually rightfully belonged to Canadian dairy 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite honestly I wish the Liberal Party of Canada would 
understand that in Canada we are supposed to milk the cows, not 
the dairy farmers.  We should ensure that we actually protect 
what Canada now freely negotiates at the WTO.  We should not give 
it away unilaterally.  These butter oil and sugar blends actually 
displaced $50 million worth of industrial milk and cream that we 
clearly could have been purchasing from our own dairy farmers. We 
want to take the initiative to defend our dairy farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, is 
interested in saying a few words on this bill as well.  Given 
that our time is running out, I want to make sure that all of us 
on this side of the House defend the rights and responsibilities 
that the Government of Canada should have in protecting the small 
farms, protecting supply management and particularly in 
protecting the dairy farmers in this great country of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from 
Fundy—Royal and other members of the Progressive Conservative 
Party who have spoken to this bill.  Some might view this 
legislation as being of little consequence and a case of 
semantics because in essence what appears to be the major change 
is one of name only, whereby it creates the Farm Credit Canada 
logo, the FCC. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it takes on much more than that.  My colleagues have 
noted and highlighted some of the changes that would come about 
as a result of the legislation.  The bill speaks in particular 
detail of expanding the financial services available to farm 
operations and businesses throughout Canada.  The bill would 
allow authority to provide loans to businesses related to farming 
activities in Canada, in cases where the business is majority 
owned by farmers and in cases where it is not.  It would touch 
upon farming in a critical way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying, but bears repeating, that farming in 
Canada is very much in jeopardy.  We have seen crises, 
particularly in western Canada and the province of Manitoba, 
because of the elements and because of flooding.  We have also 
seen drought in other parts of the country.  The expansive size 
of Canada and the distances involved in bringing produce to 
market is one of the biggest challenges farmers face apart from 
the weather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the government's involvement in the farm 
industry, we have on many occasions seen farmers throughout 
Canada left with a feeling of abandonment when it comes to their 
ability to be competitive not only in Canada or North America but 
globally.  A great deal more could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Progressive Conservative Party and other members 
in the House have spoken at length and quite passionately about 
the need for government assistance in times of need, when market 
change or legislation has hindered the ability of farmers to get 
their produce to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is perhaps one of the highlights of the bill and hopefully 
one that can be brought through quickly.  It would help farmers 
get on with the business of produce and participate fully in the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party is very supportive of the legislation as 
we have been in the past with efforts to assist farmers.  My 
colleague spoke of the situation in Prince Edward Island with 
respect to potatoes.  There have been other situations throughout 
the country where farmers have been left destitute and literally 
high and dry when it came to the government coming to their 
assistance when they were most in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend also spoke of the dairy industry.  In my constituency 
of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough there are numerous examples. 
Scotsburn Dairy Cooperative has a storied and very proud history 
of participation in the dairy industry in Canada.  It is 
continuing to expand and make great contributions on behalf of 
its industry, and it is very much a part of the vibrant and 
growing economy of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the legislation.  We are pleased that there is an 
opportunity to see the bill pass through the Parliament of Canada 
and hopefully come into being in the other place.

free of government control, western Canadian farm families remain

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the government is 
prepared to make adjustments to employment insurance based on 
conversations with Canadians and the information that we received 
from reports, including our annual monitoring and assessment 
reports.  Bill C-2 is a clear example of this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is not clear is how the Bloc matches its rhetoric with its 
voting pattern here in the House.  When it is given the option to 
change the employment insurance program in support of seasonal 
workers and families, it chooses to vote against it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

colleagues.  The attitude of my colleagues is one that works with 
the government to pass amendments like those in Bill C-2 that 
will reduce the number of hours required to receive special 
benefits and that will double parental benefits; and to meet with 
me and members with their communities to talk about economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we know that employment insurance is 
important but we also believe in a balanced approach, which means 
diversifying economies in those regions of Canada that need our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a new 
immigration law is making its way through the House.  It is a 
supreme irony that the law, if it had been on the books 30 years 
ago, would have meant that Canada was a not safe place for Nelson 
Mandela.  A secret immigration board could have branded him a 
terrorist and deported him to face torture and imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will it take to persuade the government to change the 
immigration bill to protect people like Nelson Mandela from 
brutal, dictatorial regimes?  Will the Prime Minister commit to 
making the necessary changes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the immigration bill, as the legislation 
that has been in place for 25 years, has in place discretion 
available to the minister and the government to ensure that cases 
such as Nelson Mandela's are dealt with at the highest levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I also want to point out that Bill C-11 which is 
presently before the House is no different from the legislation 
that has been in place for 30 years.  The intention of the bill 
is to give Canadian authorities the opportunity to stop those who 
are inadmissible, at the same time allowing those such as Mr. 
Mandela access to our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Was there a cabinet committee overseeing the procurement of the

the government seems completely unable to somehow split a bill

not enough by itself.  They contend that Canada's productivity 
cannot be improved without lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the Liberal government is in denial of its

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

nothing.  The incentives for research and development in Canada 
are the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They always talk about taxes.  When our program of taxes is in 
place in 2004 the rate of taxes for corporations in Canada will

is so far behind it thinks it is ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not even caught up to the tax levels of our

taxes in Canada will be lower than in the United States, 
including capital taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian

sense when we consider that the board does not even market 
organic grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister explain why giving organic farmers an

Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned that the department has struck an internal 
review committee to vet the approval of all access to information 
requests, but it appears the net result of the committee has been 
to deny information to the official opposition.  In fact we have 
had to appeal to the information commissioner to help us get 
answers to 31 access to information requests.

requests made to my department over the last year.  In fact we 
have had a threefold increase in the amount of information 
required.  We are responding as quickly as we can.  Again, as she 
points out, there is an appeal process that she should make use 
of.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian

has been requested as we have provided hundreds of thousands of

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TALISMAN ENERGY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question of privilege arises from answers in the House of May 
4 last and prior to that on April 30, and in the standing 
committee on foreign affairs May 3, concerning the alleged use of 
the airfields by Talisman Energy and by Sudan's military for 
offensive military purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In putting questions to the Minister of Foreign Affairs with 
respect to this issue, I referred to a document which had been 
vetted under the provisions of the access to information 
legislation, a portion of which had been deleted.  That was 
paragraph 15 of the document which specifically dealt with the 
issue of the use by Sudanese military of Talisman's airfields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In questioning the minister with respect to this document and 
the particular serious allegations of complicity between Talisman 
and the Sudanese government, the minister in response indicated 
that the deletions to this document had been made “to protect 
the lives of Canadians working in the Sudan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, I obtained a copy of the original document. 
Paragraph 15 of the original document made no reference 
whatsoever to the lives of Canadians.  There was absolutely no 
information in that paragraph that could in any way jeopardize 
the lives of any Canadians working in Sudan.  Indeed all members 
of the House would agree that the lives of those Canadians should 
be protected and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this issue is a very serious one because as a member of 
parliament, as a member of the House, as a member of the foreign 
affairs committee, along with other members who share concern on 
this issue, we cannot do our job effectively as members if we are 
given documents which are heavily censored and whited out, 
allegedly under the provisions of access to information 
legislation.  When the minister seeks to explain those deletions 
and gives the House and the committee information which is 
demonstrably inaccurate, we cannot do our job.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That surely is the essence of parliamentary privilege; our 
ability to question ministers, to question the government and to 
call them to account, in this case with respect to the position 
of the Government of Canada on the use by the Sudanese military, 
in its genocidal, scorched earth policy in South Sudan, of 
Talisman's airfields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that I raise this question of privilege. I 
would like to suggest to the Speaker that this is a serious 
matter and should the Speaker find there is a prima facie case of 
privilege here, I would be prepared to move the appropriate 
motion to have this matter reviewed by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that I have received from the minister 
a copy of a letter which he sent to Your Honour as Speaker, dated 
June 6.  In this letter the minister stated: “Our principal 
concern in reviewing and vetting this document, pursuant to the 
provisions of the access to information legislation, our 
principal concern was that the document contains information 
that, if disclosed publicly, could jeopardize the security of 
Canadians working in Sudan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 15, as I said before, makes no reference whatsoever to 
the security of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I just want to make this final point.  The minister 
then went on to suggest that another potential exemption might be 
respecting sensitive information about the quantity and quality 
of military assets of a foreign country, for example Sudan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the rationale, why was that rationale not put before 
the House and the committee at the time the question was asked? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this raises very serious questions of privilege that 
go to the heart of the ability, not just of myself, but of all 
members of the House.  I know there are members in all parties 
who share this concern and who may wish to speak to this to get 
at the truth, so we can do our job on behalf of the Canadians we 
have the honour of representing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, the issue raised by the hon. member was a matter 
of procedures in the wrong place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, the justification for excluding 
portions of a document that is made available under the Access to 
Information Act is appealable to the information commissioner. 
The hon. member has every right to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the answers that I gave in the House are concerned, I 
gave answers which stated the justification for the deletions 
which was used by the person preparing the response to the access 
to information request, and that is exactly what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I would like to point out that the document in 
question does address the number, location and security 
disposition of Canadians in the oil fields in considerable 
detail.  That is the case, and the hon. member knows that is 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions rebel groups in the Sudan have made threats 
against international oil workers.  That was the reason that 
those preparing the response to access to information deleted 
those passages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognizing the risk to Canadians, I think the hon. member 
will understand that precautions have been taken to try to 
ensure, as much as we can, that those individuals are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, I fail to see how this could be a question of 
privilege.  There may be a difference of point of view.  You have 
given the hon. member plenty of latitude, Mr. Speaker, to argue 
his policy view with respect to activities in the Sudan.  That 
was a whole other question that we had the opportunity to discuss 
at some length in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if he has difficulty with how an access to information 
request was handled, I suggest to him and I suggest that the 
appropriate way to deal with that is by appealing to the 
information commissioner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as somebody who has made requests for access to 
information on a number of occasions, I am shocked to hear what 
the member had to say about the paragraph that was deleted in 
this document and his later discovery that the reasons given for 
the deletion were not actually fact.  It raises the question as 
to whether the documents that I and my colleagues have received 
over the past few years have the same problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to take serious consideration of 
the complaint of the hon. member and to thoroughly investigate 
whether in fact there has been a question of privilege here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair has heard the points raised by 
the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas and the member for North 
Vancouver.  I do not see how this is a question of privilege.  I 
do not understand from anything I have heard how the privileges 
of the hon. member have been affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have two recourses with respect to documents.  First, 
they can ask the House to pass an order requiring the tabling of 
documents in the House, which is called a notice of motion for 
the production of papers.  Those motions can be tabled and can 
demand the production of documents that might not otherwise be 
available under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the act, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs has pointed 
out, there is an appeal procedure available to members.  The 
minister is perfectly correct in suggesting that the proper 
avenue for dealing with the matter is through appeal under the 
Access to Information Act and not to the Speaker.  I do not think 
it is my obligation to rule on what kinds of documents are being 
produced either by government departments or members' offices 
except in the exceptional circumstances of there being something 
done by the House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly in this case it was not a matter for the House.  It was 
a matter for an officer of parliament.  Disclosure was made by 
the department under the auspices of an act of parliament.  There 
is an officer charged with enforcement of the act and I think the 
matter should be dealt with there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a question of privilege raised at this time.  I 
decline to proceed further with the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Given the government's newfound enthusiasm for resolutions being 
introduced in this place through unanimous consent, I should like 
to seek unanimous consent to put the following motion extracted 
from my private member's Bill C-297: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the people of Canada are forever grateful to the many 
dedicated men and women who bravely and unselfishly gave their 
lives for Canada in wars and in peacekeeping efforts; 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas their extraordinary courage and profound sacrifice must 
never be forgotten by us or future generations; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And Whereas, as a gesture of its respect for these men and 
women, the federal government wishes to honour their memory by 
promoting throughout Canada the observance of two minutes of 
silence each Remembrance Day, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Therefore the people of Canada are invited to pause and 
observe two minutes of silence at 11.00 a.m. on each Remembrance 
Day to honour the men and women who died serving their country in 
wars and in peacekeeping efforts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have unanimous consent 
of the House to propose the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I regret to inform the 
member that nobody on his side of the House, his House leader or 
anyone else, raised the issue at the House leaders' meeting 
earlier this week.  That is most unfortunate for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully suggest that he might want to do that at next 
week's meeting.  I will do my best to endeavour to raise it with 
him, if his House leader does not raise it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I take it the government House leader is 
refusing consent to proceed with the matter at this time. 
Accordingly it will not proceed now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-28, an act to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and the Salaries Act, be read the third time and 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak this afternoon on 
the third reading of Bill C-28, the parliamentary compensation 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in this House on Tuesday, Bill C-28 is 
straightforward.  It simply implements the report of the 
independent Lumley Commission, a commission created by order in 
council last January. The Lumley Commission submitted a report 
in accordance with the Parliament of Canada Act.  We approved 
this report and we are simply trying to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lumley Commission stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good day's work deserves a fair wage, and there is no reason 
that this should not apply to those who commit to public 
service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lumley Commission recommendations, which are reflected in 
Bill C-28, are in my view fair.  And I am very pleased with the 
broad support for the Lumley report.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader for the official opposition supported key 
elements of the Lumley report when he said that his party had 
called for “an independent commission to make recommendations 
regarding MPs' salaries” in the future and that such 
recommendations “be done by the people who look at the judges' 
salaries, which is independent”.  He further stated that his 
party had “promoted the concept that MPs' pensions should be 
more in line with the private sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP House leader said “the process we have embarked on 
today is much superior to ones I have experienced in the past”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here, with notice being given on a Friday, the bill 
introduced on a Monday, second reading debate on Tuesday, 
committee of the whole on Wednesday and third reading and final 
vote on Thursday...does give Canadians time to get in touch with 
their MPs and give them their opinions before dealing with a fait 
accompli. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of the House leader for the New Democratic 
Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are of the opinion that Mr. Lumley and 
the other two members of his committee have carried out a 
serious, detailed and well researched study of the situation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, several representatives of the political parties in the 
House have commented favourably on this report. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject of parliamentary pensions has been noted by members 
of the House during consideration of Bill C-28.  The Leader of 
the Official Opposition raised it today during question period. 
He of course now knows, on verification, that the numbers he 
quoted from the newspaper were factually incorrect, grossly 
exaggerated and completely off base.  I am sure the hon. member 
knows not to refer to things that are improperly researched. They 
are bound to get people in trouble.  He knows something about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphasize that Bill C-28 would implement the Lumley 
commission's recommendation that pension provisions be adjusted 
to limit the cost of compensation increases.  According to Bill 
C-28, the accrual rate would be reduced by 25%, from 4% to 3%. 
The reduction would result in a saving of $400,000 annually for 
the Canadian taxpayer, and we all know why.  There are two 
reasons. First, the accrual rate would decrease.  Second, the 
premiums would be paid on a larger amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the average MP, the premiums would be approximately $3,000 a 
year more.  Because people like myself and the leader of the 
opposition get larger salaries, we would pay even more.  The 
leader of the opposition and myself, and I say that because our 
salaries are identical and much higher than those of the average 
MP, would pay approximately $4,000 a year more than we pay now in 
premiums on the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that in a Toronto <I>Star</I> article 
today an evaluation was done on MP pensions, even the one paid to 
the Prime Minister.  They were deemed not to be overly generous 
given the size of the premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Higher compensation levels would of course result in an increase 
in pension benefits but those benefits would be fully paid for by 
members themselves through their contributions to the 
parliamentary pension plan as I have just described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second reading debate on Tuesday, members of 
parliament rose to speak about the need for fair compensation for 
their demanding workload.  Members recognized the Lumley 
commission's research in comparing parliamentary compensation 
with other professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been clear this week that almost all members, certainly 
the vast majority, agree that Bill C-28 would:  first, strike an 
appropriate balance in determining a fair level of compensation; 
second, reinforce our ability to attract the best and brightest 
to public life; and third, strengthen accountability to taxpayers 
on the issue of parliamentary compensation, the judges 
commission, which will now rule, and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind those who have spoken against implementing the 
Lumley recommendations that compensation for MPs rose 6% between 
1991 and 2000.  Public sector increases have amounted to 15%, 
private sector increases have amounted to 22% and the conference 
board survey puts executives at 31%.  Of course 31% is not even 
sought in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A comparison with judges, and I described it yesterday during 
report stage debate, shows that a member of parliament even with 
this increase would not be paid nearly what federal court judges 
were paid 30 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey comparing the salaries of legislators in 12 countries 
ranked Canadian legislators ninth behind those of G-7 nations 
such as the United States, Britain, Japan, Germany, France and 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts on compensation in the private sector have commented on 
parliamentary remuneration and the Lumley commission's 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the media had to say about the Lumley report.  The 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> on May 30 stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do well to consider this as citizens in pursuit of good 
government...What job is comparable to being one of a few hundred 
legislators mastering difficult, complex subjects and passing 
laws that affect every Canadian's life? 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>La Presse</I> noted on May 31 that a good MP more than earns his 
salary, particularly when his workload and what he is paid are 
compared to equivalent jobs in the labour market. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a minute to talk about the opting in provisions.  A 
number of members yesterday commented about the opting in 
provisions.  Under Bill C-28, parliamentarians would be given the 
right to decide whether the Lumley commission report should apply 
to themselves.  I would say to all members that they are being 
given a choice and are free to do what they think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say once again, if I can be so bold, that I advise all 
members to vote for the bill.  Should they not vote for the bill 
they should opt in to the program anyway.  I would ask all 
members to do this because they are all deserving of the salary 
that members of parliament are paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opting in provisions have been used many times in the past. Some 
members alleged yesterday that it was unprecedented.  However 
they were sought by members of the House only a few years ago 
regarding the pension program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  That was an opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  No, it was an opt in.  The hon. member 
says that it was an opt out but that is not correct, I am sorry 
to say. If members review their records they will see that it was 
an opt in. All members were deemed to have opted out and had to 
sign up to be opted in.  I am quite sure of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second opting in bill was passed shortly before the last 
election to allow members to buy back a second time.  That was an 
opt in.  Again, each member had the choice of doing it.  That was 
the second one and there are a number of others. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-28 implements the report of the independent 
Lumley Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. Ed Lumley, the hon. Jake Epp, and 
Dr. Huguette Labelle on their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy for all of us to claim that we are opposed to this 
bill.  I am asking all members to think about what is right for 
themselves, for their family and for the work they are called 
upon to perform as parliamentarians in the highest court in the 
land, the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I ask them to support this bill.  It is a good bill. 
It is well drafted and it deserves the support of us all, not 
just for ourselves, but for the institution in which we sit as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the leader of the opposition and all members of the 
House will decide later today to support the bill or at least to 
opt back in when the opportunity arises.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise reluctantly to participate in 
the debate today on Bill C-28, an act to amend the Parliament of 
Canada Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and 
the Salaries Act.  I say reluctantly because I believe there are 
many other things that we should be dealing with today and in the 
days left in this session that are more important to Canadians 
than this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ostensibly the bill is meant to implement the recommendations 
that were made by the Lumley commission, which was an independent 
commission led by former cabinet minister Ed Lumley and charged 
with setting MPs salaries, benefits and pensions.  Very few will 
actually dispute the need to review the salaries of MPs.  I do 
not dispute that.  We do not dispute that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were actually in a bizarre situation where MPs got a basic 
salary of $68,000, plus a tax free expense allowance of something 
around $40,000, plus additional living allowances, with the 
result that when asked the basic question of how much an MP made 
the answer was not a simple one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is pretty much unanimous consent out there that people 
should be able to know how much politicians make.  That is basic. 
If we are to be truly accountable to our electorate, part of that 
accountability involves being transparent where taxpayers dollars 
are being spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transparency is not something for which the present Liberal 
government is known.  The very idea that the salaries of MPs 
should be transparent and comparable with private sector 
standards is actually one which is deeply held by most Canadians 
and by most members of the Canadian Alliance.  It should come as 
no surprise that the first line of article 70 of the Canadian 
Alliance declaration of policy reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary compensation will be recommended by an independent 
commission according to private sector standards. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something we believe in and that our grassroots members 
across the country have endorsed.  On the face of it Bill C-28 is 
straight out of Canadian Alliance policy.  The Lumley commission 
was an independent commission.  Its recommendations certainly go 
in the direction of basing parliamentary compensation on private 
sector standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill uses the salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court of Canada as its reference point and that the salaries of 
MPs should be a percentage of that.  We could argue about whether 
or not that amount is appropriate.  Indeed it was actually argued 
by the government House leader on Wednesday that it was 
appropriate the Prime Minister make the same salary as the chief 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may or may not be a point agreed upon by all Canadians, but 
the fact is that it was out there and a reference point was 
sought.  The only possible concern is that the chief justice's 
salary is determined by the judicial compensation commission 
whose recommendations must be passed by parliament. In a somewhat 
oblique fashion the Liberals have ensured, if they wanted to, a 
stealthy way of continuing to give MPs regular increases.  This 
is the spend portion of the tax and spend policies which 
constitute the ongoing Liberal assault on the beleaguered 
Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lumley commission did a great service in getting rid of the 
tax free expense allowances as we had recommended.  This was 
appropriate.  Just as people cannot understand why the federal 
Liberals do not feel that the cost of a mechanic's tools should 
be partially deductible if needed for his or her employment, and 
that is something we endorse as the Canadian Alliance, most 
taxpayers could not understand how our food, clothing, 
drycleaning and taxis would come out of a taxpayer funded 
non-taxable expense allowance.  By making this amount taxable the 
Lumley commission has ended the secrecy and put politicians on a 
similar footing with other Canadians.  We endorse that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission also recognized the need to make the MP pension 
plan comparable with public and private sector norms, especially 
given that salaries are being raised to private sector levels. It 
suggested that the MP pension should be equal to 2.5% of an MP 
salary multiplied by the number of years served. It should be 
noted that this is actually higher than the 2% rate per year of 
service which public servants actually get from a plan that is 
administered through the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, even the independent commission's recommended above 
average rate was not enough for the federal Liberals who jacked 
that rate up to 3%.  Now we give them half a point out of ten for 
lowering it, but it is still not where it would be if and when 
the Canadian Alliance government has the opportunity to do that 
after the next election.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it seems that our pay has been recommended by an 
independent commission, the reality is that the Liberals have 
actually used the Lumley commission's recommendation to jack up 
and justify their own pay raises.  They have exceeded the pension 
amounts and retained the ability to continue to give themselves 
pay increases by linking their salaries to the base amount, the 
salary of the chief justice, and then actually being the ones who 
have the ability to control that.  Like most things the Liberals 
do, it is too clever by half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be voting against the bill for the principal reason that 
I do not think I should set my own salary.  It is as simple as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second sentence of article 70 of the Canadian Alliance 
declaration of policy specifically states “The decision of 
parliament will be implemented after a subsequent election”. 
That is a point of principle of our own policy declaration. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always believed that we should run any salary increase by the 
voters first. We should not get elected and then vote ourselves 
a huge salary increase. We are not talking about the legitimacy 
of the current salary, but about the principle. Voters should 
know before the election what salary we will be getting 
throughout our mandate. This is why the Canadian Alliance 
proposed amendments whereby this increase would take effect only 
after the next election. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just makes sense.  On the CBC news last night there was an 
interview with a fellow at a racetrack who just could not figure 
out how MPs could vote themselves a pay increase.  He said that 
the increase should be for the next guy.  That encapsulates the 
spirit of our policy.  Like most Canadians, the person being 
interviewed did not think MPs should set their own salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be voting against the bill and encouraging others to do 
the same.  If we defeat the bill, the Liberals could bring back 
an amended bill that would contain many of the same positive 
recommendations of the Lumley commission and would add a clause 
stating that the increase would only take effect after the next 
election.  They would also ensure that the base amount would not 
be linked to any salary that parliament may control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the federal Liberal MPs to defeat the bill.  It 
would send a message to taxpayers across the country that they 
and not us are the ones who should set our salaries.  I would 
encourage our federal Liberal MPs to agree with us on this.  It 
is Canadian tax dollars and they should be the ones determining 
what is fair compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has some other nasty features.  Section 54.1 makes the 
increase retroactive to January 1.  In my view that is totally 
unconscionable.  There is no way on earth we should be voting 
ourselves a windfall, especially when taxes are so high for the 
rest of our citizens.  That is absolutely unacceptable in my 
view.  The government gave no hint during the last election that 
it would be doing such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other objectionable clause in the bill is the one which 
requires an MP to opt in to benefit from the pay increase.  This 
is one of the most troubling concepts that we have seen in any 
type of legislation.  It puts MPs in a situation whereby two MPs 
from the same party or from across the floor who do the same job, 
or maybe work harder, as some would suggest opposition members 
do, but I will not necessarily claim that, would earn two 
different salaries.  That is in direct violation of the spirit of 
equality in our charter of rights and freedoms and is 100% 
opposed to the spirit of the October 19, 1999 federal court 
decision on pay equity.  It is totally inappropriate for that 
particular clause to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also requires an MP to opt in in order to make his or her 
salary transparent to taxpayers.  We believe that should be 
happening but that we should not have to opt in to do that.  It 
should be part of the legislation that we are getting rid of the 
tax free expense allowance, which some people find so troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill says that the opt in or opt out clause, 
whichever we want to call it, is irrevocable.  This is 
astonishing.  If MPs opt out in order to defray their increases 
until after the next election, to follow our own policy, it would 
mean that as long as they continue to be elected they would 
forever be operating at a different level of compensation than 
other MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unconscionable that such a clause should be in 
the bill.  It is probably unconstitutional.  It is definitely 
against the spirit of equality and surely against democracy 
itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that at the Quebec summit in April the 
government was calling on a democracy clause to be inserted into 
the text for the free trade area of the Americas.  The government 
was of the view that the emerging democracies of the world would 
learn from us.  We can be honoured to say that many times they do 
look to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently met with President Fox of Mexico.  I can say that the 
type of democracy being proposed by the federal Liberal 
government in this bill is not something I believe that Mr. Fox's 
government would follow.  I suspect he will be looking for 
another role model and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a suggestion being made that if members vote 
against the bill it would be inappropriate for them to live with 
the effects of the bill.  I find that a specious argument.  I 
would make note of the fact that many times MPs on either side of 
the House vote against legislation which then becomes law and 
they then have to live with it whether they like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proposed certain tax measures only hours before 
the last election.  We opposed those particular measures because 
we did not think they were good tax measures.  We are living with 
the tax decreases that were passed on and nobody is suggesting 
that is inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hesitate to interrupt the Leader of 
the Official Opposition but I want to remind the House that under 
the special order of debate on this particular bill members have 
10 minutes.  The Chair will undertake the responsibility of 
giving the Leader of the Official Opposition a few more minutes 
to complete his remarks.  As I say, I hesitated to interrupt but 
in fairness to other hon. members who wish to participate I 
wanted him to be aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your 
indulgence.  I will wrap up at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestion that people who oppose the legislation should not 
have to or should not be expected to live within it is 
inappropriate.  It is a great and sad irony that those who oppose 
this type of legislation in order to protect taxpayers are 
sometimes pointed at as being the villains of this type of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also say that it is certainly a matter of principle in 
our caucus that whatever an individual MP decides to do following 
the bill, whether he or she votes for it or against it, takes or 
does not take some of it, be it Liberal, Alliance or whatever, 
there will be no personal recriminations from one MP to another 
as far as we are concerned.  Those will be private matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that Bill C-28 should be opposed and 
denounced.  We call on the government to table new legislation 
that respects the recommendations of the Lumley commission, the 
prohibition against politicians setting their own salaries and 
the fundamental principle in a democracy that if two people do 
the same job for the same employer they should get the same 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an amendment to Bill C-28.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK189">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor:

</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bill C-28, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act, the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Salaries

Committee of the Whole for the purposes of reconsidering clause 
29 to study its impact on the prime minister's pension taking 
into account the recommendation from the Lumley Commission that 
the changes to members' compensation `not result in any material 
impact, either positive or negative, to the benefits that 
parliamentarians receive from the pension plan'.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask all hon. members to perhaps pay particular attention 
to ensure that it reflects their views:  That at 3 p.m. on 
Tuesday, June 12, the member for Markham shall propose a motion, 
deemed to seconded by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the 
Opposition and leaders of the other parties, the motion of which 
he gave notice this day with regard to honorary citizenship for 
Nelson Mandela, provided that after speeches of no more than five 
minutes by the mover, and one representative from each party, the 
question thereon shall be put without further debate or 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there consent for the government 
House leader to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have just a few comments on this because our position has 
already been made clear at second reading and at committee of the 
whole with respect to our opposition to the bill on the basis 
that we believe the 20% raise to be too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we moved an amendment which would have had the 
effect of reducing the raise from 20% to 10%.  It would still be 
generous when we consider what many other Canadians would be glad 
to receive in the way of a pay raise, but nevertheless something 
that we might have been able to justify given certain economic 
indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment was defeated yesterday, so we will proceed to vote 
against Bill C-28 at third reading.  Then we will proceed as a 
caucus to all opt in to the legislation because we do not believe 
we should either be punished or accept punishment for being 
honest about our feelings on the pay package, and the fact that 
the raise is too high, especially when we consider there are 
elements of the bill which we support in terms of increasing 
transparency, and also in terms of creating a mechanism whereby 
members of parliament would not have to set their own salaries 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with care to what the Leader of the Opposition said. 
Perhaps I could just use my time to respond to some of the things 
he and the Alliance Party have said in the last few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had experience with the Alliance Party, and before that 
the Reform Party, when it comes to these matters.  It is very 
good at allowing certain things to happen and even in the past 
negotiating certain agreements.  Then after having negotiated 
those agreements, pretending to be against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened in the last parliament when I was privy to 
negotiations among the official opposition House leader and other 
House leaders with respect to the legislation that made it 
possible for many Reform members to opt back in to the pension 
legislation. 
Having negotiated that, I was very surprised to find out that 
when the bill came to the floor of the House of Commons the very 
people I had negotiated this with were denouncing it and voting 
against it.  That is bargaining in bad faith.  If people are 
going to negotiate something, they should at least have the guts 
to vote for it.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a similar situation in the sense that it was not 
negotiated, but I have heard the Alliance members say in recent 
days that this is being fast tracked through parliament and they 
did not want to see this happen now.  I would submit that there 
is also a certain intellectual political disingenuousness 
involved here too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have defended this process because I have said that this 
process is much better than any other process we have ever had 
with respect to implementing improvements or changes in our 
compensation package.  Therefore, I do not go around slamming the 
government for this particular process.  The Alliance has been 
doing this.  The fact remains that this happened pursuant to a 
House order which the Alliance Party had the 25 members to stop 
it.  This would not be happening if 25 members out of an Alliance 
caucus of 66 or whatever it was had been in the House to stop it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Alliance Party to give us a break and stop 
pretending that this is somehow happening against its will.  This 
happened because there were not 25 members of the House of 
Commons standing.  The Alliance is one of the parties that had 
the numbers to stop it.  Having not stopped it, spare us the 
theatrics of complaining that this is happening in the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to opting out and opting in, the Leader of the 
Opposition said that this is a terrible thing.  We know where it 
has its origins.  It has its origins in the former Reform Party 
demanding that it be allowed to opt out of the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  They are the bad guys though. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Fair enough.  I am just saying this is 
a fact.  I do not blame the Leader of the Official Opposition 
because he was not here.  The fact is his party has a lot of 
responsibility to bear for the fact that this kind of thing is 
even part of the political discourse in this place.  This is what 
was asked for at a certain point.  People must be careful of what 
they ask for because they might get it.  The Liberals took the 
Reform Party up on it and provided an opportunity for people to 
opt out of the pension plan.  That is where this whole opting in 
and opting out business came about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition complained about the 
irrevocability of the opting in clause or the fact that if a 
person does not opt in, that person can never opt in.  This also 
has its origins in the Reform Party.  What this is designed to 
prevent is the very thing we had to go through a year or so ago 
when we had Reform Party members, both privately and publicly, 
trying to crawl back into the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is people change their minds and then we have to 
have this very undignified process of having members doing 
something that they said they would never do.  I submit this also 
has its origins in the politics of the Reform Party and now the 
Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the things that the Leader of the Official Opposition 
said probably would have been better left unsaid for the party's 
sake.  I could not let the opportunity go by without giving what 
I think is a more faithful rendering of what has happened over 
the last few years with respect to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Leader of the Official Opposition said individual 
members should not be judged on the basis of what they do or do 
not do, that it is up to them.  He also said he would not want to 
be participating in any kind of group that judged other members 
of parliament with respect to the decisions that they make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  They are the government.  They are 
the bad guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  They are the government, but they are 
not the people who went around putting my name and other peoples' 
names in pamphlets judging us for being part of a pension plan 
that we did not even have the opportunity to opt out of or opt 
into or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, the Alliance Party and the Reform 
Party before it have built up a lot of really bad karma when it 
comes to this kind of issue.  Any discomfort that it might feel, 
either individually or collectively, over this kind of issue is 
very well deserved, because it is the party that made a political 
career out of criticizing other members of parliament who never 
had the range of choices of opting in and opting out that it had 
to deal with.  I must say that it has dealt with it very badly 
indeed, both as a group and individually.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish I could say that I am pleased to take part in 
this debate.  It is one of the dark days for parliament, as we 
prepare for the summer recess.  Members of parliament are in a 
very uncomfortable position of being presented with an option of 
enhancing their own rate of pay rather than dealing with issues 
that we all know in our heart of hearts are much higher on 
Canadians' list of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak a moment about the bill itself and the 
issues that present themselves.  This has come about after a 
great deal of consternation over many years about the 
compensation package.  Without getting into the actual merits of 
the pension and the rate of pay, when one looks at what the bill 
tries to accomplish, we understand that much of what will be 
accomplished is the removal of this uncomfortable situation for 
future parliaments, the removal of the unjust ability that 
members of parliament have currently in the legislation to 
increase and ameliorate their own rates of pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would take future pay raises out of our hands at least 
directly and tie them into the Judges Act.  That is really cold 
comfort to many Canadians right now who are struggling with 
difficult economic situations or who are currently engaged in 
strikes and labour disputes within their own fields.  That is 
really something that does not seem to appease those individuals. 
Yet I would suggest that it will be for the betterment of 
parliament that this spectacle of standing up and voting 
ourselves a raise will be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other elements that the bill attempts to address.  It 
attempts to bring rates of pay more in line with professions of 
equal status or equal value in the country.  The increase that is 
being brought in arguably could be merited and could be justified 
if it was perhaps going to be brought in over a period of time. 
That is the 5% or 4% of 6%, whatever the determined amount, would 
be phased in over a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps more appropriately and more palatable would be to 
increase it in the future, which is what the Progressive 
Conservative Party tried to do in an amendment that was moved 
yesterday.  It said in effect that this raise would only occur 
and would only take effect after the commencement of the 38th 
parliament, after the next election.  That would, at the very 
least, give Canadians the opportunity to know upfront what 
members of parliament intended to do in terms of voting 
themselves a raise before they cast their vote.  That is what 
would be accomplished if that were to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many members of parliament, I stand here today not proud. 
There is no joy among many members as we prepare for the vote 
this evening.  We have added to this discomfort this new opt in 
provision which was not included in the Lumley report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that what the Prime Minister intends to do is to 
further embarrass parliamentarians and essentially send the 
message that if we dare oppose or dare say anything publicly 
against the pay schedule, we will be punished because the media 
will be watching, our constituents will be watching, and if we 
dare opt in later, we will be labelled hypocrites.  We will wear 
that crown of thorns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This trap, this hole in ice which has been left for members to 
fall through if they have the audacity to stand up and oppose 
what the Prime Minister has put before us has grave implications 
because as has been mentioned, this is permanent.  Of course 
things can change quite radically around here.  It seems the law 
of the land can be stripped away with legislation.  We know that, 
yet this legislation is laid before us with this gaping hole, 
this bear trap, ready to clamp down on us if we say anything in 
opposition.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the timing, and perhaps the rate of pay, more than 
anything else that offends Canadians.  I have heard this from my 
constituents and from steelworkers in Trenton who are about to be 
laid off.  I have heard it from workers in the health profession 
who are labouring under extremely difficult situations.  I have 
heard it from factory workers and fishermen whose industry has 
collapsed right out from under them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take a most telling human toll on members of parliament 
when the House recesses and we go back to our constituencies, 
look them in the eye at summer events and justify our own 
existence.  The real debate we will embark on this summer is 
justifying our own existence and somehow proving that we are 
worth it to Canadians.  We will have to prove to our constituents 
that they were right in electing us and that this pay is merited 
and justified, not only the salary we used to receive but the new 
salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably there is a sense of uncomfortable shame welling up in 
all of us as we prepare for the vote tonight.  At the very least 
there has been an opportunity for some discourse and that 
discourse may lead to some backlash, but at least it is open and 
transparent in the sense we are being forced to justify our 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will very likely be taking this pay raise.  I do not think I 
should be prevented from standing here and criticizing the 
timing, the mechanism or the way in which the bill was brought in 
or be in a position of playing the role of a martyr.  That famous 
word of an unparliamentary nature, hypocrisy, which we cannot 
utter in this Chamber, is what will rain down on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to fan the flames of that sentiment, the Prime Minister 
stuck in a cute little clause that is meant to intimidate.  It is 
meant as hush money for members of the opposition and perhaps 
members of the backbench more particularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backlash inevitably will come and deservedly so.  If we as a 
parliament collectively cannot get our priorities right, if we 
cannot somehow in a more appropriate way align the priorities of 
the country, whether they be legislative priorities or priorities 
of debate, we deserve the backlash.  We deserve the heat and it 
will come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample opportunity to bring in legislation in the form 
of Bill C-15 which would protect children from stalkers on the 
Internet and would improve the sentencing schedules for police 
who are victims of attempts by someone to disarm them. Many other 
very important pieces of legislation on the order paper will 
languish away.  Some may disappear.  Some may be dropped from the 
order paper depending on how things unfold when we return in the 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to justify both in the Chamber in front of the cameras 
and in the foyer why this is happening, we should also be 
prepared to examine why it is that we are not prepared to stay a 
little longer if we have to, to sit a little later if we have to, 
to bring in legislation like Bill C-15.  That would perhaps in 
some small way, in some tiny, minute way, indicate that we are 
thinking about more important issues than the one that has 
brought shame on the House in the last days of parliament before 
the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of my party will be voting freely on the bill.  No party 
discipline will rain down on anyone who votes their conscience or 
the wishes of their constituents.  We will be voting freely. 
Clearly there is an indication that there will be a split among 
many parties on how to handle it, as there should be.  This is 
something that will, if nothing else, cause some reflection on 
the worth of our work and the emphasis that we place on certain 
elements of that work whether it be legislative or constituency 
work.

what are the priorities of the House and what the priorities

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-28, an 
act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act, the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act and the Salaries Act, be read the third 
time and passed, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address Bill C-28 at third reading because some things have 
to be put in perspective so that those who are listening 
can fully understand the problem this bill poses for 
parliamentarians, but also the need to behave in a courageous and 
appropriate manner under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is not a coincidence that we are reviewing this bill 
now. It is not because we suddenly decided that it would be a 
good idea to proceed a week or two before the end of the session. 
Rather, it is because the act provides that after an election 
an independent committee of experts must be commissioned to 
review the issue of members' salaries. The committee has six 
months to do its job and table its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago a journalist asked me why we were doing it 
now and not waiting for the fall?  I told him that whenever a report on 
members' salaries is tabled, the newspapers and media get hold of 
it and begin writing the most incredible headlines before any 
member has had an opportunity to express his or her opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This generates confusion among the public and, without a single 
parliamentarian having said anything on the issue, people begin 
to think that members of parliament voted themselves a salary 
increase of <I>x</I> thousand dollars. We have a perfect example of 
that today with the Prime Minister's pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being familiar with how pensions are calculated, I know 
personally that, on retirement—we all know that it will be in 
two years—the Prime Minister will not have a $175,000 pension 
because he would have to have paid premiums for five years on his 
maximum salary to be entitled to that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that hundreds and thousands of people are convinced 
that what they read this morning on the front page of a major 
newspaper is the truth but it is not.

members of the House to ask their opinion “Do you think it is 
enough? Do you think it is too much? Will you accept the raise or 
not? Will you recommend that all members of your party vote the 
same way or will you have a free vote on this issue?” It is 
awful. It is always awful for parliamentarians to talk about 
compensation because it is truly unfair that we are forced to 
determine the level of compensation we think we deserve, or at 
least this is how people see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know one person who is listening to us who is not 
outraged by the fact that I have to vote on my own salary. 
The people who are watching us are probably thinking “If I were 
voting my own pay increase, I would get a very nice one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not how things work. One has to understand that 
members—although obviously the government will be making the 
decision—have to vote for or against the implementation of an 
impartial report prepared by non-members of parliament who know 
about our duties and have expertise in that field. The commission 
was made of highly competent people who are above reproach and 
who have the ability to take a detached look at these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has decided to follow up on this report, and I 
agree. Our party believes that the report validates the pay 
increases recommended in a report prepared four years ago. For 
all practical purposes, these two reports are the same, except 
for the pay increase, due probably to the four year delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it means is that every time serious experts have looked at 
this issue objectively, they have always come up with almost the 
same suggestions. I truly believe that our pay level is 
reasonable. I do not know of anyone in my riding of Roberval who 
thinks it is not normal for the Prime Minister to earn at least 
as much as the chief justice of the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking here about the income of the president of a 
bank like the National Bank, the smallest of our big banks, who 
earns millions of dollars a year. 
We are not talking $2 million here, but a salary of $200,000 for 
a man who has infinitely more responsibilities than the 
president of the National Bank or the Royal Bank.  A salary of 
$250,000 or $260,000 for the Prime Minister is barely more than 
deputy ministers make in certain departments.  Do the people of 
Canada want to see their Prime Minister earning half what a 
deputy minister does?  It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the way the Prime Minister is doing his job does not 
suit us completely, his salary ought to be comparable to that 
earned by the heads of major companies.  When it comes down to 
it, does he not have greater responsibilities than anyone else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for the ministers as well. 
No one that I know of in my riding of Roberval does not think 
ministers need to earn what their deputy ministers earn, or 
close to it, at least the equivalent of an assistant deputy 
minister.  We should have given them more.  Because politicians 
are always extremely reasonable in applying these principles, we 
say that we should consider that a minister ought to earn the 
same as a deputy minister.  This is one of the rare areas in 
which a boss, with no job security, ends up earning a little 
less than the employee who reports to him.  We accept this, so 
MPs' salaries were set accordingly.  That is the outcome of the 
committee's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point to which I would like to return.  Debate 
leads to reflection.  We have supported the government in all of 
the bill, essentially. However one clause is of particular 
concern to me. 
I met some informed individuals who provided viewpoints on the 
debate.  I think intelligent people sometimes are the only ones 
to see things from a different angle.  I think the provision on 
opting in that is in the bill, although it may be initially 
attractive to the troublemakers who would like to play tricks 
with the bill on salaries, should not be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, it was in fact pointed out to me—I was impressed by the 
argument—that I agree with the principle, in a strike vote at a 
company, that if 70% vote in favour and 30% vote against, they 
do not say to the 30% “You will return to work because you 
oppose the strike”.  They say “The majority has decided and this 
system will apply”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is sort of the same thing.  In an attempt to trick certain 
individuals, to prevent their rhetoric on the bill, I think the 
government went a bit too far with this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the government House leader should not 
follow along on the route I have taken, which is, to think about 
the question and decide, in the end, that some colleagues can 
legitimately fight a bill.  Either they find the increase 
excessive or they find the pension fund inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have the right to express their point of view but they 
should not be personally penalized for that. 
I consider a member of the House of Commons must be able to do 
his job without the threat that he will be denied certain 
benefits, which members deserve, I have no doubt, all and 
amply.  It is a fair salary, as I said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we supported the government, but I would like to 
encourage it today—there is still time—to think about the opting 
in clause.  This may not be the discovery of the century.  I 
think we would all be much happier to do our job were there no 
threat, no spirit of revenge in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only change I would make to the position we have 
held since the start. 
We continue to support the bill but we would like to have the 
“opting in” clause—now before it is too late—taken out and 
withdrawn.  I do not think it is a good idea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on June 27, 1788, the Virginia ratifying convention 
proposed a series of amendments to the draft federal constitution 
then before that body.  It was understood by all participants in 
the debate over whether to ratify the proposed new constitution 
of the United States that if Virginia did not sign on, the new 
constitution would be stillborn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Virginia delegates made it clear that their ratification was 
conditional upon the adoption of the larger portion of the 20 
proposed changes to the body of the constitution they had set 
forth.  These amendments dealt with freedom of speech, the 
independence of the judiciary, freedom of religion, the right to 
own property, and other key rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments, which is relevant to today's debate read 
as follows.  It resolved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the laws ascertaining the compensation to Senators and 
Representatives for their services be postponed in their 
operation, until after the election of Representatives 
immediately succeeding the passing thereof— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposed amendment was the intellectual origin and the 
genesis of the primary principle underlying my decision to vote 
against the legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of proposed amendments was taken to the first session 
of the United States' congress by one of Virginia's greatest 
sons, James Madison.  From it and similar lists forwarded by the 
ratifying conventions of the other states, Madison and his 
colleagues cobbled together a series of 12 amendments which, on 
September 25, 1789, were duly enacted by a two-thirds majority of 
each of the two houses of congress and sent to the states for 
ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point the wording had been somewhat altered to read 
thus: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators 
and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of 
Representatives shall have intervened. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike all but one of the other amendments approved that day, 
the amendment on congressional pay was not immediately adopted by 
a three-fourths majority of the 13 states.  Perhaps this was 
because legislators in those days were modest in their salary 
demands and there was no need to place controls on their ability 
to set their own levels of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Times change.  The willingness of elected representatives to 
compensate themselves generously grew to the point that by the 
1980s a Texas legislative aide, Gregory Watson, felt compelled to 
take up the cause.  He built a cross-country coalition that 
convinced the legislatures of 32 states to complete the 
ratification process.  With the simultaneous ratification on May 
7, 1992, of the Michigan and New Jersey state legislatures, 
Madison's proposal became the 27th amendment to the United 
States' constitution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have engaged in this long historical digression to make as 
pointed a contrast as possible between the right way of reforming 
parliamentary compensation and the mess that presents itself to 
us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 2000 election, a commission, headed by former 
cabinet minister Ed Lumley, prepared a series of recommendations 
on MP salaries and compensation.  Its report was made public last 
week.  Some of its proposals strike me as excellent, particularly 
those which would moderate the accrual rate for the MP pension 
plan and which call for openness in reporting MPs' incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had not known until last week that my total compensation 
package under the existing byzantine structure of salary and tax 
free allowances added up to $109,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other aspects of the Lumley report, such as the proposal to tie 
MPs' salaries to those of judges, strikes me as less 
satisfactory. A linkage to private sector compensation would in 
my mind have been preferable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Lumley report is not the problem.  It is an 
impartial public servant's attempt to come to a reasonable 
solution to the question of MP compensation.  What has been 
distressing beyond all measure has been the government's reaction 
to the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past week we have seen the government fiddle with the 
accrual rate of the MP pension plan.  According to Walter 
Robinson of the National Taxpayers Association, it has done so to 
goose up the size of payouts by as much as 42%, make the pay 
retroactive to a point far in advance of the date suggested by 
Mr. Lumley, and insert an odious and offensive opt out clause to 
allow it to tar any member who votes against the bill with the 
spurious charge of hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these actions is an offence but the last one is so bad 
that I urge every member of the House, regardless of his or her 
intentions with regard to opting in or opting out, to vote 
against the entire bill on this basis alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part of the government's reaction to the Lumley report 
has surely been its unseemly haste to ram the legislation through 
in record time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So great was the government's haste that time allocation was 
imposed on the debate in the House.  The committee of the whole 
that met yesterday had only a few hours to discuss the details of 
the bill.  Each of us was permitted to raise questions only once, 
thereby preventing the kind of two way exchange that might have 
shed more light on important details of Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So great was the government's haste that its translation of the 
bill from English to French contained numerous mistakes which had 
to be corrected by amendments in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So great was the government's haste that at committee stage it 
failed to group consequential amendments to the bill as is the 
normal practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the government's haste was so great that many members, 
myself included, were unable to flip through our sheaves of 
proposed amendments before the votes had been commenced on them. 
We therefore voted in complete ignorance or had to abstain from 
voting so as not to vote inappropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this does the government a great discredit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say for the record that there are many members in the 
House who deserve the increase on which we will be voting this 
afternoon.  There are some for whom the services to their country 
that they are providing here, that they have provided here and 
that in many cases they will continue to provide here, far 
outweigh any level of compensation they will see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I would never condemn a fellow member regardless 
of how he or she chooses to vote, whether he or she chooses to 
opt into the pension plan, the pay raise or the whole package, 
but I cannot and will not set aside any kind word for the process 
by which the raise is being rammed through.  It is wrong and I 
will be voting against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge every fellow member of the House to do the same, 
regardless of party affiliation and regardless of his or her 
intentions with respect to the pay raise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
some other members have said that they are sorry to have to rise 
on the bill.  I am happy to do so because I believe I can stand 
here and represent the sentiment of those who have e-mailed and 
phoned me about the issue.  Their perception of what is going on 
here is that it is wrong and that we ought to reject it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say at the outset that I do not at all like what the 
Prime Minister is doing in promoting the bill, a bill which, 
among other things, would give him a hefty salary increase and a 
pension increase.  That of course is true for everyone here 
because an increased salary does, over time, increase the 
pension.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw to your attention Standing Order 23(1).  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offer of any money or other advantage to any Member of this 
House, for the promoting of any matter whatsoever depending or to 
be transacted in Parliament, is a high crime and misdemeanour, 
and tends to the subversion of the Constitution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is in our standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we cannot raise it in the House as a charge 
because the bill is not a secret handing of money, but it is an 
offer of financial advantage without criticism to members who 
vote for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, the Prime Minister used the opt in 
clause—and it was he who put it in, not the commission—for the 
sole purpose of getting people to vote the way he wanted them to. 
That is very evident.  He practically said it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Liberal members have said the same thing; that anyone who 
votes against the legislation and then takes it is a hypocrite. 
In other words, the Prime Minister is setting up members who, in 
representing their constituents, vote against the bill.  I will 
be voting against it.  He is setting us up as special targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know the terms in hockey.  It is a cheap shot, 
it really is.  If it is defensible the Prime Minister does not 
need to do it.  If it is not defensible he should not be doing 
it.  He is saying to anyone who votes against his wonderful bill 
that they will be special targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What annoys me is that every one of the Liberals on that side 
will be getting the raise.  Yes, they will proudly stand and vote 
for it and will proudly opt in.  All the while, the scrutiny of 
the media and of the public will be directed at those of us who 
voted against it instead of the guys who are putting it in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clever strategy on the part of the Liberals.  They are 
not in power year after year, decade after decade, because they 
are good managers of our economy or our finances.  We know that 
from history.  They are not in power because they represent the 
people who pay the taxes which pay their salaries and pensions. 
They are in power over and over again because they know how to 
turn the heat on someone else who does not deserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling their bluff.  I am voting against the bill.  I do 
not care what the Prime Minister says.  He can try to intimidate 
me if he wants.  I do not care what the media say.  I am standing 
up for what is right.  I am voting against the bill because there 
are a number of offensive aspects to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have time to talk about the hasty process.  I was going 
to say a few things about it but my colleague has done that. 
Suffice to say I am annoyed that the government chose to put the 
bill through in a three day time line.  It introduced the bill in 
the House on Monday.  We had second reading on Tuesday, which was 
confined to two hours, and report stage on Wednesday, which was 
also confined to two hours less a delay because of another 
process that went on in the House.  It extended the debate to two 
hours again today, or maybe two hours and two minutes or 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During report stage I had a very important amendment.  I did not 
even get a chance to explain it to the members opposite at report 
stage in committee of the whole.  We had 36 to 40 clauses in the 
bill.  In report stage we got to clause 3, then the time was up 
and we voted on everything.  My amendment was in clause 4.  We 
did not get to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to represent the members of the public who pay the 
bills and I did not even get to put in my amendment and tell 
members why they should vote for it.  They would probably not 
have done so anyway, but as a parliamentarian I should at least 
have the right to put forward ideas.  That is why I was elected. 
That is the only reason I can justify receiving any pay in this 
place at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, wanting to increase the esteem in which his 
members are held, thinks that can be achieved by giving them more 
money.  No, that can be achieved by allowing us to do our jobs as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is yet another example of where we are being inhibited 
from doing our jobs by government members in a hurry to jam 
through the legislation to give themselves a raise.  It is 
despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about my amendment because it is a good one and 
it is one of the reasons I am voting against the bill.  My 
amendment was not even really considered.  In fact I think we 
should have a new criterion whereby every Liberal who voted 
against my amendment would be eligible for a pay raise if any 
Liberal member could stand right now and tell me what my 
amendment was.  Not one of them even knew what it was.  I am sure 
of it.  They had little cheat sheets from their whip that said to 
vote against my amendment, that it was no good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it was good and they should have voted for it.  The 
amendment would have eliminated that part of the bill which 
provides for extra pay for members of committees who serve as 
chairmen and vice-chairmen.  Why am I opposed to that?  It is 
really very simple.  I believe that committee work is part and 
parcel of our jobs as parliamentarians.   When I was in the 
education industry I did a whole lot more than just stand in 
front of a class.  I did a lot of things on my own time for and 
with my students.  I did not get paid every time I lifted my 
finger for some extra thing that I was expected to do anyway, and 
there were some things I was not expected to do.  When I taught 
high school I ran a chess club with the kids.  I did not get paid 
for it and I would not have taken it if it had been offered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment would have taken away that clause so that committee 
chairmen and vice-chairmen would not have received extra pay.  I 
admit that the chairman of each committee has a little extra 
work.  Occasionally the chairman has to stand in front of the 
media and do interviews, but that is what the job is.  If one is 
elected to be the chairman of a committee, one is expected to 
know what is going on in that committee, just like all of us who 
are members of a committee.  When someone sticks a microphone in 
our faces and asks questions about what we are discussing in 
committee, any one of us could answer but usually it falls to the 
chairman, so we could give the chairman $10 an interview.  I 
would go for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government proposing?  The government is proposing 
to give a member $9,000 a year to be the chairman of a committee. 
The chairman has a staff of at least two people, usually closer 
to four, who do a lot of the work.  The chairman is a figurehead 
and the bill would give him or her $9,000 a year out of taxpayer 
money.  I am opposed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also consider the fact that the government wants to 
give $5,000 a year to vice-chairmen.  I find this really 
offensive.  I am one of the members of the finance committee.  I 
think it is fair to say that I attend more finance committee 
meetings than most of the other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago we were delayed in our committee for about 
10 or 15 minutes, with witnesses waiting.  Why?  Because the 
chairman was not there, the first vice-chairman was not there and 
the second vice-chairman was not there.  I told the clerk that I 
was ready to chair the meeting but she said it had to be one of 
the elected people.  They are elected by some process—and I wish 
I could have 40 minutes more to speak—that is nothing but an 
appointment by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would give the vice-chairmen $5,000 a year.  I would 
venture to say that the Conservative vice-chairman of our 
committee has been there about 50% of the time.  I think that the 
Liberal vice-chairman has only been at 2 meetings out of 30 all 
year.  Give them extra pay?  No way.  Yet my amendment did not 
get any consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you do not know how I regret that my time is up but 
I know there are others wishing to speak and I need to sit down.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for giving me the chance to speak briefly on the bill.  My 
colleagues on the opposition side have been talking about the 
whole notion of the amount of the pay as well as when it might 
kick in and about whether or not we should be paying a chair or 
vice-chair of a committee for the work they do aside from their 
responsibilities as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, what is lost in this whole debate is the fact that from 
here on in politicians would not really have the opportunity to 
set their salaries.  It would be done independently.  All of this 
decision making would be taken completely out of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, there would be a system in place that would look at 
the checks and balances, that would look at the cost of living. 
We would follow a formula that is not any different from what 
exists in the marketplace, what exists in government.  This is 
one thing that my colleagues on the opposition side seem to have 
missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that has been missed in this debate is that for 
the first time in a long time the amount of the pension that a 
member of parliament can accumulate over the years of serving in 
the House of Commons would be reduced.  It used to be 5%.  It was 
reduced a couple of parliaments ago to 4%.  Now it has gone 
further down, to 3%.  I am sure that if we were to look at the 
House now there would be five or six members of parliament who 
would qualify.  There would be a new system and a new regime for 
full pension in the House of Commons.  Under the new system it 
would take 25 years for a member of parliament to be eligible for 
full pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can cry and shout and jump and dance all we want, but at the 
end of the day members of parliament do not have the job 
flexibility of deciding how long they can serve.  A member of 
parliament can be tossed out after four years.  As a result, that 
member of parliament would not be eligible for his or her pension 
or any part of it.  A member of parliament could serve for two or 
three terms and the percentage of what they receive would not be 
more than 10% of the $131,000 that is now being proposed before 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this, something else was missed in this whole 
debate.  In regard to the eligibility of a member of parliament 
for receiving his or her pension, the age has changed.  A lot of 
people used to say before this that it was a known fact that 
someone could come into the House of Commons at the age of 24 or 
25, serve two terms, quit at 31, collect a pension and move on. 
That has changed.  Under the new regime, not only would a member 
need to have served for 25 years in the House of Commons as a 
member elected for seven or eight different parliaments, but the 
member would also have to be 55.  In other words there is no hope 
for any member of parliament who is under the age of 55 to 
collect a pension.  That also was missed from the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  It is not in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Yes, it is in the bill.  My colleague is 
saying it is not in the bill.  It has been in the bill and that 
part of the legislation has not changed.  That part of the 
legislation is still the same as when it was amended back in 
1994-95.  A member of parliament cannot collect a pension until 
that member reaches the age of 55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the question to ask my colleagues on the opposition side is 
whether or not they think it is fair for a member of the House to 
serve for 15 years, for example, and not be able to collect 40% 
of his or her pension if that member is 55 or 56 years of age.  I 
am sure they would agree that is a fair thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the component of this debate that has been missing is the 
whole tax free element for members of parliament.  This whole 
notion has been eliminated altogether.  Therefore, finally, 
members of parliament would be taxed like other members of the 
community.  We would pay taxes based on the total amount we earn 
as a Speaker or as a member of the opposition or a member of the 
government.  We would have the transparency that our 
constituents, the taxpayers, want us to provide them with.  We 
would say this is how much we earn and this is the amount of tax 
we pay.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves me with one issue.  That is the issue of the amount. 
Frankly, I think of my colleagues, especially the ones who come 
from the west or those who come from far east, who travel in some 
cases for 14 hours and languish at airports collecting dust for 
three or four hours.  If they miss a plane, they might end up 
waiting there for an extra six or seven hours and miss all of 
their constituency meetings, or if they have a family engagement, 
that will go down the tube.  I want any one of them to stand up 
and tell me whether or not it is fair to say that we should have 
a compensation package that is fair and equitable in order to 
allow that member of parliament to be compensated fairly. What is 
fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to agree with my colleague who spoke a little earlier. 
Yes, there are members of parliament who work their hearts out, 
day in and day out, who attend every single committee meeting, 
who speak on issues, who participate in communities, who work 
very hard and put in 70 to 75 hours per week.  There are others 
who probably do not work more than five or six or ten or twelve 
hours a week.  In an ideal world, one might wonder whether those 
two groups should be receiving the same amount of pay.  I do not 
know.  At the end of the day their constituents will decide 
whether or not they want to re-elect a member of parliament who 
is not working on their behalf in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be highly unfair for the government to propose 
legislation whereby there would be four or five different classes 
of members of parliament, where those who put in 80 hours would 
receive $131,000 and those who work 20 hours would receive less 
and so on.  We cannot do that.  The issue here is not whether one 
member of parliament is working as hard as another one.  Frankly, 
some of our colleagues probably do not deserve a raise, do not 
deserve to be paid at all and do not even deserve to be in the 
House of Commons, period.  However, who are we to pass that 
judgment in a democracy when at the end of the day it is the 
people who decide who their elected representative is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say in all fairness that what the government has 
proposed before the House of Commons is a fair and equitable 
package.  There have been a number of commissions that on a 
regular basis have proposed to the House of Commons a package 
that would reform the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a gentleman who was once on the opposition side.  His 
name is Jim Silye.  You probably recall him, Mr. Speaker.  He is 
now in Alberta.  I think he was the whip of the Reform Party.  He 
said at the time he was here that if the government were to bring 
in a package that would eliminate the tax free allowance and 
would propose $140,000 or $150,000 his party would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B>  It was $150,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was $150,000, my colleague 
has stated.  He said he would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has proposed a package of $131,000 absolutely 
taxable, whereby it has removed this whole notion of the tax free 
allowance, has removed the notion of members of parliament voting 
on their own salaries, has changed the pension from 4% to 3% and 
has maintained 55 years in terms of the ability of a member of 
parliament to receive his or her compensation.  To that extent, 
this is a fair package.  I call on my colleagues to put all 
partisanship aside and support the legislation so it can go 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. 
member for St. John's West, National Defence; the hon. member for 
Dauphin—Swan River, Immigration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are four points to this bill. 
In the course of debate a couple of others have been brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with those others first, one of those being 
the opt in clause.  In my opinion the opt in clause is really not 
part of the bill.  It has nothing to do with the legislation, the 
salary, the pension, the transparency or anything else.  It is 
nothing more than the pure gamesmanship that is displayed in the 
House from time to time, not only by the government but by many 
people in the House.  It should basically be discarded as if it 
were not there.  The second thing I have a problem with is not 
the legislation itself, but rather the speed with which the 
legislation was brought in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty with one the four parts of the bill that deals 
with pensions.  I have been fighting for years for pension 
reform.  I attempted to bring in a private member's bill for 
genuine consideration by all members.  I also attempted to bring 
in an amendment, but because of the short timeline and its 
complexity it was impossible to put into an acceptable form. 
Consequently my amendment, as drafted with the help of 
legislative counsel, was ruled out of order.  Even if it had been 
in order, because of the speed the bill went through committee of 
the whole consideration we would not have reached my amendment in 
any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has four distinctive parts and that is what we need to 
look at.  The first one deals with transparency, the elimination 
of the non-taxable portion of an MP's pay.  That is something we 
have been fighting for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the 1997 election the government virtually ignored the 
recommendations of the Blais commission.  It is nice to see this 
time, with a couple of exceptions or modifications, it is 
following what the report said.  It would have been better had it 
done that in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is to eliminate the non-taxable amount and gross it up 
so that we would end up with what is supposed to be the same pay. 
I will get to that point in a moment because it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also provides outside linkage for increases in the future so 
that MPs never again get into what is tantamount to a conflict of 
interest in trying to deal with their own remuneration, pensions 
and other benefits inside the House.  It takes it out of our 
hands and hopefully it will remain out of our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could argue all day on what it should have been linked to, 
whether it should have been linked to judges as it was or whether 
it should have been linked to the federal service at large.  That 
is an amendment I certainly would have supported. At least it was 
not linked to something that has no relevance to the House 
whatsoever, such as airline pilots, doctors or something of that 
nature, because it happened to suit somebody's notion of how to 
get a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we get to the raise itself.  Here is an area where no one 
was doing their homework.  According to the <I>Debates</I> and the 
newspapers we are talking about a 20% increase.  That is based on 
the assumption that $109,500 is the direct grossed up equivalent 
of what we were getting before the bill comes into effect.  That 
is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know who came up with that figure or how they arrived 
at it, but it does not take a whole lot of homework to check it 
out.  I phoned a tax accountant in my province of British 
Columbia who went through the tax tables and worked it out.  The 
balanced amount is not $109,500 but $115,100.  That means that 
the raise is not 20% but about 14%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will vary a little bit from province to province.  The raise 
is a bit more in Alberta, a bit less in Saskatchewan, and in 
Quebec taxes are higher still so the raise is even less than 14%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the parts of the debate that I heard no one seemed to 
raise a fact that appeared in one of the papers I was reading 
today which said that we have had a 2% raise every year for the 
past many years.  The truth of the matter is that over the past 
10 years we have had an aggregate total of a 6% increase, which 
is far behind any other sector including the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe personally that the pay raise is out line. 
Backdating it to January is a little inflammatory, kind of like 
when the postal strike was settled by legislating a settlement 
that was less than the employer had offered.  It was one of those 
unnecessary movements on the part of the government that only 
caused to inflame feelings unnecessarily. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the fourth and the only part of the bill to 
which I object dealing with the pension.  The pension amount 
would simply go up because the pay goes up.  The intent of the 
recommendations made by the commission was that it should go up 
exactly in line with the amount we were already getting. Other 
than the raise there would be no gain or no loss.  Keeping it at 
3% gives us a tremendous gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment I wished to put forward and my private member's 
bill presently before the House at first reading say that after 
getting rid of the non-taxable grossing up, as the bill has done, 
the pension of members of Parliament should be eliminated in its 
entirety. Instead all members should be placed in the federal 
public superannuation program, the same as all other public 
servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would provide a lot of benefits for MPs without it being a 
cost factor to Canadians.  It would allow newly elected MPs who 
previously worked in government at either the federal, provincial 
or municipal level, crown corporations, the RCMP, the military 
and many private corporations that have transfer agreements with 
the federal program, to transfer their pension and carry on.  It 
would also allow members who left this place and then worked for 
one of those areas to take their pension with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we leave this place our pension is on hold until we turn 
55.  If someone ends up out of service in their early forties 
their pension is based on their salary.  By the time they reach 
55, it is possibly based on a salary from as much as 15 years 
before.  It is better to carry the pension with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what I will do when it comes time to vote on the 
bill tonight because part of our policy and our principles is 
that MPs should not be voting on their pay.  Notwithstanding the 
fact that the party's policy states that, I have a greater 
problem with the fact that voting on this bill places my 
colleagues and I in a clear conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I voted for the bill at second reading because I wanted to get 
it to committee of the whole stage where it could be amended. It 
has gone through that stage without any amendment.  I did not 
vote on it at committee of the whole stage.  I may very well not 
vote on it intentionally when it comes up for a vote tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say for the record so there is no misunderstanding that I do 
not intend to opt out of the pay.  I earn what I earn in this 
place and I work as hard as other members.  Any member who takes 
an arbitrary stand to turn it down is being foolish.  He or she 
would be trying to make a point that I guarantee will be lost on 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 is a controversial bill.  At least we will be able to 
put it to rest.  Hopefully we are now balanced and never again 
will this type of legislation come to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would love to say it is a pleasure to rise today 
to address the bill, but it is not a pleasure because it is a 
very difficult issue for MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak to Bill C-28, an act to amend the 
Parliament of Canada Act, the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and the Salaries Act.  I want to address the 
general issue of the worth and value of MPs.  I recognize that 
this issue is a controversial one.  It is truly a political hot 
potato.  That is why I want to address it as reasonably and as 
sensitively as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the commissioners for their report.  I think they did a 
good job.  They held as many hearings as possible with Canadians. 
They tried to make their report as fair as possible.  I thank Ed 
Lumley, Jake Epp and Huguette Labelle for their service and for 
their good recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first good recommendation they made was to make our salary 
completely transparent by rolling the tax free expense allowance 
into a salary and thus calling it what it is.  Basically it has 
become a de facto salary over time.  It also makes MPs and 
lawmakers subject to the same tax laws as Canadians, a 
fundamental principle that should be followed in every democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They recommended that the pension contribution rates be lowered 
to 2.5%.  This was a step in the right direction because it would 
move us closer to private sector standards.  They also 
recommended a 20% pay raise, obviously the most controversial 
issue in the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the question of what MPs are worth.  I welcome this 
discussion as should all members in the House.  However the 
question is very difficult because of the uniqueness of our role. 
What is an MP worth?  Should we in the House be deciding what we 
are worth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be the first to recognize that MPs from all parties do 
work hard and deserve fair compensation.  Many who serve on 
committees do their homework.  They come prepared and they do 
background research.  They also serve their constituents well and 
are motivated by genuine interest.  However that is not the point 
because many Canadians work hard.  Many Canadians can point to 
putting in long hours, spending time away from their families, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the position that basically 
determines what an MP is worth and the salary should be based on 
this.  It should not be MPs in this House who determine what 
their salaries should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect is the opt in provision, which was not included 
in the report but which is included in the bill.  This to me is 
not good public policy and not good lawmaking.  It puts lawmakers 
in such a box that people who disagree with the process cannot 
stand up and voice their concern and displeasure with the 
process.  They are forced to make a choice as to whether they 
want to opt in or not.  We are boxed in.  It separates us into 
two categories and that is just not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all vote on bills in this House that we disagree with, for 
example, the gun registry bill and tax cuts, but the fact is that 
when the majority votes yea, both in this House and in the other 
chamber, the bill becomes law and we are all subject to the same 
law. That is the way bills should be made and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My real worry with the bill is the perception by Canadians of 
politicians and the institutions.  It is fair to say, and this is 
truly sad, that Canadians as a whole, certainly since the 1950s, 
have had a declining respect for politicians and parliamentary 
institutions.  I am not gladdened by this at all.  We should all 
be sad and think about what we can do to change this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do to change that?  We should not implement a 
process such as this to implement pay increases for ourselves. My 
main concern with this whole issue is the process.  We took a 
report that was tabled just recently, introduced a bill shortly 
thereafter, debated the bill for less than three days and will 
soon be voting on it and passing it into law.  Most Canadians 
must be wondering how we can possibly do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, even with respect to our party policy, why not let 
the report come out in the spring, let the commissioners go 
across the country during the summer to explain what MPs do and 
the value of their work, introduce a bill in normal time in the 
fall, have a full House debate on that bill and then implement it 
if it is fair?  That seems to me to be the more reasonable and 
rational way to do this, not to pass it just before the summer 
recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The optics of this are terrible.  Most Canadians are upset about 
the fact that we are voting on our own pay raise just before the 
summer recess.  We are adjourning after a very controversial 
period because of a lot of statements made by certain MPs from 
all sides of the House.  I am not trying to highlight that 
because it is unfortunate.  It is unfortunate that we are 
constantly highlighting MPs who make an offhand remark or an off 
colour remark.  We do not recognize the value of MPs from all 
parties who do work hard.  We should have used the opportunity to 
highlight those things but we did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other aspect that I am really displeased with is the fact 
that the bill took the commission's report and changed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently met the former premier of Alberta, Peter Lougheed.  I 
asked him how he dealt with this issue in Alberta.  He said that 
he had set up a commission telling the people beforehand that 
whatever they recommended would be implemented, that the 
lawmakers would not have a chance to amend it, and that it would 
simply be implemented as is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 would change the accrual rate for pensions from 2.5% 
to 3%.  It would change the retroactive pay from April 1 to 
January 1.  It would implement a 20% pay raise and has an opt in 
provision that was not in the report at all, which to me is the 
true travesty of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with MP salaries?  How should we deal with them? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, similar to what former Premier Lougheed recommended to 
me, we should do what the Canadian Alliance suggests which is 
parliamentary compensation should be recommended by an 
independent commission according to private sector standards. 
Second, the decision of parliament would be implemented after a 
subsequent election.  That would take the conflict of interest 
completely out of the issue and mean that I, as a 
parliamentarian, would not have to sit here and wonder whether I 
could stand up and vote against the bill or whether I could opt 
in or not opt in, and go through these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew before I ran what the compensation for an MP would be. 
Why should I be voting on a pay raise six months after being 
elected for the first time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should really link the whole issue to trying to raise the 
esteem of parliament and parliamentarians in the minds of 
Canadians.  We could have used this as an opportunity to do so, 
but sadly I do not think we have.  I know when I go back, I am 
going to see more disappointment on the faces of Canadians.  It 
will not increase the esteem of Canadians for their parliamentary 
institutions and that is a true tragedy of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to recommend, in terms of any pay raises 
for ourselves, is that we should always tie it to recognizing our 
worth as MPs, but moreover tie it to reforming parliament itself 
so that we truly empower MPs and send a signal to Canadians that 
their MPs are working very much on their behalf, before any pay 
increases are implemented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought 
it a good idea to speak today on a topic that is receiving a lot 
of press and on which all Canadians, almost without exception, 
have an opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by making it clear that I intend to support this 
bill.  I supported it at second reading and it is my firm 
intention to support it at third reading a bit later on today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the appropriate time, when there are forms to fill in, I 
intend to opt in to the new pay plan set out in Bill C-28.  I 
want this to be perfectly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that some 30 people have contacted me by 
telephone or in writing at my office this week.  A few of them 
were clearly in favour of the bill but most were against it. 
Among the latter, reaction was divided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost half of those against it oppose it for procedural reasons 
such as retroactivity or application.  They would like to see it 
apply to the 38th parliament, not the 37th.  They are also 
unhappy at how quickly Bill C-28 is being passed or how soon the 
increase will take effect.  Some of them would like it to be 
phased in over two, three or even four years.  The rest are 
simply against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few mentioned the opting in clause.  This clause has led to 
another kind of discussion in the debate.  Yesterday we learned 
that this clause would be permanent. 
I hope that, indeed, during the 38th parliament, if members get 
re-elected who had chosen not to adhere to the plan, this 
situation can be corrected to make things fair. I am also taking 
a stand on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to elaborate on the arguments that we heard in 
support of the bill. We heard several. Comparisons were made 
with the business world, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, the <I>Ottawa Business Journal</I> had two full pages 
listing the salaries of the heads of public corporations in the 
region. Their salaries ranged from $100,000 to $300,000. Some 
people earn several millions per year. I do not think it is 
appropriate to make this comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shareholders of a publicly traded company make a choice. 
They choose to join in and to buy shares, to become 
shareholders. By contrast, taxpayers, who will pay our salaries, 
do not make a choice. It is something that is imposed on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our salaries were also compared to those of athletes. It was 
even said that the Prime Minister is paid less than the minimum 
wages paid in the National Hockey League. We were told that the 
average salary in several professional leagues is one million 
dollars. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the comparison is appropriate because the 
salaries paid to these players are generated through revenues 
that the public is not required to contribute to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some also mentioned unions. In yesterday evening's news on the 
CBC, Mr. Lumley said that there are 200 union leaders in Ontario 
who are paid over $100,000. Again, this is not a perfectly 
appropriate comparison, but it is somewhat more, because the 
Rand formula requires all members of a union to pay union dues, 
but it is not a good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then arguments such as “We work impossible hours” were used. 
It is true our hours are long.  A typical day for a member may 
be 12 or 14 hours, easily, five, six and sometimes seven days 
a week. 
However, with all the respect due my colleagues, I do not 
believe this justifies what Bill C-28 is proposing.  My 
father-in-law was a taxi driver and he worked 12 hours a 
day regularly.  He worked as long as I do, so this is not an 
issue of hours of work.  I have a bit of a hard time with this 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like people to not take the issue of hours of work into 
account because in my opinion it is not a good reason for 
voting in favour of the bill, even though we do work long hours. 
We all wanted this job, so we must not complain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others cite pressure. 
It is true that there is pressure.  Often we are bombarded with 
requests of all sorts: requests for help or ways to find funding 
for a given project.  This sort of pressure is perhaps unique 
but in our society others who are policemen, nurses, teachers 
or air traffic controllers are also subject to pressure unique 
to them but real nevertheless.  Once again this argument 
does not hold as justification for supporting this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I am coming from instead is what we do as legislators. 
The three branches of government, the judicial, the executive and 
the legislative, are what I believe we should be using as a 
comparison basis.  It seems quite clear that over the last 30 
years we have systematically undervalued the role of the 
legislator in our society and in the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if one were to stop and think about that, we 
would see not only rationale but some encouragement to do what is 
being asked of us to do by voting for Bill C-28, which is to 
establish a basis of equilibrium between the judiciary, the 
legislative and the executive.  Not to do that is to undermine 
the importance of the legislators of this House and of the other 
House in the life of our country and how we govern ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some numbers have been given that show in the sixties the role 
of the MP was valued slightly more than judges.  However over the 
last 35 years it has been the opposite, and the role of the MP 
vis-à-vis a comparison to the judicial side has been much less. 
It has been the same with the executive.  We heard numbers that 
show what the top executives are paid.  I am talking about a 
public executive, not someone in the private sector, whether 
judicial, legislative or executive who is funded by the same 
taxpayer. That range is to $375,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what the legislators were valued at, then we see a 
huge discrepancy.  I think that is the genesis of some of the 
discredit that seems to be attributed to members of parliament, 
legislators and senators.  It behooves us to turn that around 
because the legislative function in a government is essential. It 
is a basis of democracy.  We have the role of legislators, and we 
also have the surveillance role. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of the legislative and monitoring roles of this 
House and its members cannot be neglected.  We have officers of 
the House, such as the Auditor General of Canada, the 
Commissioner of Official Languages, the Information Commissioner 
and the Privacy Commissioner, who report to the House. 
Everything turns upon the House and the legislative process, 
which naturally are responsible for setting the policies of the 
nation, the country, through the process of drafting and passing 
bills, but also through monitoring.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was vital for a start to be made at striking a 
balance between the value assigned to the judiciary, the 
legislative and the executive branches.  There is nothing 
personal involved here.  The voters will decide who is sent here 
or not in each riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we, as parliamentarians, have a responsibility to 
attribute to the legislative branch a value comparable to that 
attributed to the judiciary and the executive branch.  The 
legislative function of this chamber and the other is 
essential to the process of government, the democracy of this 
country.  It would be regrettable if this trend were allowed to 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the opportunity to reverse it by supporting this bill. 
I would invite all my colleagues to do so, so that we may 
recognize and enhance the value and importance of the 
legislative process and those involved in that process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Sometimes we say things when we do not have all the facts, and I 
need to make an apology.  I stated in my speech that the vice-chair 
of the finance committee was only there half of the time. 
He corrected me by saying he was there 80% of the time, and I 
need to apologize because it was false information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also made mention of the vice-chairman not being at a meeting. 
I was not aware that he is facing a difficult family situation, 
and I apologize to him for that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention and understanding but it is not a point of order.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-28, an 
act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act, the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Salaries Act, be read 
the third time and passed, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill and I will give my 
reasons for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons are simple.  There really is no need to make the 
bill retroactive to January 1.  It could have been made effective 
either at the date of royal assent of the bill or, as we had 
recommended, the day after the next election, which would have 
then prevented MPs from giving their own raise.  That was most 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also reject the bill on the basis that the 20% is excessive, 
given that all the other contracts that are being settled in the 
nation today are much less than that.  If we look at the small 
pittance that seniors are given in the country, one could hardly 
justify giving 301 members of the House of Commons 20%, when 
seniors usually get less than 1% per annum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take exception to the pension plan that was recommended 
by the commission to be 2.5%.  Somehow when it got into the hands 
of the members on the other side it became 3%.  Thus the annual 
amount that individuals will get ultimately is more than what 
they would get today given the increase in the pension amounts. 
That is against the recommendation of the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a labour negotiator for a number of years.  I have 
negotiated labour contracts with various unions around the 
country and I have never seen a labour agreement that said people 
had to opt in and if they did not they would never get a raise 
again.  Imagine if I sat at the table with the British Columbia 
Teachers' Federation or the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and 
Joiners of America or the teamsters, which I have, and said 
something like that?  Imagine what I would be dealing with?  That 
is the most preposterous position for anyone to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a fiduciary responsibility as an employer. 
Because it is the majority government in the House, it becomes 
the de facto employer when it is dealing with pay and benefits. 
No employer in the democratic world would say that if people did 
not opt in the employer would establish two pension plans, two 
payroll systems and inequity between people undertaking the same 
identical jobs.  It is unheard of in a democratic society.  It is 
unheard of at a negotiating table.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject this.  The trouble is that we are going to be made 
hypocrites over it if we do reject it and we end up signing into 
it because we would never ever get an increase again.  The 
government wants to tell the public that people who do that are 
hypocrites, which is another sign that the government in its 
fiduciary management responsibility with pay and benefits has no 
integrity whatsoever.

made on Monday, June 4, it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings to put forthwith every question necessary to dispose

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
S-14, an act respecting Sir John A. Macdonald Day and Sir Wilfrid

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now praise famous men,<BR> 
and our fathers in their generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lord apportioned to them great glory,<BR> 
his majesty from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were those who ruled in their kingdoms,<BR>

giving counsel by their understanding,<BR> 
and proclaiming prophecies;<BR> 
leaders of the people in their deliberations<BR> 
and in understanding of learning for the people,<BR> 
wise in their words of instruction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This passage from chapter 44 of Ecclesiasticus reminds us of the 
obligation of humanity to honour its great men and women, both of 
the present and of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians as a nation are a modest lot, which is in many ways an 
endearing quality.  I am reminded of the advice I was given many 
years ago before I moved to Nova Scotia.  I was told that things 
would be well if I simply remembered the chief operating 
principle of all Nova Scotians:  who the hell does he think he 
is?  I must say that in the past few days as the House has been 
considering the delicate subject of pay increases for MPs, I have 
heard more than one constituent express this very sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, however, for all their becoming modesty, do not seem 
well equipped to deal with greatness, to praise famous men and 
women.  This is partly because by definition greatness is in 
short supply at any given moment in history.  Indeed when we are 
confronted with true greatness, we are startled.  We hardly know 
how to react, so rare is the experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my time in the House we have met greatness in this Chamber in 
the persons of Vaclav Havel and Nelson Mandela.  There is 
something rarefied in the air, something special which is hard to 
define but utterly palpable, something which produces a sense of 
awe mingled with excitement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So too was it when Pierre Trudeau died and his body was brought 
last fall to Parliament Hill to lie in state.  The spontaneous 
decision of thousands of Canadians to come to Parliament Hill 
from all over the country to pay their last respects, to line up 
for hours before filing by his coffin, reminds us of the power of 
greatness to awaken within all of us profound feelings of wonder, 
awe and sadness.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who planned Pierre Trudeau's last trip to Ottawa were well 
aware of an earlier lying in state, that of Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
in February 1919.  The aptly named Laurier Lapierre, in his book 
<I>Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the Romance of Canada</I>, describes 
the scene: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country did well by him.  All the seats in the temporary 
House of Commons in the Victoria Memorial Museum were removed, 
except his, and the room was adorned in the purple and black 
colours of mourning.  He lay in the centre of the room in his 
open casket, candles surrounding him, flowers banked in 
profusion, and police officers guarding him.  After the officials 
had passed by, the doors were opened to the general public.  From 
about 7:00 p.m. on Thursday until the early hours of Saturday 
morning, fifty thousand of his countrymen and -women, many with 
their children, came to bid him farewell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, Ottawa, Hull and neighbouring municipalities were 
inundated with a mass of humanity.  Every hotel, <I>pension</I>, 
and empty room was occupied as, by every means of transport 
available, thirty-five thousand people came to take part in the 
national moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saturday, 22 February 1919, was a calm day with a fluttering of 
spring in the air.  By 9:00 a.m. thousands of people were already 
on the streets through which the funeral procession would pass. 
Soon thereafter, close to a hundred thousand were lined, six rows 
deep in many places, to await Wilfrid's passage. . . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 10:30, as the procession proceeded down Metcalfe Street, 
every train in the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, 
stopped, wherever it was, for one minute. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me in an admittedly roundabout fashion to Senate 
Bill S-14, an act respecting Sir John A. Macdonald Day and Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier Day, which I have the honour of introducing in 
the House of Commons today.  Its purpose is simple.  In the words 
of its proposer, Progressive Conservative Senator John 
Lynch-Staunton, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bill declares the birthday of each outstanding Canadian 
(January 11 and November 20) a national holiday as distinct from 
a statutory holiday.  Canadians too often are faulted with not 
being as familiar as they should be with their history, 
particularly how Confederation came about and its early years; 
honouring Macdonald and Laurier in such a special way will 
contribute greatly to correcting this deplorable situation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Liberal member of the House of Commons I am pleased to 
support the initiative of my Conservative Senate colleague.  It 
should be noted that this bill was given unanimous third and 
final reading in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a curious fact that Canada has no equivalent of 
Washington's birthday, presidents' day or Martin Luther King day. 
The closest we come is Victoria Day and her Quebec cousin, 
Dollard des Ormeaux, or perhaps our acknowledgement every 
September of Terry Fox.  This bill would begin to rectify that 
lack by honouring two of Canada's greatest prime ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some ways they make an odd couple.  They were men of totally 
different character and temperament.  Macdonald was a character, 
indeed almost a rogue.  What contemporary politician would dare 
boast in an election speech as he did “I know enough of the 
feeling of this meeting to know that you would rather have John 
A. drunk than George Brown sober”?  A man of artfulness and 
subtlety in politics, he was variously known over the course of 
his political life as Old Reynard, Old Tomorrow and The Wizard of 
the North.  As one anonymous Liberal member of the legislature 
was heard to mutter “Ah, John A., John A., how I love you!  How 
I wish I could trust you!” 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier, the first French Canadian to become Prime Minister of 
Canada, had a totally different personality. He was an elegant 
and refined intellectual, an extraordinary speaker, and there was 
a tragic dimension about his persona that was absent in 
Macdonald's case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had to face difficult tests during his political life, 
including the challenge of francophones outside Quebec, the 
Catholic Church in Quebec, the threat to national unity posed by 
World War I, and the challenge represented by compatriots such as 
Henri Bourassa. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two great men also had much in common.  John Raulston 
Saul, in his book <I>Reflections of a Siamese Twin</I>, argues 
that Canada was built over a century and a half through eight 
dramatic strategic acts.  Another term for these is national 
projects, deliberate, strategic acts of nation building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think of Macdonald and we think of confederation itself, or 
the national policy or the building of the transcontinental 
railway.  We think of Laurier and we think of the building of the 
west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These great national projects were the acts of great men.  They 
were not incrementalists.  They were risk takers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members to listen to Macdonald defending his 
railway policy in 1873: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have fought the battle of Confederation.  We have fought the 
battle of unity.  We have had party strife, setting Province 
against Province.  And more than all, we have had, in the 
greatest Province, every prejudice and sectional feeling that 
could be arrayed against us.  I throw myself on this House; I 
throw myself on this country; I throw myself on posterity, and I 
believe that, notwithstanding the many failings of my life, I 
shall have the voice of this country rallying round me.  And sir, 
if I am mistaken in that, I can confidently appeal to a higher 
court—to the court of my conscience and to the court of 
posterity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the authentic voice of a great leader.  These were men 
of vision who were not content to accept things as they were. 
They were creators.  They were agents of change.  They were also 
great humanists, apostles of tolerance and respect in an era that 
was decidedly less respectful and tolerant than our own. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what Laurier said at Montreal's National Club: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, people of French origin, have a sense of our own 
individuality. We want to pass on to our children the language we 
inherited from our ancestors. But while we cherish this feeling 
in our hearts, we refuse to admit that it is incompatible with 
our being Canadians. We are citizens of Canada and we intend to 
fulfil all the duties that this title implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, whenever we invite men from another race 
to our table, we affirm that they are our fellow citizens, 
just like they affirm that we 
are their fellow citizens. Our country is their country: their 
political opinions are our political opinions; our aspirations 
are their aspirations. What they want, and what we want, is that 
the rights of minorities be respected; that our constitutional 
guarantees be safeguarded; that the provinces remain sovereign 
and that Canada be united in its diversity. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the House now praise two famous men, two great Canadians, by 
voting to support Bill S-14, an act respecting Sir John A. 
Macdonald day and Sir Wilfrid Laurier day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the official 
opposition to address Bill S-14, an act respecting Sir John A. 
Macdonald day and Sir Wilfrid Laurier day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. was born on January 11, 1815 and was of course our 
first prime minister.  Sir Wilfrid Laurier was born on November 
20, 1841, and was the prime minister of Canada from 1896 to 1911. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the purpose of the bill is to 
designate January 11 of every year as Sir John A. Macdonald Day 
and November 20 of every year as Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day. 
I also understand that a variation of the bill was introduced in 
the last parliament only honouring Sir John A. Macdonald and to 
remove a partisan twinge in the other place, I say the other 
place is not represented by the elected commons and therefore 
that caveat does not play well here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make clear that the bill does not ask for the 
declaration of a national holiday.  It is simply recognizing two 
great Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We approve in principle any efforts to allow Canadians to 
appreciate their history.  The fact that these two great 
Canadians come from different traditions is a very positive 
thing.  We feel that the bill will put these dates on the 
parliamentary calendar, the national calendar and will provide an 
opportunity for teachers, for parents and for Canadian society to 
honour the memory of two great Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inasmuch as there is no attempt to declare these days official 
holidays, there is no financial implications to Canadians, 
employers and otherwise.  We think that is a very positive aspect 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reflecting on the contribution of these great Canadians, I 
came across a debate about the contributions by Sir John A. 
Macdonald in the early days when they were considering this 
union.  I would just like to state a brief quote where Sir John 
A. was speaking about this union.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this union takes place we will be at the outset no 
inconsiderable people.  We find ourselves with a population 
approaching four millions of souls...And with a rapidly 
increasing population...our future progress, during the next 
quarter of a century, will be vastly greater. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was received with cheers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And when, by means of this rapid increase, we become a nation of 
eight or nine millions of inhabitants, our alliance will be 
worthy of being sought by the great nations of the earth. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members responded “Hear, hear”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to reflect that at the time of independence, 
1931, Canada's population was around 10.5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to reinforce our sense of identity.  We do well 
to remember men and women of distinction who have contributed 
greatly to these institutions of democracy that we now labour to 
protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier are without doubt 
worthy of this recognition.  We support the bill, and we hope 
that it will contribute to our appreciation of our history and 
our heritage as Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I had not planned to speak to this bill, and I apologize 
to the mover for not having prepared remarks because I think it 
is the kind of topic on which one would have liked to have had 
the time to do a little research and perhaps to have come up with 
some worthy quotations from both Macdonald and Laurier, 
particularly with respect to Macdonald and some of the anecdotes 
somewhere along the line already engaged in by the member who 
introduced the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly like to speak in favour of the motion in its 
particularity, that is to say the idea of having a day to honour 
Macdonald and Laurier.  Generally, I would like to speak in 
favour of more opportunities for Canadians to reflect upon their 
history and for Canadians to know their history better than they 
do, because I would say that one of the weaknesses of Canada as a 
nation is that we do not know our history as well as we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that in many of the constitutional 
debates we have had in the country we might have been able to 
have had more intelligent debates, more constructive debates if 
people had been more aware of their history and more aware of the 
particular traditions out of which people were operating, out of 
which they were thinking, speaking and acting when they were 
participating in those debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean to say that it would have eliminated 
disagreement, because I think any study of Canadian history will 
show that there have always been different ideas about the 
country.  There have always been different ideas about the role 
of the central government ever since the initial debate about 
confederation. 
There have always been different ideas about how much power 
should reside with the provinces.  There have been a number of 
different ideas about Canada all competing with each other within 
the bosom of this great country we call Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To name a particular day after Macdonald and Laurier is 
appropriate because within those two names is contained at least 
two of the contending views of the country, although there would 
be a great overlap between them as well.  Nevertheless, one 
remembers that it was Sir Wilfrid Laurier who was the first prime 
minister to consider free trade with the United States, and it 
was Sir John A. Macdonald who was the creator and defender of the 
national policy, which was not a free trade policy but rather a 
policy which intended to create more of a national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that debate being lived out even today within Canada with 
respect to free trade, although I must say that the free trade 
that we have today is far more extensive and far more destructive 
than anything that Sir Wilfrid Laurier had in mind when he 
defended the idea of reciprocity.  That had to do only with 
tariffs.  It did not have to do with investment, services and 
energy.  It did not really have to do with incarnating or 
entrenching a whole philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to wander into the free trade debate.  I want to 
stick with the idea that we should know our history better and 
that any designation of days, such as the bill suggests, which 
would help Canadians to do that should be supported.  It might 
become an occasion in schools in particular, but also in other 
places for Canadians to reflect on their history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many who lament the fact that Canadian history is not 
taught as much in our school system as it should be.  It seems to 
me that we do a very poor job of that.  Knowing Canadian history 
should not be an option.  It should be something that every 
Canadian kid should have a good grasp of by the time he or she 
gets out of high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For children to simply take one course in grade 11, another 
course three or four grades back of that, and spend most of their 
time learning about the very early days of Canada with regard to 
explorers and everything else but never really knowing as much 
about our history in both the 19th century and the 20th century 
as I think people should know, is a fault of our school system. I 
know the history is in the textbooks, but I do not think we spend 
enough time on it.  I wanted to use this opportunity to register 
that particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this is the kind of bill that might pass.  I understand 
it is votable, although I hope that it does not come to a vote 
today because I think other members may want to speak to it. 
That is partly why I am on my feet, to ensure that the debate 
does not collapse within the first hour.  It is something we 
would like to hear more members on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the mover of the motion in the other place and here 
for giving us the opportunity to reflect, however inadequately, 
on Canadian history and on these two great prime ministers.  One 
who had this vision of a country on the northern half of the 
North American continent that would be different and distinct 
from the United States of America and another who had a vision 
somewhat later, when we were receiving more immigrants from all 
around the world, of a country that was tolerant and diverse and 
respectful of minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these visions need to be nurtured.  As I already indicated 
the vision of Prime Minister Laurier with respect to a diverse 
and tolerant society that respects minorities is being nurtured, 
but I think the vision of Sir John A. Macdonald of a different 
and distinct country on the northern half of the North American 
continent is a vision that is in great peril.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An argument could be made that Macdonald would be rolling over 
in his grave if he could see the extent to which the country has 
become integrated into the North American economy and the extent 
to which it has come under the sway and domination, both 
ideological and political, of the country from which he sought to 
set Canada apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forgive me if I use this time not to make a partisan point but 
to talk about something a great many people are very concerned 
about, and that is the project we call Canada.  The hon. member 
spoke of national projects.  The project we call Canada has had 
various mini projects along the way or various stages of the 
project.  Our concern in the NDP is that we are in a project now 
that is quite antithetical to all previous projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a world where we talk about a North American economic 
union, adopting the U.S. dollar and continental energy projects. 
These kinds of things would have driven Sir John A. Macdonald 
around the bend.  They might have driven him to drink. Indeed 
they might have driven him to have a few more than he might 
otherwise have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly ask hon. members to consider this when we 
honour our history and honour the ideas some of our prime 
ministers had.  Let us be vigilant and careful that we are not, 
by dearth of uncritical attraction to various new ideas or 
so-called new ideas, because some of what passes for new ideas 
these days is just old 19th century capitalism being repackaged 
and shoved down our throats, that when we pay homage to these 
individuals we are not by accident or design destructive of their 
visions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member recalled the time of Prime Minister Laurier's 
funeral and the most recent time of mourning having to do with 
the death of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  We might remember another 
time in recent history when Canadians gathered from all walks of 
life, and certainly throughout western Canada, to pay homage to 
Prime Minister John Diefenbaker who, for all his faults and 
certainly his partisan faults, had a vision of Canada as 
something very distinct from the United States.  He was not a 
member of the party I belong to, but certainly a great many 
western Canadians and I am certain Canadians from other parts of 
Canada, shared that vision with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a sense that Mr. Diefenbaker had, along with Sir John A. 
Macdonald, which sometimes got him into trouble with the United 
States of America.  I would put that on the record as we;; 
because it is something New Democrats hold dear, not the memory 
of John Diefenbaker but the idea of a distinctive country on the 
northern half of the North American continent, something that is 
different, more compassionate, more caring and more sharing.  Let 
us defend that to the death.

is a pleasure and an honour to speak this evening to a bill which 
has been unanimously passed in the other place and which recalls 
the contribution to this great country of two extremely 
honourable gentlemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we suggest to others that we are to bring in a bill to 
honour Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, there will 
probably be other people who will say we should wait because 
there are other prime ministers who have made a greater 
contribution to the country.  Were there?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to give one person credit for bringing this great 
country together we would have to focus on the efforts and 
leadership of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first prime minister of 
Canada.  Every time we look at a picture of the Fathers of 
Confederation and see Macdonald standing there with his bushy 
hair, a lot more bushy than mine or my colleague's from the 
Canadian Alliance, he stands out in more ways than one.  There is 
an awe about him that we see in very few people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the seventh prime minister if I remember my 
history correctly, and the first French Canadian prime minister, 
was known to be a silver-tongued orator.  Some of the phrases he 
issued about the country would make anyone feel proud to be 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about what Macdonald and Laurier envisaged this 
great country of Canada to be, and then look at the state of the 
country today, I can hear Laurier in some of his more pointed 
dialogues talking about the unity of the country.  I will read 
one.  I will read a little quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all Canadians.  Below the Island of Montreal the water 
that comes from the north from Ottawa unites with the waters that 
come from the western lakes, but uniting they do not mix.  There 
they run parallel, separate, distinguishable, and yet are one 
stream, flowing within the same banks, the mighty St. Lawrence, 
and rolling on toward the sea bearing the commerce of a nation 
upon its bosom—a perfect image of our nation.  We may not 
assimilate, we may not blend, but for all that we are still the 
component parts of the same country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How often in recent days or even in recent years have we heard 
this type of oration in a place similar to this?  I would suggest 
it has been quite some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Macdonald and Laurier were opponents in and out of 
the House, one a Liberal and one a Conservative, they were not 
opponents when it came to fighting for what they both believed 
in: a strong, united country where everybody, regardless of 
religion, race or language, lived and worked together for the 
benefit of the great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laurier felt so strongly about it that he said the 19th century 
was the century of the United States in terms of its development, 
but that the 20th century would be the century for Canada and 
Canadian development.  He undoubtedly felt that others who came 
after him would show the same leadership and insight as to what 
the country could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However somewhere along the line we have failed.  I think of the 
dream of unity and then look at the disunity in the House and 
within parties.  I look at my friends in the Canadian Alliance 
who are conservatives and at my friends in the Progressive 
Conservative Party who are also conservatives and they are in the 
far reaches of the House at separate ends.  I look at people here 
who tell us that their job is to take their province out of the 
country rather than to use their collective skills and wisdom to 
strengthen this great country.  When I look at these things I ask 
where we have failed Laurier and Macdonald.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Macdonald say?  In addition to the work he did in 
leading this great country and uniting the land physically by the 
construction of the railway, he too had some quotes we should 
never forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Macdonald talked about the French.  He had learned that any 
relationship with the French depended on respect.  If treated as 
a nation they would act generously, as free people generally do. 
If called a faction they would become factious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In old age, Macdonald declared: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no accord with the desire expressed in some quarters that 
by any mode whatever there should be an attempt made to oppress 
the one language or render it inferior to the other:  I believe 
that would be impossible if it were tried, and it would be 
foolish and wicked if it were possible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we learned from that?  I do not know.  I guess history will 
decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came here and walked into this honourable Chamber I was 
asked if it was my greatest, most memorable political moment.  I 
said no.  My most memorable political moment to date was when I 
sat in the legislature in Newfoundland and saw Meech Lake 
scuttled.  That night I said to myself something, which I hope 
will be incorrect, “I think this is the night we jeopardized the 
future of this great country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour and a privilege to stand here and talk about 
these two great men who made such an impression on this nation, 
not only by what they did but by what they said.  Their words, if 
we read them, listen to them and heed them, can be an example for 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the waters from the west blend with the waters that flow 
through the St. Lawrence and into the ocean, so too do the 
energies of the people of the territories, British Columbia, the 
western provinces, central Canada and on to the Atlantic.  If we 
only believed in this nation as did Laurier and Macdonald, we 
would not be having some of the petty problems we are having 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps if we focus a little less on ourselves individually and 
a little more on our nation, as did Macdonald and Laurier, 
somewhere along the line people might look at us as 
parliamentarians and say that we too made a contribution to this 
great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased and proud to support the bill and I hope others 
will also.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to comment on Bill S-14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill seeks to honour two of our greatest prime ministers, 
Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  It would 
designate the birthdays of these outstanding Canadians as special 
days, helping to commemorate their remarkable contributions to 
the building of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before commenting any further on the bill itself, I would like 
to offer my congratulations to the member of the other place for 
his initiative in proposing this piece of legislation. Like the 
hon. member of the other place, I believe we must work constantly 
and creatively to identify appropriate ways of preserving and 
celebrating our shared heritage as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only by fully understanding our history and learning about the 
lives and accomplishments of the women and men who have built 
Canada, can we know who we are, and fully appreciate what it 
means to be Canadian.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this bill is clear.  It represents an act of 
respect and acknowledgement for these two towering figures of 
Canadian history, one, a Father of Confederation and the first 
Prime Minister of Canada, and the other, Canada's seventh prime 
minister, one of our nation's most powerful and articulate 
advocates for national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that Canadians are all familiar with the 
lives and accomplishments of Sir John A. and Sir Wilfrid.  For 
people in this room today, that is almost certainly true. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However beyond this room in other rooms, other cities and other 
places across Canada that knowledge may be less widely shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians know that Sir John A. Macdonald led the effort to 
make Confederation a reality.  He drafted the British North 
America Act defining the federal system by which the original 
four provinces were united as one country on July 1, 1967.  He 
became Canada's first prime minister and went on to help forge a 
strong and vibrant nation.  He launched the Intercolonial Railway 
which would eventually provide a key physical link for Canada 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast in the vast largely 
unsettled land in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of Sir Wilfrid Laurier?  Many Canadians recognize him as an 
eloquent and staunch promoter of national unity and as the first 
Canadian of French origin to become prime minister, but how many 
know that he held the longest unbroken term of office as prime 
minister from 1896 to 1911, a period during which his unshakeable 
confidence in Canada fostered unprecedented growth and prosperity 
for the young country?  These are not matters we can take for 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member from the other place has demonstrated through his 
proposed bill, if we care about preserving and celebrating the 
achievements of these great Canadians we must take the initiative 
to ensure that their contributions to Canada are recognized. What 
is less clear about the bill, however, is whether by moving at 
this time to enact it we are taking the most appropriate and 
effective means to honour these exceptional Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting aside special days celebrating the achievements of great 
Canadians is a well established and time honoured tradition, but 
the 21st century offers new opportunities that may be even more 
effective in engaging the interest and imagination of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New technologies and communications modes are providing 
exciting, new ways to celebrate and educate, opportunities to 
achieve this same goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As more and more Canadians are connected to the World Wide Web, 
information on virtually every aspect of our society, past and 
present, has become accessible to citizens, no matter where they 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had a computer with me right now and I initiated a search 
for information on Sir John A. Macdonald or Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 
I would have instant access to a combined total of more than 
18,000 websites devoted to these great Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Literally, at my fingertips, I would be able to draw upon an 
astonishing range of information and visual images.  I would be 
able to review speech texts and quotations, copies of historical 
and more recent media commentary, academic analysis, and on and 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information revolution and the advent of new technologies 
are making it increasingly possible for Canadians to log on to 
their history, as well as to the latest stock quote or sports 
score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, in recognizing the value and potential 
of the Internet, is committed to help Canadians exploit the 
opportunities being made possible by the Web. This recognition of 
the increasingly important role and potential of the Internet is 
at the core of our government-on-line strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through government online the Government of Canada is committed 
to becoming by 2004 the government most connected to its 
citizens.  This not only involves more efficient and timely 
citizen access to government information services.  It also means 
using the Internet and new technologies to offer Canadians 
greater access to their institutions and their shared history.

to take a virtual tour of the Parliament Buildings and the 
parliamentary precinct, including the offices, parliamentary 
corridors and House of Commons seats where these two great 
Canadians did their important work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Canadian Heritage is playing a leading role in 
the government online initiatives, especially with respect to 
Canadian content.  We have an unprecedented opportunity to use 
the Internet to connect with our past as well as with each other. 
Strengthening this connection is a goal that we all share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the bill recognizes, both Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier were forwardlooking men who saw nation building 
and unity as the road to Canada's future.  Each made profound and 
lasting contributions to achieving a strong and united Canada. 
The proposed legislation presents one very tangible means of 
paying tribute to their legacies and, for this reason alone, I 
believe the bill to be worthy of support in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, it must be recognized that enacting the bill 
would likely generate calls for similar honours to be bestowed on 
other great Canadians.  That is not a simple issue to resolve. 
At what point do we draw the line in creating recognition days 
for those who have played a significant role in building our 
country? What standards and criteria do we set in determining who 
to honour and, most important, who to leave aside? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opening the door to demands for specially declared days, we 
risk diminishing the value and significance of such an honour, 
the exact opposite of what this bill hopes to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are points for careful consideration.  The good intent and 
purpose of this bill are beyond question.  What we must not 
be afraid to question is whether this proposed legislation 
represents the best way to pay tribute to the great Canadians it 
is intended to honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have tried to suggest, there may be other options, such as 
the application of new technologies and the Internet, that may 
help achieve the same ends. 
The decision on which options are best is up to you.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure and honour to debate Bill 
S-14.  I had a similar motion in fact— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There are two items that have been agreed to by all the House 
leaders and I am wondering if there would be consent to adopt 
them at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first item involves concurrence in the 26th report of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs presented to 
the House earlier this week on a committee change to the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts.  I would be seeking concurrence in 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Madam Speaker, I understand that the 
second item was also agreed to by all House leaders.  It was the 
approval of a travel request for the Standing Joint Committee on 
Scrutiny of Regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, one of the reasons it is 
a pleasure for me to rise to debate Bill S-14 is that it is in 
part reflective of a private member's bill I had in this place in 
the last parliament which would have formally recognized the 
birthday of our first great prime minister, Sir John A. 
Macdonald. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see that one of the great parliamentarians 
in the other place, Senator Lynch-Staunton, has initiated this 
legislation and that a very fine parliamentarian in this place, 
the hon. member for Don Valley West, has chosen to introduce it. 
He himself is an advertisement for the need for parliamentary 
reform, that a member with such talents should be stuck in the 
backbenches.  I ask the member to please not include that in his 
election brochure against the Canadian Alliance candidate next 
time.  However I do believe that members such as he are a very 
good reason for empowering members of parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was about to enter the debate by simply commenting on the 
importance of the bill and how important it is to have a deeper 
understanding of our history.  I was hoping to be completely 
non-partisan, as is the convention here, but I must say I was 
disappointed with the intervention of my colleague from 
Parkdale—High Park for whom I have considerable personal 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speech must have been written by a bureaucrat in the 
department of heritage and handed to the parliamentary secretary. 
To suggest that we not pass a bill recognizing our two greatest 
prime ministers because we are not sure what criteria we should 
apply is precisely the problem in Canadians not recognizing our 
history in an appropriate fashion.  The bureaucratic notion that 
the selection of the founding prime minister and the first great 
Liberal French Canadian prime minister above others is somehow an 
offence to equality or an offence to standards of political 
correctness is offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the idea that we can properly recognize these prime 
ministers through some Internet program.  How did we get on to 
government connectedness and so on?  With respect, the attitude 
articulated by the parliamentary secretary to the heritage 
minister reflects precisely what is wrong about the recognition 
of Canadian history by the official culturecrats in the 
department of heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That really has me spitting mad because there should be no 
question at all.  We do not need to devise committees of 
bureaucrats, experts or politicians to say that there are two 
great and outstanding prime ministers who stand above all others 
in our early history, Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier, and that they deserve some formal institutional 
recognition not just of parliament but of all Canadian people. 
That ought not to be a matter of contention or debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these prime ministers recognized that Canada was a unique 
experiment in the history of liberal democracy, that it was in 
many respects a confluence of our British heritage and traditions 
with the culture, language and uniqueness of the French faction 
in North America, and in some respects kept an eye on the liberal 
republican democratic experiment in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that light we can look to how our friends in the United 
Kingdom and the United States celebrate their heroes.  I submit 
that both these countries have a very vivid and robust 
understanding of their particular histories, traditions and the 
great figures in those histories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only walk down the Mall in Washington, D.C., to see the 
statues and monuments of their great past presidents, Abraham 
Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, great generals 
and figures of American history.  They have entrenched the memory 
of these men, mainly men, who were central in the history of 
their founding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly in the United Kingdom one can walk down the Mall in 
London and in Westminster parliament to see and feel a connection 
with history and tradition.  One can recognize in a very vivid 
and robust way the central role of the monarch as the central 
political institution of the United Kingdom.  Those traditions 
are celebrated in many different and vivid ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable that in Canada, with those examples before us, 
those examples of our two closest and best friends, we lack that 
kind of robust celebration of our great historical figures and 
the great moments in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill.  Symbols are important, but 
regrettably we do not maximize the values of our symbols in 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that if John A. Macdonald or Wilfrid Laurier were to 
see the motion before us today they would find it ironic and 
would undoubtedly vote against it, in part because they would see 
the sort of recognition of mere politicians in a constitutional 
monarchy as something inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do think that these great men, who contributed so 
much to carve out of the northern half of this wild, intemperate 
continent a nation as unique as this, deserve our recognition in 
a very formal way, which this bill would seek to do by 
recognizing their birthdates on January 11 and November 20 
respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of years ago a new think tank called the Dominion 
Institute conducted a survey of young Canadians to ascertain 
their familiarity with Canadian history.  Regrettably, it found a 
shocking degree of ignorance among younger Canadians about our 
central historical moments and persons.  In fact, I think fewer 
than one-quarter of young Canadians could actually name our 
founding prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever excuse we have had for Canadian history in the school 
system has not worked.  We need to reinforce national symbols of 
our history.  Through such symbols people will learn what they 
may not learn in school about the central people and events in 
our history.  That is one reason why the bill should be 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that there is a kindling of understanding about 
the need to revive Canadian history.  Jack Granatstein wrote an 
excellent book entitled <I>Who Killed Canadian History?</I> which 
is an excellent survey of this issue.  The foundation of the 
Dominion Institute itself was dedicated to reviving an interest 
in Canadian history.  A recent first time publication by 
Stoddart, <I>Canada's Founding Debates</I>, is a compendium of the 
founding debates at the time of Confederation.  It allows lay 
people a very accessible window on the debates that founded this 
parliament and this Dominion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from an intervention by John Macdonald at the 
legislative assembly on February 6, 1865 in speaking about his 
plans for this new federation.  He said “We should feel 
sincerely grateful to beneficent providence that we have had the 
opportunity vouchsafed us of commonly considering this great 
constitutional change, this peaceful revolution, that we have not 
been hurried into it like the United States by the exigencies of 
war, that we have not had a violent revolutionary period forced 
on us as in other nations.  Here we are in peace and prosperity, 
a dependent people with a government having only a limited and 
delegated authority and yet allowed without restriction and 
without jealousy on the part of the mother country to legislate 
for ourselves and peacefully and deliberately to consider and 
determine the future of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was, in a way, a modest vision but for a very immodest 
project, this country.  We owe so much to the great and sacred 
memory of these two men that the passage of the bill is a trifle. 
I hope that the bill is votable and that all members will support 
it.  I regret that there is one party in this place that has not 
even submitted a speaker to this bill, which is a reflection of 
the need for us to reinforce our remembrance of these great 
figures.

received letters thanking them for their participation in the

However the interesting point about the contract was that it was 
changed or amended after the firm got it.  Was it to sell off

</I></B></P><P align=left>I equate that to someone calling a tender to sell off used car 
tires and when all the bids are in and a favourite bidder happens 
to get the nod, the contract is suddenly amended and he is also 
asked to sell 40 Buicks and 15 Cadillacs, with the ensuing profit 
going to that friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perception is reality.  Both the perception and the reality here 
are not very pleasant for one to look at or to read about.  It is 
the type of stuff that governments and politicians should not be 
involved with.  If there is a bidding process, if there is a 
tender call, then whatever that tender call is we should live 
with it, not amend and adjust to increase it tremendously for the 
benefit of perhaps those who get the job, provided they are our 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern about the sale is that a lot of the parts were 
stored in a warehouse in the United States.  The people involved 
with that were also involved in some illegal activity in that 
country, according to the records.  That left many people 
concerned about the security of the products and whether or not 
we could end up losing them if the company involved went into 
bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not give a clear cut answer to either, but he 
gave no answer at all to the question as to why the contract to 
sell parts was amended.  I know the answer will be:  What is the 
definition of a part?  When we talking about parts we are not 
talking about Challenger jets or about helicopters.  The question 
mainly that was unanswered is why that contract was amended to 
include them after the fact.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, on the 
issues raised by the hon. member, Lancaster Aviation was the 
company in question which won competitive contracts in 1997 and 
again in the year 2000 for the disposal of surplus aerospace 
assets, not simply parts.  I recommend the member look at the 
contract to verify that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 contract contemplated special project sales such as 
planes.  When such a need arises the contract called for an 
amendment to be made to legally bind the parties with regard to 
this special project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sale of the surplus aircraft was conducted to the letter of 
the law and certainly with the interest of Canadian taxpayers in 
mind.  The member is quite right that 40 Twin Huey helicopters 
were sold to the U.S. department for approximately $20 million 
U.S. and 8 Challenger aircraft were sold to DDH Aviation of Texas 
as a result of a competitive tender for approximately $30 million 
U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lancaster was paid a fair commission for its services as per the 
terms of the contract.  It is true that Lancaster was using a 
facility in Florida for warehousing purposes only.  The assets 
were warehoused in Florida because that is where the market is. 
The assets are not and were not in danger.  They are the property 
of the Department of National Defence and are only in the custody 
of the contractor.  Lancaster is also responsible for the 
safekeeping of the assets and is fully liable for any losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would close by saying that if the member has any knowledge of 
any illegalities or allegations of wrongdoing, the appropriate 
course of business is to refer such matters either to the 
minister or to the RCMP if that is the nature of the item.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the question I asked of the Minister for 
Citizenship and Immigration was about why Canada continues to 
harbour the criminal elements of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have read in the newspapers throughout these last few 
years about the illegal criminals entering the country. Canadians 
are asking why are we allowing these criminals to enter the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have also heard names like Gaetano Amodeo and Lai 
Changxing.  In fact they have become household names in the 
country over the last few years.  We have put a lot of effort 
into protecting these criminals who enter the country.  While we 
do this, we put other Canadian citizens at risk.  We put Canadian 
visitors at risk.  An example is the Sklarzyk family who was 
recently deported back to Poland.  Who is looking after their 
rights?  Who is looking after the rights of Serge Kisluk?  This 
gentleman passed away just recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Marsha Skrypuch from a newspaper article. 
She is a children's author and met Kisluk while researching a 
novel about a girl whose grandfather was accused of war crimes. 
She said that she was appalled at the process that had been used 
to condemn Mr. Kisluk.  She stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are 50-year-old cases, and evidence won't hold up in a 
criminal court, so they use the immigration rules instead.  The 
reality is that there just isn't enough evidence.  Innocent people 
get hurt.  You end up with a bunch of little old men trying to 
defend themselves against the state. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is defending his rights?  Who is defending the rights of 
people like Oberlander and Odynsky?  How many criminals are 
there in Canada?  I do not think anyone knows.  What we do know 
is that there are at least 15,000 warrants out for people who are 
in the country who should not be here.  They should have left a 
long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are letting too many criminals through the front door.  Why? 
Because the front door is wide open.  The Canadian Alliance has 
said for a long time that there should be necessary screens put 
in place to screen out the undesirables so they do not enter the 
country.  Certainly with technology that should not be an 
impossible task.  In fact the standing committee recommended that 
in its last report to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would say that Canadians support an open 
immigration policy but not at the expense of national security. 
The minister, as the auditor general has said in his report, can 
improve the system without Bill C-11.  In fact Bill C-11 would do 
very little.  It would basically penalize the legal migrants and 
refugees to this country.  So instead of just talking about doing 
the job, I would only hope that the immigration minister would 
walk the talk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to deal with the main issue raised by the member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously he made reference to a specific case which we cannot 
go into any detail on.  However I can assure the hon. member that 
the processing time for applications for permanent residents is 
not static.  They vary according to how many applications are in 
the process at any given time and available resources to process 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  In the year 2000, 50% of all the 
applicants who applied for permanent residence in the business 
immigration category took roughly 11 months to process.  This 
means of course that some were longer than 11 months and some 
were shorter.  However I can assure the hon. member that in this 
case the allegations that were brought out concerning Gaetano 
Amodeo were completely and utterly unfounded. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, all members of parliament make representations to 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. It is our duty to 
do so when our constituents ask us for some information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators, members of parliament, and even our colleague from 
Dauphin—Swan River, I am sure, have made representations to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration on specific applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, we received 40,000 requests for information. In the 
national capital region, there were in excess of 6,000 
representations made, some of them by myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the role we play, our duty to our constituents, and we 
play it with the best intentions possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
