ALLOWANCES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John)</B> moved that Bill C-208, an 
act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak about my first bill to be tabled in the House 
and why it should be adopted. This bill responds to the concerns 
expressed by many Canadians on MPs' pensions.
<P>
	We all agree as members we are contributing substantially to 
our pension plan. It is true that only about one-quarter of the 
MPs elected will stay long enough to collect a pension. This 
being said, we should still move forward on this issue.
<P>
	Is it fair for an MP to collect a pension after six years in the 
House, even if he or she is not of retirement age? Is it right for a 
former MP to receive a pension if at the same time he or she is 
working for the government?
<P>
	The objectives of my bill are clear. This bill will prohibit 
former members of Parliament from collecting a pension while 
employed by the Government of Canada, a government agency 
or a federal crown corporation. Under this bill a former member 
could not collect a pension until the age of 60.
<P>
	I know that the Prime Minister is concerned about the issue of 
severance pay. Not only did he raise his concerns last April 6 in 
Kamloops, but he raised them again on March 7 in the House. He 
said: ``There is no security of employment around here. Some 
people who come to Parliament when they quit find it is not easy 
to get re-established in private life''. This is true, but we all 
knew that when we ran as candidates. It is also true that a lot of 
former MPs have problems getting back into private life. 
However, we are not arguing that issue today.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I understand that a case could be made for linking pension 
changes to severance packages. I suggest that if the Prime 
Minister wants to deal with the severance issue he can do it at a 
later date. Right now we should do something about pensions.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne our government said: 
``Measures to reform the pension plan of members of 
Parliament, including the elimination of double dipping, will be 
placed before you''. The government still has not introduced 
legislation to do that.
<P>
	Indeed, there is a strong consensus on this issue from all 
parties in the House. During the last campaign the former Prime 
Minister said that she would introduce measures that would 
preclude any MP from collecting a pension before the age of 55. 
She also added that there would be no more double-dipping.
<P>
	The leader of the NDP agreed with that statement in the House 
last year. The leader of the Reform Party has said that his party is 
the only federal political party to consistently advocate a change 
in the MP pension plan in order to bring the benefits in line with 
private sector standards. The Reform Party has said that it wants 
to postpone eligibility until at least age 60, and this bill does just 
that.
<P>
	In his speech in Quebec on August 16, 1993 the Leader of the 
Official Opposition said: ``Bloc MPs would support the 
government if the previous Prime Minister, Campbell, were to 
recall Parliament to pass promised legislation amending the 
MPs' pension plan and preventing ex-MPs from holding 
government jobs while collecting their pensions''.
<P>
	On that same day in Burlington, Ontario, our present Prime 
Minister urged previous Prime Minister Campbell to act 
quickly. He said: ``If Ms. Campbell wanted to do something 
about it she would have recalled the Parliament and in one day it 
would have passed''.
<P>
	In response to the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> column ``Ask the Leader'', 
our present Prime Minister said that he believes such measures 
are necessary in order to restore Canadians' faith in politicians 
and to combat widespread voter cynicism, and I agree with him.
<P>
	The time has come for all members of this House to show 
Canadians that we all were serious during the last campaign. 
After the election the Prime Minister said that his government 
wanted to wait for a report commissioned by Parliament on 
MPs' pay and perks before introducing legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3412"> 3412 </A></B>
<P>
	That report has been released and the government still has 
not introduced legislation to make the needed reforms to the 
pension plans of members of this House; reforms that are 
necessary, that Canadians want and that this government 
promised.
<P>
	My bill today would make those reforms and so I urge its 
passage. Canadians want action and they want it now. Therefore, 
I would move that not withstanding any standing orders and 
usual practices of the House, Bill C-208, an act to amend the 
members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, be made 
votable and referred after second reading to a committee of the 
whole instead of to the legislative committee and that, unless 
otherwise disposed of, no later than five minutes before the end 
of the time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business today, any proceedings then before the House shall be 
interrupted and every question necessary to dispose of the said 
bill at all stages should be put forthwith and successively 
without further debate or amendment.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the member for 
Saint John have unanimous consent to propose the motion to the 
House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-208, An Act to amend the Members 
of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
	As noted earlier, this bill comes at an awkward time. It would 
have been so much easier to have reviewed this subject 
immediately after the Conservative leadership race, during the 
summer, a summer when the then Conservative Leader, the hon. 
member for Vancouver Centre, British Columbia, crisscrossed 
the country from Halifax to Vancouver to Newfoundland on a 
pre-election campaign. It would have been easy to recall the 
House to give the members of the 34th Parliament the chance to 
debate fully the question of whether the provisions of a bill can 
apply retroactively.
<P>
	It is not in our parliamentary tradition to introduce bills which 
apply retroactively and, when we do so, it is often only 
grudgingly, after having examined all of the ins and outs of the 
matter.
<P>
	The current members of the 35th Parliament were elected in 
accordance with the rules that prevailed at the time and, clearly, 
they have some vested rights. It is obvious on reading Bill 
C-208 that it affects the vested rights of members elected to 
serve in the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	If I understand correctly, Bill C-208 would apply only to 
members elected to sit in the next or 36th Parliament. This is 
similar to the decision reached by the Quebec National 
Assembly when it reviewed the members' pension plan.
<P>
	Therefore, instead of conducting a pre-election campaign at 
the height of the summer, I think the party to which the hon. 
member for Saint John, New Brunswick, belongs should have 
been calling on its leadership, if there was any, to convene 
Parliament so that the issue could be debated and pension plan 
reform proposals could be applied to the current Parliament.
<P>
	Bill C-208 is brief. It contains one provision with which I 
know most hon. colleagues will certainly agree, that is the 
provision which states that a former member who is receiving 
remuneration in whatever capacity from the federal government 
cannot at the same time collect a pension. Let us take, for 
example, the case of a former member who is appointed to a 
federal court bench. Personally, I feel it is wrong and somewhat 
contrary to common sense when a person can collect both a 
pension and a salary from the federal government. I feel the 
same way about persons working for various federal offices and 
government or parapublic agencies and collecting a pension at 
the same time.
<P>
	In my view, the different levels of government in Canada 
should get together and agree to ban this practice from one 
province to another. For instance, there is something a little odd 
about a provincial deputy minister of justice receiving 
severance pay just because he is appointed to a federal court of 
appeal. Representatives of the various levels of government in 
Canada should sit down together to review the administration of 
public moneys in this area.
<P>
	As for the second major provision of Bill C-208, namely the 
age restriction criteria whereby a former member cannot begin 
to collect a pension immediately unless that member has 
reached 55 or 60 years of age, this is indeed another matter.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Many will say that a member has no business collecting a 
pension of $40,000 or so a year after just two terms of office, 
that is to say eight, nine or ten years depending on the 
constitutional limits, if he or she was a member of Cabinet and is 
making a career change. There is something wrong with that 
picture, however, and I think we should look at it.
<P>
	Studies have demonstrated that, by the time some members 
who sat for two terms, having been elected twice, finish 
collecting the full pension to which they are entitled for life, 
they will have cost between $2.5 and $3.5 million to the public 
purse.
<P>
	However, the bill introduced by the hon. member for Saint 
John, New Brunswick, has a flaw as I see it. There is a gap 
between the proposal for a minimum age of eligibility, whether 
55 or 60 years old, as suggested in the  hon. member's bill, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3413"> 3413 </A></B>
<P>
the present situation where one can collect a pension 
immediately upon retiring.
<P>
	Many members-with the kind of turnover we have here in 
the House of Commons, there were 200 new members elected in 
this 35th Parliament- find themselves in a difficult situation. 
Many of those members who were defeated in the last 
election-this is true of any election, but particularly of the last 
one because of the major changes that took place about six 
months ago, on October 25, 1993-may be finding themselves 
in dire straights. Perhaps, in fact very likely, we would need a 
sort of severance pay to help former members find a new job.
<P>
	Members of Parliament who held professional positions have 
to quit or at least considerably neglect their careers to serve their 
constituents while they are sitting in the House of Commons. 
When they resume their careers after being defeated or upon 
retirement, they must rebuild their clientele.
<P>
	Farmers who had leased their farms will also have to get 
reacquainted with new technology and take operations back in 
their own hands. This bill lacks transitory provisions, and there 
should be such provisions.
<P>
	Members of Parliament who retire or are defeated often have 
to regain, pardon the expression, some sort of ``political 
virginity''. A member who used to work in communications, in a 
radio or TV station, would not be allowed to go back on air 
overnight as a political analyst. The station would say that he or 
she is too closely associated with a given political party, and 
should stand back for a while and come back a few months or 
even years down the road. In the meantime, the former member 
will be handed assignments in areas not closely related to the 
political arena that he or she knows well. The same thing 
happens in several other fields. You are told: ``Distance yourself 
from politics; work on your image and, soon, we will take you 
back''.
<P>
	That is the time frame this bill does not cover, and that is why 
I find it very hard to say: Let us immediately stop paying 
benefits or annuities to members who retire or are defeated in an 
election; let us stop paying upon retirement and wait until 
former members reach the age of 55 or 60, without at the same 
time putting transitory provisions in place. I would have liked 
Bill C-208 to contain something specific in terms of transitory 
provisions.
<P>
	We would do well to use Quebec's legislation, the legislation 
passed by the Quebec National Assembly, as a model to refine 
this bill in that regard. This government had indicated in its 
parliamentary calendar that this issue would be debated in the 
House and I would recommend that the various points I have 
made be taken into consideration when a government bill on the 
subject is tabled.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Madam Speaker, we have before us for 
discussion Bill C-208 which proposes amendments to the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, amendments 
which seek to end double dipping and delay commencement of 
pension benefits to a former member until he or she reaches age 
60.
<P>
	I will confine my remarks to the bill's treatment of double 
dipping. My hon. colleague from Nepean will address the 
problems raised by the proposed provisions dealing with 
delayed receipt of benefits to former members and survivors.
<P>
	When I refer to double dipping I am referring to the 
simultaneous drawing of both a pension under the Members of 
Parliament Retirement Allowances Act and a salary or other 
payment from the Government of Canada. The government has 
announced that it intends to curtail this practice. Indeed, the 
right hon. Prime Minister has on several occasions stated that 
the government is committed to ending double dipping. The bill 
purports to do this but it must be said that the approach adopted 
here is seriously flawed.
<P>
	First, the proposed section 13.1 would remove the 
re-employed former member's entitlement altogether rather 
than just suspend that entitlement during the period of 
re-employment.
<P>
	Obvious inequities would then result since there is no 
provision to reinstate the former member's pension when his or 
her re-employment terminated as inevitably would occur. The 
bill would appear to impose a lifetime pension disentitlement 
for a former member. This surely could not have been its intent.
<P>
	Second, the term ``remuneration'' is not defined and the 
proposed scope of the source of that remuneration is very wide. 
Crown corporation directors' fees and per diems for even short 
periods of part time service to the Government of Canada would 
be caught by this very broad definition, as would contract fees, 
even though receipt of pension had already been taken into 
account when those fees were set.
<P>
	As the bill is drafted, receipt of any remuneration no matter 
how little the amount would disentitle a former member from 
receiving any pension at all. As I mentioned that disentitlement 
would appear to be for life.
<P>
	Third, the bill provides no mechanism to allow the pension 
administration to monitor possible cases of re-employment. 
Therefore there would be no way of knowing if and when a 
former member started to receive remuneration in another 
capacity from the Government of Canada, especially since there 
is no requirement in the bill for former members to report their 
re-employment and remuneration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3414"> 3414 </A></B>
<P>
	This leads to a related problem. No provision is made in the 
bill for the recovery of overpayments of pension, overpayments 
which would inevitably arise since the administration would 
have no sure way of knowing that re-employment had occurred 
and that the pension entitlement should be terminated. 
Recovery of such overpayments could prove difficult, 
expensive and time consuming at a time when government 
resources must be husbanded very carefully.
<P>
	In conclusion, the bill would put an end to double dipping but 
it would not do so in a fair and even-handed way. I wish to state 
again that the government fully intends to curtail this practice 
which has attracted so much criticism. However, it wants to 
adopt a more disciplined and integrated approach taking into 
account all aspects of a member of Parliament's compensation.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, the government has received the 
recommendations regarding members' compensation from a 
firm of consultants engaged by the previous government.
<P>
	These recommendations have been referred to the Lapointe 
commission which must report to the House by mid-July of this 
year. Rather than rushing into law seriously flawed legislation 
such as the bill before us now, the more prudent approach for 
dealing with the issue of double dipping for persons under the 
pension plan seems to be to await the deliberations of the 
Lapointe commission. The recommendations of the commission 
can then be studied carefully in the course of the government's 
consideration of its options for reform of the pension plan, a 
consideration of options which would be carried out in a context 
of the overall compensation package provided for members of 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, 
after years of abusing the trust of the taxpayer with a pension 
plan only King Midas could have matched, we have a private 
member's bill from a Conservative MP.
<P>
	Although I favour the two issues that are addressed in this 
private member's bill, as has already been mentioned there are 
some flaws in it. The best way to evaluate whether the bill is 
successful is to compare the Liberal approach, the Reform 
approach and the approach of the private member's bill. I leave 
it to you, my colleagues, and those watching today to decide 
which approach is best.
<P>
	Before I begin this comparison I would like to look briefly at 
who seriously advocated pension reform in Canada in the past 
and why all of a sudden here we are in 1994 looking at a very 
small private member's bill.
<P>
	To date no action has been taken by the Liberals other than 
after the recent election five Liberal MPs have been added to the 
long list of those collecting pensions. The Conservatives have 
taken no action to date either but if you look at the last election 
again there were 111 members of Parliament picking up a 
pension. Then we have the Conservative's private member's bill 
today. The Reform Party has had a policy in place for a number 
of years which I will describe a little later.
<P>
	Let us look at the approach to MPs' pensions that has been 
taken by the major parties. I would like to go through the 
government first, the Liberal Party. As I said, five Liberal MPs 
have recently been put on to this pension plan and are now safely 
living on government pensions for the rest of their lives along 
with many other colleagues. In fact there are 397 individuals 
today on MPs' pensions.
<P>
	The pensions range from about $28,000 to $84,000. The 
infamous red book suggests that the Liberals believe reform is 
necessary. I am not sure whether they are speaking about our 
party or the reform of the pension plan, probably a little bit of 
both. They suggest the pension regime of members of 
Parliament has been the focus of considerable controversy and is 
now the subject of an independent review which was mentioned 
here just briefly. The book also talks about the end to double 
dipping which this private member's bill actually does address. 
After all these years of milking the system the Liberal Party is 
now suggesting that it believes that reform of the pension plan is 
necessary.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has recently paid for a study on 
parliamentarians' compensation although it has suggested that 
the Conservative Party implemented this study and it could do 
nothing about it. That was incorrect.
<P>
	The original study was around $150,000. It could have been 
stopped once the election was over but it was not. Now the cost 
of this report is approximately $200,000-plus and the 
commission which was just talked about will cost about 
$300,000. The report contained some recommendations.
<P>
	It is important to note that the report stated that MPs actually 
should get a 37 per cent pay increase. Liberals say it is not going 
to happen because we have deferred that for two years but it is in 
there.
<P>
	The study suggests that MPs should get severance pay and 
that Senators should get an increase in pay. It also suggests a 
number of changes to the pension plan. One in particular 
suggests that the pension plan should be indexed annually to the 
excess of inflation over 3 per cent which is actually one of the 
most expensive parts of the pension plan.
<P>
	This study is going to a commission. Where it goes from there 
we do not know but I suspect that we will see bits of it in the 
commission's report.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3415"> 3415 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	We have already established that the Liberal government 
closely mirrors the previous Conservative government in many 
things, so let us not expect too much. If we look at the 
Conservative approach we do not need to talk too much about 
the performance of that group of politicians and their pension 
reform policy. The Canadian electorate said all there was to say 
about that in the last election. Since the last election, as I have 
said, we have 111 Conservative members of Parliament picking 
up pensions ranging from about $26,000 to $82,000.
<P>
	This private member's bill addresses double dipping which is 
now defined as a former member of Parliament who is employed 
by the Government of Canada, an agency of the Government of 
Canada or a crown corporation. I am happy to see that defined 
because there was some question from time to time about what 
double dipping actually was.
<P>
	It also covers vesting or collecting the payoff at age 60. There 
were some problems with that. What is not addressed here is that 
there are people in the country who could get elected at age 55 
and under this private member's bill could get a pension at age 
60. They would get it in five years, not six as it is today. We have 
to look at both these combinations.
<P>
	This private member's bill reflects a modest attempt to 
correct the outrageous self-indulgence both Liberals and 
Conservatives have provided themselves over the years at the 
expense of the taxpayer. It is ironic after the last two decades 
when we have been going into debt year after year after year and 
overspending in our budgets that we are sitting here looking at a 
private member's bill. These kinds of things should have been 
looked at some time ago. It is a little bit but it is a little bit too 
late.
<P>
	Since the beginning the Reform Party's policy has been to 
ensure that politicians could not collect a pension until age 60. 
We wanted to ensure that double dipping could not occur by two 
means. The first is no vesting of benefits, should a past MP 
obtain a position with the government or any of its agencies or 
corporations. The second most important aspect of double 
dipping is to eliminate all the patronage that is going on in the 
first place. The only way double dipping occurs is after an MP 
leaves his or her seat and gets appointed to this board, that 
board, this corporation and so on.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The Liberals are heckling 
me. For those who are watching this debate on camera, they are 
heckling me. Quite recently we had three patronage 
appointments, and there is no reason to think that party is going 
to change that.
<P>
	We want to end full indexing, to ensure all contribution 
criteria meet provisions of the Income Tax Act, which is not in 
here, and to allow an adequate sharing arrangement between 
government and the member. The current arrangement sees the 
taxpayer contributing about $5.97 for every $1 by the MP. We  
ought to ensure that pension benefits for MPs are brought in line 
with private sector standards.
<P>
	There is sometimes talk that one of our members is double 
dipping. The definition of double dipping is an MP who is 
unelected or chooses not to run and gets a patronage 
appointment somewhere else. That is where the heckling comes 
in because they just love patronage over there.
<P>
	When I signed my papers as an MP I refused to sign the 
pension papers because I did not want to participate in it. I got 
this letter back from the government: ``However, pursuant to the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act, members are 
required to make pension contributions based on the amounts 
payable by way of sessional allowance''. The fact is that we 
cannot even stop getting this kind of stuff. Government parties 
have made it so difficult over the years that they get in the trough 
and cannot help but stay in the trough. No wonder people in the 
country are upset.
<P>
	In conclusion we have to look at whether or not the real intent 
will be there, whether or not the Liberal government will 
actually take the steps forward to provide a reasonable pension 
plan that is in line with the private industry, matches the Income 
Tax Act, and so on and so forth. We have already seen that it is a 
party that will not accept the function of recall. It is into 
patronage. It has moved the NAFTA centre to Montreal and so 
on. I say it will not do so. If we want real reform in the pension 
we will have to look to Reformers.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak to Bill C-208, an act to amend the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
	While I commend the member for Saint John for putting the 
private member's bill forward, in my estimation it does not go 
far enough. My colleague dealt with the first part of it and I will 
deal with the second part.
<P>
	It purports to deal with two aspects of the pension plan 
provided for former members of the House and former senators. 
It proposes amendments to the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act in an effort to provide a quick fix regarding two 
features of our pension plan which have attracted a good deal of 
criticism in the country. I am referring to the fact that the act 
places no restrictions on double dipping and permits a former 
member to begin drawing a pension immediately upon 
retirement regardless of his or her age.
<P>
	At this point I should state clearly that the government is very 
much aware of the widespread concern of Canadians about the 
pension plan for members of Parliament. The government is 
committed to change but wishes to do so in a rational and 
comprehensive fashion, not piecemeal, which unfortunately is 
the approach adopted in the private member's bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3416"> 3416 </A></B>
<P>
	It would be prudent to await the proposals of the Lapointe 
commission and modify the pension plan for members of 
Parliament in accordance with a more integrated and cohesive 
approach to the overall compensation package appropriate for 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Essex-Windsor has dealt ably with 
the issue of double dipping in the context of the amendments 
proposed in the bill. Therefore I shall direct my remarks to other 
deficiencies in these proposals, deficiencies which are serious 
enough that the intent of the bill could not be realized if it were 
to become law.
<P>
	The major problem with the bill as it stands today is that it 
deals only with some of the benefits to which a former member 
is entitled. As hon. members may know, the amendments made 
to the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act in 1992 
brought the pension plan into compliance with the Income Tax 
Act registration rules and essentially divided the pension plan 
into two parts: part I, the registered plan and part II, a retirement 
compensation arrangement.
<P>
	The proposed amendments in the bill only deal with part I of 
the act, the registered plan, and purport to delay commencement 
of pension benefits under the registered plan until age 60. As an 
aside, these amendments do not even deal with all benefits to 
which a former member might be entitled under part I, since 
they do not address the special joint and survivor benefit which a 
former member may elect to receive under section 23 of the act 
in cases where a former member wishes to provide survivor 
benefit protection to a spouse he or she married after ceasing to 
be a member.
<P>
	Not only is the proposed subsection 13.1(2) quite redundant, 
it fails to achieve its objective of delaying receipt of benefits 
until age 60. I would assume that is what the hon. member would 
like it to do since it does not amend part II of the act, the portion 
of the act which contains the provisions that allow for benefits to 
be paid prior to age 60.
<P>
	Further, the proposed amendment seeks to delay 
commencement until age 60 but does not make any exception to 
that rule in the case where a former member became disabled 
after retirement but before he or she reached age 60. Surely it 
could not have been intended that in no circumstance would a 
benefit be payable to a former member who was unfortunate 
enough to become disabled prior to age 60.
<P>
	Turning to the matter of the proposed companion changes to 
survivor benefits, hon. members should be aware that delaying 
receipt of survivor benefits until a deceased member or former 
member would have been 60 years of age is quite inconsistent 
with any other federal pension legislation and contrary to the 
standards set out in any pension benefits standards legislation in 
the country.
<P>
	Such a measure could be characterized as regressive at best, 
not to mention slightly absurd in the case of children's benefits, 
since few such recipients would still qualify for benefits if they 
had to wait until their parents reached 60 years old. No provision 
is made for an intervening disability in these instances either.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	There are two further aspects of the survivor benefit proposed 
in the bill that are problematic. The first of these is that again the 
bill does not address the survivor benefits paid under part II of 
the act and does not therefore impose the delay until age 60 for 
these benefits.
<P>
	Second, the provision that purports to delay payment until age 
60 does not have any transitional arrangements and could have 
the effect of cutting off the benefits of those persons presently in 
receipt of survivor benefits who became entitled to them under 
the law as it now stands. It is far from clear that the proposed 
section 13.3 would prevent this from happening, given the 
wording of the proposed new section 24 of the act.
<P>
	In conclusion the bill may be well intentioned but falls far 
short of achieving its objectives. Given its structural defects as 
drafted it could be said to raise questions of equity. As I 
mentioned earlier the government will be coming out with a 
report in July of this year.
<P>
	I would like to quote from <I>Hansard</I> of March 5, 1991. I am on 
record as speaking in favour of amending the Members of 
Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I find it hypocritical that someone in the private sector who might get laid off 
from their job, or might be transferred to another company within the private

	I am in support of amending the Members of Parliament 
Retiring Allowances Act. Parts I and II must both be amended. 
We cannot look at one in isolation of the other. I am pleased to 
speak to the bill. Again I commend the member for Saint John 
for taking this initiative and looking at it, but we need to go one 
step further to cover all aspects of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill today.
<P>
	This bill to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act raised by my friend in the Conservative Party is 
a positive step and long overdue. The MPs pension plan is part of 
the reason Canadians are disillusioned with politics and with 
politicians.
<P>

<P>
	The vote on October 26, 1993 to change the government in 
Ottawa was as a result of many things, not the least of which 
was the need to reform the MPs gold plated pension plan. Often 
in the House when the government enjoys a clear majority, the 
majority overrides voices in the opposition who are often and 
only repeating the frustrations of Canadians.
<P>
	Government members protest constantly against the elected 
representatives who are only doing what they promised 
Canadians: to get rid of the obscene MPs pension plan for one. 
When I hear Liberal MPs protestations I am reminded of a 
phrase from literature to the effect: methinks thou doth protest 
too much.
<P>
	It seems strange to be defending a Conservative motion which 
in essence has been part of the Reform Party platform over the 
last few years. It seems strange when other Reform MPs and I 
were elected on the basis of our promises and MP pension 
reform was high on the list.
<P>
	One of the promises I made to constituents time and time 
again was to fight the current MP pension plan and change the 
system so that retiring MPs, those whom the voters have stated 
they have no confidence in, those who lost their jobs in the 
October federal election, would not be eligible for hefty 
pensions, at least not eligible until age 60.
<P>
	Politicians must realize they should have no more rights than 
other Canadians in the private sector like the employees of 
Woodward's department store who had to face a changing world 
with no guarantees and certainly no gold plated pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Defeated and retiring MPs will cost Canadians close to $2 
million per year in pension payments on top of current pension 
payouts. Is this right? No, of course it is not right. The payouts 
are obscene. If the government hopes to restore confidence in 
the political process it must take quick action to scrap this 
ridiculous pension plan.
<P>
	Part of our accountability and responsibility as members of 
Parliament must be reflected in our own pension plan. 
According to the Liberal Party platform the incoming 
government supports a review of the lucrative pension scheme 
with a special look at the age at which pensions begin to be 
collected. That is a good sign.
<P>
	The pension plan is indefensible, even in good times when 
Ottawa's vaults are overflowing and the public is feeling 
wonderfully generous toward its politicians. In bad times when 
many Canadians are suffering and the government is hard 
pressed to find basic programs, this plan amounts to little more 
than robbery. There are probably east European dictators who 
never had it so good as retiring Canadian members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	MPs should not be setting their own wages nor their own 
pensions. They should be set by an independent body which 
reflects a cross-section of Canadians. It could be businessmen, 
academics, professionals, home workers and many others. No 
group should police itself in our society or set its own wages 
when those wages come from the public purse.
<P>
	It is hoped the Prime Minister will recognize the public 
hostility to this obscene plan. Premier Ralph Klein recognized 
the public hostility to a rich pension plan for MLAs in a time of 
hardship. His decision to kill the Alberta MLAs pension plan 
was probably the single most important factor in the re-election 
of the provincial Conservative government. It was also a factor 
that Prime Minister Kim Campbell fatally ignored when she set 
up a commission on federal pensions rather than act directly.
<P>
	The Canadian people who heard former finance minister 
Michael Wilson promise in 1984 to reduce pensions were not 
fooled by more promises. Chrétien should take the right 
example: not Wilson, not Campbell, but that of Klein.
<P>
	It may be that some form of taxpayer assisted federal pension 
plan should survive. There may in the end be justifications 
accepted by the public for a plan to assist politicians in 
retirement. These can be explored.
<P>
	This bill does not mention the Reform Party's clause on 
stopping the indexation of the MPs pension plan. Here we have a 
pension plan where the Canadian taxpayers have to pay far more 
than their fair share in contributions. The added insult is in 
indexing.
<P>
	Former Conservative cabinet minister Perrin Beatty, only 43, 
qualifies for a pension of over $70,000 annually until he is 60, at 
which time it will be adjusted to take into account the preceding 
17 years of inflation. The Reform Party which has made MPs 
pensions an issue estimates that Beatty will collect more than $5 
million in pension payments if he lives till 75.
<P>
	When we become government we will continue as we have 
started. Even in opposition we have kept our word to the 
Canadian people. We have taken less in salary or in allowance, 
forgone other MPs benefits and pushed for changes in many 
areas, particularly parliamentary reform.
<P>
	We will continue to fight for changes to the MPs pension plan, 
but not changes like those made by the previous government in 
January 1992. Those changes illustrate how excessive MPs 
benefits are.
<P>
	One of the changes came about because the MPs benefits 
exceeded the limits allowed for registration under the Income 
Tax Act. The federal government therefore had to divide the 
pension plan into two separate sections to keep it registered. The 
first section, the retiring allowances account, met the 
requirements for registration while the second, the 
compensation arrangement account, fleshed out the plan so the 
MPs could still receive their lavish benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3418"> 3418 </A></B>
<P>
	A 1988 actuarial study of the plan revealed that the 
contributions made by the politicians, which were matched by 
the government, would fall $144 million short of paying for the 
MPs projected benefits. Therefore, in the January 1992 changes 
the government moved to make the plan self-sufficient.
<P>
	First, the government provided a cash infusion to make up for 
the plan's accumulated shortfall, which by that time had risen to 
$158 million. Second, to ensure no further shortfalls would 
accumulate, the government had to choose one of a combination 
of the following scenarios. Either the MPs would have to reduce 
their pension benefits and/or increase their contributions, or the 
government would have to increase the amount of tax dollars 
being funnelled into the plan.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out which 
route was chosen. Treasury Board decided that Canadian 
taxpayers would be more than willing to keep making up the 
difference so the MPs plan could keep its gold plating.
<P>
	A ratio of one to one, one to two, but seven to one? While MPs 
contribute $7,000 to their pension plan on their $64,000 
sessional allowance taxpayers have to contribute about $41,000 
per year on behalf of each MP.
<P>
	There is another aspect to the pensions which is equally 
insupportable, the right of retired MPs to go on collecting a 
pension even as they collect another federal public salary. I 
repeat federal. Former NDP leader Ed Broadbent is a good 
example, collecting both a handsome pension and a large salary, 
because of his appointment by Mulroney to a human rights 
agency.
<P>
	I am listening to the frustrations coming from the other side. 
Another gross example is former Mulroney cabinet minister 
Benoit Bouchard who will collect both an MP-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. I have tried 
to be very patient. I think the member is well aware that we do 
not call members of Parliament by their names. We refer to the 
position or the riding.
<P>
	The member still has about a minute left, but would she please 
pay attention.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought you were going to 
tell me my time was up.
<P>
	I was under the impression that if an MP was no longer an MP 
it was quite all right to mention their name.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You did refer to the 
Prime Minister by name.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Getting back to federal pensions, the very 
first step in pension reform should be to outlaw that type of 
double dipping. MPs should not be permitted to collect a 
pension until they reach an age considered pensionable among 
the Canadian public, somewhere between the ages of 60 or 65.
<P>
	Also the pension should bear some relationship to 
contributions. At present the taxpayer contributes at least five 
times as much as MPs do to the pension payouts. That is a ratio 
which is destined to grow.
<P>
	Finally some leadership has to be shown from the political 
representatives who endlessly beseech Canadians to cut back, to 
reduce their expectations. These pleas lose their lustre when the 
politicians neatly exempt themselves from the sacrifices. Klein 
realized this. The Prime Minister probably does too. All he 
needs to do now is act.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make four short points about the bill under 
consideration this morning.
<P>
	The first point is that this is something the public cares very 
deeply about. I think we are all aware of that; all members who 
have spoken today on this topic have mentioned it. Because this 
is something the public cares about, it is something we should 
seriously consider.
<P>
	In my experience nothing gets the public more riled than this 
whole subject of the members pension plan. This is for a couple 
of reasons.
<P>
	One is because there is nobody else in the country who is able 
to command a pension for life after working only six years. 
Canadians feel it is fundamentally unfair that anyone should be 
able to do that. Another is that the pension plan is a very rich 
one, even if you discount the fact it can be earned after only six 
years. It is fully indexed and is based on 75 per cent of the best 
six consecutive years of earning. Again it is not something 
which is available to most Canadians.
<P>
	Therefore it is fair to say it is something we should 
legitimately deal with because the public is demanding it be 
dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	The second point I would like to make is that change is very 
much needed in this pension plan. Canadian taxpayers are not 
able to fire us, to put it bluntly. If they lose confidence in us, if 
they feel we are not competent in the job we are doing and our 
performance is unsatisfactory, the taxpayers are not able to 
relieve us of our duties as can happen in private industry and in 
any other walk of life.
<P>
	It adds insult to injury in their view when not only can they not 
get rid of us in between elections but even after an election if our 
performance has been unsatisfactory they have to pay us forever 
under a pension plan as long as we had been MPs for six years.
<P>
	Canadians do feel that change is needed simply on the basis of 
equity. On the basis of the dollar figure Canadians feel that 
change is needed. As other members who have spoken have said, 
for each dollar an MP pays into the pension plan or did in 1993, 
the taxpayer contributed more than $6. That is a very high ratio 
of contributions of the person receiving the pension and the 
employer, who in this case is the public or the taxpayer.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3419"> 3419 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words MPs pay about 20 per cent of the value of the 
plan. This compares to 40 per cent for federal public servants 
and about 35 per cent for public sector executives. Once again 
the percentage of contributions in the eyes of Canadians is 
inequitable.
<P>
	Other members have also mentioned that of the MPs from the 
1988-93 Parliament 134 will receive pensions now. Those will 
cost $5.5 million each and every year. That is an increase of 56 
per cent over what was paid out in pensions to former MPs in the 
last fiscal year.
<P>
	Again Canadians see this pension liability as one which is 
growing very rapidly. In a time when our tax resources are 
shrinking and the demands on them are increasingly 
competitive, Canadians are concerned even though it is a 
minuscule amount in terms of the overall budget. The 
percentage of growth and the growth of the liability does 
concern a lot of Canadians.
<P>
	The average pension for those 134 MPs from the last 
Parliament is $41,450 per year and that will go up as the 
indexation goes up. This is true even though a number of those 
134 former members of Parliament are not retired. They are 
working and some of them are even working for the federal 
government. Canadians do not see any equity in paying pensions 
to people who are quite able bodied and working and are able to 
support themselves. They are asking why pensions are paid to 
people who are working and are well able to work.
<P>
	The last point I would like to make about the fact that change 
is needed is that a lot of our pension obligations are unfunded.
<P>
	I have been contacted, as I am sure other members have, by 
members of the Public Service Alliance. They are concerned 
that there is an unfunded pension liability of about $100 billion 
for federal civil servants. They are concerned that this fund 
should be managed, should be funded, should be actuarially 
sound. They are concerned about their future pensions.
<P>
	When Canadians are concerned about their future, their 
pensions, their retirement years, it is very difficult for them to 
feel positive about a group who again seem to be free or not 
subject to those kinds of uncertainties.
<P>
	The third point I would like to touch on is what this bill 
proposes. It proposes essentially two things. One is that double 
dipping would end. In other words people who are entitled to 
members pensions but who are working for the federal 
government or crown corporations would not be entitled to 
pension moneys as long as they are employed by the federal 
government or by crown corporations. The second thing it 
would do would be to end any pension payments until at least 
age 60.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that those are key elements of pension 
reform for members of Parliament that the Canadian public is 
asking for, but I very much agree with other members who have 
spoken on both sides of the House suggesting the bill does not go 
far enough, that this just touches on the need for pension reform 
but there are other elements that really need to be brought into a 
comprehensive reform of members' pensions.
<P>
	While this is a good start and the two points are valid, there 
are other elements that need to be addressed.
<P>

SETTLEMENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that Bill C-16, an act to approve, give 
effect to and declare valid an agreement between Her Majesty 
the Queen in right of Canada and the Dene of Colville Lake, 
Déline, Fort Good Hope, Fort Norman and the Metis of Fort 
Good Hope, Fort Norman and Norman Wells, as represented by 
the Sahtu Tribal Council, and to make related amendments to 
another act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill 
C-16, the Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act. I 
am honoured and pleased to have the opportunity to speak in 
support of this bill. I urge hon. members to give this legislation 
their strong support and quick passage so that the Dene and 
Metis people of the Sahtu region can begin now to build a better 
future.
<P>
	This agreement has been many years in the making. The Dene 
of the Mackenzie Valley filed a comprehensive claim with the 
federal government in 1976 and the Metis filed a claim the 
following year. These were among the first claims received after 
a Liberal government decided in 1973 to end the 50 year hiatus 
in treaty making in Canada.
<P>
	This was the right decision. It avoided potentially protracted 
and expensive litigation. Court decisions have indicated that the 
best way to resolve land claims is through negotiation. Some 20 
years later the settlement of outstanding land claims is an 
objective this government will be pursuing with a great deal of 
energy and commitment in the coming months.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3420"> 3420 </A></B>
<P>
	The clear definition of aboriginal rights to land and resources 
is a crucial foundation for the long term success of 
self-government and the future aspirations and prosperity of 
dozens of aboriginal communities.
<P>
	With that in mind we need to move quickly to clarify land and 
resource ownership in those regions of Canada where aboriginal 
right to land has not been satisfactorily dealt with, and we are 
committed to do so both through existing channels and with new 
approaches to resolve land claims.
<P>
	We made clear our commitment to address outstanding land 
claims in ``Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada''. 
On page 96 of that document there is a very clear and concise 
statement of this government's intention toward aboriginal 
people: ``The priority of a Liberal government will be to assist 
aboriginal communities in their efforts to address the obstacles 
to their development and to help them marshal the human and 
physical resources necessary to build and sustain vibrant 
communities''.
<P>
	Comprehensive land claim settlements take us a long way 
toward accomplishing this goal. By ensuring certainty of land 
ownership and providing fee simple title to large areas of land 
they remove some of the most significant obstacles to the 
economic development and diversification of aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
	By affirming resource ownership and rights and by providing 
monetary compensation they give aboriginal beneficiaries the 
means to become self-reliant. By formalizing aboriginal 
participation in the decision making process, land claim 
settlement agreements enable aboriginal people, people like the 
Sahtu Dene and the Metis, to regain a measure of control over 
their lives and to restore pride and self-respect in their 
communities.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The Sahtu claim was the second regional Dene and Metis 
agreement to be signed. A land claim agreement with the 
Gwich'in was finalized in July 1991, promulgated to December 
1992 and is now being implemented.
<P>
	The fact that we are addressing Bill C-16 today is testimony 
to the perseverance, strength and character of the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased for the elders among these two 
aboriginal groups. These individuals have suffered the longest, 
worked the hardest and provided the guidance and leadership 
that has brought this agreement before the House. They give the 
younger generations reason for hope.
<P>
	The result of those years of perseverance is a modern day 
treaty that fulfils treaty 11, signed in 1921. With second reading 
debate we are now at a critical stage in the settlement process.
<P>
	Let me remind my hon. colleagues that this land claim 
agreement has been overwhelmingly endorsed by the 
beneficiaries. Eight-seven per cent of the ballots cast by the 
Dene in the ratification vote supported the agreement and 99 per 
cent of the Metis who voted supported the agreement. I would 
also like to point out that this is the first land claim agreement in 
which the Metis have had a principal role.
<P>
	This agreement has also been endorsed by the government of 
the Northwest Territories which was a key player in the 
negotiations and which will play a fundamental role in 
implementing the agreement. It has been praised by 
non-aboriginal residents and business interests in the Sahtu 
region because it will finally lay to rest issues of land ownership 
and resource rights that have stymied development in the 
settlement area.
<P>
	Now it rests with this House to move the settlement 
agreement forward. By passing Bill C-16 we will be approving, 
giving effect to and declaring valid this agreement between Her 
Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Dene of Colville 
Lake, Déline, Fort Good Hope and Fort Norman and the Metis of 
Fort Good Hope, Fort Norman and Norman Wells as represented 
by the Sahtu Tribal Council. We will also encourage resource 
development of the settlement area.
<P>
	In the simplest of terms, Parliament is being asked to do its 
part to address the longstanding, legitimate land based claims of 
the Sahtu Dene and Metis and to help the north realize some of 
its economic potential.
<P>
	We are being asked to ensure that their traditional lifestyles 
will not only survive but will flourish. We are being asked to put 
into action Canadians' commitment to share the potential of our 
nation.
<P>
	I would like briefly to touch on a number of issues addressed 
in the Sahtu Dene and Metis land claims settlement that I know 
will be of interest to hon. members.
<P>
	First, I want to make it clear that Bill C-16 provides that the 
Sahtu agreement will be a land claims agreement within the 
meaning of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. This is 
extremely important because it means that the rights of the 
aboriginal participants to the agreement may not be arbitrarily 
affected or altered by any other person. However, this 
Constitution protection does not mean that the agreement forms 
part or alters the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	On the issue of land title, this agreement will give the 2,000 
Dene and Metis beneficiaries collective ownership of 
approximately 41,000 square kilometres of land in the 
settlement area. On approximately 1,800 square kilometres of 
this area they will also own the sub-surface mineral rights. The 
Sahtu lands will be privately owned lands, not reserve lands 
under the Indian Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3421"> 3421 </A></B>
<P>
	The quantum of land that was agreed upon in this land claim 
agreement is guaranteed to the Sahtu Dene and Metis forever. 
If any settlement lands were ever to be expropriated, which is 
extremely unlikely, they would be replaced with an equal 
amount of land elsewhere in the settlement area.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members that the lands selected have a great 
meaning to the beneficiaries.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	The settlement agreement encompasses territory that has been 
occupied and used by many generations of Sahtu Dene and 
Metis. Settlement lands include traditional hunting and fishing 
areas as well as lands of historic and spiritual significance to the 
Dene and Metis. They also include lands which would bring 
economic benefit to the Dene and Metis. Subject to existing 
mineral interests, the Sahtu Dene and Metis will decide whether 
and how to explore and develop any sub-surface resources that 
they might own.
<P>
	In addition to these revenue generating opportunities, the 
beneficiaries of this land claim agreement will seek payments 
totalling $75 million in 1990 dollars over the next 15 years.
<P>
	These lands and these funds combined with a share of the 
resource royalties from projects in the Mackenzie Valley will 
give the Sahtu Dene and Metis the financial resources to support 
their own economic development initiatives. The money may 
also be used to support social, cultural, educational and political 
initiatives.
<P>
	Most important, it will be used as the beneficiaries see fit. 
They, rather than the government, will have an increased say in 
how their communities are to develop.
<P>
	A number of provisions of the agreement acknowledge the 
rights and interests of non-aboriginal people in the settlement 
area. For example, any third party rights, titles and interests that 
already exist on Sahtu lands when this legislation comes into 
force will be protected. As well, because the parcels of 
settlement lands are so large, there are provisions to allow 
access to the lands under certain circumstances by persons who 
are not Sahtu Dene or Metis. For example, members of the 
public may cross settlement land in order to exercise a right, 
interest or privilege on crown land that is adjacent to the Sahtu 
land.
<P>
	In all cases, however, access to settlement land will be based 
on the conditions that no significant damage will be done to the 
land and that there will be no interference with Sahtu Dene and 
Metis use and enjoyment of their land.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that the land claim agreement 
acknowledges the traditional subsistence lifestyle of the 
majority of the Dene and Metis in the Sahtu region. It guarantees 
them special wildlife harvesting rights in the settlement area, 
including the exclusive right to trap. The agreement also 
provides for compensation where developers cause provable 
damage to property or  equipment used in harvesting wildlife or 
a loss of income from wildlife harvesting.
<P>
	It also recognizes the importance of expanding the economic 
horizons for aboriginal people in the north. Toward this end, the 
agreement provides for economic development opportunities 
related to guiding, lodges, naturalist activities and commercial 
fishing.
<P>
	For example, throughout the settlement area the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis will have the first opportunity to obtain new licences 
for commercial opportunities in wildlife harvesting, guiding 
and outfitting, naturalist activities and the keeping and breeding 
of wildlife species native to the settlement area.
<P>
	The aboriginal beneficiaries will also be looking for 
employment and business opportunities that will arise once 
third party resource development projects get under way. The 
historic involvement of the Sahtu Dene and Metis in the Norman 
Wells project puts them in an excellent position to take 
advantage of opportunities that are expected to emerge in the oil 
and gas sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the passage of Bill C-16 and the coming into 
force of the Land Claim Agreement will give the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis the opportunity to be really involved in the making of 
decisions which will have an impact on their environment and 
way of life.
<P>
	Under this agreement, they are guaranteed a 50 per cent 
representation on all agencies concerned with renewable 
resource management, land development, and regulations 
regarding land and water use in the area covered by the 
agreement. Moreover, they will sit on the Mackenzie Valley 
Impact Review Boards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Federal, territorial and municipal laws will apply to the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis and their land. However, if there is any conflict 
between those laws and this agreement, the agreement will 
apply.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to note that an arbitration panel will be 
established under the terms of this agreement so any disputes 
that arise can be settled without involving the courts.
<P>
	The agreement also provides a framework for negotiating 
self-government. I know that many Sahtu Dene and Metis are 
looking with hope and confidence to the day when they might 
exercise jurisdiction in such areas as education, language, 
taxation, health and social services and the administration of 
justice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3422"> 3422 </A></B>
<P>
	We are proceeding with this land claim at this time for three 
basic reasons. The first is that an agreement has been signed 
on behalf of the crown and we are determined to live up to past 
commitments and to uphold the honour of the crown. Second, 
the agreement reflects the aspirations of the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis and addresses their legitimate claims. This agreement 
will guarantee a secure land and resource base for economic 
development and self-government. The third reason we are 
proceeding is because the resolution of outstanding land claims 
has become a priority for all Canadians.
<P>
	This initiative has the support of people from coast to coast, 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal alike. Bill C-16 is clearly 
deserving of parliamentary support. I urge my hon. colleagues to 
do the right thing for the Sahtu Dene and Metis and the right 
thing for Canada by ensuring quick passage of this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to address this House today to inform you that I and the 
party which I represent, the Bloc Quebecois, will be very 
pleased to support Bill C-16 for several reasons.
<P>
	I would like to tell you that since I became Indian Affairs 
critic for the Official Opposition, this is probably the issue on 
which I have spent the most time. The procedure followed in this 
case is fairly typical and representative of what I intend to do 
from now on with government bills on Indian affairs.
<P>
	This bill has many implications, and I will come back to them 
shortly. The people of Sahtu, who are very pleasant to deal with, 
came to meet me in my office; we went over the whole 
agreement as such and I was very glad to learn that the 
government had agreed to support Bill C-16 which would 
quickly implement an agreement reached on September 6.
<P>
	Of course, representations were made from many quarters. As 
I said, those people are very pleasant to deal with and very 
persistent. This agreement is the result of a long struggle. From 
1982 to 1991 or 1992, these people tried to negotiate it, but there 
were other agreements before, starting in 1921, formal 
agreements and also less formal agreements between the Whites 
at the time and the people of Sahtu.
<P>
	So this agreement is very good for them and for us. The 
seniors, called elders, were very much involved. For them this 
agreement is very important for future generations and I think 
that they will be very satisfied.
<P>
	The president, George Cleary, also came to my office with his 
delegation. As I just said, those people were persistent and I 
think that the agreement they have today is very worthwhile. I 
also hope that all members of this House will ensure that this bill 
can take effect fairly soon. Among the local associations that 
made representations to us are the Déline band of Fort Franklin, 
the Déline sub-band, the Fort Norman band, the Colville Lake 
band and the Fort Good Hope band.
<P>
	Of course, these are important centres of social and economic 
activity in that region of the Mackenzie Valley and those people 
have communities within those socio-economic centres and 
they are all included in the agreement.
<P>
	Speaking of local associations represented, there are also the 
Metis Nation of the Northwest Territories, local 60 in Fort 
Norman, local 59 and local 54; these are Metis groups that 
worked on this agreement and signed it. The agreement will 
affect some 1,755 Metis and Dene. The figures vary a little. 
Some talk about 2,000 but there is a general consensus that the 
agreement will affect between 1,700 and 2,000 people.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Of course, Sahtu-it is important to know this-is the big lake 
in northern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. The 
word means big bear in the Dene language. So right off the bat it 
is important to realize the significance of the words.
<P>
	Earlier I talked about the 1921 treaty. It may have been the 
start of a more traditional system of management between the 
Whites and the Natives, and we see that this is now taking the 
form of a land claims treaty that is not in fact a self-government 
treaty. I could come back to that a little later.
<P>
	The territory itself represents about 75 per cent of the area 
occupied by Nova Scotia. So it is a huge territory, to say the 
least, and it is already limited by other Native agreements. In 
particular, the Sahtu Tribal Council's current territory is limited 
to the northeast by the recently-signed Nunavut agreement and 
to the north by the Inuvialuit treaty.
<P>
	I will now tell you the history of the five communities because 
I think it is important. The Colville Lake community lives on the 
ancestral lands of the Slave Dene. It was founded in 1962 and it 
is the only community in the Northwest Territories where 
everything is made out of roundwood logs, Madam Speaker. It is 
still typically, a very rustic, very nice, good-sized village. I did 
not visit it but I saw pictures, and everything is built out of 
roundwood logs.
<P>
	Déline, which was founded in 1825 by Sir John Franklin, is 
also called Fort Franklin. It was Lord Franklin's winter 
headquarters. When oil was discovered in Norman Wells-I will 
come back to that later-in the 1920s, it was close to 
transportation routes and became a major trading post. At that 
time, the people of Bear Lake were still leading a nomadic 
existence, following a tradition which is several thousand years 
old. They travelled across their hunting grounds in pursuit of the 
animals they wanted to trap and hunt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3423"> 3423 </A></B>
<P>
	It is only since the 1960s and the early 1970s that the Dene 
have been living in Déline year-round. When these people 
became a little more sedentary in the 1970s, they built the 
village of Déline where they now live.
<P>
	Fort Norman has long had great seasonal importance to the 
Dene. The Northwest Company was active in the 18th century. 
The trading post founded at Fort Norman in 1810 has been 
permanently occupied since 1872. It was then a trading post 
which became a permanent village in 1872.
<P>
	Fort Good Hope is the oldest trading post of the Lower 
Mackenzie Valley. Although it lies inside the territory of the 
Northern Slave Dene, the Gwich'in and the Mountain, the 
Mackenzie Delta Inuit used to go there. So another important 
community is affected by this agreement.
<P>
	Norman Wells was the first community in the Northwest 
Territories to depend exclusively on the development of 
non-renewable resources. It is where the first traces of oil were 
discovered. It is a place where the oil development reaches its 
full extent. In 1818 and 1819, oil was discovered in commercial 
quantities. In 1847, the collapse of oil prices created problems 
for the village.
<P>
	Imperial and Canada are joint owners of operating oilfields. 
The Can Oil trail was laid out during World War II so that 
Norman Wells could send its premium-quality light oil, a 
strategic resource, to the Alaska Highway and to southern cities. 
Norman Wells is also the northern end of the oil pipeline going 
from the Northwest Territories to Zama in Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I said earlier that the agreement was signed on September 6, 
1993, in Fort Norman. According to our experts and researchers, 
the agreement is indeed protected by the Constitution as a 
modern treaty, in compliance with section 35. I said that 
between 1,700 and 2,000 Dene of the Sahtu region will be 
covered by the agreement and will be represented by the Sahtu 
Tribal Council.
<P>
	In the region where those rights will apply, the agreement was 
approved by 85 per cent of the Dene and by 99 per cent of the 
Metis, while the rate of participation was close to 90 per cent.
<P>
	You can see the efforts made by these people, who live in the 
very large territory of 280,000 square kilometres covered by the 
agreement. Such high participation and approval rates 
demonstrate how important the agreement is to those people, as 
well as their very positive attitude towards it.
<P>
	I want to discuss the content of the agreement as regards the 
use of land and water. The Dene-Metis from the Sahtu region on 
the one hand, and the government on the other hand, will be 
equally represented on the land use planning boards regulating 
the use of land and water, and they will also be represented on an 
environmental council in the case of development  proposals for 
the region. This is very important to these people.
<P>
	I explained earlier the importance of traditions such as 
fishing, hunting, trapping, etc. Now, we also realize that, with 
the emergence of their new economy, these people want to try to 
reconcile in an effective way their new and former cultures. I am 
pleased to see that the government has acted on their claim 
regarding this aspect and that these people's representation will 
be equivalent to that of the government regarding any expansion 
project, and also that, in the field of environment, they will have 
the opportunity to provide an important input.
<P>
	I want to point out that it is a land claim agreement-later I 
might give more details on the territory covered and on the 
agreement itself-which does not put an end to what are 
commonly referred to as self-government agreements. These 
are two very different things. In fact, the annex to the agreement 
before us today contains some draft agreement on eventual 
negotiations relating to the issue of self-government.
<P>
	As you know, a number of things can be the object of a 
transfer of jurisdiction between the Crown and Indian bands. 
Very few such transfers are in the process of being made right 
now, but the agreement provides for that possibility regarding a 
number of issues, including education, justice, health care and 
police services. Indeed, now that a land claim has resulted in a 
formal agreement, once these people have developed their 
resources and built a solid base for their economic development, 
they will want to look at what issues eventual negotiations on 
self-government might include.
<P>
	Again, this agreement does not put an end to 
self-government. In fact, I think that it is a starting point for 
self-government, because if there is no land claim, if there is no 
land on which to base future claims for transfers of jurisdiction, 
it is very difficult to look at the issue of self-government. 
Consequently, this is one thing which is taken care of with the 
conclusion of the agreement.
<P>
	We are also pleased to see that the Sahtu Tribal Council will 
participate in any constitutional conference on the reform of the 
Northwest Territories' constitution. An arbitration board is 
about to be set up to avoid having to go to the courts and 
therefore avoid delays which can sometimes be very long and 
costly for these nations.
<P>
	The Metis and Dene now get ownership title for over 41,000 
square kilometres, of which 1,800 include mines and minerals. 
This is very important. This is a territory these people now own 
exclusively. Some compensation could even be awarded in cases 
of expropriation.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In other words, should the government decide, although I 
heard the minister say it was unlikely that the government would 
be interested in acquiring land and decide to expropriate, but 
should this ever happen, these people made sure the agreement 
contained clauses under which compensation would consist of 
equivalent lands.  This is very important to them. If the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3424"> 3424 </A></B>
<P>
government tries to expropriate 2,000 or 3,000 of the 41,000 
square kilometres covered by the agreement, it will have to 
compensate by giving them the same amount of land somewhere 
else.
<P>
	This is a very important point. The 41,000 square kilometres 
are not only part of the settlement but also belong to the Sahtu 
municipal lands. In other words, the five or six communities I 
mentioned earlier as well as other groups living in small villages 
are not only given lands immediately adjacent to their territory 
or villages but are also given ownership of all adjacent lands 
within the 41,000 square kilometres. On 1,800 square 
kilometres, rights to sub-surface resources the mineral rights 
will be included.
<P>
	As far as financial compensation is concerned, I think it is a 
good settlement, both for the Crown and for the aboriginal 
people. They will receive a tax-free financial settlement in the 
amount of $75 million annually, over a period of 15 years. Every 
year, participants will receive 7.5 per cent of the first two 
million dollars of royalties on resources received by the 
government for that year, and 1.5 per cent of additional royalties 
on resources in the Mackenzie Valley.
<P>
	There is a financial settlement and royalties on resources as 
well. Of course a percentage goes to the Crown, but the Sahtu 
tribal council benefits from it as well.
<P>
	I think this is good for the economic development of the Dene 
and the Metis in that part of the country. For them, the 
settlement was a prerequisite for economic development and 
self-government, and the rest will follow. The financial 
compensation package is a case in point.
<P>
	As for the other clauses in the agreement which I intend to 
discuss, we shall see that, on the economic development side, 
these people are ready to take control of their lives.
<P>
	The main focus of the department of Indian affairs may well 
be to help aboriginal tribes and nations to take control of their 
lives and get rid of the dependency spirit fostered by the Indian 
Act.
<P>
	I think that today we are witnessing a first step by aboriginal 
people toward economic development and, eventually, 
self-government.
<P>
	Incidently, in Quebec we have some very good examples 
where this has been successful. Unfortunately, I have not had the 
opportunity nor, in fact, much time to compare the two 
agreements, but Quebec has set a good example, with its Cree 
and Naskapi legislation and the James Bay agreement, and I 
think we can say quite honestly that we pioneered the 
introduction of a degree of self-government around land claim 
settlements. I believe this bill is very similar in its treatment of 
the Metis and Dene in the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	As far as the agreement itself is concerned, I will briefly 
discuss a few important points. I mentioned the wild life aspect 
and the possibility that these people would be represented on a 
kind of tribunal and consulted on environmental and economic 
development issues.
<P>
	To them, wildlife is extremely important. As I pointed out, for 
thousands of years, until the beginning of the twentieth century, 
these people followed the caribou herds and other game. They 
were nomads. Their life style and habits were based on animal 
resources. The agreement contains provisions on wildlife, and 
we are very glad to see the agreement reflects their culture and 
the position of the Bloc Quebecois on the important 
jurisdictional aspects that must be included in this kind of bill.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	So the Renewable Resources Board will be composed of an 
equal number of Dene, Metis and government representatives 
and will manage wildlife in the region covered by the 
settlement. They will obtain specific rights concerning the 
management of wildlife, including the exclusive right to trap 
throughout the region covered by the agreement, the right to 
hunt, economic opportunities concerning the use of camps, 
guiding naturalist activities and commercial fishing.
<P>
	Some people who are neither Dene nor Metis have lived in the 
region for some time. They will now have to reach an agreement 
with the band council in order to pursue their commercial 
activities. The agreement also mentions the importance for the 
band council of ensuring that wildlife is managed not only for 
subsistence but also on a commercial basis. Furthermore, the 
agreement provides that those who harm the environment by 
taking too many caribou or fish or who misuse the fishing or 
hunting equipment at their disposal will have to compensate the 
band council.
<P>
	The agreement does not infringe on the ancestral political, 
social or other rights which the Dene or Metis may have. The 
Dene and Metis living in the region can register under the terms 
of this agreement. We know that there may be people who have 
lived on that territory from generation to generation but were 
not registered under the Indian Act; the agreement contains 
special provisions whereby these Dene and Metis can register 
within a certain period-I will not mention exactly any passage 
or provision, but they are indeed included in the agreement.
<P>
	As for the native people or Canadian citizens living in the 
Mackenzie Valley, the valley covered by the agreement, who are 
not registered and are neither Dene nor Metis, the agreement 
allows them to register provided that a Sahtu community adopts 
them. It is important to emphasize that the agreement does not 
throw out people who have lived on the territory for a long time, 
as if to say to them: ``You are not Dene, you are not Metis, you 
have to leave the territory''. The  agreement allows these people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3425"> 3425 </A></B>
<P>
to stay provided that they are accepted by one of the Sahtu 
communities.
<P>
	The Sahtu lands will be private, not reserves, and that is 
important. I mentioned earlier that, since its inception, the 
Indian Act has made the Indians very dependent. The agreement 
before us frees the Indians from this dependence and gives them 
enough economic power and land to exercise their full 
autonomy. Although the agreement on self-government will 
come later, we note that this is a step in the right direction. We 
are pleased to see that the land will be private and not reserves.
<P>
	Federal, territorial and municipal laws will apply and, in case 
of conflict, the agreement will prevail. That is important; it is 
another step to self-government and it says: ``The agreement 
between you and us will protect you''. For example, if there is 
conflict between a municipal by-law and the agreement, the 
agreement will prevail. The agreement will not set up a 
hermetically sealed territory. By that, I mean that we are not 
building a Berlin wall around a territory and saying that no one 
can go there.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	We are pleased to see that, as far as the public is concerned, 
the agreement contains provisions allowing the public access to 
the region.
<P>
	However, if someone has in mind to start up a business within 
this territory, then naturally this is another matter. Under the 
current provisions the public will be allowed access to Sahtu 
land in order to reach an adjacent territory. Dealing with a 
territory covering 280,000 square kilometres, you cannot expect 
someone to make a detour around this vast expanse to reach an 
adjacent territory.
<P>
	Therefore, members of the public wishing to travel through 
this region will have no problem doing so. Naturally they will 
have to comply with the regulations and designated areas. The 
agreement even contains provisions stipulating that members of 
the public will be able to hunt migratory birds, provided of 
course they comply with certain conditions to be determined by 
the band council.
<P>
	Regarding access for developers, those who are already in the 
area will be able to remain there, subject, as always, to the 
approval of the band council. Indeed, this approval will be 
required, and even a right to appeal is provided.
<P>
	One example of this arose when the lands in the Sahtu region 
were being selected. As you know, outfitters who have long been 
operating in this region need vast expanses of land to carry out 
their outfitting operations.
<P>
	These outfitters renegotiated all of their systems and 
territories with the Sahtu and Metis band council, and 
agreements are now in place which allow these outfitters to 
continue using Sahtu lands.
<P>
	Federal departments have been represented and consulted on 
countless occasions during the negotiation process. The same 
holds true for the government of the Northwest Territories 
which was part of the federal negotiating team.
<P>
	As we can see, nothing was taken for granted. All parties, the 
federal and territorial governments as well as the 
representatives of the Sahtu band council, approached the task at 
hand very seriously and no one was left out of the process. The 
agreement meets with the approval of all parties.
<P>
	The Sahtu were even consulted when the time came to draft 
the land claims bill. They told us so themselves. They will also 
be consulted on the drafting of the future Mackenzie Valley 
resources management legislation.
<P>
	The territory in question does not take in all of the Mackenzie 
Valley. Therefore, it is extremely important, to them and to us, 
that it be made clear that when legislation, whether economic or 
social, is drafted for the rest of the Mackenzie Valley, they will 
be consulted. The agreement states that they will be consulted, 
that they will be abled to express their views and even 
participate in the process.
<P>
	On certain reserves, the Dene themselves make the decision 
whether or not to allow exploration or resource development. 
They are not required to follow a particular course of action. Of 
course, within the 1,800 square kilometres referred to earlier, a 
band council can decide at any time to allow exploration, the 
conduct of a feasibility study or a geological study and, if there 
are resources in the subsoil, mining, quarrying, and so on.
<P>
	This is all allowed under the provisions of the agreement 
before us.
<P>
	As for present and future titles holders, they will have to 
negotiate with the Dene and Metis the use they want to make of 
those lands and waters. That is totally consistent with the 
principle of the agreement before us.
<P>
	To wrap up regarding the contents of the agreement, 
negotiations were held from 1982 to 1990 to come to this 
agreement. Today, to become law, it will require unanimous 
consent from this House. So, I hope that, for the sake of 
expediency, we will have unanimous consent.
<P>
	Other consensus were reached before coming to the product 
before us and I would like to mention some of the groups that 
have been consulted and various public consultation processes 
involved.
<P>
	So, groups were consulted. Proper consideration was given to 
this. The people and organizations I am about to mention have 
taken part in the discussions to some extent. The Northwest 
Territories Chamber of Mines was one of them, as well as the 
Mining Association of Canada, the Canadian Association of 
Petroleum  Producers, the North West Territory Wild Life 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3426"> 3426 </A></B>
<P>
Federation, the Mackenzie Mountains outfitters-those who 
need large areas for their outfitting operations, as I said 
earlier-and the Ingraham Trail Association. Consultations 
took many forms. It was mentioned earlier that the agreement 
was approved by federal government. The agreement was signed 
by the federal government as well as the territorial government. 
The public meeting in Yellowknife was held as part of this 
consultation process.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Communities were toured extensively. I was saying earlier 
that the agreement applies to an area of 281,000 square 
kilometres. You can imagine it was no small task to go and see 
2,000 people who live in that area. But the results were highly 
conclusive, as I said earlier, with a positive vote from 85 per 
cent of the Dene and 99 per cent of the Metis.
<P>
	Information brochures were distributed. Municipalities were 
involved in the lands screening process. A serious job has been 
done.
<P>
	I would like to open a parenthesis here because the outlay of 
money required makes Canadian taxpayers jump. In fact, many 
people have commented to me, and I am sure that similar 
remarks were made to the hon. minister, that the department of 
Indian affairs was perhaps one of the least hit by cuts. Not only 
were there no cuts, but its budget has actually increased.
<P>
	We must also understand what led to the Indian Act. I often 
tend to use the same example, namely an Indian village or 
reserve nearby. How much money goes to the village if we look 
at who built the town hall? Who built the hospital? Who built the 
schools? Who is in charge of the roads? Who is in charge of the 
water supply system? If we look at all this and at the money 
coming from various departments, we see that the department of 
Indian affairs looks after the reserve.
<P>
	Although the amounts may look outrageously high, it must be 
understood that, as a trustee under the Indian Act, the federal 
government must look after the quality of life of the Natives 
who live on these reserves.
<P>
	There are many other reasons why the budget was not cut. Yes, 
the budget has grown but so has the Native population. It does 
not mean that we want to remain a trustee forever. I think we all 
have an effort to make in this regard and, after listening to the 
minister's comments on this subject, I feel that he, too, wants to 
revoke the Indian Act as quickly as possible.
<P>
	How will we proceed? We have a typical example before us 
today. Without the Dene and the Metis achieving 
self-government, which will come later, we can still see that it is 
a step in the right direction. The money the government was 
going to spend on these bands should be reduced to allow for its 
gradual withdrawal and to let Natives control their own 
economic development and achieve full self-government in the 
long term.
<P>
	We now understand why, in a public finance management 
context, the department may not have been hit by cutbacks. 
There is also the whole notion that, since the government wants 
Natives to take control of their own destiny, it will have to invest 
the amounts resulting from that decision and allowing us to 
initiate a negotiating process. That is what I tell people to 
explain why we in the Bloc Quebecois see an increase in the 
Indian Affairs budget. We must also remember that, historically, 
we exploited the lands and resources of these people and 
confined them to parcels of land representing perhaps 1 per cent 
of the area they used to occupy.
<P>
	In closing, a last word on their languages and cultures because 
I think it is important.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The Eskimo and Dene languages are not at all related. Even 
though these nations have long lived close from one another, we 
recognize that the two cultures are distinct. Even though these 
people have been hunting, trapping and fishing forever, we 
recognize their respective specificity regarding the land they 
occupied. They have such precise expressions relating to nature 
that there is indeed a separation between the two languages. For 
example, the Eskimo language has 60 terms for ``snow''. That 
language has all kinds of variations and nuances regarding snow. 
Because of this degree of specificity, it is understandable that 
the languages are not necessarily compatible, depending on 
what part of the territory one lives in.
<P>
	As for culture, these people are fishermen; they have always 
been close to nature, and the agreement before us today will 
bring them closer to an economic development which will 
enable them to manage their own natural resources. I think that 
the agreement ensures a happy union between the two cultures, 
and that it reflects a deep respect for their traditions and 
heritage. It could be the start of an economic development 
somewhat closer to our own culture.
<P>
	For all these reasons, and after a thorough review of the 
agreement, the legislation and the representations made by the 
Metis and Dene, I am pleased to say that the Bloc Quebecois 
supports Bill C-16. I hope that all members will share our view, 
so that we can speed up the implementation of this agreement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it must be spring. The sun coming through those 
stained glass windows is taking my breath away.
<P>
	As spokesperson on aboriginal affairs for the Reform Party of 
Canada I take great pleasure in opening debate on second 
reading of Bill C-16, which would have the effect of approving, 
giving effect to and declaring valid the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
comprehensive land claim agreement signed September 6, 1993.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3427"> 3427 </A></B>
<P>
	This agreement is comprehensive and complex in scope and 
far-reaching in consequences. Along with numerous 
appendices it comprises several hundred pages with many 
clauses and subclauses of considerable complexity.
<P>
	My party has some very serious reservations about the 
direction in which land claim settlements in the north have gone 
in general and specific concerns relating to this agreement in 
particular. I intend to point out some of them and I am sure that 
my colleagues will add further to what I have to say. Many of our 
members wish to speak on this bill.
<P>
	I want to emphasize at the outset that my criticism is directed 
to government policy toward the native people. In many respects 
it is not achieving the desirable result of improving 
unacceptable social and economic situations in which many of 
our native people find themselves or providing opportunities 
which could encourage and assist many of them to take their full 
place in Canadian society.
<P>
	At this time I would like to explain a little bit about my 
background. I have worked in many locations on the B.C. coast 
in the forest industry. Twenty-two yeas ago I was supervising 
tree planting and forestry crews in the Chemainus area on 
Vancouver Island with natives as crew and charge-hand. This 
connection with native forestry crews continued in Ucluelet and 
in the Queen Charlotte Islands. The workforce in the logging 
operation on the Queen Charlotte Islands was very integrated. 
Individual racial status was often not known nor of 
consequence, which is as it should be in my view.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	When one lives, works and volunteers in these small 
communities there is sensitivity that respects cultural 
differences. I have shared joy and grief and I am aware of many 
of the subtleties of native culture.
<P>
	I so much remember my Haida friend, on hearing that I was 
leaving the Charlottes, saying to me: ``John, many people have 
come to the Charlottes, worked, and then left without 
contributing a thing. I can tell you that you are an exception 
because you have made this a better place''. Madam Speaker, 
these words meant so much to me. It is so easy to become 
polarized in society, particularly when this suits someone's 
political agenda. We all have a responsibility to be constructive 
wherever possible.
<P>
	Returning to debate on Bill C-16, every time I set out to 
analyse this agreement I return to the same question. Will the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis people be better off after the agreement is 
in place than before or will they not? The agreement requires 
surrender of all further land claim interest, creates fee simple 
ownership without creating reserves, and maintains a tax regime 
for individual Dene and Metis of the Sahtu the same as that of 
any ordinary person. They pay tax on income earned. These are 
enlightened provisions with which I concur.
<P>
	My primary reasons for speaking in opposition to the bill are 
threefold. First, there is no legal rationale for this massive fee 
simple transfer of land. Second, a new bureaucracy is created. 
Third, the agreement in all its complexity is to be 
constitutionally entrenched.
<P>
	We are dealing with very substantial benefits in land and 
dollars and other rights to a relatively small population over a 
massive land area. To be specific, the Sahtu settlement area 
covered by the agreement we are discussing today covers 
280,000 square kilometres or 108,200 square miles. It is an area 
50 times the size of Prince Edward Island, five times the size of 
Nova Scotia, or 30 per cent of the size of British Columbia.
<P>
	A portion within this massive land area will be conveyed 
outright to the Sahtu Dene and Metis. Specifically they will 
receive title in fee simple to 41,000 square kilometres or 16,000 
square miles. This is an area seven times the size of Prince 
Edward Island or three-quarters the size of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	In addition to these land entitlements the Sahtu Tribal Council 
will receive each year for the next 15 years a sum of money 
totalling approximately $130 million. The Sahtu Tribal Council 
will also receive from government a portion of the royalties 
received from oil and gas exploration within the settlement area 
equivalent to 7.5 per cent of the first $2 million in royalties each 
year and 1.5 per cent of all royalties over and above the $2 
million.
<P>
	Non-share or communal settlement corporations are to be 
established to receive these capital funds and to dispense them 
for the activities and details and benefits described in detail in 
schedules I and II of chapter 8 of the agreement. These activities 
and benefits include education and training, supplementary 
funding for a wide range of existing government programs, 
loans or grants to low income people for certain purposes, 
housing, other public services, heritage preservation, economic 
development loans or guarantees, recreational facilities, elders 
assistance, one-time individual grants to all of $3,500 plus 
consumer price index adjustment to the date of payment, 
administrative costs, and qualified trusts investments.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition to all of this, the federal government is committed 
to taking measures to support the traditional economy and to 
assist business development. Moreover nothing in this 
agreement affects the participant's right to receive benefits from 
any existing or future constitutional rights for aboriginal people 
generally.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3428"> 3428 </A></B>
<P>
	This is an enormous package of benefits and one cannot help 
but be struck with the fact there are so few people who stand 
to receive them. The Sahtu ratification committee has provided 
us with the most recent count of participants in the settlement 
area. It numbers 982 adults, that is 829 Dene and 153 Metis, 
and 773 children for a total of 1,755 people.
<P>
	I would ask the minister as to the rationale the government has 
applied in arriving at this huge package of benefits for such a 
relatively small number. How has the sum of $130 million been 
arrived at? Is there any indication it is appropriate to the needs 
of the participants? Will this enormously generous package of 
benefits result in the regular programs available to native 
peoples being phased out? There is no indication in the 
agreement that this is to be so. In fact, the very opposite is said 
to be the case.
<P>
	A very disturbing aspect of this agreement is the fact that a 
massive area of land will be forever removed from the public 
lands of Canada and conveyed outright. An area equivalent to 
three-quarters the size of Nova Scotia will be conveyed to a 
collectivity totalling 1,755 people. In our view, conveyances of 
this kind are unnecessary, should not be made and are not in 
keeping with what the courts of Canada have found to constitute 
aboriginal rights.
<P>
	The area north of the 60th parallel throughout Canada has 
always been considered to be a part of the public lands of Canada 
in which all Canadians share an interest. This is the fourth land 
claim settlement undertaken by recent federal governments in 
the territories. It is apparent there is very little left of the 
Northwest Territories which has not either been conveyed 
outright to various bands or over which they have a substantial 
measure of control.
<P>
	It is apparent it is the intention of successive governments of 
Canada to blanket all of Canada's north with land claim 
settlements of this kind. One could understand granting to a 
sparse northern population traditional rights of hunting, fishing 
and trapping, subject to third party interests. But it is quite 
another matter to convey the outright ownership of vast 
territories of land. It is not necessary and my party opposes it.
<P>
	It is noted that subsurface rights are also transferred under a 
portion of the property to be conveyed outright to the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis under this agreement. I wonder if the minister 
can tell us if the Government of Canada has any idea of the 
potential in mineral and oil and gas exploration that exists in 
respect of these subsurface rights. If not, this represents a 
potential transfer of unknown proportions.
<P>
	We do not believe that land claim settlements of this kind 
should be open-ended or represent a blank cheque. After all, 
these are the public lands of Canada and the Government of 
Canada has a duty to all Canadians to administer them in the best 
interests of all. Massive transfers run contrary to this principle.
<P>
	The agreement sets out a plethora of new administrative 
tribunals and other bureaucratic instruments that are going to be 
established. The same can be said to have been the case in regard 
to the three previous land claim settlements in the territories. In 
fact in the case of the Nunavut agreement, a whole new 
government is proposed to be established: a legislature and a 
court system including the Supreme Court of Nunavut and the 
court of appeal.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	In the case of the agreement before us today, it is noted that 
five renewable resource councils are to be established for each 
of the Sahtu communities of Colville Lake, Déline, Fort 
Norman, Fort Good Hope and Norman Wells to manage the 
exercise of harvesting rights.
<P>
	A renewable resource board is to be established as the main 
instrument of wildlife management in the settlement area. Six 
members are to be nominated by the government and three by 
the Sahtu Dene and Metis.
<P>
	An arbitration panel is to be established to attempt to settle 
disputes relating to this agreement without going to court. A 
land use planning board is to be established to prepare a land use 
plan providing for the conservation, development and 
utilization of land, resources and water in the settlement area. 
Again the Sahtu Dene and Metis can nominate 50 per cent 
membership on such a board.
<P>
	A land and water board is to be established to regulate all land 
and water use within the settlement area. The environment 
impact review board and the surface rights board established to 
implement the earlier Gwich'in agreement are to have 
jurisdiction over the area with special panels established with 
the Sahtu tribal council having the right to nominate half of the 
members.
<P>
	One has to question the necessity of setting up still another 
plethora of boards, commissions and instrumentalities within 
the Northwest Territories. The fact of the matter is that most of 
these functions are now being administered by existing 
instrumentalities of either the Government of the Northwest 
Territories or the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.
<P>
	There is no obvious consideration in the agreement given to 
winding down existing boards. Layer of government upon layer 
of government in the sparsely populated Northwest Territories is 
not the way to go. We are in danger of turning a sparse 
population into a bevy of bureaucrats, yet one of the main stated 
purposes of the agreement is to permit pursuit of a traditional 
livelihood and way of life.
<P>
	Later this year the government is expected to introduce the 
Mackenzie Valley resource management act which it is said will 
fulfil the resource requirements of the various regional land 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3429"> 3429 </A></B>
<P>
claim settlements in the western Arctic. In addition it will bring 
a new system of resource management to the Mackenzie Valley. 
Indications are that this act will create still additional  boards to 
co-ordinate the activities of the others. Where will it end, 
bureaucracy on top of bureaucracy?
<P>
	The agreement provides for a most elaborate process of 
negotiations in the future to conclude agreements on Sahtu Dene 
and Metis self-government. This framework agreement is set 
out in appendix B of the agreement. It is important to note this 
framework agreement contemplates negotiations on the transfer 
of legislative-making powers to the Sahtu Dene and Metis over 
a long list of 18 subject matters.
<P>
	One has to question the necessity of this given the fact the 
agreement we are debating today deals with virtually every 
aspect of these people's lives. The real question is: Is 
self-government necessary or appropriate for so few people 
scattered over such a wide area? Whether or not a 
self-government agreement is negotiated remains for the 
outcome of future negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I would stress the fact that self-government arrangements or 
agreements must provide that the laws passed by legislative 
bodies and governments of the aboriginal peoples and the 
administrative practices of such governments must comply with 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. To be certain this 
will be the case, it may well be necessary to amend section 32 of 
the Constitution to specifically provide that the legislation 
passed and administrative action taken by aboriginal 
governments will be subject to the charter.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister could advise the House whether the 
Minister of Justice has examined this issue and expressed an 
opinion as to whether or not the actions of aboriginal 
governments are now covered by the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, or whether an amendment to the Constitution is 
required.
<P>
	If approved, Bill C-16 constitutionalizes the agreement 
within the meaning of section 35 of the amendments to the 
Canadian Constitution which came into force in 1982. While the 
full scope of this constitutional protection is not clear, it almost 
certainly means the agreement can only be amended by resorting 
to the appropriate part of the amending formula set out in the 
Constitution. If it be otherwise, constitutional protection means 
nothing.
<P>
	When one looks at the amending formula in the Constitution 
there are no less than six different formulae, only one of which is 
designed to be used in a particular circumstance. The fact of the 
matter is that none of them fit the case of an agreement entered 
into by the Government of Canada and a tribal council of native 
peoples. When the amending formula was designed there was no 
thought given to devising constitutionally entrenched land 
claim agreements between an Indian band and the Government 
of Canada.
<P>
	If this had been an agreement between the Government of 
Canada and a single province then section 43 would apply and 
the agreement could only be amended by consent of both the 
provincial legislature and the Government of Canada. However, 
the Sahtu Tribal Council is not a province and it is unclear how 
this agreement can be amended.
<P>
	Section 41, which is the general amending formula, might be 
the only amending formula available in this case. The irony is 
that this general amending formula requires not only a 
resolution of Parliament, but also of at least seven provincial 
legislatures. Of course this is totally inappropriate.
<P>
	There are two aspects of constitutional entrenchment that 
cause me concern. First, this is a complicated agreement. I think 
it unwise to constitutionalize such detail given the uncertainty 
as to how it can be properly amended.
<P>
	I am well aware clause 3.1.26 of the agreement provides that 
once the agreement is in force it may be amended by consent of 
the cabinet and the Sahtu Tribal Council. If this is so, it is 
difficult to see that the agreement has protection under section 
35 of the Constitution.
<P>
	My second concern is to question the wisdom of entrenching 
all of the detailed provisions of the agreement until it has been in 
force for a period of time to consider whether or not it is 
workable.
<P>
	It would be preferable to constitutionalize the land rights and 
perhaps the other benefits to be paid. All of the administrative 
and regulatory provisions should not be constitutionally 
entrenched to ensure flexibility as circumstances dictate.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Who are we to say we know what is best for future generations 
in those areas? If there is to be certainty, finality and stability to 
these land claim agreements, there must be the extinguishment 
of any claim to other undefined and uncertain aboriginal rights 
over land that might be put forward in the future.
<P>
	I am therefore pleased to see under clause 3(1)(11) that in 
consideration of the rights and benefits provided under this 
agreement, the Sahtu Dene and Metis release and surrender to 
the Government of Canada all their claims, rights, title and 
interests if any to other lands and waters anywhere in Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased to see such a provision in this agreement. It is 
rumoured that the minister does not favour extinguishment 
clauses in agreements of this kind and that he has instructed 
departmental staff to expunge from their vocabulary the word 
extinguishment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3430"> 3430 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know whether this is in fact the case but if it is, I 
say with the greatest of respect to the minister that it is the 
wrong course for him to take. I say that because the content 
of these agreements represents substantial concessions from 
government to the native people and the most reasonable quid 
pro quo should be for the final resolution of outstanding 
aboriginal claims.
<P>
	To enter into these agreements with the prospect of having to 
do it again a few years down the road is a prospect that should 
not be entertained by government. Although there is an 
extinguishment clause, the agreement provides that it in no way 
affects the right of the Sahtu Dene and Metis to participate in 
any benefit from any existing or future constitutional rights 
extended to aboriginal people or their right to continue to 
benefit from all government native programs.
<P>
	What is missing in this agreement is any indication that if it 
proves to be successful over a period of time, financial 
assistance and government native programs of a general nature 
can be phased out. All of this is at the expense of the Canadian 
taxpayer and surely the objective is to provide self-sufficiency 
and ultimately the removal of the need for government 
assistance beyond that available to ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to have seen more of an indication that this is the 
direction in which the government wishes to go. One should also 
ask what we do if this agreement turns out to be unsuccessful 
over a period of years.
<P>
	My final point concerns the tendency of the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to take a decidedly 
advocate role on behalf of the native peoples. I can understand 
that this is its mandate up to a point but with issues such as 
conveying large areas of public lands, the actions of the 
department should be in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	Too often these agreements are worked out behind closed 
doors with the ordinary Canadian in blissful ignorance of what is 
going on. I am delighted that the Sahtu agreement is being 
debated at some length is this House, unlike earlier north of 60 
agreements. In future it would be advantageous to determine a 
mechanism for debate at a much earlier stage than merely at 
ratification. I commend this approach to the minister for his 
consideration.
<P>
	I regretfully conclude that the major beneficiaries of this 
agreement are negotiators, advisers and lawyers. I have 
concerns that the average Sahtu Dene or Metis may be no further 
ahead in the long run as a result of this agreement. I wish them 
well.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of Bill C-16, the Sahtu Dene and Metis Land Claim 
Settlement act.
<P>
	As previous members have described, this is a claim which 
deals with that part of the Mackenzie Valley which involves 
Great Bear Lake and the area to the west and the bands that live 
in those areas.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased to speak in support of this legislation. 
It is another example of the government's commitment to build 
partnerships with aboriginal peoples, partnerships based on 
mutual respect.
<P>
	The resolution of native land claims is a major part of that 
commitment. The federal government is committed to 
significantly increasing the rate of land claims settlement. It has 
been seeking new ways to resolve impediments that slow that 
process down.
<P>
	I would like to give members of this House some background 
to the Sahtu land claim agreement as an example of the claims 
negotiation process. I would like to describe what 
comprehensive claims are and provide some details of the 
process that is followed to successfully conclude them.
<P>
	First, I will give a few highlights of the evolution of the 
concept of aboriginal rights in the context of land claims. 
Protecting lands occupied by aboriginal peoples from outside 
acquisition can be traced to the royal proclamation of 1763. 
With Confederation, Canada assumed responsibility for 
applying this principle.
<P>
	The common law concept of aboriginal rights was addressed 
in 1973 in a Supreme Court case which acknowledged the 
existence of aboriginal title in Canadian law. Six years later in 
1979 a common law test for continuing aboriginal rights was 
established in another federal court decision.
<P>
	These two groundbreaking decisions were followed by the 
recognition of the central importance of the concept of 
aboriginal rights to aboriginal peoples in the Canadian 
Constitution, specifically section 35(1). In 1990 the Sparrow 
case tried before the Supreme Court provided the first analysis 
of the implication of this recognition.
<P>
	All these decisions established that the exercise of aboriginal 
rights could be regulated by government. The court also set out 
strict tests which were to be applied to determine if government 
interference with section 35 rights was justified in specific 
cases. The court has also concluded that rights are unique to 
each aboriginal group. Given that the rights are common law and 
not written down their extent and nature have been the subject of 
considerable debate.
<P>
	Before these court decisions were enacted defining the special 
rights of aboriginal groups within treaties had long been an 
important aspect of the relationship between aboriginal peoples 
and the crown. As well the evolution and development of the 
federal government's land claims policy has been closely linked 
to court decisions, particularly the decisions that I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3431"> 3431 </A></B>
<P>
	To address any uncertainty created by the decisions the 
federal government announced that it was willing to negotiate 
land claims settlements with native peoples. As the policy 
developed, claims were divided into two broad categories, 
comprehensive and specific.
<P>
	Comprehensive claims are based on the concept of continuing 
aboriginal rights and title which have not been dealt with by 
treaty or other legal means. The courts have emphasized that the 
proper way to resolve outstanding land claims is through 
agreements negotiated fairly by the affected parties.
<P>
	Specific claims, on the other hand, arise from the alleged 
non-fulfilment of Indian treaties and other lawful obligations or 
the improper administration of lands and other assets under the 
Indian Act.
<P>
	All these court decisions and constitutional guarantees 
provided the background within which the Sahtu agreement was 
negotiated.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	To further describe this process I would like to list the 
objectives of comprehensive claims settlements, of which this is 
an extremely important example.
<P>
	The primary purpose is to conclude agreements with 
aboriginal groups that will resolve the debates and legal 
ambiguities associated with the common law concept of 
aboriginal rights and title.
<P>
	Uncertainty with respect to the legal status of lands and 
resources created by a lack of political agreement with 
aboriginal groups has been a barrier to economic development 
for all Canadians and has hindered the full participation of 
aboriginal peoples in land and resource management.
<P>
	The comprehensive claims process is intended to lead to 
agreement on special rights aboriginal peoples will have in the 
future with respect to lands and resources. It is not an attempt to 
define what rights they may have had in the past.
<P>
	The process of comprehensive claims settlement has five 
stages. The first is initial negotiation when issues are identified 
for discussion. The second is substantive negotiation when 
issues are discussed to produce the agreement in principle that 
contains all the features of the eventual settlement. The third is 
finalization when all parties formalize decisions needed in the 
agreement in principle to produce a final agreement. The fourth 
stage is enactment of settlement legislation which brings the 
agreement into force. The fifth stage is the implementation of 
settlement legislation when the terms of the agreement are 
carried out by all parties.
<P>
	During the initial and substantive stages, the first two stages I 
mentioned of the settlement process, aboriginal groups may 
obtain loans from the government to hire professional and 
technical staff to help them prepare and negotiate their claims.
<P>
	Most of the lands and resources that are subject of 
negotiations and that are required for the settlement of 
comprehensive claims are owned by a province. Because of this 
the federal government feels that provincial governments must 
participate in the often complex negotiations and must 
contribute to the provision of claims benefits to aboriginal 
groups.
<P>
	In Yukon and Northwest Territories most lands and resources 
fall under federal jurisdiction. Nevertheless, territorial 
governments participate fully in claims negotiations and have 
made commitments to aboriginal groups through claims 
settlements. This was certainly the case of the Sahtu agreement. 
The Northwest Territories government was an active participant 
in all deliberations.
<P>
	As in all deliberations, including those leading up to Bill 
C-16, the scope of discussions was defined so as to arrive at a 
fair and just resolution of the outstanding claim in a manner that 
would uphold the honour of the crown.
<P>
	As well, settlements including the one before us today are 
designed to ensure that the interests of aboriginal groups in 
resource management and environmental protection are 
recognized and that claimants share in the benefits of 
development. A number of these points were mentioned in 
previous speeches.
<P>
	To achieve these objectives settlement agreements must 
define a wide range of rights and benefits to be exercised and 
enjoyed by claimant groups. These rights and benefits usually 
include full ownership of certain lands in the area covered by the 
settlement, guaranteed wildlife harvesting rights, guaranteed 
participation in land, water, wildlife and environmental 
management throughout the settlement area, financial 
compensation, resource revenue sharing and specific measures 
to stimulate economic development and a role in the 
management of heritage resources and parks in the settlement 
area.
<P>
	The rights and benefits of the Sahtu Dene and Metis in this 
particular case have been described by the minister and other 
speakers today.
<P>
	Members should know that settlement rights are 
constitutionally protected and cannot be altered without the 
concurrence of claimant groups. A claimant group may retain 
any aboriginal rights that it may have had with respect to the 
lands it will hold following the settlement so long as such rights 
are consistent with the final agreement. As well those aboriginal 
rights that are not related to land and resources, or to other 
subjects under negotiation, will not be affected by the exchange 
of rights in the negotiated settlement.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Resource revenue sharing is negotiated so that the group can 
share federal royalties derived from resource extraction 
throughout the area covered by the group's settlement 
agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3432"> 3432 </A></B>
<P>
	Enhanced aboriginal involvement in environmental 
management is also provided for. Such arrangements, however, 
recognize that government has an overriding obligation to 
ensure resource conservation, to protect the interests of all 
users, to respect international agreements and to manage 
renewable resources within its jurisdiction.
<P>
	If an aboriginal group's traditional activities have extended to 
offshore areas, their claim settlement may include offshore 
wildlife harvesting rights.
<P>
	The House should be aware that in its efforts to clarify the 
rights of aboriginal people the federal government does not 
intend to diminish the rights of others. Public and third party 
interests will be respected in the negotiation of claim 
settlements and if affected they will be dealt with equitably.
<P>
	I hope my colleagues appreciate the long and complex process 
that has brought us to second reading of Bill C-16. I urge 
members to support the bill. Its passage will benefit all 
Canadians as well as help First Nations become strong and 
prosperous. I hope all bands associated with the Sahtu Tribal 
Council will have a happy and prosperous future as a result of 
this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Madam Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the hon. member's speech, and I wish 
he would expand on the five stages and the process around what 
is referred to in English as a comprehensive agreement. The first 
two stages the hon. member mentioned were initial 
negotiations, when issues are identified for discussion, and 
substantive negotiations to identify all aspects of the issues, the 
entire process being financed by the federal government.
<P>
	Earlier in my speech, I said that, to justify raising the Indian 
Affairs budget, perhaps the government would like to give us a 
preview of its plans for further negotiations. Could the hon. 
member tell us whether the Liberal government plans to 
increase the level and number of negotiations of the kind we are 
discussing today, which would partly justify maintaining and 
even increasing the Indian Affairs budget?
<P>
	I would also appreciate it if he would share with us his views 
on the involvement of the provincial governments in these 
agreements, although I am aware that today we have the 
involvement of the government of the Northwest Territories, 
which is not quite a provincial government. I would appreciate it 
if he would explain how he sees the involvement of the 
provincial governments in the negotiations around land claims.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
interest and his questions. I listened with great interest to his 
remarks.
<P>
	I made it clear that the government was very keen to move 
forward with claims settlements. I am afraid I cannot comment 
on the details of the budget. Unlike the hon. member this is not 
one of my specialty areas. However I would be glad to find out 
the relationship between our plans to speed up negotiations and 
the budget, if he so wishes.
<P>
	With regard to the question of involvement of the provinces, 
in my speech I specifically mentioned that the case of the 
Northwest Territories was quite special. In that area the federal 
government still has a great deal of control. Nevertheless, 
despite that, the federal government involved the NWT 
government in these negotiations because it was the proper thing 
to do.
<P>
	As I also pointed out, if that is proper in the case of the NWT 
government, where I suppose it could be argued that the federal 
government need not have involved that level of government, it 
is even more true in the case of the provinces. The federal 
government will involve the provinces in equivalent 
negotiations in the future.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the presentation and I have a couple of 
questions for the member.
<P>
	The member outlined two different types of land claims in 
Canada and how they are dealt with. He explained that the 
particular agreement falls under the comprehensive land claim 
policy which states that under the comprehensive land claim 
agreement entitlement to lands not dealt with under treaty fall in 
this category.
<P>
	In my opinion this particular land area is clearly dealt with 
under treaty 11. Also in my opinion the Government of Canada 
has fulfilled its obligation under treaty 11 in every way possible. 
How is this particular land claim justified under that particular 
area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, although I have an opinion on 
the status of treaty 11 and the outcomes which have not appeared 
from that treaty, in this case I would like to take the question 
under advisement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with a great deal of interest to the legal base that the hon. 
member laid out. I thank him for placing that on the record. I am 
sure it will be the subject of consultation and examination.
<P>
	Would the member give the House a view on the question of 
the fee simple aspect of this agreement? Does the member 
concur that fee simple transfer on such a broad basis as is 
undergone in this agreement goes beyond any legal precedent 
we have seen in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I have to say I am not familiar 
with all the legal precedents, but it does seem to me that one of 
the bases of these claims negotiations is that there are groups of 
people who have variously occupied very large areas. It seems to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3433"> 3433 </A></B>
<P>
me logical that when the settlement is made there is some 
agreement or  jurisdiction over a very large area which reflects 
the fact that over long periods of time they have occupied those 
areas in a particular way. There are much tighter agreements 
over other areas in which, particularly in recent decades, people 
have lived in a much more non-migratory way.
<P>
	Therefore it seems to me the fee simple part of these 
agreements has to do with that. There are rights to wildlife 
management over large areas and more controlled rights the 
closer we get to the areas presently occupied by the native 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wonder if the member opposite would care to 
comment on the whole nature or the whole question of 
precedent. There are some very good things in this settlement 
and there are some things we are questioning.
<P>
	While we recognize that these lands are exclusively under 
federal jurisdiction, I wonder if there is any notion of precedent. 
We will have further land claim settlements in provincial 
territory. There are pending land claim settlements in Albert 
with Metis, for instance. Would the member speak to the issue of 
precedence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, unlike many members of the 
House I am not a lawyer. In using the word precedence as a more 
general term, this is a precedent. It is an indication of the fact 
that the government and the people of Canada want to move on 
many of these settlements.
<P>
	With regard to precedence in the more technical sense, it 
relates to the question I answered of the member from the Bloc 
previously, that when such negotiations are made in provincial 
jurisdictions provincial governments will be fully involved. To 
that extent the precedent of involving the NWT government is a 
very good and a very healthy one. It is very proper to involve 
provincial governments in their areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Madam Speaker, thank 
you for the opportunity to participate in the debate on Bill C-16.
<P>
	I have particular interest in the proposed legislation, having 
lived and worked among the people of this area. Perhaps I have a 
better understanding of this part of Canada and its people than 
someone living in suburban Ottawa, Toronto or Edmonton.
<P>
	As I have repeatedly said, I strongly support the right of 
Canada's aboriginal peoples to self-determination and 
self-reliance. Therefore when representatives of the Sahtu 
Tribal Council first presented the agreement to me I was 
supportive. There are many elements of this proposal that 
moved the aboriginal people of the Mackenzie Valley toward the 
objectives I support. I am referring to the rejection of the 
objectionable apartheid principles of the reservation system of 
more southern parts of Canada.
<P>
	The co-operative approach to resource management and free 
access to their traditional lands for traditional purposes is 
positive. The requirement to contribute to the tax system to help 
support their own government and the preservation of the social 
safety net system so essential to all Canadians including 
aboriginals is also a positive step. In my view the taxation 
provisions of the agreement are very complex and no doubt will 
be the subject of legal interpretation.
<P>
	On these points and in the hope the cash payment and the 
share of the resource revenue would end the devastating cycle of 
welfare dependency which has robbed these once independent, 
hardy people of their self-esteem and initiative, unfortunately 
the closer I examined the agreement the more I came to realize 
these positive things would never be achieved through the 
agreement.
<P>
	More and more I began to question the motivation and 
objectives of those negotiating on behalf of the people of 
Canada. When I contacted public affairs of the department of 
Indian affairs and Northern Development and inquired as to the 
objectives of this process, I was told it was to right the injustices 
of the past and to supplement rather than replace the provisions 
of treaty 11.
<P>
	Immediately I have to ask what injustices are we trying to 
right. If one is familiar or cares to study the history of the area 
north of the 60th parallel, one would discover that there is a 
substantial difference from the history of more southern 
neighbours.
<P>
	To begin with, life for aboriginals in the land north of 60 has 
traditionally been a subsistence existence, harsh and 
unforgiving. From the earliest encroachment into this land by 
European settlement, the federal government has recognized its 
responsibility to the people living there and made efforts in spite 
of the vast wilderness and harsh climate to provide, where 
possible, help through RCMP outposts and local missions.
<P>
	I will not accept the popular myth spread by certain 
self-serving interests that the encroachment of European 
settlers constitutes an injustice against the aboriginal people 
here or anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
	At the turn of the century western and northern Canada was a 
vast, mostly uninhabited land in real danger of being annexed to 
the United States. The aboriginal people living in this vast 
territory were eager for the technology which the Europeans 
brought with them, in spite of the problems that came with them.
<P>
	It was under these circumstances that the then Government of 
Canada, through a series of grossly distorted and overly 
optimistic ads, invited Europeans from all parts of Europe to 
come to western Canada with the promise of 160 acres or a half 
square mile of land for the sum of $10 and a freer, richer 
lifestyle, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3434"> 3434 </A></B>
<P>
all the time having the real objective of asserting sovereignty 
over western and northern Canada.
<P>
	It was under these circumstances that my grandfather along 
with thousands of others came to Canada, not to perpetrate an 
injustice upon the aboriginal people but to accept the 
opportunity being offered.
<P>
	In spite of the great disappointment upon arriving in a bush 
covered, swampy, fly and mosquito infested homestead in 
northern Alberta, my grandfather and grandmother built a home 
with the trees on the land, cleared the land with only an axe and a 
team of horses, and built a farm in spite of the injustices of hail, 
frost, depression, injury, disease and government 
misrepresentation. That is how to build self-esteem and 
self-worth.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I cannot and will not be held responsible for the actions of the 
past political leadership of this country any more than the 
aboriginal people can be held responsible for their past 
leadership. Therefore I will not accept the guilt or support 
compensation for my being here or my helping to develop 
industries which now support us in the best standard of living in 
the world. However I would support any agreement or effort to 
help the aboriginal people of this area to participate and enjoy 
the benefits of life enjoyed by all other Canadians.
<P>
	I believe this agreement entrenches in the Constitution 
commitments on the Government of Canada that may not be in 
the best interest of all Canadians or responsibilities that Canada 
can no longer afford.
<P>
	The richness of this package should shock even the most 
liberal Canadian. The agreement gives $100,000 in financial 
entitlement over 15 years plus title in fee simple to eight square 
miles of land per capita counting children, plus a share of 
resource revenue amounting to somewhere between $200,000 
and $400,000 per year.
<P>
	In my view the settlement would be acceptable if it would 
then cause to end the financial responsibility of the federal 
government to these people. The truth is far different. Clause 
3.1.5 clearly states that the participants in the agreement shall 
have full access to all present and future programs for aboriginal 
people as well as programs available to all other Canadians.
<P>
	These programs now include not only a share of the $4.5 
billion budget of the department of Indian affairs and Northern 
Development but also a share of the proliferation of government 
programs for aboriginals provided by at least 29 specific 
programs in 15 other departments of government, costing at 
least another $5 billion. All this is being offered at a time when 
our country is bankrupt and our most treasured social safety net 
system is decomposing because of the financial restraints being 
imposed on it.
<P>
	On top of the aforementioned benefits the agreement also 
calls for the establishment of no less than nine separate boards 
funded by federal money and a written commitment to negotiate 
a self-government agreement with the institution of this 
government agreement also presumably funded by Ottawa.
<P>
	This brings me back to a question that I raised earlier. What 
could possibly be the motivation or justification of such an 
agreement? In my opinion there have been no great injustices 
perpetrated on the people of this area above those imposed on all 
our lives by the advancement of technology and our consuming 
lifestyle.
<P>
	The government is already redistributing tax and resource 
dollars in a major way to help these people catch up. The 
Canadian government 73 years ago at the request of these 
aboriginal people entered into treaty No. 11 and has more than 
met its obligations. In fact the text of treaty No. 11 states: ``The 
said Indians do hereby cede, release, surrender and yield up to 
the Government of the Dominion of Canada for His Majesty the 
King and his successors forever all their rights, titles and 
privileges whatsoever to the lands included within the following 
limits and also the said Indian rights, titles and privileges 
whatsoever to all other lands wherever situated in the Yukon 
Territory, the Northwest Territory or any other portion of the 
Dominion of Canada''.
<P>
	Where does this initiative for the land claim settlement come 
from? In my opinion the initiative comes from the real root of 
the aboriginal problem in Canada, the insidious parasitic Indian 
industry. That group of lawyers, consultants, bureaucrats and 
Indian leaders year after year swallow up the vast majority of 
money designated to solve the problems of poverty, illiteracy, 
substance abuse and suffering among our native people.
<P>
	This agreement does nothing to solve that problem and in fact 
greatly reinforces it. Instead of continuing to feed this selfish 
parasitic monster, let us break the cycle by making available to 
aboriginal Canadians programs available to all Canadians and 
then providing an affordable amount of the $10 billion plus now 
spent on aboriginal services and programs to grassroots 
aboriginal people in the form of a guaranteed annual income.
<P>
	We will then give the power to tax to the proposed aboriginal 
governments. These aboriginal governments will then be truly 
accountable to their people. The people will decide what 
programs they are willing and able to pay for. They will also 
decide if their tax dollars should pay for their chief or band 
administrator to spend in one year $130,000 on travel, as was the 
case of a band chief in Manitoba, the very birthplace of 
self-government proposed by the minister of aboriginal affairs. 
There would still be those selfish, greedy people who would try 
to exploit these people but at least it would provide a much 
greater accountability if combined with regular, fair, democratic 
elections than the system now provides.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3435"> 3435 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would urge hon. members to re-examine the 
whole agreement and its implications. I ask members to 
consider what it means, when in spite of the fact that only 73 
years ago the Canadian government entered into treaty No. 11 
and the fact that this land claim is in clear violation of the terms 
of this treaty, we are repeatedly reminded that the rights gained 
by aboriginals through these treaties is a binding contract on 
Canada forever.
<P>
	I also ask members to consider whether we have the right to 
commit future generations of Canadians to this extremely 
generous package, considering Canada's financial situation and 
our doubtful ability to maintain our current social safety net 
system.
<P>
	Last, I ask members to question the real motivation behind 
this agreement and who stands to benefit most. Look at the 
Indian bands in Canada that have accumulated great wealth 
through resource revenue and it is obvious that money will not 
solve the problems we are trying to solve. These problems can 
only be solved by the people regaining their self-esteem and 
self-worth. We are providing enough wealth that 982 adult 
aboriginals need never work or strive to meet goals again in their 
lifetime. However it will not accomplish this any more than it 
did for others.
<P>
	I ask that members not buy into this guilt trip so skilfully put 
on us and not enter into another binding contract based solely on 
racial origin that is to last as long as the sun rises and the rivers 
flow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B> 
Madam Speaker,
<P>
	<I>[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut]</I>
<P>
	Listening to the two members from the Reform Party one 
would think we were invading and taking over the land they have 
always occupied.
<P>
	After listening to what they are saying it seems we are going 
in as aboriginal people and saying that they should excuse us but 
we are taking over the land. They never quite point out that the 
people they are talking about, the Sahtu, whose land claims we 
are discussing today, have been in that neighbourhood for 
36,000 years.
<P>
	One would think after listening to the previous speaker-I 
will get to the question-that the aboriginal people were just 
there to invite the Government of Canada to take over our land 
and say it is all yours. It was not quite like that. There were 
losses imposed whether it was renewable wildlife loss, or social 
loss like custom adoption or mission schools that were imposed 
on the aboriginal people.
<P>
	We did not ask for any of that. We did not ask for a lot. 
Somebody told us that we could not hunt geese in the springtime 
which we have always done. We could not hunt muskox or 
whales any more because they were almost extinct because some 
hunters and whalers came  along and hunted all the muskoxen, 
whales, and whatever else.
<P>
	The member talked about mosquito infested areas and the 
hardships that his grandparents went through. We think it is a 
beautiful land. We do not talk about the mosquitoes infesting the 
land or cold and hardships. It is our land. We like it. It does not 
matter whether there are 10 million mosquitoes around. It is a 
beautiful land. We do not describe it as mosquito infested or 
cold and harsh.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	The attitude of people like the member who just spoke and the 
other Reform member who spoke earlier, I repeat, is 
unbelievable. We are not asking him to accept the guilt. All we 
are doing through this legislation is trying to right the wrongs 
that were done to the aboriginal people of that area, in this case, 
the Sahtu. Words fail me because it is too unbelievable to even 
contemplate the attitude of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would ask a couple of questions. If we look back far enough, 
we will find that the lands that were occupied for the last 30,000 
years were occupied by the Dene. If the member wants to trace 
his history in that area, he would go back no more than a couple 
hundred years, if that far.
<P>
	Should there not be some justification in settling a claim with 
the people who have occupied that land and who can trace back 
their occupation in tens of thousands of years? Second, would he 
not agree that the right thing to do would be to recognize the 
aboriginal people's inherent right of self-government and that 
the aboriginal people deserve to have that recognition?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the member 
opposite drew such bizarre conclusions from what he heard 
myself and the other Reform Party member talk about. The fact 
is the Canadian government resisted entering into a treaty with 
the aboriginal people of this area for some time, choosing to 
leave them live a traditional lifestyle and to not disrupt that way 
of life.
<P>
	If one examines the history of the area, one also notes that it 
was the aboriginal people who on a number of occasions 
requested that the Canadian government enter into treaty with 
them. In fact, the leadership of the very communities that we 
speak of in this agreement put their signatures to treaty No. 11.
<P>
	Therefore we had the situation where the federal government 
had no responsibility to the aboriginal people. It was the choice 
of the aboriginal people themselves. They chose to enter that 
agreement.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m. pursuant to Standing 
Order 35, the House will now proceed to Statements by

we hear today that Canada's recovery and renewal are based on

that Canada was built by our farmers, by our miners, by our 
fishermen, by our forestry workers and by our manufacturers 
mainly in the automobile business.
<P>
	That is where the majority of jobs were, that is where the 
majority of jobs are today and that is where the majority of the 
jobs will be in the future.
<P>
	This government can assist all of those industries by getting 
their products to the global market by a fast economical and 
Canadian transportation system.
<P>

Canada that will change these goals and get all Canadians back

<P>
	It is the only sanctioned Ironman race on the North American

includes swimming, biking and a marathon run. The 1994 race

Cartier, the St. Croix, the Shelburne and the Main.
<P>
	In January 1984 in order to protect these rivers and to retain 
their beauty for future generations, the Canadian heritage river 
system was formed under the auspices of Parks Canada. This is a 
national system of protected rivers from sea to sea to sea. It 
consists of 27 rivers totalling almost 6,000 kilometres. This 
number will hopefully grow in coming years.

	The heritage river program deserves support. Canadians can 
generate it by writing to Parks Canada and to their federal

four years after opposition political parties became legal. 
However, the democratic forces in South Africa are still the

which took  place this morning and the one which occurred 
yesterday, close to the ANC offices, in Johannesburg.

their support and ensure a smooth election process. For the

unemployment rates are higher than ever. Youth crime statistics 
are soaring.
<P>
	Constituents tell me that on an average Friday or Saturday 
night numbers of young people can be found in the parking lots 
of my riding of Calgary Southeast partying and sometimes 
vandalising. There is little fear of being caught. Many know if 
they are caught the punishment will be easy to handle.
<P>
	Members from all areas of society, including youth groups, 
have been calling for the government to make changes to the 
Young Offenders Act. Does this government have the strength to 
show Canadian youth it cares about them, that it is willing to 
make the tough decisions to guarantee their future?
<P>

characteristics which we must strive to achieve. Accordingly, 
when inequities are identified Canadians should expect prompt 
attention from their elected representatives.
<P>
	One such inequity has to do with child care expenses. Under 
the present income tax law one spouse cannot pay another 
spouse to provide direct parental care and receive a deduction 
for the expense. However, in the case of same sex couples who 
have custody of a child, one can pay the other for child care 
expenses and deduct the cost on their income tax return. This

<B><A NAME="3439"> 3439 </A></B>

effectively provides for income splitting not available to

What this means is better conservation of the lobster fishery and 
a long term sustainable lobster fishery.
<P>
	For many years researchers and the Department of Fisheries

Mr. Speaker, Canada has an immigration system that is well

devastating.
<P>
	One example is the application of 89 year old Mrs. Arora, who 
has been denied a visitors visa to visit Canada. She is the mother

She was a landed immigrant in Canada, returned to her home

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMREFORM">SOCIAL PROGRAM REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	After referring to the unemployed as beer drinkers, the leader 
of the government also announced in Toronto that he would 
proceed with his reform of social programs, in spite of 
opposition and reticence from the provinces, which he qualified 
as turf wars, although, except in the case of unemployment 
insurance, these programs are a provincial responsibility.
<P>
	In spite of his reputation as a constitutional bulldozer, will the 
Prime Minister acknowledge that by forcing his reform of social 
programs on the provinces he is acting irresponsibly, since this 
strategy will merely lead to sterile confrontations and 
unnecessary duplication?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said that, like all governments, this government has a mandate 
to work on creating jobs, not to indulge in squabbles, 
constitutional or otherwise, that would adversely affect the 
economic climate in this country. In fact, in recent months we 
proved that we were able to conclude agreements with 
provincial governments. We signed an infrastructure agreement 
with the Government of Quebec, which is working very well, 
and also with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3440"> 3440 </A></B>
<P>
other provincial governments; we managed to deal with the 
Sainte-Marguerite River project; and we have concluded 
similar arrangements.
<P>
	Obviously, we cannot deal with all the problems, especially 
the more difficult ones, and especially when the Opposition is 
looking for a bone to pick and keeps trying to talk about the 
Constitution and jurisdictional matters instead of focussing on 
job creation. We were elected to create jobs, and that is why we 
are going to introduce reforms in our own jurisdiction that will 
create more jobs. We hope the provinces will be willing to do 
likewise, so that both levels of government will benefit and, 
above all, so that workers will get what they want: jobs that will 
provide them with an honest living.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he would 
agree that his government has already started ``bulldozing'' the 
provinces in the area of social programs, first through the 
training component of the federal adjustment plan for 
fishermen, and second, through its youth strategy, in both cases 
increasing the overlap he denies exists.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Regarding our 
strategy for the fishermen, the Government of Newfoundland, 
where 85 per cent of the target population comes from, has 
praised the reform which was developed in consultation with it 
and other governments.
<P>
	As for youth job creation, that is a priority for this 
government. The federal government has always had such 
programs. It had them under the Conservative government when 
the Leader of the Opposition was a member and a minister on the 
government side. My point is that, today, the hon. member is 
hardly in a position to blame us for doing what he did himself, 
and we make no apologies for doing everything we can to create 
jobs, especially for young people.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Prime Minister following the callous approach he 
took in Quebec prior to the forced patriation of 1981, when he 
refuses to have an open and public discussion of these reforms of 
social programs with his provincial counterparts, as requested 
by Mr. Bob Rae of Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development has had several 
meetings with his colleagues and was supposed to have another 
one last Monday. The provincial governments said they were not 
ready, and the minister postponed the meeting. That is exactly 
how we want to proceed. At the request of several provinces, the 
minister cancelled the meeting he was prepared to call at that 
time. We can hardly do more than talk to the provinces and, if 
they want us to postpone the talks, we say yes. Eventually, 
governments will have to agree, because the unemployed cannot 
wait while we squabble  over constitutional matters. They want 
jobs, and we will do everything to satisfy them in that respect.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 13 
last, in response to a question from my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, the Prime Minister stated, and I 
quote: ``- I am sure that all committee chairs will be very 
pleased to consider all recommendations for spending cuts and 
that will make the hon. members very happy. I asked our party to 
do so, because we want our members to be involved. There is no 
problem, then''.
<P>
	Well, Mr. Speaker, there is a problem. What explanation can 
the Prime Minister give for the fact that Liberal members have 
so far disregarded his undertaking and have systematically 
refused to carry out a comprehensive review of government 
expenditures, as the Prime Minister had promised?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the committees have work to do and they do the best they can. 
They have received a mandate from this House and, if the 
Opposition members want to submit a list of the programs they 
would like this government to cut, they can do so here, in this 
House. We will gladly accept it. However, with the Opposition, 
it is always the same old story when we ask them to identify the 
programs they would like us to cut. When we proceed to make 
cuts, they say we are targeting the wrong program. But they 
never let us know where they want the cuts to be made. When 
they themselves know, perhaps then they will tell us. Why all the 
fuss? Send me a letter! Deliver it to me here, in the House. What 
could be simpler!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be 
happy to write a letter to the Prime Minister. I will send him as 
many letters as he wants, if that is what it takes. However, I was 
under the impression that he had made a commitment in this 
House that the committees would, on his orders, proceed to 
review government spending as requested. Is the Prime Minister 
leading his members? Does he have any leadership? Can he give 
us some assurance that his own members will do what he said? 
After all, he was the one who gave us his word.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> It is very 
difficult, Mr. Speaker, to satisfy the opposition. When I decide 
to do something it blames me because I am moving too fast.
<P>
	In this case I respect the good judgment of members of 
Parliament who have been elected and who work hard in their 
committee duties. They know that we cannot look at everything 
at the same time. But when we look at something the opposition 
wants to look at something else.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3441"> 3441 </A></B>
<P>
	I will let my members decide. I know they have good 
judgment and I know that they are not afraid to look at all the 
expenditures of the government. They are like me, if they can 
give some good direction to the government about cuts they will 
be happy with that. At the same time they know they have to 
respect the rules of the committee. If the members opposite are 
never satisfied it will be very difficult to satisfy them. They 
have to be there and give the list that they have prepared, 
apparently, but which they never made public.

is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	This government was elected on a promise of jobs and 
infrastructure. Pearson airport is arguably the single most 
important piece of infrastructure in Canada and a huge creator of 
jobs.
<P>
	All five regional chairpersons in the metro area agree that 
future growth and jobs are at risk. The review on Pearson by Mr. 
Robert Nixon recommended the same thing, that immediate 
construction begin.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why he continues to ignore local 
leaders and the Nixon report by delaying action on this 
important project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to assure my hon. friend that I am not disregarding the 
advice from important political leaders in the greater 
metropolitan Toronto area.
<P>
	I have met with the chairman of metro Toronto, Alan Tonks, 
with the mayor of Toronto and with the minister of transport for 
Ontario. We are carefully considering the future of Pearson 
airport because, as my hon. friend says, it is an important 
economic development tool for all of Canada, not just 
southeastern Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely the 
minister must realize that Pearson expansion is not a local issue. 
In an earlier question he indicated it was being held up by some 
Toronto MPs.
<P>
	It is an issue of national importance. National development 
and jobs across Canada are at stake. Perhaps the real question 
here is why has the minister abrogated his national 
responsibilities regarding Pearson? Why has he passed the 
matter off to a select group of Toronto members who will clearly 
have local rather than national interests at heart?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with all due respect I do not consider it the role of the minister to 
abrogate the responsibilities of members of Parliament from any 
region of the country to determine how they wish to analyse a 
matter of great interest to them.
<P>
	I do want to assure my hon. friend that we are looking at the 
situation at Pearson very closely. We are working very hard at 
trying to resolve it, but we are respecting our national 
obligations in making sure that the solution proposed for 
Pearson International Airport is consistent with what we will be 
setting in place to operate other airports across the country in the 
national airport system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, this project 
benefits all of Canada for economic and safety reasons. Pearson 
has been studied to death. When will this government take 
action on Pearson's job creating potential? Thousands are 
waiting.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no question, as the hon. member puts it. Pearson 
International Airport is a very important airport for Toronto, for 
Ontario and for all of Canada.
<P>
	As I have indicated many times both in this place and outside 
the House, we will be moving expeditiously to do the right thing 
at Pearson in consultation with a wide spectrum of interested 
parties. We will make that decision known very soon.

has become a real money pit into which Ottawa blindly 
continues to pump Canadian taxpayers' money by the millions.
<P>

can the government continue to pump more and more public

overrun will be and how far this huge farce will go?

<P>

of cost overruns are at a preliminary stage at this point. The 
owners, including the government, have requested a report

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister. It concerns remarks made 
in the House by the Minister of the Environment on January 24.
<P>
	At that time she said with regard to the selection of a site for 
the environmental secretariat of NAFTA:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The selection will be made based on the environmental performance of those 
cities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She also said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The selection would be made with no politics involved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On Friday the same minister told the House that the reality 
was that politics was about making difficult decisions in the best 
interest of the country.
<P>
	Since the independent consultant's report was submitted on 
one day and the decision to award the secretariat to Montreal 
was made the very next day, what actual criteria came into play? 
Was it environmental? Was it political? Or, was it federal pork 
barrelling?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
I recall, the report was not translated until the Monday but a 
copy in English had been available before. There was a 
minimum of five cities that qualified. Every one of the cities had 
some advantages or disadvantages and the minister 
recommended the city of Montreal.
<P>
	We cannot go everywhere. I do not know why people make 
such a fuss about it. One factor that was not in the criteria but 
always impressed me a lot was that of the five cities Montreal 
was the one with the highest unemployment level. That was not 
one of the criteria. There were five cities that were basically 
equal. Eventually we had to decide. The minister made that 
recommendation and we accepted it.
<P>
	We could have decided in November to name one city. We 
gave the opportunity to a lot of cities to make application but we 
could select only one. Montreal was selected based on the 
criteria of cities that were equal. For me, anyway, the fact that 
Montreal had the highest level of unemployment was an 
important factor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reason many people are making such a fuss over this is that 
many Canadians feel they were led down the garden path in the 
selection criteria for this environmental secretariat. Had the 
decision been made to award it either to Montreal or Toronto and 
that had been done up front, it would not have been a problem.
<P>
	In any event, the Deputy Prime Minister also told the House 
on January 24: ``Montrealers like all Canadians want a process 
free of politics which is precisely what the federal government 
is providing''.
<P>
	This is why my question is so important. When will the 
government stop insulting Quebecers by offering such 
transparent bribes when what Montrealers, like all Canadians, 
really want and expect from the government is a government 
free of political expediency and a government that would put 
principle ahead of politics?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is an accusation that has no grounds. If we had selected 
Edmonton it probably would have been unfair to Vancouver, 
Toronto, Winnipeg and Montreal. However there was a problem 
with Edmonton in that air connections were not the best. It was 
negative. We had to decide the month before; we had to select. 
We had to decide if we were to cut Edmonton or Calgary.
<P>
	It was decided that it was unfortunately better, probably 
because you never said thank you, not to cut in Edmonton and 
cut more in Calgary. It was not pleasant. Why did you not 
complain at that time and say that we should have cut in 
Edmonton-

question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Last Friday, the CBC reported rather disturbing conduct on the 
part of immigration officers. For example, some of them were 
said to have administered a sedative to a pregnant woman before 
deporting her to Zaire. Also, a two-year old child with 
pneumonia was apparently deported to Ghana. Such practices 
are unacceptable and unfitting of a civilized nation such as ours.

<P>
	Is the minister of immigration aware of these allegations and 
does he condone practices which, insofar as the Zairian woman 
was treated, are inhuman as well as medically unethical?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising 
a very sensitive question. This gives me an opportunity to 
address it based on the facts.
<P>
	First, it is general policy of this government, as it was in 
previous governments, that people on medication who are asked 
to be removed should continue to receive the prescription 
through a regular practitioner.
<P>
	Second, under no circumstances is it policy for the purpose of 
removal to simply sedate individuals.
<P>
	Third, last year there were approximately 9,000 removals. My 
department informed me this morning there were under 12 
individuals who required medical attention.
<P>
	In the case of the woman from Zaire I caution the member 
because no immigration officials are permitted to administer 
any kind of medicine whatsoever. In this case the woman had a 
medical condition which I am not permitted to get into because 
of privacy laws. There was medical attention recommended and 
administered by a practising physician under provincial 
jurisdiction.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

completely as I could under the guise of question period that no 
immigration official is permitted to administer any medicine, 
injection or sedation at all.
<P>
	The 12 cases last year out of 9,000 were done on the orders of 
doctors usually practising in the provincial field for the benefit 
of the individual who was being asked to be removed because of

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government is planning to spend 4.5 million taxpayer 
dollars on a patronage theme park in the Prime Minister's home 
riding in spite of a report commissioned by the government 
warning that the project was doomed to fail.
<P>
	According to the Deputy Prime Minister the government 
reduced its contribution to the park by more than half because of 
the concerns raised in the Legault report.
<P>
	If the government was concerned enough to cut funding to this 
patronage park in half because it will fail, why did the 
government not do the logical thing and cut the funding 
altogether?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a project that has been in the mill for many years. A lot of 
people have worked on it. The request at the beginning was 
bigger and it was reduced.
<P>
	When the private sector put up $12 million and the provincial 
government $4 million, the federal government put up $4 
million. Even if it had been an infrastructure program, 
according to the criteria it would have been one-third. This is 
only 20 per cent.
<P>
	It was approved by the provincial government and it was in 
the mill. When I was in the opposition I asked some questions 
about it. Eventually when I became the Prime Minister the 
contribution was cut in half. I will not talk too much because the 
people in Shawinigan wil be mad at me.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems the Prime Minister is telling taxpayers that 
instead of wasting all their money he will only waste half their 
money.
<P>
	According to the February 15 edition of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
during the election campaign the Prime Minister promised to 
fork out the pork in his riding. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have the impression that when files from Saint-Maurice cross the desk of a 
minister-I needn't say more.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Will the Prime Minister rise above patronage politics and tell 
his ministers not to give preferential treatment to his own 
riding?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just said that I do not have to talk to anybody. They will look at 
all the projects.
<P>
	When the minister responsible cut my program by half I did 
not even protest. Maybe I should have. When the private sector 
provides $12 million to a project, is it willing to lose $12 
million? I do not think so.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. I would 
especially want to draw his attention to the anxiety now felt by 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	We know that last week, the U.S. government warned GATT 
of its intention to restrict Canadian durum wheat and barley 
imports starting July 1. If no agreement is reached, the conflict 
could well extend to other agricultural products such as milk and 
poultry.
<P>
	Given the importance of these products for the Canadian 
market and a statement made by the Minister for International 
Trade on the possibility of Canadian retaliation, can the Prime 
Minister tell us how Canada intends to protect the interests of 
Canadian producers and consumers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the GATT agreement was signed, we said that the move 
towards tariffs was inevitable, but that very high tariffs would 
be protected by GATT, and our position has not changed.
<P>
	We do not want it to be attacked, and our legal advisers tell us 
that there is no danger. The GATT rules will apply in the coming 
years, even if the Americans do not like it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> I would 
like to ask a supplementary question. The Minister of Foreign 
Affairs said in February that he hoped Canada's conciliatory 
attitude would help resolve the trade problems with the United 
States.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that this new attack 
confirms the failure of negotiating strategies between Canada 
and the U.S.?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since 80 per cent of our trade is with the U.S., it is not surprising 
that we encounter a few problems from time to time.
<P>
	As for milk and the products controlled by marketing boards, 
we think our position is well protected by GATT.
<P>
	Regarding the situation of Western farmers, our fight is not 
over yet-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They have 90 days. I talked to the President of the United 
States on Friday before he made his announcement to tell him 
that we were not happy with that and that the problem had to be 
revisited. He told me that over the period of 90 days there would 
be some  time to discuss with the administration. I hope we will 
come to a reasonable level of export to the United States.
<P>

of our trade with the United States are not very numerous at this

<P>
	I brought to the attention of the House the fact that Canada 
does not require HIV testing of its applicants for immigration. 
The minister accused me of having faulty research but then 
amazingly proceeded to admit that Canada does not screen its 
immigrants for HIV.
<P>
	This is double-talk. There is some question of exactly how 
many immigrants have come to Canada who are infected with 
HIV. Why test for communicable, infectious diseases like 
syphilis, hepatitis B, tuberculosis but not for HIV?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, when he asked me that question he 
said he was amazed to have discovered at committee the day 
before that we did not automatically test.
<P>
	When I said he had faulty research it was in the sense that he 
had not known that to be the case as opposed to being amazed 
and surprised.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> You can hem and haw all you want. You can look 
at truth right in the face.
<P>
	Then I went on to say that as part of the review in immigration 
there is a review of the class of medical inadmissibility. I 
mentioned that it is appropriate for the department and for the 
country to consider that things do evolve. As the member 
mentioned there are a number of diseases that we automatically 
check.
<P>
	I also mentioned that where our doctors, our practitioners, see 
evidence of HIV positive they are permitted clearly on their 
judgment to test and subsequently refuse people admittance.
<P>
	The question that I raise which will be part of the review is 
ought this test to be an automatic part of the medical check, yes 
or no. We are happy to look into that question and no one is 
hiding anything.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the minister.
<P>
	As he pointed out a week ago last Friday the minister stated 
that mandatory testing does not take place but if individuals 
exhibit traces of HIV they are asked to be tested and if HIV is 
found then most of these individuals are not permitted into the 
country.
<P>
	How can the minister possibly know that most HIV positive 
immigrants do not get into Canada when his department does not 
even do the test? Just what is the situation here? How many 
immigrants are refused?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I mentioned was that if our 
doctors currently detect symptoms of HIV, they order a test. The 
test is based on two questions, one in terms of public health, 
safety to the country and, second, the whole question of the tax 
that the disease would put on the medical infrastructure. The 
judgment of the doctor is then rendered.
<P>
	I said then and I repeat today that based on the tests done, our 
doctors currently reject most of those individuals from coming 
into the country, not based on general public safety but on the 
whole question of how taxing the disease would be on the 
medical infrastructure.
<P>
	I have also said that we are reviewing this situation so as to 
update ourselves with respect to HIV and AIDS. These diseases 
are a growing concern that has consumed the attention of many 
individuals. Third, in terms of tracking the number of cases 
across the country I do not think my department or any 
department keeps those kinds of numbers.

government will control 50 per cent of this agency and the other 
half will be held by the private sector.
<P>
	Given the major impact that the electronic highway will have 
on the whole cultural community, how can the minister justify 
the lack of representatives from this community on the

electronic highway? Has the government not learned a lesson 
from the Ginn Publishing affair?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

<P>
	Having said that, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Breast cancer has reached epidemic proportions in our country. 
Currently there are two cases of fraudulent breast cancer 
research. There are ongoing allegations of improprieties in the 
medical auditing process and the American medical community 
has withheld information for three years that was important to 
Canadian research.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Health tell the House how the Department 
of Health will guarantee the integrity of breast cancer research 
in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, breast cancer has reached epidemic proportions and 
it has been that way for many years. It is not recent. It concerns 
me very much that more has not been done for women with 
breast cancer in terms of research and the outcome of treatment.
<P>
	In the cases the hon. member is referring to, American dollars 
went to fund those studies in Canada. The Canadian government 
did not fund those particular research studies.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	As a result of what happened with these cases, I met with the 
Medical Research Council to assure myself and to speak with 
them to make sure that we always address these cases as 
completely and as effectively as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
appreciate the minister's response but it was not specific to my 
question. I have a supplementary question.
<P>
	I would like to know what progress has been made in the 
investigation that the minister committed to on March 17 
regarding those fraudulent cases of breast cancer treatments in 
Montreal. Could she be specific to that question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
specific to that question I answered that this was an American 
study.
<P>
	Let me reassure hon. members and all Canadians that even 
though these studies were not the way they should have been, 
many other studies have validated the findings. They have been 
tested and their validity has been looked at, as have all the other 
problems that have been encountered with the one case in 
Montreal.

	Two weeks ago it came to light that the RCMP were not only 
spying on black civil rights leaders in Nova Scotia in the 1960s

were laced with racially insensitive and overtly racist comments 
about blacks.
<P>
	Last Thursday before a House of Commons standing

opportunity to apologize for these statements but refused. Given 
the seriousness of these incidents, what actions is he 
contemplating to address these very disturbing incidents?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill C-16, the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis Land Claim Settlement Act.
<P>
	The government is committed to the conclusion of equitable 
land claim settlements with the aboriginal peoples. Since taking 
office we have made great strides in streamlining the process of 
settling claims. The negotiation of comprehensive land claims is 
a result of a policy introduced by the Liberal government in 
1973 as a response to views expressed by representatives of the 
aboriginal peoples and in recognition of the Calder decision 
handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	The intent of this government is to achieve through 
negotiations appropriate and formal changes to the structure of 
the relationships between First Nations and the federal and 
provincial governments. The objective of a comprehensive 
claims settlement is to exchange undefined aboriginal rights for 
defined rights with constitutional protection. The resulting 
certainty benefits all.
<P>
	A number of achievements, especially recent 
accomplishments, demonstrate the success of the 
comprehensive claims negotiation process. To date 10 
comprehensive land claims have been settled and 11 claims are 
being negotiated. As well, the British Columbia Treaty 
Commission has received statements of intent to negotiate from 
44 First Nations and aboriginal organizations.
<P>
	The James Bay and northern Quebec agreement and the 
northeastern Quebec agreement represent Canada's first modern 
treaties. They were signed in 1975 and 1978 respectively. The 
two agreements are very similar. The Inuvialuit agreement, 
signed in 1984, sets out the rights and benefits of the 2,500 
Inuvialuit of the western Arctic. The next agreements concluded 
with the Gwich'in in 1992 and the Tungavik Federation of 
Nunavut in 1993 contained many provisions similar to the 
Inuvialuit final agreement. They also include additional items 
such as resource revenue sharing.
<P>
	In April 1990 negotiators for the Dene and Metis, Canada and 
the Northwest Territories initialled a final agreement for that 
group's overall claim. However, in July 1990 a motion of the 
joint Dene and Metis assembly called for the renegotiation of 
fundamental elements of the initial agreement, effectively 
rejecting the agreement as negotiated.
<P>
	The legislation before the House is the result of intensive 
negotiations over several years which led to regional claims 
agreements with the Dene Metis. They are based on the April 
1990 agreement. The Gwich'in of the Mackenzie Delta region 
were the first Dene and Metis group to negotiate a regional 
comprehensive claim. The Sahtu Dene and the Metis agreement 
is the next regional claim settlement to be concluded. The 
restoration of a land and resource base to sustain this aboriginal 
society is key to the cultural and economic viability of the 
communities concerned.
<P>
	This government remains committed to the negotiation of 
comprehensive land claims settlements. As a step to fulfil our 
commitment to other aboriginal people without standing claims, 
we announced on December 20, 1993 that the Government of 
Canada would return immediately to the claims negotiations 
table with the Labrador Inuit Association without any 
preconditions.
<P>
	As a parallel commitment to support regional 
self-government agreements, our government mandated the 
conduct of Labrador Inuit self-government negotiations 
concurrently with the comprehensive land claim negotiations. 
We are looking forward to receiving a proposal from the 
Labrador Inuit over the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3449"> 3449 </A></B>
<P>
next few weeks and we expect that tripartite discussions on that 
proposal, which will include the government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador, will begin very soon. I am optimistic that we will 
reach an agreement with the Labrador Inuit within a reasonable 
time.
<P>
	Similar progress is being made with other aboriginal claimant 
groups. As members are aware, offshore water is the primary 
source of Inuit subsistence activities. This is no different for the 
Inuit of northern Quebec. The 1975 James Bay and northern 
Quebec agreement dealt with aboriginal rights to lands in the 
province of Quebec only. It did not address Quebec Inuit claims 
to islands offshore Quebec which are in the jurisdiction of the 
Northwest Territories and the northeast coast of Labrador.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Negotiations began in 1992 and already a framework 
agreement which is the first step to these negotiations has been 
signed by Canada, the Northwest Territories and the Quebec 
Inuit.
<P>
	All of us have been aware of the government's various 
initiatives to improve the social and economic circumstances of 
the Innu nation in Davis Inlet in Labrador. Concurrent with these 
initiatives we are also negotiating the Innu nation land claim.
<P>
	Negotiations toward a framework agreement began in July 
1991. Substantial progress has been realized in those 
negotiations. There has been equally encouraging progress on 
the potential interim measures related to the environmental 
impacts of proposed development projects.
<P>
	We expect the discussions which are tripartite in nature and 
involve participation of the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador will result in a settlement with the Labrador Inuit and 
the Innu nation to provide a land and resource base, one which 
will promote regional development and self-sufficiency in 
those communities.
<P>
	The government also intends to introduce settlement 
legislation for the Council of Yukon Indians over the next few 
weeks. This will complete a lengthy negotiation process, one 
which was begun some 20 years ago.
<P>
	Negotiators for the Government of Canada, the Yukon 
government and the Council for Yukon Indians signed an 
umbrella final agreement in 1993. It establishes the basis for the 
negotiation of individual settlements with each of the 14 Yukon 
First Nations. Final land claims agreements and 
self-government agreements have been signed with four Yukon 
First Nations. Settlement and self-government legislation for 
these agreements will be introduced soon.
<P>
	One may well ask why all of these land claims agreements are 
so important. The answer is both elementary and profound. 
These agreements are the basis on which we can provide land 
and resources to aboriginal people along with guaranteed 
participation in land and resource management in a way that 
provides for them their rightful place in Canadian society.
<P>
	These modern treaties are the means for guaranteed 
participation of aboriginal peoples in effective governing 
structures dealing with renewable resources, land use planning, 
environmental impact assessment and review, and land and 
water regulation. In addition they provide the financial means to 
allow aboriginal people to develop an economic base which will 
sustain their futures.
<P>
	It is only by clearing away the uncertainty over title to the 
land that we are able to assure equitable access to the 
development over land and resources. This becomes critical in 
negotiating claims south of the 60th parallel, claims which we 
are undertaking.
<P>
	In addition to finalizing the claims in the north and beginning 
negotiations in Labrador we are negotiating along with the 
government of Quebec, the Conseil des Atikamekw et des 
Montagnais, CAM, claim in Quebec.
<P>
	Recently the Quebec government reappointed its negotiators 
in another effort to accelerate the negotiations. General side 
tables have been established to negotiate matters such as lands 
and traditional activities, self-government and economic 
development. The parties are aiming to complete the agreement 
in principle by June 1995.
<P>
	Negotiations with the Nisga'a are also under way in the 
province of British Columbia. We have approached the 
numerous land claims in British Columbia through a unique 
process.
<P>
	The governments of Canada and British Columbia and 
representatives of First Nations have established a treaty 
commission to facilitate and monitor negotiations, allocate 
negotiation funding, and assist in dispute resolution. A further 
function of the commission is to make public the reports on the 
progress of the negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	The British Columbia Treaty Commission is an impartial 
arm's length body designed to facilitate negotiations. 
Commissioners are appointed by the governments of Canada 
and British Columbia and by the British Columbia Summit of 
First Nations.
<P>
	We intend that the negotiations in the province will include 
both comprehensive claims and self-government matters in a 
combined process. This will help to establish appropriate 
linkages between claims, structures and self-government 
institutions in various jurisdictional areas.
<P>
	Given the importance of land and resource development in 
British Columbia, a joint third party consultation process has 
been established to address the interests of the third parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3450"> 3450 </A></B>
<P>
	I have sketched for hon. members the very promising 
situation surrounding the comprehensive claims process in 
Canada today. I am proud to be able to urge them to consider 
favourably the Sahtu Dene and Metis land claims settlement 
which is before them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my first question relates to the B.C. Treaty 
Commission which was referred to as an impartial body. Three 
groups are involved in those negotiations, represented by the 
federal and provincial governments and the First Nations.
<P>
	My first question is why are third party interests and most 
especially the municipality or local governments that are 
elected and influenced by local negotiations not represented in 
that so-called impartial treaty commission?
<P>
	My second question relates to the whole question of fee 
simple land transfer. Is the hon. member familiar with the recent 
B.C. Court of Appeal decision on the Gitksan-Wet'suwet'en 
case? Does the member concur that the fee simple transfer this 
bill talks about goes far beyond any legal precedence as 
expressed very well in that B.C. Court of Appeal decision?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. I know hon. members on the other side of the House 
really like the colour red just as I do. I would like to quote a 
portion of the red book which I carried with me in October: ``The 
priority of a Liberal government will be to assist aboriginal 
communities in their efforts to address the obstacles to their 
development and to help them marshal the human and physical 
resources necessary to build and sustain vibrant communities''.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked a question which I will take under 
advisement and my answer to his second question is no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for her speech. I would like her to comment on a few 
observations I have.
<P>
	The original treaty signed by the treaty Indian people with the 
agents of the crown were in part land settlements. They have 
never worked out, not that they could not have because in some 
areas there has been an enormous amount of wealth generated 
from Indian lands.
<P>
	The reason they have not worked out is because of the power 
and control the department of Indian affairs has over the Indian 
people. They cannot sell their grain without approval from the 
superintendent of the department of Indian affairs and so on. It is 
all there in the history of the treaties and the treaty research 
many of the bands have conducted.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Our party is supportive of the fair, equitable and rapid 
settlement of these land claims so that the aboriginal people can 
form a base upon which they can become economically 
independent.
<P>
	My concern about this agreement is that we are creating 
another bureaucracy. It seems to be a fairly formidable one 
according to what I have read.
<P>
	Does the hon. member see the economic viability of this 
agreement? In other words, will we see a time when the people 
of Canada will no longer have to provide support through the 
various programs for this particular group of Indian people? I 
think there would be a lot of support from the people of Canada 
if that is the case, if that is what we can see within this 
agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the hon. 
member's first question, one of the reasons they never did work 
is because they were never honoured. They were left out in 
limbo.
<P>
	I am very optimistic about this process we are doing today. I 
want to quote some information for the hon. member. The 
agreement guarantees the participation of the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis. They will be able to manage their own renewable 
resources within their settlement area; land use planning within 
the settlement area; environmental impact assessment and 
review within the Mackenzie Valley; and regulation of land and 
water use within the settlement area.
<P>
	I believe this is the road to take for the dismantling of Indian 
affairs. This is the road to take to initiate self-government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have one more question.
<P>
	There was some discussion about the history of these kinds of 
negotiations in the member's statement. I just wondered 
whether the member was familiar with the comprehensive 
western Arctic Dene-Metis agreement. It was signed in 1990 
and included a larger settlement area, but it included this 
specific area within it. Would the hon. member comment as to 
why the fee simple transfer of ownership in that period of time to 
this group of people has approximately doubled in size since 
1990?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1990 there was some 
disagreement between the Sahtu and the Metis. Why we are here 
today is so that they can take on their own initiatives and their 
own mandate, so that they can do this themselves.
<P>
	I encourage hon. members across the way to support us in this 
venture. I believe we must work together on this venture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to give the member for Dauphin-Swan River a break.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3451"> 3451 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder if she might not agree that the degree of 
compensation seems to be setting a very high precedent in 
terms of what the compensation level is.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon. member did not 
hear what I had said earlier. I would hope that we could be very 
positive and take a look at the positive side of this matter.
<P>
	I am going to mention again that the agreement guarantees the 
participation of the Sahtu Dene and the Metis. They can control 
their own destiny. They can be managers of their own resources, 
land use planning, environmental impact assessment and review 
within the Mackenzie Valley, and regulation of land and water 
use within that settlement area.
<P>
	I encourage hon. members on the other side of the House to 
accept our philosophy. Let us get on with self-government. Let 
us allow the aboriginal peoples of the country to have some 
dignity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity this afternoon to speak in the debate on second 
reading of the bill tabled by the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, the purpose of which is to approve, give 
effect and declare valid the agreement signed on September 6, 
1993, with the Dene and the Metis. This agreement was 
concluded following land claims made by these peoples, which 
must be considered by this House in accordance with the 
provisions of the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	I am the elected representative for the riding of Châteauguay 
and, as such, I am particularly aware of and concerned by all 
matters connected with aboriginal affairs. The riding provides a 
good example of the Amerindian problem or, should I say, the 
problem of co-habitation between our peoples. The facts are 
clear: sharing the lands of this continent first meant living with 
them, then it meant hostility, then pushing some into the back 
country and then creating reserves after a conquest in which they 
lost everything. We cannot deny and we cannot get around this 
historical truth, since we are faced with it every day. The proud 
descendants of these peoples are only too willing to remind us, 
each in their own way, of the cost of being neighbours on such a 
fragile basis.
<P>
	The most troubling challenge to us today is to find the right 
way to deal with the problems we have created. There is the 
silence of the young suicide victims in Davis Inlet. This is our 
own third world, within our borders, the result of wanting to 
share this land without respecting the aboriginal culture and way 
of life.
<P>
	The most troubling image is that of this anonymous 
Algonquin in the subway, crowded all sides by the ultimate 
cultural mosaic, and no one else realizes that his ancestors were 
there first. Another troubling image: two faces staring 
impassively at each other, their silence an  eloquent metaphor. 
With the reserve of Khanawake within its boundaries, 
Châteauguay knows all about that, and that is why it placed its 
trust in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois recognizes aboriginal peoples as distinct 
nations, as it recognizes the two founding peoples of this 
Canadian federation. Mutual understanding will depend on our 
ability to share the same sphere of economic, political, legal and 
commercial activities, as opposed to the present situation, 
where we live in parallel worlds.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	This partnership must succeed and, with them like with the 
people of Quebec, the best way to achieve mutual co-operation 
is by recognizing first of all their existence as partners, as 
neighbours, in their integrity, with all their rights and 
obligations. The days when one nation exercised trusteeship 
over another should be over.
<P>
	In that context, the Bloc Quebecois welcomes Bill C-16 as a 
form of recognition of the Sahtu Dene and Metis as nations. 
Major exclusive territorial rights are being recognized to a 
group of 2,000 people living on 41,437 squre kilometres in the 
Mackenzie Valley, in the Northwest Territories, including 
subsurface rights on an area covering 1,813 square kilometres, 
some $75 million over 15 years and an annual share of the 
royalties on the valley's natural resources.
<P>
	Sahtu lands will be neither public property nor reserves. 
Trough this agreement, the Dene and the Metis are guaranteed 
private lands, which will enable them to be involved in land use 
planning, protect their exclusive hunting rights, and determine 
their economic development prospects as well as their future.
<P>
	This is one more step toward self-government. That is exactly 
what we are wishing for all peoples: the capacity to take in their 
hands and have a say with regard to the management of their 
natural resources, heritage conservation and regulations 
concerning their lands and waters.
<P>
	One point of particular interest to me is the impact of this 
agreement on the land holding system. Since the Colonial era, 
we had known two main types of property: private property and 
public property. The former was a vested right of lords, settlers 
and inhabitants, and today, it is a privilege enjoyed by citizens, 
corporations and speculators alike. The latter was a prerogative 
of the Crown, the clergy, the Colonial administration, and today, 
the state, our governments.
<P>
	The mid-19th century saw another type of property be 
established, namely Indian reserves. It was then, and still is, a 
special status granted to lands, a status nonetheless ambiguous. 
We are dealing here with collectively owned lands which are 
neither public, since they are not accessible to everyone, nor 
private, since they are not controlled by individuals, but rather 
by a tribal council which is responsible for administering the 
reserve.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3452"> 3452 </A></B>
<P>
	I have some difficulty understanding why, in 1994, we have 
yet to clear up this ambiguity. I think back to a time full of 
promise when, in 1969, the government of Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau promised action to bring about the full participation 
of native communities. Even then, the Minister of Indian and 
Northern Affairs, today the honourable the Prime Minister, said 
that the legislative and constitutional basis of discrimination 
must be removed. The government of the day was adamant that 
services must come through the same channels and from the 
same government agencies for all Canadians. The lawful 
obligations of natives must be recognized and, to this end, 
responsibility for administering native lands must be 
transferred to native communities.
<P>
	Despite the Trudeau era and his minister, 25 years later, the 
problem of native self-government has yet to be resolved. Why 
is this? Because the promised action was never taken, despite 
the fact that, on June 25, 1969, the Minister of Indian Affairs 
made a commitment to this House to act so as to give natives 
control over and title to their lands. Listen to what was said at 
the time. The minister promised to transfer to the provinces 
federal funds normally provided for native programs so that the 
provinces could take over the same responsibilities for natives 
that they had for other citizens in their provinces. He was 
committed to dismantling the department of Indian affairs and 
giving its mandate to other federal departments.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	What was this minister talking about? He was talking of 
transferring jurisdictions to the provinces, according to the 
Trudeau government; of eliminating costly and unproductive 
duplication and overlap. What did he actually do? The 
department is still in place. It will spend over $5 billion. As for 
transferring jurisdictions, in today's federal arena, only the Bloc 
Quebecois maintains that it is necessary.
<P>
	The Sahtu agreement paves the way to something other than 
reserves for Natives. The Sahtu lands will fall under two 
categories: those covered by the regulations and municipal 
lands.
<P>
	In the case of regulated lands, certain special conditions will 
ensure the Dene and Metis' title to the lands. These lands cannot 
be sold, mortgaged, seized or expropriated without being 
replaced. Municipal lands, on the other hand, can be sold or 
ceded, but if it is to an individual, they will no longer belong to 
the Sahtu. The Sahtu's improved municipal lands will be 
taxable, but those that are not improved will be tax-exempt.
<P>
	This issue of ownership raises several questions, especially 
since the Native crisis of the summer of 1990. This crisis arose 
from claims for territorial autonomy and self-government. The 
claims made at that time almost amounted to an offense 
affecting
<P>
urban areas inhabited by thousands of people with deep roots in 
their community.
<P>
	In my mind, the Bloc Quebecois' support of the agreement 
with the Sahtu Dene and Metis does not mean opening the door 
to all land claims from a distant past. Neither the Bloc 
Quebecois nor any other political party can recognize the rights 
of one people at the expense of another. That is why negotiations 
on self-government are so sensitive. We must consider these 
negotiations in the light of today's realities, without forgetting 
the past, of course, but by acknowledging that lasting relations 
are based on mutual respect.
<P>
	As the member for Châteauguay where the Kahnawake 
reserve is located, I know that this agreement is good. I salute 
the Mackenzie Valley agreement; I hope that it is only 
recognizing today's reality, above all, and that it does not 
discriminate against anyone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktituk.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I rise to address the House on Bill C-16, the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis Land Claim Settlement Act.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased to speak in support of the legislation. 
Bill C-16 fulfils one of the most important commitments made 
in the red book, a commitment to resolve outstanding land 
claims. As has been stated on a number of occasions this is a 
priority for the government.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne the government made a more 
specific commitment to put before Parliament legislation to 
further the implementation of northern claim settlements. Bill 
C-16 is such legislation. It is an action to back up our words.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-16 completes some unfinished business. It is a result of 
governments and aboriginal people working together in a new 
partnership of trust and mutual respect to ensure more certain 
and prosperous futures for all northerners.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, Bill C-16 implements the land 
claims agreement signed last September by Canada and the 
Sahtu Tribal Council, which represents some 2,000 Dene and 
Metis in the Sahtu settlement area of the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	In the ratification vote held last July, 87 per cent of the Dene 
and 99 per cent of the Metis were in favour of the agreement. 
Voter turnout was very high.
<P>
	As the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
has stated, the House is now being asked to support the wishes of 
the Sahtu Dene and Metis as expressed in their ratification vote. 
I should say that the interests of the non-aboriginal people, 
northerners and all Canadians are amply protected in the 
agreement. The certainty of land ownership and rights provided 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3453"> 3453 </A></B>
<P>
through  the agreement will allow the major resource 
development projects to proceed. The moratorium on oil and gas 
exploration will be lifted. I remind hon. members that the 
government is committed to putting Canadians to work. This 
agreement will help us do that.
<P>
	Because of the many benefits it will bring to the settlement 
area, the Government of the Northwest Territories is also a 
strong supporter of Bill C-16.
<P>
	The opening sentence of the preamble in the Sahtu land claim 
agreement states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Slavey, Hare and Mountain Dene of the Sahtu region have traditionally 
used and occupied lands in the Northwest Territories from time immemorial.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The location of that statement as the first sentence in the 
preamble is significant. It is the reason we are here today.
<P>
	The land claim agreement and the bill before us recognized 
that the Slavey, Hare and Mountain Dene as the original 
inhabitants of the Sahtu region have aboriginal and treaty rights. 
These rights have been translated and affirmed through 
negotiation into the rights contained in the land claim agreement 
before us. It is a fact that the rights of the original inhabitants of 
the Sahtu have not been adequately dealt with in the past. The 
agreement returns to the Sahtu some measure of control over 
what happens to land and resources in their homeland.
<P>
	I draw the attention of hon. members to the objectives of the 
land claim agreement. The objectives stress the cultural and 
economic relationships which the Sahtu Dene and Metis have 
with the land. The preservation and the strengthening of these 
links, along with the clarification of land and resource rights 
contained in the agreement, provide the basis for a renewed 
partnership in a very important region of the western Arctic.
<P>
	The Sahtu settlement area encompasses some 280,000 square 
kilometres of land in the Mackenzie Valley. Under the land 
claim agreement the Dene and Metis will own more than 41,000 
square kilometres of that area, including the mineral rights of 
about 1,800 square kilometres. The Sahtu Dene and Metis will 
also own a wide range of specified substances under settlement 
land. These include carving and construction stone, gravel, 
gypsum, peat, sand and other substances.
<P>
	Under the agreement there will be two categories of Sahtu 
land. The first category is settlement land, which will be outside 
municipal boundaries. Sahtu municipal land, the second 
category, will be those lands located within municipal 
boundaries. Certain special conditions will apply to settlement 
land to ensure that it is never lost to the Sahtu Dene and Metis.
<P>
	For example, these lands may never be sold, mortgaged or 
seized under court order. They will enjoy special tax treatment. 
If any of the land is expropriated, the government guarantees 
that it will be replaced so that the initial amount of settlement 
land is never reduced. Sahtu municipal land will be treated like 
other privately owned municipal land in that it may be sold or 
mortgaged. However, if Sahtu municipal land is sold or granted 
to an individual, it will no longer be considered Sahtu land and 
the provisions of the agreement will not apply to it.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In this agreement third party interests will be protected and 
will continue. As I mentioned earlier, the certainty of ownership 
and rights this agreement will bring about are important for the 
non-aboriginal people of the Northwest Territories, as well as 
the aboriginal beneficiaries.
<P>
	The settlement agreement should lead very quickly to new 
investments in the oil and gas sector, which in turn will mean 
employment and business opportunities for all northerners. 
Before any oil and gas developments can proceed, however, 
Canada must provide the Sahtu Tribal Council with an 
opportunity to present its views on the matter. This is a key 
principle of the land claim agreement.
<P>
	As well, any operator proposing such activities must consult 
with the beneficiaries on such issues as environmental impact, 
potential impacts on wildlife harvesting, and Sahtu Dene and 
Metis employment opportunities. Similar consultations will 
also be required prior to the development or production of other 
types of minerals.
<P>
	The settlement agreement also provides a fair and equitable 
financial settlement to the beneficiaries. Over the next 15 years 
the Sahtu Dene and Metis will receive payments totalling 75 
million in 1990 dollars. They will also receive a share of the 
resource royalties from projects in the Mackenzie Valley. This 
will amount to 7.5 per cent of the first $2 million of resource 
royalties received by the government and 1.5 per cent of 
additional royalties.
<P>
	Special efforts will be made to strengthen the traditional 
economies and economic self-sufficiency of the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis.
<P>
	As the minister has already stated, governments are 
committed under the agreement to providing economic 
opportunities related to guiding, lodges, naturalist activities and 
commercial fishing.
<P>
	These and other provisions will enable the five Sahtu 
communities in the settlement area to improve their social and 
economic opportunities to control their own destiny. It is they 
who will make the decisions. Promoting self-determination by 
aboriginal communities is a goal that is shared by all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3454"> 3454 </A></B>
<P>
	The settlement agreement accommodates the government's 
objective of increasing the participation of aboriginal peoples 
in the decision making process.
<P>
	The Sahtu Dene and Metis will be full and equal partners in a 
renewable resources board that will be created to manage 
wildlife harvesting in the settlement area.
<P>
	The board will also have the power to establish policies and 
propose regulations for all aspects of wildlife harvesting and 
commercial activities relating to wildlife.
<P>
	The Sahtu Dene and Metis will also participate fully on 
boards responsible for land use planning, environmental 
reviews and the regulation of land and water use in the 
settlement areas. These boards will be institutions of public 
governments within the settlement area. The agreement will 
also provide constitutional protection of the special wildlife 
harvesting rights the Sahtu Dene and Metis will have in that 
settlement area, including the exclusive right to trap.
<P>
	If for conservation reasons harvesting quotas must be set on 
certain wildlife species or populations or in certain areas, the 
harvesting needs of the Sahtu Dene and Metis will have first 
priority.
<P>
	The wildlife harvesting provisions of the agreement are 
extremely important to the Sahtu Dene and Metis and other 
northerners. Each Sahtu community will establish a renewable 
resources council to manage the harvesting rights provided 
under land claim agreements.
<P>
	I am pleased that Bill C-16 provides for the negotiation of 
self-government agreements with the Sahtu Dene and Metis. It 
guarantees them a role in any process to reform the constitution 
of the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	I assure my hon. colleagues the agreement that will be put into 
force by Bill C-16 does not affect any aboriginal rights the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis may have to self-government.
<P>
	A great deal of effort has been devoted to ensuring full and 
proper implementation of the Sahtu Dene and Metis land claim 
settlement agreement. In mid-1992, when the terms of the 
agreement were taking effect, a special working group was 
established to develop a 10-year implementation plan. This 
plan, which was signed at the same time as the land claim 
agreement, identifies all the obligations contained in the 
agreement, the activities required to fulfil those obligations and 
various other responsibilities, time frames and resource 
requirements.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	The implementation plan however is an accord among the 
parties to the land claim settlement. It is not part of the 
settlement agreement and therefore will not receive 
constitutional protection. Nevertheless it is a vital document 
because the land claim settlement must be properly 
implemented in order to fulfil its aims.
<P>
	The implementation plan is extremely detailed. It reflects the 
commitment of all parties to ensure that the letter and the spirit 
of the agreement are fulfilled. It sets out more than 100 separate 
obligations, some of which may involve up to 20 distinct 
activities. All parties to the plan have responsibilities to fulfil 
many of these obligations. This underlines the fact that the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis land claim settlement imposes 
obligations not just on Canada but on the aboriginal 
beneficiaries and the Government of the Northwest Territories. 
It also emphasizes the need for all parties to work together in 
implementing the agreement.
<P>
	A key focus of the implementation plan is to give substance to 
the commitments in the land claim agreement that the Sahtu 
Dene and Metis will have genuine and meaningful participation 
in the institutions of government.
<P>
	To further the goal of successful implementation of the 
agreement an implementation committee will be formed 
comprising representatives of Canada, the territorial 
government and the Sahtu Tribal Council. The committee will 
guide the implementation process for at least the first 10 years, 
monitor the status of the implementation plan and, if necessary, 
amend the plan. It will also report each year on the 
implementation of the Sahtu agreement.
<P>
	One of the first orders of business will be to establish an 
enrolment board which will determine eligibility for benefits 
under the agreement. Eligible Dene and Metis living within or 
outside the settlement area may also enrol with the board as 
beneficiaries of the agreement. To be eligible they must be 
Canadian citizens and Sahtu Dene or Sahtu Metis as defined in 
the agreement.
<P>
	An aboriginal person who is not Sahtu Dene or Metis but lives 
in the settlement area and is a Canadian citizen may also be 
eligible to enrol after the settlement is in effect. This will be 
achieved through a community acceptance procedure which will 
be decided by the Sahtu Dene and Metis.
<P>
	The Sahtu claim is the second regional Dene and Metis claim 
to be settled. The first settlement with the Gwich'in in the 
Mackenzie Delta came into force in December 1992. This 
agreement is now being implemented.
<P>
	With the co-operation of hon. members on both sides of the 
House we can ensure the Sahtu Dene and Metis will also soon be 
benefiting from their own land claim agreement.
<P>
	I urge my hon. colleagues to support Bill C-16. This claim 
will benefit all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems a bit like the further we get away from the first 
presentations the more murky some of the debate becomes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3455"> 3455 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to make a couple of points and then ask a couple 
of related questions. We are really looking for open debate. We 
are talking about an area three-quarters the size of Nova Scotia 
to be set out in fee simple and constitutionally entrenched. We 
wanted to create a circumstance in which we could get input 
from members interested in inputting into the process. There 
will be a diversity of opinion. There is no doubt about that. We 
are certainly not looking to be obstructive in any way, shape 
or fashion.
<P>
	I am reminded of a current example in British Columbia 
where we have quite a raging debate right now on the Kemano 
project. That project was signed by two levels of government in 
1951 originally and in the ensuing 40-some years many societal 
values and other things have changed. That agreement was not 
constitutionally entrenched, but we have a very complicated 
agreement here that is planned for constitutional entrenchment.
<P>
	My first question for the member who just spoke would be: Is 
there not some sympathy with the argument that constitutionally 
entrenching this level of detail has some inherent dangers?
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	My second question relates to a statement the hon. member 
made relating to the Sahtu Dene and Metis co-operating on 
amending the constitution of the Northwest Territories. I would 
like clarification on that because that statement is something I 
am certainly not clear on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer to the first question is 
no.
<P>
	In 1999 there is an agreement to divide the Northwest 
Territories into two. One part will be Nunavut which is the area I 
presently represent and hope to continue to represent after 1999. 
The western Arctic will be the area the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
land claims fall under.
<P>
	I suspect there will be a lot of discussion on the constitution of 
the western Arctic portion of the Northwest Territories. It is 
pretty well settled as to who will define the constitution of the 
Nunavut area and that is us, the Inuit.
<P>
	I think all the land claims groups in the western Arctic portion 
of the Northwest Territories will have a great role in defining the 
constitution of that western Arctic territory prior to 1999 in 
order to ensure proper implementation of the western Arctic 
territory.
<P>
	Presently all the claimant groups in that western Arctic area 
are about equal to the non-aboriginal people in that area as well. 
Therefore I think the groups will have a large role in defining the 
constitution of the Government of the Northwest Territories in 
the western part.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
what sense is the hon. member using the word constitution? Is he 
using the word constitution in the sense of what constitutes the 
western Arctic lands, or is  he using it in the sense of the British 
North America Act, which is really a legal provision that 
determines how government shall function and so on? Could he 
clarify that, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the Northwest Territories we 
are basically colour blind. The proposal in the Northwest 
Territories is to have two new territories which are public 
government concepts. However a large role is played by the 
aboriginal people in that area.
<P>
	I answered the question on the basis that the hon. member 
asked it in terms of the constitution of the Government of the 
Northwest Territories as it relates to the British North America 
Act. I was using it in those terms because all the aboriginal 
people will have a large role in a public government as well as 
the self-government again because of their sheer numbers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
follow-up question on the hon. member's response.
<P>
	If the territories are going to create their own constitution, 
then I would be interested in knowing whether or not the 
aboriginal individuals will continue to have the protection of the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms as guaranteed to all Canadians 
within the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> I am sorry I did not get that very important 
question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I could be of assistance, 
I might ask the hon. member for Crowfoot to repeat his question 
to the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as the hon. member's 
response to the last question indicated there is going to be the 
creation of a constitution for the Northwest Territories, my 
question and concern is whether the aboriginal people involved 
will continue to enjoy the protection of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms within the Constitution of Canada as all Canadians 
now do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> As I said, we are basically colour blind in the 
Northwest Territories. All the residents will continue to enjoy 
that privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to Bill C-16. Although there are many 
positive things in this agreement, there are also many problems 
with it.
<P>
	I wish to direct my comments to the compensation package 
given to the Sahtu Dene and Metis in this land claim agreement. 
I have many concerns about the precedent this agreement sets 
for land claim settlements and other negotiations in the rest of 
the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3456"> 3456 </A></B>
<P>
	With every right there comes a corresponding responsibility 
and obligation. I see many rights in this agreement. The Sahtu 
are receiving a generous compensation package of land and 
money, rights to resource royalties, rights to restrict public 
access over large tracts of land and water, rights to participation 
in resource management decisions and environmental 
assessment, and rights to review economic plans and resource 
development initiatives.
<P>
	Where are the responsibilities outlined? Where are the 
obligations summarized? With this agreement the government 
has lost certain rights by handing them over to the Sahtu 
peoples, but what is the diminishment in government 
responsibilities? These are questions which need to be 
answered.
<P>
	The monetary compensation package in this agreement is 
generous. The Sahtu have been awarded a non-taxable $75 
million cash settlement to be paid out over a 15-year period with 
accrued interest. This will add up to approximately $130 million 
for the current population of 1,755 people.
<P>
	The agreement does not explicitly state why this money is 
being awarded. If it were compensation for not having had the 
use of the land they were entitled to under treaty, they are 
receiving $1 million for every year the government failed to 
fulfil the treaty land entitlement provisions of 128 acres per 
person. But there are few fences in the Northwest Territories so 
they have had the use of the land for traditional purposes.
<P>
	In the recent Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement 
Framework Agreement funds have been set aside to enable the 
First Nations to purchase the shortfall in treaty land themselves. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been set aside for this 
purpose, but they will not be able to buy anywhere near the 
amount of land the Sahtu have been given in addition to their 
cash compensation.
<P>
	Apparently this money was just part of the settlement. Does 
this mean that the government would have given them even 
more land if they had not received the $75 million? This is 
extremely generous.
<P>
	What is the responsibility that goes with the awarding of the 
cash payment and these royalties? If the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
have not lost any of the privileges which accrue to them under 
the Indian Act, then what does this mean? Does the crown have a 
fiduciary obligation with respect to Sahtu monetary decisions? 
On the face of this agreement it would appear that it does.
<P>
	Settlement dollars and land title are vested in Sahtu 
organizations, not individuals. If five or ten years down the road 
the Sahtu people from a community charge that one of these 
organizations have mismanaged their money or land, who will 
be responsible? If, as the former Indian affairs minister implied, 
this settlement has given the Sahtu the necessary land and 
resources for a brighter future, do the Sahtu also have the 
obligation to actively pursue that goal for future generations?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	This agreement also provides the Sahtu Dene and Metis with 
resource royalties. As previously stated they will receive 7.5 per 
cent of the first $2 million of resource royalties received by the 
Government of Canada in any given year and then 1.5 per cent of 
any additional royalties. These royalty shares will be from the 
entire Mackenzie valley. What is the explanation for this? How 
can the government justify this royalty deal to the Canadian 
people?
<P>
	The Sahtu are given fee simple title to more than 41,000 
square kilometres with subsurface rights on 1,800. This 
agreement gives them traditional use rights and significant input 
on resource development decisions on over 280,000 square 
kilometres. Now they will receive a share of government 
royalties over 900,000 square kilometres of the Mackenzie 
valley.
<P>
	All resource royalties are calculated on a different basis. Oil 
and gas royalties tend to be based on production. Mineral 
royalties are based on profit. Exploration for diamonds and 
other minerals is on the increase in the Mackenzie valley. We do 
not know what our proven resource potential is north of 60.
<P>
	Just exactly how much money are we talking about here? It 
appears the Sahtu do not know, the government does not know, 
no one knows. Only the taxpayers of Canada will know when 
they have to make up for the royalty shortfall out of their 
pockets.
<P>
	As each northern comprehensive claim is settled more groups 
will receive a share of the government royalties. The Gwich'in 
are already a part of this deal as was stated earlier. As each group 
is added on, the government share of royalties decreases 
proportionately. What precedent does this set for claims 
settlements in the rest of Canada?
<P>
	If the government gives up most of its resource royalties 
based on these precedents north of 60 other taxes will clearly 
have to go up. The Canadian people are already overtaxed. As a 
result of this agreement obviously they will have to pay more in 
the future.
<P>
	Is this government being responsible? Is it giving hope to 
future generations of Canadians?
<P>
	This new right to resource royalties the government has given 
the Sahtu people does not appear to have any responsibilities 
attached. The minister talks about giving them some control 
over resources so they can control their own economic destiny. 
That is certainly a worthwhile objective, but where does it say 
any of this money will be used to further the aspirations of the 
Sahtu people? They continue to rely on the federal government 
to provide special programs and funding.
<P>
	The government may suggest Sahtu responsibility for all of 
these functions will come later after self-government 
agreements are reached. However this government is taking 
great pains to point out that no one knows what the eventual 
form of self-government will be. This government has no idea 
what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3457"> 3457 </A></B>
<P>
responsibilities the  Sahtu or other aboriginal groups will 
assume under their specific self-government formulas.
<P>
	We are talking about the rights and responsibilities that arise 
out of this particular agreement. The Sahtu are receiving many 
monetary rights without the attachment of any significant fiscal 
responsibilities. They are receiving a land base and royalties 
without an obligation to use them to further the economic and 
self-sufficiency objectives outlined in the agreement. I am very 
concerned that it sets a bad precedent for fiscal responsibility in 
future self-government negotiations.
<P>
	This agreement also establishes a number of boards for 
resource management and environmental assessment. In some 
ways this is a positive development. The Sahtu have recognized 
that many of the board activities, functions and decisions are 
technical and not political.
<P>
	Opening up the appointment process allows the Sahtu to 
nominate technically competent people to represent their views 
and interests at the table. If those people are not doing their jobs 
in the future, they can be removed easily without the 
repercussions removal of a political nominee would create.
<P>
	Increasing the number of boards also adds to an existing 
problem. In 1992 one Toronto paper said there were already 
6,200 bureaucrats and 800 boards and agencies in Yellowknife. 
There are fewer than 60,000 people living in the Northwest 
Territories in 62 communities. That is more than one bureaucrat 
for every 10 people and one board or agency for every 70. Surely 
that is enough. Imagine the chaos if we tried to run the rest of the 
country as inefficiently.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Yet this bill proposes more boards and with one or two 
exceptions does not propose to eliminate parallel boards at other 
levels of government. All stakeholders should have the right to 
have input into resource management decisions and these boards 
provide the Sahtu people with a mechanism for that 
participation.
<P>
	Will these boards provide a more informed and cost effective 
way for northern residents to ensure that environmentally and 
economically sustainable decisions are made in the best 
interests of all Canadians? Will they take the responsibility to 
represent all interests seriously? I hope that is the purpose of 
these boards. I hope that this was not just a Tory job creation 
scheme for the north. Only time will tell.
<P>
	The Sahtu, Dene and Metis received title to more than 41,000 
square kilometres. The settlement lands of the Sahtu peoples fall 
within the treaty 11 territory. In 1921 treaty 11 was signed by the 
crown and the ancestors of the Sahtu Dene who are now 
signatories to this land claim agreement.
<P>
	Among other things treaty 11 provided for the establishment 
of reserve lands. It is obvious now and it was obvious then that 
the whole reserve system envisioned by Ottawa bureaucrats was 
unworkable.
<P>
	It was even more irrelevant for the people living under 
completely different conditions in the Northwest Territories. 
Reserves do not make sense to people who must follow the 
caribou to survive. One only has to look at the tragedies of 
substance abuse and suicides in communities like Davis Inlet to 
see the end results of past misguided policies of clumping 
people who traditionally ranged much further afield into small 
groups.
<P>
	It is because the crown never upheld its promise in 1921 to 
provide treaty lands that we find ourselves discussing this 
agreement here today. The government did not have to make 
reserves out of this land entitlement. It could have spread the 
entitlement out as land in severalty in traditional camps or along 
family trap lines. This should have been a specific claim 
settlement because it lies within treaty 11, not a comprehensive 
claim settlement.
<P>
	During the 1970s the Dene and Metis people took the position 
that they had never surrendered their rights to all of the land. It 
appears that the government chose to agree with this position 
rather than uphold or slightly modify the provisions of the 
treaty.
<P>
	Under treaty 11 people were entitled to 128 acres per person. 
If the government had fulfilled its lawful obligation under the 
terms of the treaty even at this late date far less land would have 
been transferred. Although the Metis would not have received 
land under the old treaty, including them now means that the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis beneficiaries would have received just 
over 900 square kilometres of land with subsurface rights.
<P>
	In this agreement the government doubled the treaty land 
entitlement to 1,800 square kilometres. Then it stepped 
completely outside of the treaty and beyond its lawful 
obligations and added another 39,000 square kilometres without 
accompanying subsurface rights. Instead of 128 acres per person 
the Sahtu have received 20 square kilometres per person. I 
would call this quite generous.
<P>
	After doubling the treaty land entitlement and after 
guaranteeing traditional use rights over the entire settlement 
area of 280,000 square kilometres, why did the government give 
the Sahtu fee simple title to 39,000 more kilometres? I would 
ask the question is this fair and is it a just settlement?
<P>
	Recent court decisions in Canada have recognized aboriginal 
rights to the land. In the Delgamuukw Court of Appeal decision 
last June the court clearly distinguished between land ownership 
and land use. The traditional use rights are to be determined on a 
case by case basis. The aboriginal rights referred to are for the 
use and enjoyment of the land according to tradition and culture 
while recognizing there are other third party interests which also 
require use of the land base.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3458"> 3458 </A></B>
<P>
	The courts do not currently hold that the aboriginal right to 
the land is a right of ownership but of use. This agreement goes 
far beyond that. Not only have fewer than 1,800 Sahtu Dene 
and Metis retained the right to hunt, trap and fish throughout 
the settlement area, but they have a share of resource royalties 
in perpetuity, a generous cash compensation and a significant 
land and resource base.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	For all the rights the Sahtu have received, what are their 
accompanying responsibilities and obligations? Despite the 
generosity of this agreement, the crown retains responsibility 
for program delivery and for special economic development 
programs to encourage self-sufficiency. These programs are in 
addition to the many government programs the Sahtu and other 
Canadians are eligible for.
<P>
	Where is the incentive or the responsibility to become 
economically self-sufficient if the government is committed to 
providing programs indefinitely?
<P>
	The crown has gone far beyond its lawful obligations and is 
not getting any diminishment of its responsibilities in return. 
Although the agreement states that government is not liable for 
damages or losses due to the failure of a Sahtu organization to 
comply with its administrative obligations, what does this really 
mean?
<P>
	If the government does not get any concessions from the 
signatories regarding their assumption of program funding and 
delivery in this settlement then it is certainly not going to get it 
from south of 60 where governments cannot afford to be quite so 
generous.
<P>
	The continuation of government's involvement will incur 
increasing fiduciary obligations despite the fact the Sahtu now 
have the land and money to begin to take responsibility for these 
functions themselves.
<P>
	This agreement is setting a precedent for self-government 
negotiations down the road. Where First Nations in the future 
may have a tax base and the economic means to provide for their 
own programs, will they choose to rely on government funding? 
Instead of downsizing with the devolution of programs and 
authority away from Indian affairs, we seem to be encouraging 
greater bureaucracy with little fiscal responsibility at the local 
level.
<P>
	What precedent is the crown setting for negotiators in other 
treaty territories and in comprehensive claim areas throughout 
Canada? There is a clause which extinguishes all future Sahtu 
claims to additional land and water, but treaty 11 also had an 
extinguishment clause. The government chose to renegotiate the 
land entitlement provisions and resource royalties even though 
it takes the position that the Sahtu did surrender title to the land 
in 1921. The extinguishment clause in this agreement 
apparently provides greater certainty to the government, but 
extinguishment is extinguishment.
<P>
	Modern day treaties are far more complex and it is hoped 
more equitable, but will they be any more binding on the 
parties?
<P>
	The Indian Act was created in an era when paternalistic 
government believed that the Indian and Inuit peoples of Canada 
needed protection from unscrupulous land speculators and 
others, but it evolved into the misguided monster we see today.
<P>
	The Indian Act created dependencies where none existed 
before. Government assumed responsibility for all decisions 
regarding monetary or land transactions and removed all 
responsibility and decision making authority from the people it 
sought to protect.
<P>
	It is time that government got out of the business of making 
decisions for people. Government must restore the dignity of the 
Indian, Inuit and Metis people by letting them make their own 
decisions and allow them to be responsible for the consequences 
of those decisions.
<P>
	Government has given the Sahtu a settlement with extensive 
rights. Now it must ensure that the Sahtu assume the 
responsibilities that go with those rights.
<P>
	The government of the day has the right to negotiate fair and 
just settlements with aboriginal peoples who have outstanding 
claims, but the government also has the responsibility to ensure 
that those settlements are fair for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut</I>]
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the attitude of the Reform Party reminds me of 
the story of Rip Van Winkle who slept for so many years that 
when he woke up things had changed drastically. I think 
Reformers are still sleeping with the attitude they have.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Their attitude is surprising when they say how generous the 
government is. I think the Sahtu Dene and Metis have been 
pretty generous by giving up 240,000 square kilometres of land 
to the Government of Canada and only retaining 41,000 square 
kilometres and 1,800 of subsurface and surface rights. I think 
that is pretty generous.
<P>
	I would like to think that the Reform Party can see reason. 
However, that might be impossible to ask of such outdated 
thinking.
<P>
	To the three speakers from the Reform Party, how would they 
feel if they woke up one morning and somebody said they can 
live on their land but laws are going to be proposed which they 
have to obey on how to live, where to live, outlawing their 
beliefs, taking away their dignity, taking away their hunting 
rights, not allowing them to vote, putting in a new justice system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3459"> 3459 </A></B>
<P>
that is totally foreign to them, and in the process infecting them 
with smallpox, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases?
<P>
	How can they be so dense that they cannot understand that the 
Government of Canada and the people of Canada are now trying 
to correct a situation, an injustice that has been around for a few 
hundred years?
<P>
	I will repeat my remarks from earlier. The Reform Party 
members talk as if the aboriginal people are invading their land. 
It is as if we are taking land away from them. They can record 
their history in hundreds of years. We can record ours in 
thousands and tens of thousands of years. The sheer audacity of 
this group-I am at a loss for words.
<P>
	How would they feel if they woke up one morning and 
suddenly found themselves subject to a totally different kind of 
life than they had been used to for years and years?
<P>
	Some of them make statements that they are all for aboriginal 
self-government, self-determination. Strip away that veneer 
and I think all we see is paternalistic statements from the 
Reform Party. It is like saying some of my best friends are 
Indians. It is good to say it but it does not really mean much, 
because the respect and the support have to be there from within 
rather than just saying it on the surface.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his comments. I do not think that anyone 
would deny that there have been injustices done. I detailed some 
examples of that, how that has taken place down through the 
history of our country.
<P>
	I think also that what I was trying to get at in my presentation 
is that when rights are granted to individuals or to groups there 
are corresponding responsibilities that go with those rights. I do 
not see in this agreement where that is taking place within the 
confines of the agreement. I see all sorts of things being granted 
to this group of Canadians, and I think we have to distinguish 
here that we are all Canadians and we have all benefited from 
this great land of ours in different ways. Even the native people, 
the aboriginal people, have clearly benefited from Canada. My 
comment is that they also have to take responsibility. If they are 
going to go down the road toward self-government-there 
clearly does not seem to be any definition of that forthcoming 
from the opposite side of the House-then obviously there 
should be this devolution of power, to the Sahtu people in this 
particular case, to the aboriginal people in Canada, but also they 
should be seeking to give up any further rights to aboriginal 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	My hope always was that once we came to a reasonable and 
fair settlement and self-government for the aboriginal people 
that at some point we would all be treated equally. There would 
not be any programs specifically based on race any more.
<P>
	I see that this agreement does not accomplish that, even 
though the monetary compensation is paid, even though the land 
use is guaranteed, even though the fee simple land is given over, 
even though subsurface mineral rights are given to these people 
from the Government of Canada. The bottom line still appears to 
be that they do not give up any future access to aboriginal 
programs, either existing ones or ones in the future. That was the 
thrust of my speech. That is my concern.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the hon. member and I have a hard time coming to grips with the 
root of his reasoning.
<P>
	He suggests somehow that Canada is giving them something. 
In his speech he even goes on to suggest that other agreements 
would have given them less. I cannot really comprehend it. Then 
the hon. member goes on to say we are going to give them these 
things but what are their obligations. In other words he wants to 
pay homage or lip service to self-government but then turns 
around and says we should be making the rules for them and tell 
them what their obligations are. That is what I hear in the 
speech.
<P>
	We are not giving the natives anything. It is already theirs. We 
are simply arriving at a suitable accommodation so that the 
country can forge ahead.
<P>
	I saw a cartoon once where two Indians are standing on Mount 
Royal watching Jacques Cartier land. The soldiers are about to 
get off the boat and come ashore and one Indian is saying to the 
other: ``Let them land. What harm can they do?''
<P>
	Does the hon. member really believe that we are giving them 
something by these agreements? I have really failed to 
understand what direction he is coming from. We have already 
taken. It is already theirs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his question and comments regarding my 
presentation.
<P>
	What I was referring to was that the ancestors of the Sahtu 
Dene did sign treaty No. 11. As signatories to that treaty certain 
things were decided on, one of which was that there should be 
128 acres granted per person under the treaty. What we see under 
this new agreement goes far beyond that.
<P>
	I believe that as a people and a country we are giving up 
something. If we are not then I would ask the member in return 
where is the $75 million coming from? It is coming from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3460"> 3460 </A></B>
<P>
somewhere. Someone is giving that money and it is we as a 
nation, which includes all the aboriginal people, all of us are 
giving that. I am not saying we as a  race or we as a party or we as 
a government. I am saying we as a nation are giving up some of 
the things that are in this agreement. I dispute his point.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Given the nature of the 
debate today, if any one of you should be watching the clock 
very carefully you will notice that I am going to extend the 
period of questions and comments because I want to hear from 
the Secretary of State for Training and Youth.
<P>
	I think all of us in the House would recognize her interest in 
this issue and that of others. But in this instance I would like to 
give the floor to hon. Secretary of State for Training and Youth.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State </B><B>(Training 
and Youth)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member. I know that he has had intense briefing this very day 
and put forward quite a few ideas concerning this claim.
<P>
	I just want to say that some of the things I am hearing in this 
debate are very disturbing. It is a very ethnocentric view that is 
being perpetrated, but then I suppose that is the reason why we 
have different political ideologies. We totally support the land 
claims process. In fact as a government we want to make that 
process fairer and more equitable for the aboriginal people.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that this particular claim is receiving all of 
the concerns that the Reform Party has. It is not specifically the 
Sahtu claim that is being dealt with here. It is the Reform Party's 
political agenda regarding aboriginal issues: self-government, 
compensation. However there are a number of things I want to 
hit on.
<P>
	Talking about treating all Canadians the same I think is very 
misguided and misdirected through this claims debate because 
talking about treating aboriginal people the same is not treating 
them fairly necessarily.
<P>
	If you know the language of constitutional debates and of 
aboriginal justice you will know that treating people who are 
poor, who are probably one of the poorest groups in the country, 
who have the highest unemployment, who have the highest rate 
of suicide-in Big Cove one a month-if you think about the 
social statistics, the under representation of aboriginal people in 
the financial institutions, the political institutions and when you 
think about the over representation of those people in terms of 
incarceration, poor health, poverty, suicide and a number of 
other social malaise, you will know that treating the people the 
same is not treating them fairly. Maybe we can eradicate that 
view.
<P>
	Second, I would like to say that you are talking about the 
finality of the claim. It was my grandfather, Chief George Zault 
Blondin who signed treaty 11. It was with the good intent of 
holding in trust those things that we hold dear to us. I know from 
the history of my people that it was not to forfeit anything. It was 
signed to secure  and hold close the things that mean something 
to aboriginal people.
<P>
	This is a peculiar arrangement, a very difficult process, which 
for the last 20 or 24 years these people have undergone. They 
voted for it. They want it. We recognize that as a government. By 
taking the debate one step further, the hon. member alleges that 
if we have a deal there has to be finality, there has to be an 
element of certainty, that if we reach an agreement the people 
have to be responsible and must not ask for anything else.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member is this. Is he alleging that 
once provinces become provinces they should not ask for any 
more transfer payments? Is he alleging that once municipal 
governments are formed they should not look for any subsidies 
in terms of tax benefits or anything like that? Is he alleging that 
any form of government that is established outside of the federal 
government should have that same finality as well? If we are 
going to treat people the same, so should governments be treated 
the same.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will certainly give the 
hon. member for Prince George-Peace River the same 
generosity of time to respond.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
address my comments to the last question first. That is not what I 
am advocating. When the municipalities of the Sahtu Dene are 
formed I would think and hope they would be eligible for the 
same programs and the same benefits as any municipality in 
Canada.
<P>
	What I was referring to were programs specific to one group 
based on race, in other words, specific aboriginal programs. 
That is what I was referring to. Certainly, once they form their 
municipalities and have self-government, they should be 
eligible for the same programs as any other municipality in any 
province.
<P>
	I have a couple of other quick points because I know time is of 
the essence. I agree with the hon. member. The system has failed 
and part of the reason it has failed in the past is that they have not 
been treated equally. People were segregated and shoved on to 
reserves and they had to live there.
<P>
	That is where the system failed in the past. They were not 
treated equally. Therefore I still hold on to the long-term goal 
that gradually we can reach a point where all Canadian citizens 
will be treated equally. I noticed that the hon. member used the 
term that she was interested in a fair and equitable settlement for 
the aboriginal people. Certainly that is my concern and I think 
the concern of my colleagues in the Reform Party as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3461"> 3461 </A></B>
<P>
	We go a bit beyond that. I would say to the hon. member that 
we are concerned about a fair and equitable settlement not just 
for the aboriginal people but for all the people of Canada. We 
feel we do not just represent one group. We represent all 
Canadians and we are speaking on behalf of all Canadians when 
we raise these issues.
<P>
	She also mentioned that she had concerns about the Reform 
Party's position, that we were using this debate and it was not 
specific to this agreement. I agree with her. Obviously we are 
trying to bring other issues concerning the aboriginal people to 
light using the format of the debate here today.
<P>
	We are very concerned about the precedent that one 
agreement will set. It might be used in future agreements 
throughout the country and we are using the debate to bring 
forward some of these other issues. I thank the hon. member for 
her comments and her questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: The 
hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, MIL 
Davie shipbuilding; the hon. member for Portneuf, 
bilingualism; the hon. member for Frontenac, job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have spoken 
here a few times. I have made some statements but this is my 
first speech in the House. I am very honoured to be sent to the 
Parliament of Canada to represent my constituents, not only the 
aboriginal people in my area but also many non-aboriginal 
people.
<P>
	As an aboriginal person and First Nations member, I have 
been involved in this discussion for many years both as a chief in 
my reserve, Red Sucker Lake Band, and also as a member of the 
Legislative Assembly in Manitoba for well over 11 years. I have 
committed myself to this process for a very long time. What I 
find is that I have to repeat myself over and over again many 
times to get my point across.
<P>
	When we talk about the aboriginal people we have been here 
for thousands and thousands of years. We have had governments 
for thousands of years. We had societies. We had political 
structures, social structures. We had our own languages. We 
traded with other nations. In that way we have existed as a 
nation, as a government in this country. When the first European 
people or the settlers arrived they were met by the First Nations 
in this country. They welcomed these people on to the shores of 
what we call Canada today. Whether it was on the west coast or 
on the St. Lawrence River we were here; even through Hudson 
Bay, which I am very familiar with, down to the Nelson River to 
Winnipeg we welcomed these people.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	If it had not been for the kindness and the generosity of our 
people many of those people would have perished. If the Lord 
Selkirk settlers had not been helped by Chief Peguis, many of 
these people would have perished.
<P>
	What surprises me in this country is the lack of understanding 
or the ignorance of the history of this country. We see the 
Canadian Constitution being proposed as supreme law in this 
country, entrenching in the law of this land the recognition of 
two founding nations, the French and the English. We know very 
well that the first people here were the First Nations. Yet your 
Constitution is based upon the supremacy of God and the rule of 
law.
<P>
	There is a myth concerning the Canadian Constitution and the 
truth. Any constitution should be able to tell the truth, built upon 
strong foundations that will not crumble but will stand the test of 
time. The Canadian Constitution never did that. That is why it 
crumbled, it did not acknowledge the truth and reality in this 
country.
<P>
	It was the First Nations that contributed so much to this 
country by signing treaties. What does it mean when you sign 
treaties? It means that you enter into an agreement with another 
nation, in this case the settler people represented by the Queen 
with our representatives of the First Nations.
<P>
	There were many pre-Confederation treaties and a number of 
treaties made in Manitoba and today what are called modern day 
treaties. Treaties are about establishing relationships. That is 
what it is all about. As a matter of fact, when we say inherent 
right to self-government, we are exercising the very authority to 
sign the treaties. We did not need Parliament to tell us we have 
treaties. As a matter of fact, there should be a formal recognition 
by Parliament that we always had the inherent right to 
self-government. It is not something that can be granted by 
Parliament or by Canada, because we came to the table as 
equals. That is what the treaty making process is all about, 
establishing that.
<P>
	In that process we shared the land and resources of this 
country from which many people have benefited all over the 
world. How generous and how kind we have been to the rest of 
this country. What kind of benefits have we received so far? 
Look at the situation in Davis Inlet or in my home at Red Sucker 
Lake. We have poor housing conditions. We do not have running 
water. We do have unemployment rates higher than in the cities. 
I am sure that if unemployment reaches 20 per cent it is a 
national disaster across the country, but it is 90 per cent in many 
of these communities. Nobody cries about those kinds of 
conditions.
<P>
	All we want is governments to honour and respect the treaties 
they have signed with us. We do not expect anything more or 
anything less because we have contributed so much to this great 
country and we have not benefited at all.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3462"> 3462 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We talk about the special relationships. I know we have a 
special relationship, but I do not mean special in the way that we 
are better off than anyone. We have a unique relationship which 
no other group has in this country. We want governments to 
honour that.
<P>
	This government has proceeded to do what has not been done, 
and that is to settle and implement inherent right to 
self-government. We are not asking it to give us 
self-government. It has never been anyone else's concern to 
give us anything. It is a matter of acknowledging that we have 
always had that.
<P>
	We talk about the Fathers of Confederation in Charlottetown. 
What about our forefathers who signed the treaties? Can they 
not be mentioned in history as contributing to the well-being of 
everybody else in this country? There is no formal recognition 
of our people. All we are asking for is to settle the outstanding 
issues, the treaty obligations. The spirit and intent of the treaties 
should be honoured.
<P>
	Many people have risen and spoken here but all we asked for, 
compared with what money has been spent, has been very little. 
Consider how much land and resources have been generated in 
this country and shared by the aboriginal people. I am sure 
billions and billions of dollars have been made off this great 
country. Yet when we ask for money we are not asking in the 
sense that we are begging for it, we have been asking 
governments to honour their treaty obligations, if only a small 
portion allocated under the control of First Nations.
<P>
	If we look at the treaty making process, government officials 
went back and developed the wording. They never really 
understood what the native people were saying. First, our way of 
life and our philosophy is to share what we have so we shared the 
land and the resources so that we would have respect for each 
other, that we would live side by side with each and that we 
would co-exist with each other and help each other. That was the 
spirit and intent.
<P>
	It was never our intention to be governed by a government. 
We have never extinguished or surrendered the right to govern 
ourselves. It has never been that. When we signed the treaties 
they were signed nation to nation. As a matter of fact, it was a 
recognition when we signed treaties that we were nations. As a 
nation we expect governments not to act unilaterally in the way 
history has shown us and in which they created the Indian Act 
which has total control over our lives. It even defines who we are 
today. This has to be done away with and we have to have a 
renewed partnership. That is the challenge that faces us today. 
How can we honour that? I know we have honoured our bargain. 
We expect the government with the support of the opposition to 
honour the promises of its forefathers, those they made to us. We 
do not expect anything more or anything less. That is all we ask 
for, we do not ask for very much. We have  been very patient for 
a very long time and it is time the government honour those 
treaties.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	That is why I am very honoured to speak on Bill C-16. It is a 
very small part. We want to be part of this country and we have 
contributed so much to this country as well, but no one seems to 
talk about it or at least acknowledge it. If they acknowledge it 
somehow they seem to be obligated that they have to provide 
more things or more benefits.
<P>
	If the governments alone were to provide for their treaty 
obligations there would really be no need to ask for more 
funding. We talk about finality. In the treaties it says as long as 
the sun shines and the rivers flow and the grass grows. That is 
the terminology used. It is forever, the relationship that we have.
<P>
	We are very committed to this country. We want Canada to be 
wealthy. We want Canada to be united. We love this country. We 
love this land. We love everybody. I often say jokingly that our 
immigration policy was wide open, and it has been to show what 
kind of people we have been. We have been very kind but it has 
been the governments here that have always dictated and put 
restrictions on. It seems like within our own homeland we are 
treated like foreigners, we are treated like outside citizens, 
second class citizens.
<P>
	The first order of business should be the First Nations 
business in this country. We should settle the treaties and settle 
land claims. I speak in favour of this bill. I hope members will 
support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Churchill 
on his first participation in debate. I think we were very 
appreciative of the words he spoke, his commitment to Canada, 
and the warmth and conviction with which he speaks.
<P>
	I have spoken to many Canadians and I am sure I speak for 
millions of Canadians who would like to express appreciation to 
the hon. member for Churchill for the part he played in the 
debate over the Meech Lake accord. I have had many people 
express to me their appreciation for the fact that the hon. 
member for Churchill played a major and a significant role in 
defeating the Meech Lake accord and preventing it from being 
imposed upon Canadians.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate the hon. member on his concern 
over Canada as being a country built on two founding races. I 
know that my Reform colleagues and I for many years now have 
shared the view that as a false conception of Canada it is not 
relevant in very many parts of the country and certainly does not 
recognize the role played by the true founding race of Canada, 
the aboriginal people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3463"> 3463 </A></B>
<P>
	I do have a question. On our side of the House and in our 
caucus we have asked the minister of Indian affairs, we have 
asked the Prime Minister and we have asked many influential 
members on the government side to provide us with a definition 
of aboriginal self-government. I heard the hon. member for 
Churchill speak about aboriginal self-government today. It is 
very difficult for us to fulfil our role as an opposition until we 
have the terms of aboriginal self-government defined for us so 
we can determine whether they are good and just and will make 
us a better country and will enhance the role of aboriginal 
people within the nation, whether it may be divisive and 
negative on the country. I plead with the hon. member for 
Churchill. Would he at least be so considerate as to give us his 
definition of what aboriginal self-government is.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, self-government 
simply put is to administer our own affairs, to be able to make 
our own decisions and to determine our own future. It is a very 
simple statement but very complicated to implement. 
Self-government entails many things. It means to start 
developing our own institutions, language, culture, education 
and our own First Nations government structures.
<P>
	In negotiations self-government is based upon what kind of 
agreement is reached. My position has always been that the 
fundamental basis and foundation from which we negotiate are 
the treaties. When the first governments met we sat down 
together and came up with a treaty. That formed a basis for our 
relationship with the government. In return we were to have 
certain benefits.
<P>
	However we have never extinguished the right to 
self-government. It has never been surrendered. To me the 
treaty making process has never come to an end. What needs to 
happen is the government needs to sit down with the First 
Nations in this country.
<P>
	One of the reasons the constitutional process failed is that the 
very question the hon. member asked was raised at the 
constitutional table. All the first ministers and the Prime 
Minister asked the same question. They were the ones really to 
say what kind of structure we have. It was not based on equality. 
We were not being invited as equals; we were just invitees at the 
first ministers conferences. It failed because we were not equal 
in the negotiations.
<P>
	Sometimes we get invited equally on a level playing field. 
However often when we are on that level playing field or let us 
say we are in a skating arena we find we have no ice skates or 
equipment, yet we play according to their rules. That is the kind 
of process we have been involved in. We are not being treated 
equally.
<P>
	It should be based on the treaties, nation to nation. Once that 
is recognized instead of trying to determine what is best for us, 
we should sit down as equals, equal to First Nations. I think that 
would resolve a lot of the questions.
<P>
	Self-government is not something which is defined in a paper. 
It has to be negotiated with the First Nations. It may vary from 
the Micmacs to the Haida people because they have different 
cultures and a different way of doing things.
<P>
	There is the potlatch system. Potlatch is a system of 
government. We have the clan system which is another 
traditional form of government. There is Iroquois confederacy. 
These different systems of government have been here for a long 
time, whether they will be modified or not. Those are things we 
go through.
<P>
	When the hon. member asks for a definition of 
self-government, it is a matter defining it in the negotiation 
process or through a treaty process. It is not black and white but 
it is a process that hopefully the governments are going to be 
undertaking so we can resolve it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
competing with each other to be recognized by you.
<P>
	First of all I would like to congratulate the member for his 
speech today and the straightforwardness with which he 
expresses his point of view.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I for one am in this House to help resolve this problem. I 
definitely would like to see as much consultation and work as 
possible with the aboriginal peoples, the Indians, the Metis and 
the Inuit so we can resolve these long term outstanding 
settlements and agreements.
<P>
	I know the settler people are here. I know the white man took 
over, those immigrants when they first landed. Perhaps the hon. 
member for Churchill would appreciate the current 1 per cent 
rule the Liberal government has and he would have maintained 
control.
<P>
	Repetition is important; it is a fact of life. If he has to give a 
similar speech again and if he has to repeat it five or six times, I 
would encourage him to do that.
<P>
	There have been a lot of wrongs committed. A lot of injustices 
to the native peoples have been perpetrated over the years. We in 
this House are not the ones who have perpetrated this crime nor 
made these mistakes. We are here to learn from these mistakes 
and we are here to try to make it better.
<P>
	It is in this light and in this vein I wish to address the hon. 
member and let him know that what we are concerned about is 
the consultative process. Will he agree with us or put forward 
the next time he speaks the type of self-government the native 
people or the aboriginal people want will comply with the 
current law? He has his problems with the other tribes and other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3464"> 3464 </A></B>
<P>
nations. There is a problem with that interfacing with the laws of 
the  land as they are today. It is a fact of life that the Government 
of Canada is here and it has to be negotiated with.
<P>
	Will the hon. member try to put an answer in the context that 
what they are seeking for in terms of self-government will in 
fact comply with the laws we have today? How can we get over 
that hurdle? What would his response be on that basis?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly the problem 
we are wrestling with is not as a result of our laws. It is as a 
result of the laws that were passed here a long, long time ago, 
well over 100 years ago.
<P>
	Many of our people have been put outside of their 
communities as a result of laws that were passed here. If we had 
exercised our own laws many of our people would still be 
enjoying the benefits of our societies. When we are concerned 
about leaving out people or people not being represented or 
losing their rights, the principles of that will be maintained by 
our people.
<P>
	Certainly, when we are talking about self-government 
structures we cannot operate with the kind of laws that have 
been put in place. If we did that all we would be doing would be 
implementing the colonial oppressive policies on ourselves. 
Therefore, a new kind of system would have to be recognized 
and a level of government would have to be established in which 
we would be able to exercise jurisdiction within our own 
territory.
<P>
	When talking about justice, whose justice are we talking 
about? Usually the dominant society has the upper hand in 
dispelling justice which is quite different from ours in terms of 
value systems. We could get into a big debate about that, but I 
certainly think the aboriginal people in their own traditions have 
maintained the kind of structures that would provide all kinds of 
rights and benefits to our communities.
<P>
	I do not see any kind of loss of rights if we were to administer 
our own jurisdiction in our own territory. I have no hesitation in 
saying that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity to rise and respond to 
the hon. member for Churchill.
<P>
	This really is what Parliament is all about. I am personally 
very honoured to have been here for the hon. member's first 
intervention and to have heard him speak so passionately and 
honestly about his life, his experiences, dreams and aspirations. 
Obviously it came from the heart. It is not something I could 
live; I cannot be in the hon. member's skin. We can learn a 
tremendous amount from each other.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member, other members in this 
House and others in our land that our role here is to oppose the 
government, to challenge its program and to try to ensure that by 
a spirited and healthy debate we end up with a better solution 
than we would have had without that debate.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his intervention. I look forward to 
more in the future.
<P>
	What would the member do faced with this situation? The 
situation is that all across the land on reservations there are all of 
the social ills and the unemployment the hon. member 
described. How do we go about changing that, not just on 
reservations but for urban Indians as well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all we would 
like to be in a position to make our own decisions. We would like 
to exercise our own jurisdiction in respect of our territories. At 
the same time we would expect the government to honour its 
treaties so that we would have the resources and the financial 
wherewithal to address and alleviate some of those problems 
that are so apparent in our communities such as unemployment, 
the high suicide rates and the economic conditions.
<P>
	We are not asking for any special funding or to consider 
anything special. All we are asking is that the government 
honour its treaty obligations. Housing, medicare and education 
are under the treaties, just to give an example of what we are 
talking about.
<P>
	What is important is that the government tends to make 
decisions for us and that has to stop. By not supporting this bill I 
think what is being said is that the hon. member is agreeing to 
the policy which exists today. What is being said to me is that he 
is not agreeing with the government's policy and legislation to 
allow us to make those decisions.
<P>
	With respect, the amount of dollars we are talking about is 
very small compared to the spending government has had. As I 
said, we have been very generous. We are not asking for billions 
of dollars in this package. We are asking for a very small amount 
of money compared to the kind of money spent overall.
<P>
	My first answer is, allow us to control it and honour your 
commitment by supporting this bill. Actions speaker louder than 
words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, just a point of order to correct 
what I believe is a small error. In Canada we have reserves, not 
reservations.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am not sure that was a 
point of order. However, the point has been made and I thank the 
parliamentary secretary for his intervention.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Let me add also my own remarks that I feel honoured to have 
been in the Chair on the occasion of the member for Churchill's 
first intervention and debate on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Let me also compliment all members in the House, 
particularly those who have participated in the debate and even 
those who did not participate through this intervention but who 
listened very attentively. The tone was most encouraging and 
the sensitivity in respect of the debate is much appreciated by 
the Chair. I compliment all members present.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
first to thank the hon. member for Churchill who gave us a 
lesson in history. He spoke from his heart and also with great 
wisdom, and I can only hope that his speech will help improve 
our relations with aboriginal nations, as well as our 
understanding of those people.
<P>
	This having been said, we have before us a bill to approve, 
give effect and declare valid the comprehensive land claim 
agreement of the Sahtu Dene and Metis, which was signed on 
September 6, 1993. The region covered is a territory of 280,000 
square kilometres, in which live some 2,000 people representing 
five communities. The Bloc Quebecois supports this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	At this point, I would like, for the benefit of those who are 
listening here and across the country, to give a chronology of the 
events which have led to the tabling of this bill today.
<P>
	In 1976, the federal government started negotiating under a 
land claim process with the Dene and the Metis of the 
Mackenzie Valley. In 1981, these negotiations led to a final 
agreement which was concluded in April of 1990. On September 
6, 1993, the agreement was signed by the Queen and the Sahtu 
Tribal Council, in Fort Norman, Northwest Territories.
<P>
	A plebiscite was held from July 5 to July 8, 1993, to ratify the 
agreement. The agreement was approved by 85 per cent of the 
Dene and by 99 per cent of the Metis. On January 13 and 
February 11, 1994, the tribal council approved certain 
amendments to the agreement. Just what is this agreement all 
about?
<P>
	First, its purpose is to achieve certainty and clarity of rights 
with respect to ownership and use of some lands and their 
natural resources. The agreement is divided in two parts. The 
first one deals with issues such as self-government, royalties on 
resources, taxation, financial and economic measures, rights 
over water, as well as wildlife harvesting and management.
<P>
	Financial compensations totalling $75 million, in dollars of 
1990, are to be provided over a period of about 15 years. An 
annual proportion of royalties collected on resources from the 
Mackenzie Valley is also covered by the agreement. As well, an 
annual proportion of royalties  collected on resources from the 
Norman Wells oil and gas development is also covered. Indeed, 
7.5 per cent of the first two million dollars collected by the 
government during a given year and 1.5 per cent of any 
additional amount will be used as royalties.
<P>
	The agreement also includes participation in land use 
planning, renewable resources management, water and land 
control, as well as preservation of the Sahtu heritage in the 
region covered. Federal, territorial and municipal laws will 
continue to apply to Sahtu Dene and Metis, and also to the land.
<P>
	A Renewable Resources Board is created. This board is a legal 
entity, which means that it can take legal action and can itself be 
sued. It can also set policies and propose regulations on the 
commercial harvesting of wild animals and on commercial 
activities related to wildlife. It will be the main wildlife 
management organization in the region. It is composed of seven 
members appointed jointly by the federal government and the 
territorial government, with at least three members chosen from 
a list submitted by the Sahtu Tribal Council.
<P>
	I said that this agreement was in two parts. The second part 
concerns land and distinguishes between areas with rights to 
underground resources and areas with only surface rights. 
Property rights cover 41,437 square kilometres in the 
Mackenzie Valley region, with mining rights for 1,813 square 
kilometres.
<P>
	At this time, I think it is appropriate to talk about the 
aboriginal question in a broader way, going beyond the specific 
subject before us now and putting it in the larger context in 
which it belongs anyway and on which the rest must necessarily 
be based. Perhaps we could begin with the native issue in 
Quebec.
<P>
	I remember a song heard fairly often on radio and television in 
the 1970s, which told the story of what our colleague from 
Nunatsiaq was talking about earlier, I believe.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In the beginning, in his tent, a very easygoing native man 
received a white man, who asked permission to plant a stake, 
just a single little stake. The reaction was, ``Well, my God, it is 
just a single stake, so why object, it is so simple and easy; it is 
not much, go ahead, plant your stake''. Some days passed and he 
was asked permission for a second stake; a few more days went 
by and a request came for a third stake. Several months later, 
after a series of stakes had been installed across the forest, he 
was asked to let a wire go through. Every time, the native had 
always agreed in good faith and complied with great pleasure.
<P>
	Once the wire was installed, he found himself with concrete, 
highways, houses, buildings and he finally had to move his 
teepee. The song goes on for about three minutes, but I have to 
shorten it. However, I believe that it expressed a certain 
inescapable reality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3466"> 3466 </A></B>
<P>
	Many people have asked me, and I am sure that many of my 
colleagues in the Bloc have been asked the same question, Mr. 
Speaker, ``What will Quebec do about the native people?'' That 
is the wrong question. Not only is it the wrong question, but 
it is one which should not be asked in the first place.
<P>
	First, we are not doing anything about the native people. If 
something is to be done, it will be done together, as equals. It is 
not up to us or anyone else to decide what must be done about 
native issues. This is a matter that must be negotiated and 
covered by agreements between equal nations. The question 
arises how this translates in Quebec and how our perspectives on 
the matter have developed since the sixties.
<P>
	I may recall that on April 8, 1963, the Government of Quebec 
resumed contact, administratively speaking, with the aboriginal 
peoples within Quebec territory. Until then, the federal 
government's responsibility was paramount and it still is today. 
The Government of Quebec at the time established the Ministère 
des richesses naturelles et de la Direction générale du Nouveau 
Québec. Within New Quebec, the department was responsible, 
with the exception of those areas that were already administered 
by Quebec, for the administration of justice, provincial police 
services and the services of the department of lands and forests. 
At the time, the purpose was to develop natural resources.
<P>
	Not until federal responsibility for community and municipal 
services was transferred to the province 17 years later, in 
February 1981, was the <I>direction générale du Nouveau Québec</I> 
able to start concentrating on education, although it had, as in 
1963, stated its desire to respect the Inuit language and culture.
<P>
	By the way, I would like to commend the hon. member for 
Nunatsiaq on using his mother tongue. I don't understand when 
he speaks in his own language, but we must realize that language 
communicates culture. When I speak French, I am able to 
express ideas in a certain way, and I would be unable to do so in 
English because language is a reflection of culture. When the 
hon. member speaks in his native tongue, we don't understand, 
and I think that is his message to us. We don't understand. And 
when we realize that we don't understand, perhaps then we will 
start showing respect, and he has my respect.
<P>
	To continue this short history, in the early seventies, the 
federal government published a White Paper on native policy. 
Quebec established the <I>Commission de négociation des affaires 
indiennes</I>, whose purpose was to work together with the 
department of intergovernmental affairs and other departments 
involved in negotiations with the Confederation of Indians of 
Quebec, and with the federal department of Indian affairs and 
Northern Development regarding Quebec's responsibilities 
vis-à-vis the Indians of Quebec or Indian affairs.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The <I>Commission de négociation des affaires indiennes</I> was 
also supposed to make recommendations on an integrated policy 
on Indian affairs and to propose measures to be taken in order to 
implement the policies concerning Indian affairs.
<P>
	On November 11, 1975, the Quebec government signed the 
James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement with the Crees and 
the Inuit. On January 31, 1978, it signed the Northeastern 
Quebec Agreement with the Naskapis of Quebec.
<P>
	We were then facing a new reality in Quebec government 
departments: the aboriginal reality. And the whole of the 
Quebec policy on aboriginal people was summed up in two 
agreements only. Therefore, we had to give ourselves a more 
comprehensive policy; that is why on January 18, 1978, the 
<I>Secrétariat des activités gouvernementales en milieu 
amérindien et inuit</I> was created and the <I>Direction générale du 
Nouveau-Québec</I> and the <I>Bureau de coordination de l'entente</I> 
were abolished.
<P>
	Then came the eighties. In January 1987, the secrétariat was 
given a new name, <I>Secrétariat aux affaires autochtones</I>, and its 
new mandate was to negotiate global agreements in 
co-operation with the various departments involved. Let me 
remind you that the preamble of the Charter of the French 
Language says that ``the National Assembly of Québec 
recognizes the right of the Amerinds and the Inuit of Québec, the 
first inhabitants of this land, to preserve and develop their 
original language and culture''.
<P>
	And self-government is certainly the focus of discussions 
between aboriginal people and governments. It was the subject 
of four constitutional conferences held in Ottawa between 1983 
and 1987. There again, they talked about the principle of the 
inherent right to self-government, but unfortunately that right 
was not entrenched in the Canadian Constitution. Natives have 
to get some political leverage if they want to really exercise that 
self-government because this is the way to their economic 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
	Self-government means giving aboriginal people complete 
jurisdiction over health, education and social services they 
receive. It means giving them full jurisdiction also over the 
administration of justice, environment, public safety and land 
and forest management.
<P>
	I would now like to present this House with some statistics 
that should give it some food for thought. It should interest as 
well those who are watching this debate at home.
<P>
	In 1991, there were, in Quebec, 39,590 Indians living either 
on reserves, in establishments or on treaty lands, whereas 
15,794 Indians lived off their reserves. On top of that, there were 
6,400 Inuit living in northern settlements in the Hudson and 
Ungava Bay area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3467"> 3467 </A></B>
<P>
	We are therefore dealing with a native population of 61,754 
according to the 1991 Census, which represents one per cent 
of the total population in Quebec. The lands set aside for them 
amount to 14,770 square kilometres. The main native peoples 
or nations are the Mohawks, with close to 16,000 members; the 
Montagnais, with more than 11,000; the Crees, with a little 
more than 10,000; and the Algonquins, with more than 6,000.
<P>
	Nations vary in size from 242 for the Malecites to more than 
15,000, very close to 16,000 for the Mohawks. Fifty per cent of 
these communities have less than 500 members. Their annual 
birth rate is 2.4 compared to 1.4 for other Quebecers. Seventy 
per cent of Indians living on reserves do not have a high school 
diploma. Their suicide rate is three times that of Quebecers. The 
native infant mortality rate is three and a half times higher than 
in the general population. Life expectancy for Indians on 
reserves is 8.6 years shorter than for the rest of the population. 
Indians account for 2.74 per cent of inmates.
<P>
	Here are now a few statistics for Canada as a whole, again as 
food for thought. Twenty-five per cent of natives are 
unemployed, whereas Montreal, with 19 per cent, has the 
highest unemployment rate in the country.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The average income is 33 per cent lower. The unemployment 
rate for native people on reserves is 33 per cent, and 16 per cent 
of natives say that their race is a barrier to employment, which 
proves that racism and discrimination are probably fairly 
prevalent.
<P>
	In 1990, 13 per cent of native adults did not have any income, 
compared to 9 per cent for the general Canadian population. 
Only 5 per cent of natives had an income in excess of $40,000 in 
1990, compared to 15 per cent among Canadians in general. 
Seventeen per cent had an income of less that $2,000 and 29 per 
cent were on welfare. Forty-two per cent of native welfare 
recipients lived on reserves.
<P>
	The main problems encountered by natives are, in descending 
order of importance: chronic unemployment, alcoholism, 
family violence, suicide, sexual abuse, rape. Six per cent of 
natives have diabetes compared to two per cent in the general 
population, even though this disease was unknown among native 
people in the 1940s.
<P>
	Forty-five per cent of Indians on reserves claim that their 
absence of mobility is a problem. Twenty per cent of native 
housing is in need of major repairs against eight per cent for all 
dwellings in Quebec. Ten per cent of native dwellings did not 
have toilets, less than half were heated with electricity. 
Nevertheless, the average rent was $410 in 1991.
<P>
	Crib death among native infants is 4.7 times higher that the 
national rate, and deaths in the 15 to 44 age group resulting from 
drowning, fire, shooting and vehicle accidents, can often be 
linked to alcohol abuse. The suicide rate among young adults is 
22 per 100,000, twice the national average.
<P>
	The only way to give back their dignity to the First Nations is 
to treat them as equals. Nobody has a secret formula for reaching 
the results which must be obtained before the next century, but 
everyone should keep an open mind and a fair attitude. We could 
thus negotiate on an equal basis and come to suitable agreements 
like the one signed with the Dene, which is before us tonight.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to congratulate the Sahtu Dene for the very 
professional manner in which they have pursued this agreement 
and the help they have been to me and to others in trying to get a 
handle on this debate and exactly what is in the bill.
<P>
	It is my view that in Bill C-16 the majority of what is written 
is innovative, imaginative and very worth while.
<P>
	At the outset I want to point out that I will be raising some 
points while speaking about the bill. The intent is to make it 
better and to understand what we are talking about. This is 
probably one of the very first times that there has ever been a 
debate in the House of Commons over such an important issue. 
These issues come before the House and because they are 
politically sensitive or motherhood issues they never end up 
being debated honestly. It is this lack of honest, vigorous debate 
which may have allowed us to arrive in the position we are at 
today.
<P>
	It is our job, our function, our responsibility not to 
automatically assume that everything the government presents 
is right and holy and good. Our job is to assume that everything 
the government presents is exactly the opposite.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And can be improved.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> And can be improved. It is in that spirit I 
make my comments today and I know my hon. colleagues do as 
well.
<P>
	We are all aware that Bill C-16 will pass eventually. It will 
pass intact or with moderate or very little change. The question 
then is this: Why am I and my colleagues so impassioned about 
this debate? That is the question. Why would we even bother?
<P>
	The other question is: This is a debate of incredible 
importance, at least in our view, to the nation, and yet how much 
ink does it get? Where are the priorities in the nation? We are 
talking about the First Nations, the first people in our country. 
They have traditionally, we know and acknowledge, been the 
recipi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3468"> 3468 </A></B>
<P>
ents of something less than the kind of treatment of which we 
should be proud. Yet for the very first time it is being debated.  
Unfortunately it will probably get very little interest outside the 
House.
<P>
	Why then do I think this is the most important speech I have 
given in the House thus far, and why do I care so deeply that 
what we do is right? It is because the relationship between the 
first people and the immigrants, that is all of us that they 
welcomed to this continent, has largely been one of paternalism, 
of manipulation, of neglect and of isolation.
<P>
	We acknowledge that there are two sides to every story. While 
we-I am speaking essentially as a white person in this 
country-have not much to be proud about, neither do our native 
brothers have very much to be proud about either. We have to 
recognize that there are two sides to this story and 
responsibilities on both sides. We must accept responsibility, 
but so must the aboriginal people accept responsibility for their 
lot in life.
<P>
	That is not to say there have not been examples of inspiration 
and achievement. But in general, especially on the prairies 
where I am from, we have nothing to be proud of. By using that 
as a starting point and as a base, what can we do, where do we go 
from here?
<P>
	As in everything we have to recognize the situation as it is, not 
as we would wish it to be. We have to recognize both sides of the 
issue; those who will receive the benefits of this agreement, and 
also those who are going to be paying the bills. Because we are 
all, as it was mentioned earlier by an hon. colleague, and we 
have to make it work. If it is not good for both sides it will not be 
good for either.
<P>
	Aboriginal Canadians comprise about 5 per cent of the 
population, and yet aboriginal Canadians are over-represented 
in every statistic that speaks to failure in our society and they are 
under represented in most statistics that represent success. This 
was so eloquently put across to all of us by the hon. member for 
Churchill when he talked about his experiences. We know this, it 
is not something we are debating at all.
<P>
	How did this unholy circumstance happen? Did it happen by 
accident? I submit it did not. It happened because our 
forefathers chose not to accept the aboriginals as brother human 
beings, equal in every respect, in human rights and in dignity. 
Instead, aboriginal Canadians were treated as innocents, they 
were in need of the benevolent protection of the state. 
Aboriginal Canadians were herded on to reserves, isolated from 
the world, out of sight and out of mind. That has largely been the 
situation for many years, one of benevolent ignorance, ``let's 
not pay attention to it and it won't be a problem''.
<P>
	It does not matter whether the intention was good or evil. The 
result today is the circumstance that aboriginal people largely 
endure, a circumstance in many respects no better than South 
Africa's discredited system of apartheid, so deservedly 
denounced in all the civilized world. Aas we debate today, free 
elections are under way in South Africa. Another nail is being 
driven into the  coffin of the marginalization of indigenous 
peoples around the world. South Africans should and must be 
congratulated for this giant leap forward and that indeed is a 
giant leap forward for mankind.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	However, I must get back to Bill C-16, the comprehensive 
land claims settlement of the Sahtu Dene and Metis. How would 
the bill lead to a better way of life for those involved and will 
this settlement lead to self-sufficiency, pride, self-respect and 
self-confidence of the Sahtu Dene as a people? That is the 
question. If what we are talking about would lead to 
self-respect, pride, self-confidence and self-sufficiency, then it 
would be a very small price to pay. It is what we all want to 
achieve. It is where we want to be at the end of the day.
<P>
	Unfortunately I think the answer is a qualified no. I do not 
know if it is going to achieve the noble objectives which are 
envisioned for it. While there are aspects of the bill my 
colleagues have already questioned, I need to point out that 
16,000 square miles is an awful lot of land for just 2,200 people, 
not to mention $130 million over 15 years.
<P>
	Why do the Sahtu Dene need so much land and why does the 
government pay them so much money, while at the same time 
they are still entitled to all the benefits all other status Indians 
have today or may receive in the future?
<P>
	Sixteen thousand square miles is a lot of land. However keep 
in mind that over much of the year it is covered with ice and 
snow. Also keep in mind there really are not a whole lot of 
people up there and the traditional way of life for the Sahtu Dene 
is trapping, hunting and fishing. Not a whole lot of people are 
trying to get into that land either, except to explore and get at the 
resources and we still have that opportunity.
<P>
	As I understand it the Sahtu Dene will be the custodians of the 
land. We should not make any mistake. The land will be theirs in 
fee simple. However, except for about 700 square miles all 
Canadians will have access, with permission where possible, 
provided they do not harm the land or destroy the environment.
<P>
	We can look at the immense amount of land and look at the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis because there will not be any reserves. 
This is all settlement land. We can look at it as a big national 
park but the park rangers are the traditional inhabitants, the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis. While they will be getting the land in fee 
simple, they do not own the resources of the vast majority of the 
land. They own the resources of about 700 square miles. That is 
an important consideration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3469"> 3469 </A></B>
<P>
	However, if resources are found in any of that land, they will 
via royalties be able to participate in the profit. The money, $75 
million to be paid out over 15 years, is intended to help develop 
a commercial infrastructure and is paid to the band council. 
With the money they can set up hunting lodges-if handguns 
or rifles are not banned-and with fishing and guiding try to 
get some tourist trade going.
<P>
	The idea of the Sahtu Dene is to participate, to be doing 
something, rather than sitting back and for this they are to be 
recognized and congratulated.
<P>
	The reality is that we, the Government of Canada, are going to 
pay out $75 million over 15 years. The money is not going to 
disappear. It will be recycled through the band to the 
community. I think that financial commitment may turn out to 
be a mistake and this is the primary reason why I have a problem 
with the bill. Remember it is in addition to any existing 
entitlements.
<P>
	In my opinion the Sahtu Dene would be well served if their 
commercial activities had to undergo the same checks and 
balances as any other commercial venture anywhere else in 
Canada. The band council could consider a system of guarantees 
but the focus should be to develop entrepreneurs who would 
repay their stake and be accountable for use of the money. 
However the most important consideration is: Will the 
agreement lead to self-sufficiency? Will this get people off 
social assistance and into the mainstream of Canadian life?
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Unless the entrepreneurs in the Sahtu Dene nation have 
obligations, they are not going to be able to develop skills as 
entrepreneurs that will allow them to become part of 
mainstream life. All of us exist in a competitive society and we 
cannot take ourselves out of it. If we are going to get into 
business, we are into business. We cannot be half in and half out. 
Otherwise it will be a black hole in which we will be throwing 
more and more money.
<P>
	I think, though, it could be but only if the land settlement and 
cash payment are one-time deals. That is why the agreement is 
so very important. In my opinion the agreement will set the 
stage for future agreements to be negotiated across the country 
in the months and years ahead.
<P>
	Most Canadians want to do the right thing by our aboriginal 
brothers. Most Canadians feel a collective sense of 
embarrassment over the condition and situation of many 
aboriginal Canadians. We will not improve their situation by 
creating still more dependence and throwing still more money at 
the problem. Therefore this would be a much better agreement if 
the Sahtu Dene and Metis were to receive the benefit of the 
agreement or their traditional entitlements as agreed, but not 
both.
<P>
	That is a fairly major change. They would receive the benefits 
of the agreement or their traditional entitlements, but not both. 
The way it is set up today,  they would receive all their 
traditional benefits plus all the benefits that accrue to them 
under the agreement.
<P>
	There are only 982 people to participate in this. How will that 
do anything to promote self-sufficiency? We must remember 
that when the settlement is done the Sahtu Dene will get the 
benefit of the royalties of resources on the land. Those royalties 
would today give them $200,000. How does anyone know what 
might be found there in the future?
<P>
	By accepting this land settlement and the royalties that come 
with it as well as the cash settlements, the Sahtu Dene should 
also accept the same rights, freedoms and obligations of any 
other Canadian in any other part of the country. That is the only 
road that leads to self-sufficiency, self-respect and dignity.
<P>
	Continued dependence generation after generation leads to 
exactly what we do not want whether the recipients are 
aboriginal or not. This settlement offers at the very minimum 
hope of a better future for the Sahtu Dene and Metis. I am 
concerned that the agreement sets a bad precedence because it 
does not regulate the use of the cash payment. The land 
settlement is absolutely enormous. It is not clear if there is a 
provision to make changes in the agreement if it is subsequently 
seen to be in need of correction. The agreement is entrenched in 
the Constitution under section 35 because the Sahtu Dene are 
already covered under treaty 11.
<P>
	Another consideration has to be the implementation of 
aboriginal self-government. It is my opinion the Sahtu Dene 
will be responsible in implementing a combination of band 
council and municipal government. We have to face it that in 
this circumstance there are only about 2,800 people in the entire 
16,000 square kilometres and they are mostly concentrated in a 
few communities.
<P>
	Finally the agreement will be entrenched in the Constitution. 
Therefore I am of the opinion that the charter rights would 
prevail as the law of the land despite any future self-government 
negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member who just spoke was a businessman in his 
previous life. Has he looked at the agreement from the 
standpoint of the new bureaucracy, how it would affect doing 
future business and how it would affect existing businesses 
within the settlement area?
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I have not looked at it 
carefully from that perspective. I contacted Mr. George Cleary, 
president of the Sahtu Tribal Council, and talked to him about 
this settlement. He seemed in conversation to be very concerned 
that whatever was done on both sides of the table be done right 
and be done in a responsible manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3470"> 3470 </A></B>
<P>
	There are provisions in the agreement to set up an enormous 
level of bureaucracy. I believe there are seven, eight or as many 
as nine other bureaucracies. He was very clear in saying they 
understand the potential for problem there and would be very 
cautious to ensure that did not happen by perhaps having people 
wearing two or three different hats at one time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my caucus colleague from Edmonton. I appreciate 
and understand his concern about the size of the grant of funds.
<P>
	What about inherent self-government and how that will 
interface? Perhaps he has an idea of how inherent 
self-government could be negotiated on the reserves within this 
large land area and how that would interface with the laws of the 
rest of Canada. Does he see any potential conflicts there? Should 
this be negotiated now before we do the land settlements?
<P>
	He talked about precedent. That is something they did not 
mention. I would like to know as a businessman how he would 
be negotiating this deal from that point of view.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that 
entirely unexpected question.
<P>
	The implementation of self-government in this particular 
circumstance will be very different from the implementation of 
self-government in other circumstances. This is an enormous 
area with relatively few people who are by and large involved in 
a traditional lifestyle, with the exception that they particularly 
want to get more involved in oil and gas exploration. 
Self-government in this particular model would be one that 
would be more municipal; it is envisioned as being more 
municipal than it would be federal.
<P>
	Something we would want to keep in mind in this whole 
self-government consideration is that if 5 per cent of Canadians 
are of aboriginal ancestry, and yet something like 40 or 50 per 
cent of Canadians in jail are of aboriginal ancestry, then 
somewhere along the line we have gone horribly wrong. If we 
need to make a leap of faith to try to right that wrong then it is 
incumbent on us to do exactly that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
would the hon. member make a distinction between land use 
control, oil and gas development and self-government as such? 
Does he see an intrinsic difference between them?
<P>
	Obviously oil and gas development would not be compatible 
with the structure and powers of a municipal set of governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the whole question of 
mineral exploration or exploration for anything the 
self-government model would have to go to a provincial model. 
In this particular case the people involved have indicated they 
would be flexible to do whatever is necessary and to do whatever 
is right. It is a learning process for everyone involved.
<P>
	The important thing in the whole aspect of self-government 
as I envision it is not to replace one with another but is to say: 
``Give us the opportunity to earn and to have our dignity by 
making our own laws. This is our land. We know our land. We 
know how to look after our land a lot better than you do. Give us 
the power to do so''.
<P>
	I think particularly in this agreement the Sahtu Dene have not 
tried to say this was their land exclusively. It is very clearly laid 
out in the agreement that with the exception of about 700 
kilometres it is open to anyone on permission. The caveat is not 
to destroy the environment or harm the land. In answer to the 
direct question it would not work as a municipal but it might be a 
combination of municipal and provincial. Who knows?
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to my hon. colleague's speech. He raised some 
questions that I might like to refer to and ask him one in return.
<P>
	He asked: ``Is this agreement fair?'' If this agreement were 
arrived at by an equal number of participants who wanted to 
make an agreement that would stand and serve their interests, 
those of Canada and those of the aboriginal people, it is probably 
fair.
<P>
	He said that 16,000 square kilometres was a whole lot of land. 
I agree but we do have a lot of land in the country. Then he said 
they were custodians. I suggest aboriginal people made less 
impression on this land in 36,000 years than we immigrants 
made in the past 200. In fact in the past 50 years we have done a 
pretty good job of changing the face of this land.
<P>
	It might be a good thing to return some custodianship to those 
who believe that the land suckles us all and that it is here for our 
children and grandchildren and not for our exploitation.
<P>
	He said that the Dene wanted to participate but that the money 
may turn out to be mistake. He asked: ``Will this agreement lead 
to self-sufficiency?'' All members of the House would like to 
say they hope very much that it will. Certainly what we have 
been doing up to now has not led to self-sufficiency. Maybe we 
had better try another approach to see whether it will work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not really hear much of a 
question in the comments, but I would pretty much echo 
virtually everything he said. We are basically on the same 
wavelength.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will admit that I am not an expert on native affairs, land claim 
settlements or treaties that were signed years ago. However 
because I am the only Reform member from Manitoba, and 
Manitoba being probably a model of self-government for the 
rest of Canada, I would like to point out a few things that could 
have some effect on self-government for Manitoba which are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3471"> 3471 </A></B>
<P>
kind of laid down in the guidelines in the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
bill.
<P>
	Through the agreement the government, as far as I am 
concerned, has shirked the wider public interest in dealing with 
aboriginal land claims. North of 60, which is the Northwest 
Territories and Yukon, comprises 40 per cent of the land mass of 
Canada. Ownership up to now has been with the federal 
government, which should control it in the best interest of all 
Canadians. It would appear however that the government like 
the one before it is more concerned with being perceived as 
politically correct than it is in administering the land in the best 
interest of all.
<P>
	The people in this part of the country have seen four major 
territorial agreements. There have been four massive land claim 
agreements since 1984. The Inuvialuit agreement covered the 
western Arctic. The Gwich'in agreement dealt with the 
Mackenzie River Delta and the Nunavut agreement covered the 
eastern Arctic. Now we have before us the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
agreement which covers the Great Bear Lake region. These 
agreements typically give vast amounts of land to a relatively 
small number of people. The land settlement agreement to Sahtu 
Dene and the Metis includes land equal to 28,000 square 
kilometres or about five times the area of Nova Scotia.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	There are, however, only about 1,755 beneficiaries. This 
works out to approximately 160 square kilometres per person, 
an area 10 kilometres by 16 kilometres per individual. If you 
take that into miles it is 6 by 10 miles which is 60 sections per 
individual, 36 sections in a township. Each individual will 
receive approximately two townships of property.
<P>
	These agreements give generous concessions to the 
recipients, including the constitutionally entrenched rights for 
aboriginal fishing, trapping and hunting forever. If any outside 
group wants to use this area in the future for something like 
forestry or the development of oil and gas it would have to go 
through several complex layers of regulations including native 
negotiations. This could seriously deter any potential investors 
from setting up shop in these areas.
<P>
	This bill will also provide cash payments of $130 million over 
15 years. This works out to approximately $74,000 per person. 
Also included in this agreement is a percentage of resource 
royalties from any gas, oil and mineral development. No 
indication is given as to how much money this would include.
<P>
	When combined with the agreements that preceded it we have 
an area of over half a million square kilometres. That is half the 
size of Ontario and it is granted to a population of 23,800 
individuals. These actions have taken this land with its untold 
resources out of the hands of all Canadians and put it into the 
hands of a few.
<P>
	This bill has special significance to me because I am the only 
Reform member of Parliament from Manitoba. The hon. 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
indicated that Manitoba will be a test case for aboriginal 
self-government. I am very concerned that this Sahtu Dene and 
Metis agreement sets a precedent for future Manitoba 
agreements. Manitoba has a native population of about 84,000, 
four times the amount that these four agreements include.
<P>
	I am not sure that this government can define everything that 
would be included in self-government but to put it in 
perspective, if the agreement that C-16 deals with is used as a 
model and the same concessions are eventually given to 
Manitoba's 84,000 natives, the government would have to agree 
to land claims of about 13.4 million square kilometres.
<P>
	Since Manitoba covers about 650,000 square kilometres this 
is obviously impossible. This would mean that the federal 
government would have to purchase another 20 Manitobas 
somewhere to settle the land claims. Maybe this would be a way 
of selling my farm land which I am told is very valuable, 
although it is hard to get the money out of it.
<P>
	Based on the funds that are given under the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis deal, about $6.2 billion is going to be handed over to the 
84,000 Metis. Where will the federal government get that type 
of money to settle all the land claims? What is the figure 
eventually going to be for the rest of the native people in 
Canada?
<P>
	One week after the Charlottetown accord referendum was 
defeated a leaked government document indicated that the 
government had few answers as to what self-government would 
entail. It had no idea of how much it would cost, where it would 
get the money or how many aboriginal groups would want to be a 
part of this.
<P>
	I am simply not confident that this present government has a 
better grasp on these matters. Yet, through the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis agreement the government will enter into a future 
agreement for self-government.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	As I stated, the model for self-government is not clear. Thee 
is a reference in appendix B of the land claims settlement 
agreement for local law making on a range of powers that are 
normally exercised federally or provincially. I would hope that 
the government could assure Canadians that this does not mean a 
new legislative law making body would be set up with a new 
judicial system all for the benefit of fewer than 2,000 people.
<P>
	As I mentioned, huge questions surround how Manitoba will 
become a testing ground for aboriginal self-government. The 
number of acres of land that will be set aside for Manitoba 
natives and the amount of money involved are two more of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3472"> 3472 </A></B>
<P>
obvious questions, but there are no answers because they do not 
make sense in this agreement.
<P>
	What will the related costs add up to, for example the cost of 
policing a judicial system? In appendix B of the Sahtu Dene and 
Metis agreement there is a framework that considers 
transferring not only administrative responsibilities but also 
legislative powers. The extent to which this applies in any 
self-government initiative remains to be determined in future 
negotiations.
<P>
	This leads to a number of questions. Would this include a 
special and separate native police force? Who will be 
responsible for the hiring and training of such a police force? 
Who would be responsible for the incredible costs involved?
<P>
	There is also the question of whether the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms would apply to any self-government arrangement 
negotiated in accordance with this agreement. That is a question 
that is not answered in this agreement.
<P>
	A very questionable aspect to this agreement is the additional 
layer of bureaucracy it creates to administer the land, the water, 
the resource and the wildlife provisions. Renewable resource 
councils will be established by each community. A renewable 
resource board will be created by the government. Sahtu Dene 
and Metis will make up half the membership on this board. An 
arbitration panel will be formed to settle disputes relating to this 
agreement without going to court. A land use planning board and 
a land and water board will each be set up, with 50 per cent 
membership for the Sahtu Dene and Metis.
<P>
	There will also be an environmental impact review board and 
a surface rights board. Together with an expected act on the 
Mackenzie Valley resource management, this agreement will 
give rise to a whole new layer of bureaucracy.
<P>
	Who will pay the salaries and expenses of the members on this 
new layer of government? Are we just training the Sahtu Dene 
and the Metis to become bureaucrats? Currently all of these 
functions are performed by either the department of Indian and 
northern affairs or the government of the Northwest Territories. 
I see no commitment to phase out these current boards. I wonder 
if they will continue to exist even though their jobs have been 
taken over by someone else.
<P>
	The department of Indian affairs has a budget of about $5 
billion and has a staff of 3,400 people. In this year's estimates 
salaries and contributions to employee plans amount to $134.4 
million. This works out to an average salary of approximately 
$40,000. Will this department with a huge budget and a large 
staff continue to exist as we set up another bureaucracy?
<P>
	This land of course will have roads, bridges and similar 
infrastructure that will have to be built and maintained. 
Presumably this will be the responsibility of the new native 
administration. Will it still be federal funds that will be applied 
for?
<P>
	I think it is worth mentioning that health care under this 
agreement will remain unchanged. It will still be administered 
by the federal government. As I can expect that self-government 
will be introduced into Manitoba, this is of concern to my 
constituents. In the report to the Manitoba standing committee 
on medical manpower concerning the year 1991-92, I learned 
that the total health care service expenditure per capita for 
natives was much higher than for the rest of the province. In my 
own area of the province, which includes Morden and Steinbach, 
the average cost was about $140 per person. In Winnipeg it was 
about $200 per person. The Manitoba average was $185 but on 
the southern native reserve it was $260 per person. One doctor 
told me that half the people on the native reserve are afflicted 
with diabetes-how sad. It is of real concern to the other people 
in that area that these problems get corrected and how that will 
be accomplished.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	It is similar when we look at the average expenditure for each 
hospital visit. For towns like Winkler and Steinbach the cost was 
about $23 per visit which was about the same as the Winnipeg 
and Manitoba average, but for the reserve natives, the average 
cost was $50, more than twice as much.
<P>
	Clearly this indicates that there are special health care 
requirements for Manitoba's native population. It is a social 
issue because we should be looking at ways to improve their 
overall health but it is also a financial issue and I think it is 
important to realize that these costs will remain after these land 
claims are settled.
<P>
	Will there be any provision under self-government for natives 
to assume their own health care or will they depend on the 
federal system forever?
<P>
	The government has also announced its commitment to 
continue the northern food mail program which I think is a very 
important program. This program will cost about $14.1 million 
in 1994-95. I think it is important for Canadians to realize that 
these programs continue even after these agreements have been 
achieved. The Canadian taxpayer's responsibility to fund these 
programs does not disappear just because natives are being 
given new land rights and more control over their affairs.
<P>
	I wonder when the time comes for self-government in 
Manitoba what the government will do in the way of initiatives 
to improve the health of this segment of the population. I hope it 
will not ignore the problem and just agree to another wholesale 
giveaway of land and resources as it has done in the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3473"> 3473 </A></B>
<P>
	I think it is very important that we realize that not just the 
Metis and the native people but the white are responsible to 
correct some of these problems and they have to be dealt with 
and there have to be funds for it. Huge land claims will not deal 
with these health problems.
<P>
	In closing, I hope I have served to air some concerns and raise 
some very important questions regarding Bill C-16. The 
implications are very far reaching and it is very troubling that 
some of the more important questions seem to be without 
answers.
<P>
	As a Manitoba member of Parliament I hope that when the 
time comes for any self-government or land claim agreement in 
my own province it is more well thought out than this one is. The 
current concept of self-government is so ill-defined and open 
minded there are serious implications to everyone involved, not 
the least of whom is the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	A large percentage of native bands in Manitoba are millions 
of dollars in debt because of mismanagement and corruption. By 
moving toward self-government are we going to clear ourselves 
out of this indescribable mess created by Indian and Northern 
Affairs, or will it simply make the situation worse?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it always amazes me when members talk, as the 
previous speaker just did, about giving away land. It seems to 
me incredibly naive to say that the government gives away land. 
After all, I cannot describe well enough what has happened to 
the land that we now call crown land or Her Majesty's land or 
whatever the case may be.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The member talks about the large size of the land that has been 
given. He compares it to how Manitoba would fare if it had a 
similar type of land claim in that regard.
<P>
	We have to remember that the boundaries were not set down 
by the aboriginal people. As far as the aboriginal people are 
concerned those are artificial boundaries when they talk about 
their land.
<P>
	The aboriginal people, the Dene and the Inuit of the 
Northwest Territories, the Denesuline from Manitoba and the 
people from Prince Albert did not sit down and say: ``Okay, here 
is Manitoba, here is Saskatchewan and here is the Northwest 
Territories''. It was imposed on them. As far as they were 
concerned they had some boundaries but not necessarily defined 
when they hunted and survived around that area.
<P>
	When the member talks about how large the land is in ratio to 
if they tried to do that with Manitoba, that is not an applicable 
question.
<P>
	The hon member talks about how self-government is 
undefined. I go back to a response I made some weeks ago about 
self-government.
<P>
	When the British parliamentary system was being set up here 
who asked the aboriginal people of Canada? ``We are going to 
set up a government. We are going to set up the Parliament of 
Canada, but you do not have a choice. You are just going to have 
to go along with it''. That is basically what happened. We did not 
have a role in defining how the system of government was going 
to be set up in our land.
<P>
	There has to be some understanding and I am sure the 
understanding is there. It is just being chosen to be ignored.
<P>
	We talk about the bureaucracy which is going to be set up. In 
the Nunavut area I hope that the bureaucracy is going to be 
comprised of a large number of Inuit in our area. Hopefully the 
same will be true in the western Arctic, and there will be a large 
number of Dene within the bureaucracy.
<P>
	In order to save time and money in dealing with issues we 
want a bureaucracy and a government sensitive to the people 
being served. After all the bureaucracy is there to serve the 
people. Even though sometimes the bureaucrats seem to think it 
is the other way around, that is the way it is supposed to be.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not understand that this is setting up a 
system or settling claims which are long overdue? The hon. 
member asks whether the aboriginal people will be paying for 
their own medical care and so on. He talks about the food-mail 
program which he says is a good one and I agree. However that 
subsidy cannot be taken away from the people it presently serves 
when in large part those people have the least earning power.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	In some cases they are paying $4 for a loaf of bread, $4 for a 
dozen eggs, $5 for a litre of milk. They regard apples and 
oranges and other fruit as treats rather than a nutritional part of 
their diet.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not think this is the settling of some 
claims which has been long overdue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those comments 
from the hon. member.
<P>
	As I said, I am not that familiar with the history of the native 
people but when I read the history books, it seems to me the 
native people were immigrants at one time too. They did come to 
Canada from the Soviet Union across the Bering Strait. North 
America was settled to some extent by them. I do not know who 
was replaced.
<P>
	I can also tell the hon. member that I stood on the ruins of 
Chichén Itza. That was a Mayan civilization which totally 
disappeared from North America before there was any white 
man around. It was because agriculture failed in that area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3474"> 3474 </A></B>
<P>
	I can also tell the hon. member that my forefathers came to 
this country and bought a quarter of land for $10. After 100 
years and having cut down every tree to provide food for this 
nation, they have lost everything. I buried three of my 
neighbours who committed suicide just like the hon. member 
explains because the system we have today took away from 
them what they had worked for, just like their people have done.
<P>
	This land has been given to us by our creator. We should use it 
for the benefit of all people. We cannot totally disengage 
ourselves from the kind of situation where we want to try to grab 
more for this person or more for that person.
<P>
	We have to realize that problems were here before the white 
man came. I am just wondering what the natives would be like 
today if it had not been white men who defended these borders 
against the communist regime in the Soviet Union.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to talk to some of the native people at 
Flin Flon or Pine Falls recently. I listened to their problems. We 
have made a lot of problems but we have also done some good 
for this country. I wish that was acknowledged once in a while.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think we are here to 
debate hypothetical questions. That is a totally hypothetical 
question.
<P>
	I suspect if Christopher Columbus had not come over, North 
America would be a lot more cleaner place to live. I would hate 
to think if not the aboriginal people but the people whose 
forefathers came first, what state of affairs the aboriginal people 
would be in. I cannot imagine the despair we would be in.
<P>
	However I acknowledge what the hon. member has stated, 
that he is ignorant about the aboriginal issue. I accept part of his 
comments. Ignorance is bliss.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am just wondering. Do we then 
say that our history books are full of lies and there is no truth in 
that when I read about the 1400s and 1500s of how native people 
in this area were fighting among themselves? Whole nations 
were wiped out. People starved to death because of famines. Is 
that all a myth? Did the white man create that in Europe before 
he was even here? Is our history that false? Should we rewrite 
our history books?
<P>
	What would the hon. member suggest? Does the hon. member 
want to take the facts or do we want to work on as he said, 
hypothetical questions, solutions or answers? We have to be 
honest about this issue. We have to try to resolve that, not just 
for the native issues or their grievances but there are also 
grievances on the other side.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	I think if we want this country to survive we have to come to a 
realization that this is a joint problem and we have to work 
together to solve it or else we will destroy ourselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask my colleague what he thinks of the land tenure system that 
has been put in place from the beginning with the earlier settlers, 
those who settled this land and stayed put versus what those 
settlers may have found here as a group of people not necessarily 
staying on the land, and did that actually help develop this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, after hearing the hon. member 
speak, I do not know how to respond to that. I always thought 
that we as a people who developed a country should have some 
respect or some benefits from it.
<P>
	My forefathers were driven from Prussia to the Soviet Union. 
They lost all their land and came over to Canada and started over 
again. Maybe it is just natural for us to be on the losing side all 
the time. Maybe it is the other side that should always win. I also 
have feelings and needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to preface my comments by saying that there is a 
legitimacy about the comments that the Reform Party members 
are making in this debate.
<P>
	I am honoured to be here. I am honoured to participate in this 
debate and express concerns and questions of my constituents.
<P>
	Far too many aboriginal people struggle daily with the 
economic and social conditions that are overwhelming and 
tragic. Few Canadians would argue that their standard of living 
is acceptable. For far too long aboriginal people and the state of 
their affairs were out of sight of most Canadians. However, as 
Canadian people become increasingly aware of what life on 
reserves has meant in terms of humiliation and loss, there is a 
justifiable reaction. Let us remedy the situation. Let us make it 
right. There is a will for this to happen.
<P>
	Some people are saying there is no way that we can move too 
quickly or do too much to remedy the unacceptable state of 
aboriginal affairs. I have heard non-aboriginal people in their 
enthusiasm and guilt say things like it is the white man's turn to 
live on the reserves with no vote and do what the department of 
Indian affairs tells him.
<P>
	In my mind, however, what we must accomplish is somewhat 
less reactionary. I believe that what we should be doing is 
bringing down the barriers and co-operatively opening up the 
way for aboriginal people to come as far into the mainstream of 
Canadian life as they individually choose to come.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3475"> 3475 </A></B>
<P>
	I have heard aboriginal people respond to this guilt of the 
white man. In very natural human terms aboriginal people are 
prepared to take whatever the government will give up; money, 
land, special rights. Aboriginal leaders are justifiably proud 
that they have learned how to get money out of the government, 
as one western chief described it. They have learned that in the 
present climate of political correctness the government has 
little if any will to deny aboriginal demands.
<P>
	As an example of this the media reported recently that the 
minister of aboriginal affairs was handed a memorandum of 
understanding by Chief Phil Fontaine and after quickly reading 
the memorandum, without a word of clarification or 
consultation and to the surprise of everyone in the room, the 
minister took out his pen and signed it. All involved were so 
surprised at the minister's action, to quote the reporter, you 
could have heard a pin drop.
<P>
	I see the Sahtu Dene and Metis comprehensive land claim 
agreement that we are debating today in much the same light; a 
willingness to give to the Sahtu Dene and Metis whatever is 
demanded. Once again there is a willingness to relinquish large 
tracts of land, water, surface and subsurface rights with little 
public consultation south of 60. There is also the unanswered 
question of the federal government's legal ability to enter into 
such an agreement without at least consulting the provincial 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I am not suggesting that past wrongs and present day 
inequities should not be addressed. They must be addressed. But 
inasmuch as there are now no secrets about what happened on 
the reserves and in the residential schools, by the same token 
neither should there be any secrets about what the government 
of the day does behind closed doors.
<P>
	So far the Sahtu Dene and Metis agreement has been made 
behind closed doors with little public consultation. When the 
facts become known, as surely they will, what will be the 
reaction of mainstream Canadians? They will feel they have 
been deceived by the government. Will their reaction stall and 
delay and even prevent the kind of programs that fair-minded 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals alike have been struggling to 
achieve? Will the reaction move against and stifle the 
agreement?
<P>
	Bridges can and should be built between aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people. These bridges need to be built for 
two-way traffic. Cultural enrichment can cross these bridges in 
both directions for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	In the mosaic of cultures that is being created in Canada, 
every culture can receive as well as contribute to the Canadian 
mosaic. I am not confusing this concept with that of the melting 
pot of cultures. What I am insisting on is that we have as an 
ultimate objective a unity within Canada that dynamically 
includes all  cultures with no benefit or loss of benefit based on 
cultures-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Hindsight is 20-20, as we 
all know. I suppose that at 6.25 when the member for 
Cariboo-Chilcotin began his intervention I could have asked 
the House if it wished me to see the clock as being 6.30. 
However, I did not.
<P>
	I wonder if there would be unanimous consent to allow the 
member to complete his intervention. We would not have 
questions or comments. Maybe the member could give us some 
indication of how much longer he would require because I hate 
to cut people off half way through.
<P>
	I am in the hands of the House. The hon. member could help us 
possibly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> I would need about another 15 minutes to 
complete my intervention, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Would there be 
unanimous consent or should we go to the late show and the 
member will have to complete his intervention when we resume 
debate on the bill?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I must proceed then to the 
orders of the House.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MILDAVIESHIPBUILDING">MIL DAVIE SHIPBUILDING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 
12, I informed the Speaker of the House that the Minister of 
Industry had still not recommended to the government to make 
decisions on two issues affecting the MIL Davie shipyard in 
Lauzon, namely the Magdalen Islands ferry and the 
multifunctional smart ship project.
<P>
	I added that, if the government still believed in employment, 
it had no reason not to make an immediate decision on the future 
of this shipyard. I also informed the House that, with every 
passing day, government inaction threatened the survival of the 
biggest private business in the Quebec City region.
<P>
	The employers, employees and people concerned are not at all 
satisfied with the answers then given by the Minister of Industry 
to these two questions. We cannot be satisfied with a stock 
answer such as the one we received. We agree that, as the 
custodian of public funds, the government must make decisions 
that are in the best interest of taxpayers, but it must still make 
them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3476"> 3476 </A></B>
<P>
	In the last election campaign, all local stakeholders told the 
parties now forming the government and the Opposition how 
important it was to react rapidly in the MIL Davie case because 
failure to do so could lead to economic disaster, namely the 
closure of the MIL Davie shipyard. The shipyard is now in a 
state of panic as no contract has been or is waiting to be signed.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	At this time last year, 3,000 employees were working. There 
are now 2,000 workers but this number will go down to 300 in 
December if the government does not assume its responsibilities 
right away.
<P>
	As you can appreciate, people are ready to use any means to 
ensure their survival. They do not intend to wait for the 
provincial election to be called without the federal government 
taking a firm stand. All too often, campaigning politicians 
promised the shipyard it would be awarded contracts that never 
materialized after the election.
<P>
	Today I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry to give me a definite answer on the government 
position in this case, not on a whim but because the situation is 
serious and urgent. That is also the reason why, Mr. Speaker, you 
allowed me to address this House tonight pursuant to Standing 
Order 37(3).
<P>
	People on both shores of the Quebec City region who work in 
the private sector are dependent on two major industries: pulp 
and paper and shipbuilding.
<P>
	The pulp and paper industry is already facing serious 
difficulties in trying to apply certain federal environmental 
standards but, Mr. Speaker, if you allow me, I will bring this 
thorny problem to the attention of the House a little later.
<P>
	The other industry supporting 3,000 employees has no 
contracts left and is about to close its doors. I would like the 
government to be aware of the major problems that would be 
created by its failure to take immediate action. Three thousand 
families represent about 10,000 people who will live on 
unemployment insurance for a while. The following year, these 
10,000 people will be forced to live on welfare with all the 
psychological problems brought on by this situation. These 
psychological problems will lead to a significant increase in 
health-care costs paid in part by the federal government.
<P>
	The government, I am sure, analyzed all these repercussions 
and I fervently hope that my colleague, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Industry, is now in a position to give us 
the good news right now, namely that MIL Davie of Lauzon has 
been awarded the contract for building the Magdalen Islands 
ferry as well as the smart ship prototype so that it can survive for 
the next few years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Industry has asked me to comment on the issue 
raised by the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans on April 12 and I am sure 
he will get a clear answer as he requested.
<P>
	The future of MIL Davie and its ability to generate 
meaningful long-term employment is of great importance to 
this government and I know how important it is for the 
population of the Quebec region.
<P>
	With the completion later this year of the Canadian patrol 
frigate and trump contracts at MIL Davie the government will 
discuss the future of the shipyard with its owner, the province of 
Quebec. As a basis for the discussion, the province of Quebec is 
assessing a corporate business plan identifying the direction the 
company will take to ensure its future success.
<P>
	I understand that the provincial government has not approved 
the draft plan and the MIL Davie business plan has not been 
presented to the federal government at this time.
<P>
	Unsolicited proposals have been made by MIL Davie for two 
federal construction contracts. The first is a contract for the 
replacement of the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> ferry operating 
between the Magdalen Islands and P.E.I. The second is for a 
multifunctional vessel or smart ship for the Department of 
National Defence.
<P>
	In the case of the ferry my colleague, the Minister of 
Transport, is evaluating the options available to him in the 
context of limited budget resources, other Canadian shipyards 
and the provision of timely and effective ferry service.
<P>
	Regarding construction of the smart ship, the Minister of 
National Defence will be able to assess future naval 
requirements following the completion of the defence policy 
review that the member knows is going on at present.
<P>
	In conclusion the long term future of MIL Davie and the 
well-being of its workers and the community is important to this 
government. As my colleague the Minister of Industry has said 
many times, we are committed to working with the yard's owner, 
the province of Quebec in a co-operative fashion.

concerning bilingualism.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3477"> 3477 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Part of his response to one of the questions was as follows, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It seeks to protect its rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Prime Minister was referring to Canada's francophone 
and Acadian community.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, it also deplores the fact that some francophones like the Parti 
Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois members are the ones who create the most serious 
problems for it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, statements like this call for an apology or, at the 
very least, some serious explanations. Here is how I see these 
statements and why I find them exceedingly disagreeable. To 
begin with, the rights of Canada's francophone and Acadian 
communities are not dependent on Quebec. These communities 
enjoy them outright. They enjoy these rights because of what 
they are. Moreover, these rights are entrenched in the 
Constitution and in the Charter.
<P>
	Whether Quebec is or is not part of the Canadian 
confederation does not take anything away from the fact that 
these rights are legitimately theirs. The Prime Minister seemed 
to be saying that, if Quebec were no longer around, either the 
Liberal government could not be counted on to ensure 
compliance with the Constitution or the Charter, or Canadians 
would not normally be inclined to uphold their Constitution and 
Charter.
<P>
	Are we to understand then that the government wants to hold 
Quebec accountable for the future to which Canada's 
francophone and Acadian communities are entitled? Are we to 
understand that the government wants to hold Quebec 
accountable for the way in which other Canadians from coast to 
coast will treat their francophone and Acadian communities?
<P>
	I hope that this was not what the Prime Minister was hinting 
at. Therefore, I think some explanations are in order. In short, 
either the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Liberal government, 
has no intention, in Quebec's absence, of ensuring compliance 
with the Constitution or, the Prime Minister believes that, in 
Quebec's absence, Canadians from coast to coast will not have 
the will, determination or sense of fair-play to ensure 
compliance with the Constitution and the Charter.
<P>
	Which is it? Or should these words never have been spoken in 
the first place?
<P>
	Not only am I waiting for an answer, Mr. Speaker, so too, I 
have no doubt, are tens of thousands of other people. There are 
900,000 anglophones in Quebec and that province has never 
once said that it would treat them any other way but very fairly. 
There are 960,000 francophones in the rest of the country, 
60,000 more than there are anglophones in Quebec, and they are 
waiting for an answer now.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that 
nearly a million francophones in Canada live outside  Quebec 
and their number has increased by 50,000 since 1971. While the 
proportion of francophones outside Quebec has diminished 
during the same period, this is mainly due to the growing 
proportion of Canadians of diverse origins who came to our 
country during that period.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the government recognizes the particular 
challenges facing francophones outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member opposite uses statistics on the situation of 
francophone communities outside Quebec to make this House 
believe that these people will soon disappear and that their 
disappearance would end our policy on official languages 
throughout Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	French speaking Canadians living outside Quebec represent 
about 20 per cent of the total francophone population of Canada. 
Through government action there has been notable progress in 
recent years, particularly in terms of greater access in all 
provinces to French language schooling.
<P>
	For example, there are now over 185,000 young Canadians in 
700 French language elementary and secondary schools outside 
Quebec and in 45 colleges and universities which give 
instruction fully or partially in French.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member should keep in mind that a community's 
vitality is measured by its entrepreneurship spirit and its sense 
of identity and not only by statistics.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 25 last, I rose in this House to put a question to the 
Minister of Finance on the Sainte-Marguerite project.
<P>
	At that time, all was set for construction to start, except that 
one permit was missing. It so happens that it was to be issued by 
the federal government. Already struggling with 
unemployment, the Sept-Îles region, in Quebec, was faced with 
job creation efforts being paralysed by the federal government's 
dilatoriness.
<P>
	To a question as to when the federal government was going to 
allow Hydro-Québec to go ahead with this project, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport replied 
that the environment had to be protected. I agree. However, that 
is putting a bit too much on the back of the environment, seeing 
that the BAPE report was accepted on February 24. If the idea is 
to harmonize federal and provincial standards, why is the 
Quebec report not enough?
<P>
	As for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, he took that 
opportunity to emphasize what a great achievement this 
agreement between his government and the Quebec government 
was. He explained that the permit in question was a complex and 
was detailed document and that a few more pieces of 
information were needed before it could be issued, indicating in 
passing that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3478"> 3478 </A></B>
<P>
the  missing information was to be supplied by Quebec. In other 
words, it was Quebec's fault if the federal government could not 
issue the permit. So much for the great example of 
co-operation!
<P>
	In the end, all that time was wasted for nothing because the 
government allowed construction to start without the famous 
permit. I am happy that it got under way so that the people from 
the Sept-Îles region can work. Let me elaborate on that. It is 
clear as day that the federal government allowed construction to 
start without permit just to score points with the electorate.
<P>
	It is clear and it reeks of electioneering when the Prime 
Minister of Canada tells the Premier of Quebec that he does not 
need his authorization. This whole thing is clearly ridiculous. It 
is clear, in particular, that no one is falling for the little game the 
Premier and the Prime Minister are playing.
<P>
	And they call this an excellent example of federal-provincial 
co-operation. The fact that the federal and provincial 
environmental standards are different has put a wrench in the 
works for Hydro-Quebec.
<P>
	We get along fine on paper, but when the time comes to take 
positive action, we hit a wall. When well-intentioned people try 
to find out where the blockage is, the process gets so 
cumbersome that they can hardly find an answer. My point, Mr. 
Speaker, is that the Sainte-Marguerite project incident is proof, 
once again, that the federal system is dead. For the people of 
Quebec, there is one level of government too many and the 
sooner we get rid of that one the better. Then Quebec will be able 
to develop to its full potential because all the tools it needs will 
be in its hands alone and Quebec will be the master of its destiny.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Transport has asked me to address the concerns 
expressed in the House over perceived delays in the granting of 
the necessary federal approval for Ste. Marguerite 3 hydro 
electric project.
<P>
	The construction of the project requires a permit under the 
Navigable Waters Protection Act, which is administered by the 
Department of Transport.
<P>
	The scope of the work required an environmental assessment. 
To that end the federal and provincial governments agreed to 
conduct a joint public panel.
<P>
	On March 28, 1994 the Department of Transport, on behalf of 
the federal government, made public the federal response to the 
Bureau d'audiences publique sur l'environnement, BAPE, panel 
report.
<P>
	The Department of Transport is moving expeditiously to 
complete its statutory responsibilities. Following the minister's 
February 24 announcement, departmental officials contacted 
the province and Hydro Quebec to explain the requirements for 
Navigable Waters Protection Act approval.
<P>
	In order to finalize the approval documents the Department of 
Transport will have to receive and approve the final detailed 
plans and drawings of the project. In accordance with the 
Navigable Waters Protection Act, Hydro Quebec must deposit 
these plans in a land registry office and advertise their project 
intentions in two local newspapers and the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and 
await 30 days prior to commencing any work which may 
interfere with navigation.
<P>
	To close, Hydro Quebec can and has, I believe, begun the road 
work for the project. There is certainly work that is not 
associated with the Navigable Waters Protection Act process 
with which they can proceed. Contrary to the comments of the 
hon. member for Frontenac, I believe the government 
commitment to both the protection of the environment and to job 
creation have been met.
<P>
	I might also remind the hon. member that not long ago the 
United Nations declared Canada the number one place on the 
planet where to live, measured against certain criteria and 
thanks to the co-operation of all provinces, territories and the 
federal government. He should take that to bed and sleep on it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.52 p.m.)
