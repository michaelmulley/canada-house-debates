on behalf of the constituents of Victoria-Haliburton who are

<P>
	This petition adds to the growing list of Canadians who are 
opposed to the killer cards which glorify serial killers and send a 
negative, violent message to the youth of our country.
<P>
	The petition calls upon the Parliament of Canada to amend the

and manufacture of killer cards in law and to advise producers of 
killer cards that their products, if destined for Canada, will be 
seized and destroyed.

[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 1-<B>Mr. Taylor:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the government's intention regarding the automated security systems 
planned for the Fort Battleford national historic park in Saskatchewan, what is 
the rationale for the conversion, and what tests have been done on the system 
under consideration to guarantee that it works?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> The 
government's intention is to install an automated security 
system at Fort Battleford national historic site. The system will 
be installed in five historic buildings, as well as the maintenance 
shop, administration office, visitor reception centre and storage 
garage by March 31, 1994.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2084"> 2084 </A></B>
<P>
	The rationale for the conversion is to effect an annual saving 
of approximately $51,000, as follows:
<P>
	1. An electronic security system was approved for Fort 
Battleford national historic site in the 1989 management plan.
<P>
	2. Once the security system was approved for 
implementation, the site's two security staff were redeployed to 
the visitor activities department with no loss of salary.
<P>
	3. The Corps of Commissionaires was contracted through a 
master standing offer to provide security services on an interim 
basis until completion of the installation of the electronic 
security system.
<P>
	4. The average annual operation and maintenance (O &amp; M) 
costs from April 1, 1990 until March 31, 1994 for the standing 
offer with the Corps of Commissionaires are $58,019 per year.
<P>
	5. One time installation costs for an automated security 
system are estimated at $60,000. Annual O &amp; M cost based on 
existing system are estimated at $5,000 per annum (maximum).
<P>
	A saving of approximately $51,000 will be realized annually, 
beginning April 1, 1994. In one year, installation costs will be 
recovered. Savings can be redirected as per the approved 
management plan.
<P>
	The highest criteria imposed on installation proposals were 
utilized: all hardware had to be CSA (Canadian Standards 
Association) or ULC (Underwriters Laboratories of Canada) 
approved; must meet the approval of the Dominion Fire 
Commissioner and Labour Canada; only systems presently 
installed in several businesses and government offices across 
the country are being entertained as viable; generally similar 
systems have been used successfully at other National Historic 
Sites.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question as enumerated by the 
parliamentary secretary has been answered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions 
be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall the remaining questions stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from March 9 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
day marks the first time in history that a Liberal has stood in this 
House to speak on behalf of the people of Beaches-Woodbine. I 
am proud to be that Liberal.
<P>
	As I campaigned door to door throughout last year's election, 
I promised the people of Beaches-Woodbine that we could 
have social justice and jobs. It did not have to come down to a 
choice of one over the other.
<P>
	The budget brought down by my esteemed colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, reflects very much my commitment to the 
people of Beaches-Woodbine. He has succeeded in creating a 
judicious balance between the need to put our financial house in 
order and the equally important need to ensure that Canada 
remains a truly just society.
<P>
	That hard to achieve balance is very important to the people of 
Beaches-Woodbine and to all Canadians.
<P>
	Our long lasting commitment to social justice is the hallmark 
of our society. It sets us apart from most nations. If members 
think that is an overstatement, ask the millions of men and 
women who left their own countries over the last several 
decades and made a deliberate choice to become Canadians. 
Their being here has helped to make Canada a vibrant, dynamic 
model of living together, a model for the entire world.
<P>
	Ours is a truly remarkable society and we must ensure 
throughout the nation-wide debate that is about to take place 
that we remain a truly just society of which we can all be proud.
<P>
	We do have to take all necessary steps to arrest the growth of 
the deficit, reduce it to a manageable level and put in place 
sound economic policies to create jobs. The budget brought 
down by the Minister of Finance is a major first step in that 
direction.
<P>
	The budget is, however, but one of several initiatives set in 
motion by the Liberal government. It is designed primarily to 
ensure that our financial house is put in order as quickly as is 
humanly possible.
<P>
	I am more concerned, however, about the social justice part of 
the equation, that which sets us apart as a great, caring nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2085"> 2085 </A></B>
<P>
	As we embark on the national debate about our social security 
systems, I find myself a little uncertain about the outcome.
<P>
	Because of the pressure that has been placed on the economy 
and the social safety net by the recession there appears to be an 
almost panic mentality that has taken place. Get on with it is 
what everyone seems to say.
<P>
	Because of my promise to the people of Beaches-Woodbine 
on social justice and jobs, I will do everything in my power to 
ensure that appropriate time is given and taken to ensure that the 
social safety net review is carried out in a worthwhile manner.
<P>
	There is a great deal of talk of the stress that social programs 
have put on the economy but we must also look at the stress that 
the economy has put on the social programs. Despite some of the 
holes in our safety net this held out very well despite the huge 
demands we have put on it.
<P>
	I believe that the social security system that we will need in 
the future should be one that can address the needs of Canadians 
from cradle to grave. It must be a system that is comprehensive, 
holistic in approach, completely accessible to all and flexible. 
People now are often falling between the programs.
<P>
	This may mean a guaranteed income supplement. We have 
had a form of guaranteed income supplement in this country for 
quite some time. The old age security system, unemployment 
insurance and the way we have used them in eastern Canada has 
been a form of that.
<P>
	We will have to make some fundamental choices, however. 
For instance, the labour market is changing with low value, 
short term and part time jobs on the increase. What choices will 
we make in the need for continuous upgrading of skills, the type 
of day care available and retirement planning?
<P>
	Apart from the real fact that the comprehensive child care 
program is essential, if we are to have a chance at succeeding 
with upgrading, retraining and development of programs I 
believe it is our collective responsibility to ensure that children 
are cared for. The physical and mental well-being of children 
will mean healthy and well adjusted adults.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Today's youth are tomorrow's leaders. I attended a youth 
conference in Toronto on Tuesday of this week. It was attended 
by some 200 young people from all walks of life. Some had 
received welfare and were now on the youth employment 
program. Some were university graduates out of work and some 
were single parents on social assistance. The one thing they all 
had in common was their desire to want to work and their 
concern that maybe we, the baby boomers, were not interested in 
their concerns, did not understand their plight and did not have a 
commitment to tackle the problems that they are facing.
<P>
	They made very insightful observations about the strengths 
and weaknesses of the current social assistance programs and 
their recommendations I thought were very practical and 
realistic. These are some of their statements:
<P>
	``Most kids decide what to do by grade 10. They either stay in 
school or they drop out. So why can we not start apprenticeship 
as a career choice at grade 10''. ``I was asked to move back home 
in order to receive employment and training assistance'', said 
another. ``I have not lived at home since I was 15, so why am I 
going to move back now''?
<P>
	Yet another: ``I had to drop out of my college program because 
student aid was not enough and welfare would not pay if I 
received student aid. I now owe $3,000 in student loans, but still 
do not have an education. I really want to be an interior 
decorator''.
<P>
	Grants for students should come back.
<P>
	They refer to themselves as the lost generation. They asked 
me if the government was really serious about addressing their 
needs. I said that if we did not do anything at this time and did 
not move quickly, we would be totally negligent and very stupid. 
They are the future of this country and we must meet their needs.
<P>
	Social programs might cost more than we would like at first, 
but in the long run we save. If a young person is working they 
pay taxes. They will be able to create other jobs as they build 
their own businesses.
<P>
	A comprehensive child care program allows parents to work 
and results in healthier children and we will save on further 
social costs.
<P>
	Finally, the cost of the delivery of the programs does not 
necessarily have to be as costly as it is today. If we use an 
integrative approach instead of a selective approach and utilize 
all existing infrastructures such as schools for child care, the 
voluntary sector, and developed one stop shopping for all three 
levels of government it might just save some money. Economic 
renewal does not have to be at the expense of social justice. In 
fact, I believe that a strong social justice system will aid 
economic development
<P>
	As I stated at the outset I am the first Liberal since 
confederation to stand in the House and represent the people of 
Beaches-Woodbine. And, yes, I do consider this an honour. 
The Beaches part of the riding's name derives from the fact that 
we have the best area of beach in metropolitan Toronto. Every 
summer and throughout the year thousands of people from 
outside the riding descend on the beaches and become honorary 
beachers for several hours of a day.
<P>
	Our international jazz festival attracts upwards of 60,000 
people, devotees of jazz across North America. The beach 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2086"> 2086 </A></B>
<P>
family festival reflects a devotion to family and community that 
makes the beaches such a great place to live.
<P>
	The Woodbine part of my riding's name takes up from the tree 
lined streets of the beach to Little India at Gerrard and Coxwell, 
the family run stores of the Danforth, the postcard perfect 
bungalows of the seniors in East York and the largely immigrant 
population high rise towers of Crescent Town. Does it not sound 
beautiful?
<P>
	Beaches-Woodbine is a truly diverse riding and being the 
member for that area is a rewarding and demanding challenge. 
We have no factories in Beaches-Woodbine, no company head 
offices despite a large number of small businesses. We are very 
much dependent on opportunities for jobs outside the riding. 
That is why it is very important to us to ensure that metro 
Toronto gets its fair share of the infrastructure program and all 
other programs for economic stimulus.
<P>
	As Toronto grows so does Beaches-Woodbine. You can be 
sure, Mr. Speaker, that I will avail myself of every opportunity 
to ensure that Toronto gets its fair share and makes its fair 
contribution to the growth and prospects of the whole country.
<P>
	It is the whole country that should be speaking in the House in 
the debate on the budget, the social security system, our 
defence, health care and other national issues. We simply cannot 
afford to pull back, to think only of our ridings and of our 
regions. Today more than ever before it is important that we 
speak as one, as one country, one nation, one great people.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to assure you that the people of 
Beaches-Woodbine will be well represented in national 
debate. We will be heard.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Congratulations to the member on 
what I take was her maiden speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to commend the hon. member opposite for the comments 
she made in her speech. Since we started this debate on the 
budget, I believe this is the first time we have heard a Liberal 
member who is so emphatic about social justice, who tells the 
government to take its time in carrying out the reforms it plans 
to make and to examine all sides of the question in order to 
create the kind of social justice-and I was particularly struck 
by this comment-that will guarantee a better future for our 
young people, and the hon. member is to be commended for 
saying so. Throughout her speech, she repeatedly referred to the 
future of our young people and the fact that they too will have to 
make a life for themselves. I am sure that many members of her 
party will be mindful of what she said in her speech, for the 
greater benefit of young people in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	I understand where the hon. member is coming from, because 
I have worked with teenagers for many years, and the problems 
you described and heard described by various people sound 
familiar. I must say, Madam, I am impressed.
<P>
	Before we finish, I would like to ask how you intend to 
persuade the Liberal caucus to share your views?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite 
for his kind comments.
<P>
	In my caucus there is very open discussion on these issues. We 
have embarked on something that is quite unusual. A standing 
committee of the House normally does not embark on public 
hearings prior to legislation or prior even to a proposal being put 
before the House. In fact we are doing that right now, talking to 
Canadians to hear their concerns about these issues.
<P>
	Once the proposals are presented to the House by the minister, 
which will be a discussion paper not yet legislation, we will 
again travel this country to discuss with every Canadian who 
wishes to talk with us. We will try to reach as broadly as we can 
to discuss those proposals and to share what kinds of ideas we 
want to share and to see what future we want to have.
<P>
	I will continue to fight and work within my own caucus. A lot 
of my colleagues agree with me. I do not have to work very hard. 
I have a tremendously strong and very committed caucus with 
regard to social justice. I do not think that is something we need 
to be concerned about too much.
<P>
	Once legislation is brought in at the end of the year at that 
point we will be able to consult on the legislation itself.
<P>
	To explain to members opposite, there will be plenty of time 
to be able not only to share ideas but to work out solutions, to 
adjust and to share them and discuss them again with Canadians. 
Certainly for my part I intend to hold two or three public 
consultations in my riding. Every member of the House can do 
the same. In fact I think they are being asked to do the same by 
the minister so that we have as broad a consultation on this issue 
as possible.
<P>
	Certainly the commitment that I have to social justice which 
is 20 years long is not going to diminish during this process but 
rather will increase.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as this is my first formal speech in the House of 
Commons I would like to begin by offering a message to my 
constituents of Annapolis Valley-Hants. I thank them for 
putting their trust in me to represent their views in Parliament. I 
consider it an honour 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2087"> 2087 </A></B>
<P>
and a privilege to have been elected to this position. Julia, 
Patrick, Kelly and I consider ourselves most fortunate to live in 
the valley where the warmth and generosity of our people 
enhance the natural beauty of our area.
<P>
	When my Liberal colleagues and I were elected to form the 
government last October, it was as a result of our commitment to 
jobs and long term economic growth. This budget is a first step 
in fulfilling the commitment and promise made at that time. It 
strikes a balance between economic renewal, social policy 
reform and deficit reduction, a balance that will provide the 
foundation for jobs and growth.
<P>
	This budget offers fundamental restructuring of our thrust to 
this balance so we can move from a passive system to an active 
one. The changes we are offering will cause some pain but this 
new active approach will bring on the creativity that is inherent 
in the people of my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants and of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I know there is a lot of unemployment in my riding and I feel 
very badly. It is easy for me to say this because I am fortunate; I 
have a job. However, I will commit my energies to be a part of 
the process that will create jobs in my riding.
<P>
	I recently had an opportunity to travel to CFB Greenwood and 
meet with the base commander and the defence staff. I have also 
had a chance to meet with the regular forces and reservists at 
Camp Aldershot. I am extremely impressed by the dedication, 
commitment and high levels of professionalism of these 
military personnel. While these centres have only been 
minimally affected by the budget, I will work to ensure that the 
military and civilian jobs at these bases remain secure over the 
long term.
<P>
	As the budget indicates, one of the most effective ways to 
encourage economic growth and jobs is through support of the 
small business sector. I have talked with many small business 
owners in my constituency who believe that the federal 
government can play a very active role in helping small business 
not only remain viable but grow and create new jobs. I am also 
working very closely with the local agricultural industry which 
is the backbone of small business in the community of 
Annapolis Valley-Hants. By working with this local advisory 
group we can best determine how the government and the 
agricultural sector can work together to create jobs.
<P>
	I have also in the past had the pleasure of working closely with 
first-rate institutions such as the Acadia University Centre for 
Small Business. Such centres are not only promoting local 
community networks but also provide valuable information 
services to help individuals get their ventures off the ground.
<P>
	According to a recent survey conducted by the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, a freeze or reduction in 
government payroll taxes was one of the most important 
conditions necessary for small business owners to hire more 
employees.
<P>
	We have listened. By rolling back unemployment insurance 
premiums for small business, we are providing these firms with 
incentives necessary to increase both investment and job 
creation. I applaud the Minister of Finance's announcement that 
we are moving ahead with programs such as the Canada 
investment fund, the Canadian technology network, and a 
commitment to work closely with banks to improve access to 
capital for small business.
<P>
	Aside from assisting small business, this budget has set the 
foundation for economic recovery through a number of 
important initiatives. First, the national infrastructure program 
is progressing rapidly. In Nova Scotia the federal contribution 
for this program over two years will be $69 million. Annapolis 
Valley-Hants is largely a rural riding and, having high quality 
physical infrastructure, it is imperative for the future economic 
viability of both the businesses and individuals who call this 
area their home.
<P>
	Organizations in my area have submitted several innovative 
proposals and I hope they will receive positive approval.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	Another major commitment we have made in this budget is 
the extension of the RRSP home buyers program. Prior to the 
budget I received many letters from the real estate companies 
and home builder associations in Annapolis Valley-Hants in 
support of this program. All of these letters indicated the 
housing industry will play a central role in Canada's economic 
recovery and that by promoting this program over the long term 
the government would be greatly assisted in this recovery.
<P>
	The budget also makes a $50 million a year commitment to 
the residential rehabilitation assistance program. This will 
further boost the housing construction industry and help create 
many jobs.
<P>
	The most important aspect of our commitment to economic 
restructuring however is our pledge to help individuals obtain 
the skills necessary to find meaningful jobs. It is my 
commitment to the people of Annapolis Valley-Hants that I 
will work tirelessly in this endeavour.
<P>
	By investing in programs such as the Canada youth service 
corps, the youth internship and apprenticeship programs, we 
will assist young Canadians in gaining the training and skills 
necessary for jobs for the long haul.
<P>
	I have received over a dozen phone calls in the last week from 
groups and individuals interested in putting forward proposals 
for the national youth service corps. I am committed to working 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2088"> 2088 </A></B>
<P>
closely with youth interest groups in the riding to assist them in 
getting involved and benefiting from these important programs.
<P>
	With respect to education and training I would like to take the 
opportunity to mention one program which is currently under 
way in my riding. It is a technology recycling program 
sponsored by a non-profit organization, Nova Knowledge, in 
conjunction with the federal government and a number of 
private sector organizations.
<P>
	The purpose of the program is to collect used computers from 
organizations planning to purchase newer technology. These 
computers then go into community colleges across the province 
and students refurbish and repair them for shipment to many 
Nova Scotia schools.
<P>
	I am proud to say that the province's first program is located 
in Annapolis Valley-Hants. Students at Kingstec Campus, 
Nova Scotia Community College in Kentville have refurbished 
more than 20 computers at this point in time which have gone to 
public schools. These are the types of innovative programs this 
government is committed to.
<P>
	We are working with all the stakeholders to provide valuable 
training programs which will serve to benefit the local and 
national economy now and in the future. An important part of 
our commitment to education and training is our pledge to 
ensure that people collecting social assistance have access to 
skills upgrading programs.
<P>
	It is quite clear the old system is not working. We need to find 
and make more jobs available. We need to make our approach 
more active. When we offer assistance we must also offer the 
opportunity to develop the necessary skills to find a meaningful 
job. At the same time we must assist small and medium sized 
businesses in creating a fertile economic environment.
<P>
	As both the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development have outlined, by revamping our social 
assistance program we will be able to reinvest our resources into 
initiatives geared toward finding innovative ways to get people 
back to work. In that regard I applaud the announcement of $800 
million being made available over the next two years for pilot 
projects so that we can help with the training of the unemployed.
<P>
	I am confident this budget will set the course for growth and 
jobs in Canada. I believe these initiatives will have a positive 
impact in my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants. I am proud 
that as a government we are fulfilling our commitment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask a very brief question to the hon. 
member. In his speech, he mentions that the deficit is quite 
reasonable, but the fact is that it is the biggest deficit ever 
announced by a government, a $39 billion deficit. Does he 
believe that such a deficit is acceptable? Should he not rather try 
to convince his government to review spending so that we can 
really make the necessary cuts and get room to manoeuvre to 
really create jobs, not  only in the infrastructure area, where jobs 
are less specialized, but also all other types of jobs?
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. What really arises is that we are attentive to the 
deficit. We have spent a great deal of time trying to explain that 
issue to members across the way.
<P>
	My emphasis is not less on the deficit, because we need deficit 
reduction and we are working toward that goal. However it must 
be remembered that we have to create a climate in which there is 
economic growth so that we can work on that deficit. This is a 
parallel, two-pronged approach which we need to work on.
<P>
	I only tried to emphasize job creation, training and the 
advancement of an economic climate because in my riding I can 
make some differences working with people. I certainly have 
had an opportunity to talk with our Minister of Finance and our 
caucus over time. Yes, we are working on the deficit. I would 
only encourage members opposite that we work together.
<P>
	I came to Parliament so that I could work with people to get 
them back to work and achieve economic recovery. I come from 
a psychiatric background and know what dependency is all 
about. I have been at it for 30 years. I want to see people become 
more independent. That is a goal for Canada, for members 
across the way and for our party. I look forward to the 
enhancement of that in my work here in Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the member for his presentation. I was very 
impressed with what he focused on. There is no question he 
outlined our deficit problem but it is very simple. He 
emphasized economic renewal. If we through the programs he 
outlined enhance economic renewal there is no question we are 
going to be addressing that problem.
<P>
	I was impressed by how he used the approach that we have 
now moved from a passive to an active system. That is a prelude 
to attacking this deficit problem. More so I was impressed with 
the used computer concept, to refurbish them for use by schools.
<P>
	I would like to introduce this program in my riding. We are 
accomplishing two things. First, we are educating people on 
how to train and upgrade themselves by repairing the computers. 
Second, we are passing this on to other institutions which use the 
refurbished computers thus allowing people to elevate 
themselves to a higher level.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2089"> 2089 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no question that automation is where it is at today 
and where society is heading in the future. Therefore, the 
passive to the active system has very much impressed me. I 
thank him for sharing that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have thought for a long time this 
was the route we had to follow. There is pain in this route, but I 
believe when we move from the passive to the active we bring on 
creativity. As a government we are allowing people to create 
opportunities and jobs. Therefore as a government we become 
facilitators. We are not the creators. We are the facilitators 
helping small and medium sized businesses get started and get 
the economic recovery back on track.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in this budget the government has attacked the most 
vulnerable members of our society. Unfortunately, the elderly 
and the unemployed had less clout than the Liberal Party's 
backers. This is unacceptable, and some day, Quebecers and 
Canadians will remember this.
<P>
	We strongly condemn the $7.5 billion cuts in social programs 
especially as they affect unemployment insurance. A slow 
recovery, with little stimulus for employment, is hardly the 
answer to the tremendous economic problems facing us today.
<P>
	The safety net introduced by Canadians is now, more than 
ever before, absolutely essential to the survival of individuals, 
families and communities that are in need. And now, when we 
need it most, the minister has decided to weaken the safety net.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The budget has attacked all aspects of the unemployment 
insurance program: benefit periods and rates have been reduced; 
to qualify for unemployment insurance, a person must have 
worked at least 40 weeks in his first job; and it now takes 12 
weeks instead of 10 to be eligible for benefits. A measure that 
will be particularly hard on seasonal workers, for instance.
<P>
	Incidentally, Serge Côté and Normand Anctil of the group for 
interdisciplinary research on regional development in Eastern 
Quebec at the University of Quebec in Rimouski have just 
published a study conducted with the co-operation of with the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. According to the 
study, 25 per cent of the unemployed in Rimouski are seasonal 
workers, and the figures is 50 per cent in the rest of the region, 
which means they represent 37 per cent of UI claimants. The 
study also found that 83 per cent of seasonal workers would 
prefer regular, steady jobs, which puts the lie to the stereotype 
that these workers are lazy and perfectly happy the way they are.
<P>
	The minister has cleverly camouflaged cuts in benefits as a 
way to help low-income women, while at the same time 
invading the privacy of these women, who will be entitled to 
more benefits only if they can prove to UI  employees-who are 
not always very understanding or forthcoming-that they have 
dependents and are the sole breadwinner. Moreover, women 
whose only fault is to try to get a second income for the family 
will be discriminated against, since they will suffer a reduction 
in their payments.
<P>
	The Minister is thus launching a policy of intrusion into 
women's private lives, refusing them the right to live or cohabit 
with whoever they please, very often solely to save money and 
make ends meet.
<P>
	What about social housing? During the election campaign, the 
Minister had personally promised that a Liberal government 
would, as it should, guarantee to one million Canadian families 
decent housing at a reasonable price. Looking at his budget, we 
realize that he forgot that promise. In 1989, $133 million were 
allocated to public housing. In 1993, the amount is down to $41 
million and, in 1994, it will be nil, no money being allocated to 
new social housing projects.
<P>
	What is worse, the government is refusing that municipalities 
use the infrastructure program to build social or co-op housing. 
Yet, building housing units is profitable in many respects. 
Because they are saving on rent, people can spend more; social 
expenses for shelter, soup kitchens or protective lodging are 
reduced; they offer greater security to low income seniors who 
cannot afford private foster homes.
<P>
	The Minister should look around, because the situation is 
disastrous. In my riding, you can tell people are getting poorer 
by the fact that 40 per cent of households must spend more than 
30 per cent of their income on housing. Senior citizens who are 
going to be affected by the elimination of the tax credit or the 
changes in their pension plan, as we now know, will see their 
situation deteriorate.
<P>
	While the government is making cutbacks and is overlooking 
job creation, their friends can live in peace. In fact, the 
contribution made by businesses to government revenue over 
the last ten years has decreased. If only the minister had the 
courage to establish a minimum corporate tax, like the one in 
United States, taxpayers would pay less and might even benefit 
from a lowering of taxes without any changes required to our 
social programs.
<P>
	At a time when the GST is a nightmare for all Canadians, the 
minister, once again, has spared the holders of some $25 billion 
worth of listed shares when he could have gained substantial 
revenues by taxing them.
<P>
	I want to take a closer look now at some aspects of the 
expenditure plan of Canadian Heritage. The budget announces 
that the red book is going to be fully implemented, including an 
investment of $60 million over a period of three years in the 
cultural sector. That is great news if you think it involves new 
money, but such is not the case. In fact, as it is said in <I>The Budget </I>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2090"> 2090 </A></B>
<P>
Plan,  these initiatives will be ``funded through internal 
departmental reallocations''.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The government cuts with one hand and reinvests with the 
other. The left hand does not know where it will cut and the right 
one does not know where it will reinvest. I hope the Holy Spirit 
will enlighten the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage, and that this new trinity will 
inform this House as soon as possible.
<P>
	The estimates for the Department of Canadian Heritage are all 
the same: they give us very little indication about where the 
government is heading. On that point, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage should make the Cabinet understand the importance of 
culture not only as part of our national identity, but also as a 
major driving force behind our economy, and increasingly so.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the federal government's inconsistency 
should have such an impact on major institutions such as the 
CBC and Telefilm Canada at a time when the main industries of 
the future are telecommunications and entertainment. The cuts 
of $100 million will be maintained for 1995 and 1996 for CBC 
and, during the coming years, the Corporation will have to deal 
with a structural deficit which will amount to $169 million by 
1996.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is saying to CBC: Make the cuts 
yourself, take on that responsibility. Like Pontius Pilate, he is 
washing his hands of the whole question.
<P>
	Moreover, the government keeps on repeating that it is 
guaranteeing CBC a five-year budget, but one should remember 
that, during the last campaign, this same government was 
promising that it would maintain social programs. Barely four 
months after the Liberals' coming to office these solemn 
promises have vanished into thin air. You understand now why 
we are working so diligently to bring about Quebec's 
sovereignty, so that we will not be around three years from now, 
when this government goes back on all the promises it made 
over and over again.
<P>
	As far as Telefilm Canada is concerned, this budget maintains 
the 10 per cent cut in its operating budget announced by the 
previous government. As a result, for 1994-1995, Telefilm must 
give $10 million back to Treasury Board. The overall cut of 
more than $116 million over five years is maintained, at a time 
when the emergence of new technologies and specialty channels 
create an almost limitless demand for cultural material of 
Quebec and Canadian origin.
<P>
	The Liberal government could not come up with a better idea 
than clipping the wings of such an essential cultural agency. 
However, to have us believe that culture is of great concern to 
them, the Liberals exempted Telefilm Canada from a further 5 
per cent cut.
<P>
	On behalf of the francophone and Acadian communities, one 
must rejoice in the reinstatement of the Court Challenge 
Program, the abolition of which they had condemned. It is 
thanks to this program that the right to be educated in French in 
Canada was recognized. However, I would like to point out that 
even though the courts have upheld this right, its formal 
recognition still leaves a lot to be desired in Canada.
<P>
	In another connection, I would like to add that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage recently allotted enormous amounts of 
money for the promotion of a failure, Canadian federalism. Here 
are a few examples.
<P>
	Communications strategies, $16 million; negotiation of 
constitutional amendments for native people, $27 million; 
Knowing Canada Better Program, $6 million; for a better 
understanding between Canadians, $15 million; Canada Day, 
$3.6 million-48 per cent more than what was anticipated; the 
125th anniversary of Confederation, $22 million; forty-two 
medals commemorating the 125th anniversary, $1.3 million.
<P>
	Time is running out and I would be remiss if I ended my 
speech without saying a few words about amateur sport and 
especially about the Athlete Assistance Program. The Minister 
of Canadian Heritage went to Lillehammer where he met 
athletes and gave an interview on television. In answer to 
questions by two Quebec gold medallists, Gaétan Boucher and 
Sylvie Bernier, the minister admitted that the athlete assistance 
policy would have to be reviewed.
<P>
	The last budget increase for that program goes back to 1985. 
To compensate for the loss of buying power due to inflation 
since then, benefits under the Athlete Assistance Program 
should have been raised by at least 43 per cent. What did the 
heritage minister do? He accepted a budget cut of 7 per cent 
which will bring average benefits to individual athletes down to 
$5,100 a year from $5,500.
<P>
	The federal government lost no time in claiming the gold 
medallists of the last Olympics in the name of national pride and 
rewarding them with the country's highest decoration, but as for 
helping them on a day-to-day basis, they force them to live 
below the poverty line.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take a couple of minutes to reminisce after hearing the words 
of the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. In 1967 I had the 
distinct privilege of travelling through the member's riding with 
200 Boy Scouts from western Ontario. It was during Centennial 
Year. We travelled 3,600 miles, as they were in those days, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2091"> 2091 </A></B>
<P>
through the south shore of Quebec and into the maritimes and so 
on.
<P>
	One evening we camped in the town of Rimouski in a field 
beside the high school. Maybe it is still an open field, I do not 
know. We were wonderfully treated by the people of that town 
and by one of the service clubs. We were treated to a typical 
south shore dinner of turkey and rabbit. It was a wonderful 
evening.
<P>
	We could not speak very much French and the local people 
could not speak very much English. However, I recall that when 
we returned to the campsite from dinner the young people from 
the town of Rimouski had all gathered and made a big bonfire. 
We discovered that we could sing together. We sang songs in 
both languages until about three o'clock in the morning. When 
we finally recovered and got on the buses we recalled it as one of 
our most wonderful experiences.
<P>
	I was very interested as the hon. member talked about the need 
to support national identity. I concur with her in that regard. It 
seems to me that our duality and our national identity needs all 
the support it can get these days. I stand with her in that regard, 
even though I had a bit of a problem when she said she felt that 
somehow it was a lost cause. I want to go on record as saying that 
I do not believe it is a lost cause at all. It is the thing that makes 
us different in North America; it is the thing that makes us great.
<P>
	I want to ask the member a question. At the outset of her 
speech she talked about the government is attacking the most 
disadvantaged seniors. Does she feel the 25 per cent of senior 
citizens who are in an upper income bracket of over $25,000 are 
disadvantaged senior citizens? I would have to challenge the 
statement.
<P>
	I realize senior citizens deserve support and protection, but I 
believe many seniors in upper income brackets are willing to 
participate in helping Canada get out of its financial difficulty.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The point has been 
made. It is time for the hon. member to reply.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>Mr. Speaker, I mentioned two things. 
Presently, I want to reassure my colleague. Even when we are 
sovereign, he will still be welcome in Rimouski. We will still 
have parties on the beach and sing around a bonfire.
<P>
	I think that the elderly, pensioners, did not have the chance to 
live in the same context that we did. They did not have a chance 
to save up as much as we did. Some of them did but I do not know 
how many. Perhaps the Minister of Finance could tell us how 
many of them are in his millionaires' club, but I doubt it is the 
majority of the seniors of our country. I think they need help.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Again, there were suggestions made, plenty of them. I 
mentioned two: one is a minimum corporate income tax and the 
other is the levying of GST on transfers of listed shares. With 
such measures, it would not have been necessary to make 
changes affecting the public or social programs. As long as there 
is no reform of federalist parties that keep on being financed by 
big funds and big business, there will never be a government in 
this House with the courage to change the Income Tax Act and 
tax those with the big bucks.
<P>
	In the end, if we took care of corporations and tax shelters, we 
could lower the burden of taxpayers as they did in the United 
States instead of adding to it all the time. We cannot pay any 
more. If the government keeps on ignoring this simple fact, we 
will keep on heading towards bankruptcy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
come to the stage in today's proceedings, pursuant to the 
Standing Orders of the House, when we resume debate the 
budget speech. For several days now, members have had the 
opportunity to voice their concerns about the budgetary 
provisions. However, I think we can rightfully ask ourselves the 
following question: What is the government going to do with the 
views expressed in this House on the budget?
<P>
	Given the government's obstinate refusal to change its mind 
about closing the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean, I think the 
answer to this question is obvious: Nothing! The government 
has no intention of acting on the concerns expressed during this 
debate. It has no intention of listening to or taking into 
consideration the arguments put forward by the members of this 
House. Just a few minutes ago, my colleague, the hon. member 
for Rimouski-Témiscouata, mentioned several suggestions 
made in this House that the government has chosen to 
completely ignore.
<P>
	It was not so very long ago that the government was boasting 
of wanting to consult Parliament and the public before drafting 
its budget. Yet, it does not seem to be able to benefit from the 
opinions, suggestions and concerns presented. The Liberal 
government, which appears to be suffering from acute 
``consultationitis'', spent vast sums of money staging mock 
pre-budget conferences and was unable to draw little, if any, 
inspiration whatsoever from the opinions expressed.
<P>
	However, by holding these conferences which were given 
wide coverage by the media and which provided an opportunity 
to float a series of trial balloons, setting Canadian taxpayers up 
to expect the worst, the government deliberately maintained an 
atmosphere of austerity. As a result, the vast majority of our 
fellow citizens were fully prepared to do their share to help 
bring the deficit under control, provided all segments of society 
were asked to make equivalent sacrifices.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2092"> 2092 </A></B>
<P>
	Did the government take advantage of the implicit consensus 
among Canadians and of the admirable movement of collective 
solidarity? No, it foolishly let this opportunity slip away by 
tabling a highly disappointing budget designed so as not to stir 
up the waters too much. In some respects, the budget is a 
reflection of the Canadian government's powerlessness in the 
face of the catastrophic state of public finances.
<P>
	After unemployment, the deficit is one of the biggest 
concerns of Quebecers and Canadians. This government wanted 
to work on three objectives at the same time: first, to promote 
economic growth; second, to stem the increase in public 
spending so as to reduce the deficit; and third, to carry out at all 
costs the promises made during the election campaign. In doing 
so, the government literally overlooked two objectives to which 
it should have given the greatest importance: deficit reduction 
and job creation.
<P>
	It seems that this government was not able to attain both these 
goals at the same time. In fact, instead of attacking the 
problems, it chose instead to go after the citizens themselves, 
especially the most disadvantaged.
<P>
	Indeed, 60 per cent of the too small deficit reduction projected 
for 1995-96 is due to the new measures reducing the amounts 
allocated for the unemployed. Furthermore, the government is 
increasing the tax burden of seniors and eliminating a tax break 
that benefited the middle class.
<P>
	Let us consider for a moment the structural deficit, which is 
approximately 3.5 per cent of the gross domestic product. The 
Bloc Quebecois and many Quebecers are convinced that Canada 
is running up such huge deficits because of the very way this 
country is structured. Federalism is inherently inefficient with 
the many overlaps, wasted energy and contradictory policies.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	The structural deficit is due to the huge government 
bureaucracy. What is the government doing in the 1994-95 
budget to improve the poor management practices that exist and 
are perpetuated in this bureaucracy? What is it doing to 
eliminate the waste which the Auditor General has made a point 
of denouncing many times in successive reports? Very little.
<P>
	One of the solutions put forward by the government is to cut 
transfer payments to the provinces by $2 billion, $466 million in 
1995-96 and $1.54 billion in 1996-97. Of course, the Minister 
of Finance defends himself by saying that he will spend $800 
million to finance new approaches to social security. What are 
these new approaches? Can he assure us they will not, once 
again, lead to federal government intervention in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	It is disturbing to see that one of the solutions considered by 
the government is to increase the tax burden of middle-income 
seniors and of middle-class taxpayers in general. How can they 
justify their decision to reduce the age credit? In total, between 
1994 and 1997, this measure will take $490 million from the 
pockets of seniors, while high-income taxpayers are still 
benefiting from tax shelters.
<P>
	On the other hand, when the Bloc Quebecois called for 
stimulation of the job market and lowering of the unemployment 
rate, it did not ask the government to shift the responsibility for 
its problems to Quebec and the other provinces. Unemployment 
insurance reform will neither motivate people to work nor, of 
course, increase the number of jobs available. It will in fact put 
more people on the welfare rolls.
<P>
	The government's dithering is impossible to explain and 
unforgivable when every wasted minute aggravates its financial 
situation as well as the suffering of individuals and families hurt 
by unemployment and poverty.
<P>
	The government seems to count mainly on economic recovery 
to fill its coffers. Recent experiences have taught us to be wary 
of such calculations. We should have expected the government 
to take vigorous measures, but it has not done so.
<P>
	The Desjardins Group, the Quebec Deposit and Investment 
Fund and the Conference Board all forecast an unemployment 
rate of around 10 per cent in 1995. How did the government 
come up with this more or less realistic and much too optimistic 
percentage of 8 per cent?
<P>
	The sluggish recovery is mostly due to the excessive tax 
burden and unacceptable unemployment rate. No wonder Gallup 
pollsters found out last November that participation in the 
underground economy is considered acceptable by 33 per cent of 
Canadians and 42 per cent of Quebecers.
<P>
	The only real solution to the underemployment problem 
proposed by the government to Quebecers and Canadians is the 
infrastructure program. It is better than nothing but it is far from 
being the solution to all our problems. Furthermore, the 
short-sightedness with which this program was designed is 
alarming. In fact, it will only provide 45,000 short-term jobs in 
economic areas having rather little value-added, so it does not 
stimulate Canada's international competitiveness. Quebec's 
437,000 unemployed are perfectly entitled to question the 
government's good faith.
<P>
	Yet, when all available means must be used as efficiently as 
possible, the government does not seem to understand that 
enhancing the production and export capability of the thousands 
of small and medium-sized businesses throughout Canada and 
Quebec can truly create jobs and produce wealth. The 
government recognizes that two million jobs depend on exports, 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2093"> 2093 </A></B>
<P>
account for more than one quarter of the GDP. It  also 
acknowledges that priority should be given to increasing the 
exports of the small and medium-sized business sector, which 
account for only 10 per cent of the total volume of exports. It 
fails, however, to take concrete measures to realize its wishes.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade himself declared that 
measures to stimulate expansion in this sector are insufficient, 
overlooked and therefore inadequate. Several members received 
complaints from heads of small and medium-sized businesses 
who say that they cannot get the information, the expertise or the 
logistical support needed to access foreign markets. It is 
therefore urgent for the government to correct the situation and 
ensure that the information, which apparently exists, is made 
available.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	This is only the tip of the iceberg. This sector's real problems 
result from the treatment small and medium-sized businesses 
receive from banks and their inability to access funds. In this 
regard, the minister does not have anything concrete to propose 
apart from planning a vague consultative process between 
himself and Canadian financial institutions, but, of course, 
without the main stakeholders, namely small and medium-sized 
businesses. Once again, the Minister only uses the future tense. 
Unfortunately, action must now replace discussions and pious 
wishes.
<P>
	We know that, in the past, the governments of some 
provinces, especially Quebec, made efforts to promote small 
business development. What is the federal government doing to 
coordinate its initiatives with those of the provinces? The fact is 
that small business assistance programs, particularly those 
related to exports, are not only inadequate, but often competing 
and conflicting.
<P>
	Solutions to problems are deferred. After being so alarmist 
for several weeks, the government finally tabled a budget which 
had no real direction and managed to make everyone unhappy. 
Once again, the government resorted to a policy with no 
long-term vision, thereby leaving us with the poor result that we 
know.
<P>
	This budget reminds us of an administration which, not long 
ago, was vehemently criticized by the Liberals themselves. This 
budget, like the ones tabled by previous governments, fails to 
reach the original objectives set by the government.
<P>
	It does nothing to reduce the deficit. It does not provide 
adequate measures to create employment. Moreover, it targets 
social programs, instead of eliminating costly waste and 
overlapping in government expenditures. One could almost 
think, and I will end on that note, that it was Michael Wilson or 
Don Mazankowski wearing the Minister of Finance's work 
boots, last February 22. And that certainly does not augur well 
for Canada and for Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the hon. member for Verchères for his very 
interesting remarks and I would like to make a comment. He said 
that one of the reasons for the high cost of federalism was 
overlap and duplication between the federal programs and 
provincial programs. I took note of that fact.
<P>
	In that context I wonder whether he would agree that it would 
be a net saving and a reduction in the deficit if Quebec returned 
control of immigration to the federal government as it is in the 
rest of the country and as it is constitutionally. Would he agree 
that is a good plan?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleague for his question.
<P>
	The hon. member commented on one part of my speech where 
I most specifically addressed the issue of costs inherent to our 
federal system. I mentioned of course the costly overlap and 
duplication, but I could also have talked about the scattering of 
public moneys all across Canada, supposedly to defend regional 
interests and to avoid offending regional susceptibilities. This is 
one aspect of Canadian federalism which, because of our vast 
territory, is at the root of some of our financial problems.
<P>
	To reduce overlap, the hon. member suggested that Quebec 
opt out of the immigration field. At the outset, I find it horrible 
that members opposite would only take note of the fact that we 
find that overlap costs us a lot of money. First, we were 
expecting a lot more from them. We thought you would act 
energetically to eliminate overlap and duplication between the 
federal and provincial governments. Second, Quebec negotiated 
with the federal government a special immigration agreement 
which, in a certain sense, does not involve additional costs 
either for the federal government or for Quebec. This agreement 
only transfers the responsibility for managing the case files of 
immigrants and applicants. In my opinion, what the member 
suggested was somewhat irrelevant, since it has more to do with 
the Quebec government than with the prerogatives of the 
Official Opposition.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his speech. I know we are the opposition on this 
side of the House, but I do not think that means we have to be so 
negative. The hon. member knocks the budget but there is 
nothing concrete, no proposals being put forth by Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition that also sits on this side of the House. He 
talks about the bank's being difficult on small business, about 
the underground economy growing, about all things that are 
negative in the country. As members of the House we should be 
talking about the positive aspects such as how the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2094"> 2094 </A></B>
<P>
government transfers $3.5 billion to the province of Quebec 
through the equalization grants.
<P>
	When are they going to start acknowledging these things 
rather than talk like a broken record and say that the duplication 
of federal-provincial programs seems to be the problem that 
faces the country? If we repeat that statement often enough 
people will start to believe it, but the point is that there are many 
positive things.
<P>
	Will he recognize that we in the House make a positive 
contribution to Quebec and every other province in Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is already the second time I 
have the opportunity to discuss directly with my colleague from 
St. Albert on budget issues and, each time, I am under the 
impression that the hon. member for St. Albert does not listen 
carefully to what I say.
<P>
	Duplication was mentioned as one of the factors behind the 
lack of budget efficiency within the federal system; other causes 
could have been indicated. So, if he wants, I could meet with 
him in private or simply make a speech on the factors inherent to 
the federal system that are responsible for the staggering costs 
to the country as a whole.
<P>
	You suggested-and I find it a little sad-that the Official 
Opposition only knows how to criticize and never has anything 
positive to suggest. I cannot help but think that you must not 
have been present in this House very often to say that, since the 
Official Opposition has not ceased, these last few months, to put 
forward several budget proposals which the government has not 
taken into consideration, as I have already mentioned in my 
speech on the budget.
<P>
	Moreover, the hon. member has also suggested that Canada is 
a great country and that it had to be acknowledged that Quebec 
receives a lot from the federal government in the way of transfer 
payments. I will put to you that these transfer payments are in 
the form of unemployment insurance and social assistance 
benefits and that one does not congratulate oneself on receiving 
from a federal state investments which are not going into 
research and development or a job creation program, but which 
only reveal the poverty of Quebec society within this federal 
system.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> By the way, I ask you to please address 
your remarks to the Chair and not to the hon. member, even 
though you sit close to one another. Debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox 
and Addington):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to have the 
opportunity to speak about such an important measure as the 
federal budget. I consider the budget to be a historic document 
which lays the necessary framework for a renewed, prosperous 
and just Canada.
<P>
	As this is my maiden speech, I take the liberty to point out that 
my great privilege to be speaking today is also a historic 
occasion. I am the first Liberal representative of 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington since David 
Wright Allison defeated Sir John A. Macdonald back in 1883. It 
is a privilege to be given the trust and good wishes of one's 
constituents. I will work to ensure the government represents 
the concerns of my riding.
<P>
	Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington extends from 
Lake Ontario in the southwest and Algonquin Park in the north 
to the Thousand Islands area in the southeast.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	As I travel through the riding and stop in places like Bancroft, 
Madoc, Marmora, Stirling, Napanee, Arden, Sharbot Lake and 
my own village of Camden East, I receive many words of 
encouragement. I also receive general advice and specific 
suggestions about the issues that face our rural communities. I 
value this input and I thank the people of 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington for their support 
and wise counsel.
<P>
	I give thanks to several hundred people who gave so freely of 
their time during the recent campaign. Today I am proud to be 
representing all of the people of our riding.
<P>
	I would also like to publicly thank my wife Reta, and Kayla 
Rebecca, our daughter, for their love and support.
<P>
	One of the messages I receive over and over again is that 
people want to see the government come out with an open and 
transparent game plan for economic and social renewal. My 
constituents expect no less. This is what the 1994 budget sets in 
motion, a framework for social and economic renewal.
<P>
	Our objective is clear: to stimulate growth by targeting our 
spending without imposing new taxes. Just look at how quickly 
the government has set about funding initiatives which were 
promised during the campaign. In this party we take our 
platform, the red book, seriously.
<P>
	The national infrastructure program has had a speedy start. In 
my riding alone 44 local level governments and five school 
boards are busy preparing their proposals. There is no doubt in 
my mind and in the minds of rural residents that there are many 
worthy infrastructure projects.
<P>
	I received copies of proposals from a number of 
municipalities in my riding. My riding has the most miles of 
roads of any riding in Ontario. I have seen proposed projects for 
road improvements. I can attest that there are many heavily 
travelled arteries which have yet to be paved. The benefits of 
these proposed upgradings are many. Besides the prospects of 
jobs in road construction, there is the added benefit to the local 
tourist economy. Good roads get residents and tourists to and 
from their destinations quickly and safely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2095"> 2095 </A></B>
<P>
	Infrastructure projects may even save lives.
<P>
	My background is in small business. I owned a general store 
in our community. My constituents own, work in and patronize 
small and medium sized businesses. Eighty per cent of new jobs 
are created by small and medium sized businesses. Eighty per 
cent of all jobs in rural areas are created by local based 
businesses.
<P>
	This budget, I am pleased to point out, supports small and 
medium sized businesses. By its measures to support small 
business, this budget becomes the foundation for our country's 
economic renewal.
<P>
	One of the most common complaints coming from the 
business community in my riding is that it is difficult to access 
bank capital for investment or expansion. During the election 
campaign we in the Liberal Party acknowledged this and 
promised to act to redress the situation.
<P>
	The government is acting now in consultation with both 
financial institutions and businesses to develop a code of 
conduct for small business lending. The government's role is to 
act as an honest broker between stakeholders. By consulting 
with those concerned our government is showing its willingness 
and ability to tackle the problem of access to capital.
<P>
	It is only by working with the banks and their business clients 
that we can together meet our country's common objective to 
improve the business environment and increase international 
competitiveness.
<P>
	With this budget the government has proven that it not only 
knows how to consult but it knows how to listen and act as well.
<P>
	More payroll taxes would have been a burden on business and 
a barrier to jobs. The government has acted decisively to roll 
back the unemployment insurance premium rate.
<P>
	As most people know, a common request made to MPs' 
offices is for information on programs for small business. This 
suggests to me that Canadians have the will to create new 
businesses. Canadians have faith in their talent and their 
abilities. Canadians have plans that they are willing to put into 
action. Finally, Canadians have the initiative to search out the 
resources which are available to them.
<P>
	My staff has been and will remain happy to seek information 
on government programs for small business on behalf of 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	It is only sensible that my staff and my constituents should be 
able to access complete information quickly. They need direct 
access to civil servants who hold an expert's knowledge of the 
content and scope of government programs for small business.
<P>
	By next year the government will have put a Canada business 
services centre in every province. This is an efficient one stop 
shopping scheme for government programs. This is just one 
more piece of the framework which will serve to support 
business growth. With this budget the government is putting into 
place the building blocks necessary for strong social and 
economic renewal.
<P>
	Also, on the economic front I am excited about the Canada 
investment fund and the Canadian technology network, just two 
more pieces of the framework for our country's renewal.
<P>
	I am perhaps most encouraged by our government's 
commitment to fundamentally overhaul the social security 
system. We will not achieve savings by indiscriminately 
slashing the budget of social programs. Ours is not the mandate 
of the previous government. We have not been elected to tear 
down the social safety net, but rather to rebuild a system that 
works for all Canadians. This is our mandate and this is what the 
1994 budget initiates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member for his speech. However, I would 
add that I do not agree with everything he said and I will begin 
with the end of his speech to illustrate the points on which I 
disagree.
<P>
	When the hon. member said that his government was not 
elected to cut social programs, I wonder if we read the same 
budget, because it said that the Department of Finance will cut 
$725 million from unemployment insurance plan this year. Is 
the hon. member aware of the impact that will have in regions 
like the Maritimes and Eastern Quebec where, unfortunately, 
people live on seasonal jobs?
<P>
	Right now, unemployment insurance is essential there. Like 
everybody else, workers in those regions would like to be able to 
work 52 weeks a year, but they need tools. The government says 
that it did not get the mandate to cut social programs, but 
nonetheless it is cutting unemployment insurance. The Liberals 
say that they want to reform and restructure the Canadian social 
safety net, but I would like to be sure that when they talk about 
reform, they do not mean cuts and less assistance. What 
alternative do they have to offer?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Certainly I appreciate the fact that I have had an inside 
opportunity for the last few weeks of sitting with the Standing 
Commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2096"> 2096 </A></B>
<P>
tee on Human Resources Development. We have been listening 
to witnesses for 12 and a half hours a day this week, and I will be 
back there shortly.
<P>
	Certainly with our programs we are not setting out to cut off 
anyone and make them suffer and go hungry in this country. We 
believe that there is a lot of money in the system between the 
different levels of government, including all the provinces and 
this government. The strength seems to be that the 
municipalities can deliver a lot of these systems.
<P>
	We can save a lot of money within the administration as we 
study that. We can put this to good use in helping to look after all 
the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his maiden speech. I would like to 
bring the hon. member into a point of reality with his analysis of 
his government's budget.
<P>
	We must focus on the ugly reality which the government's 
budget brings about.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	I am talking about an additional $100 billion debt that will be 
attached to the $500 billion debt that has now accumulated. How 
is the hon. member going to assure business that there is going to 
be no hindrance to its expansion, to its growth or other such 
initiatives when there is no other alternative but to increase 
taxes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.
<P>
	As I go back to my riding and talk to business people from 
across 5,000 miles of road a lot of these business people who 
like to complain about government-I complained about 
government for many years and I still do-believe there is a new 
confidence in the air already. I do not believe they are just 
saying this because I happen to be a Liberal member. I hear 
people running down the government but who are also 
acknowledging the fact that there is an atmosphere of 
confidence today and that things are getting better already.
<P>
	Back to my small business background, I am certainly glad to 
talk about the debt. The hon. member's cohorts and my friends 
in our standing committee are letting every witness who comes 
in front of us know that we do have a debt in this country. Many 
of us believe that the only way we can look at this debt and be 
realistic in this country without ruining it is to have jobs.
<P>
	Therefore we believe it is very important how we affect this 
country and certainly we want to provide the right atmosphere to 
help businesses grow.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I congratulate the hon. member on his 
maiden speech. On debate, the hon. member for Vancouver East.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Mr. Speaker, tansi. 
Tansi means hello in Cree, one of the languages of the aboriginal 
people.
<P>
	Being an immigrant I feel it is appropriate for me to use it in 
my maiden speech. I have risen in the House before to make 
statements or ask questions but this is the first time I have 
delivered a speech in this House where so many important 
people before me stood and delivered their maiden speeches.
<P>
	My riding of Vancouver East is surely one of the most 
interesting and diversified ridings in Canada. It stretches from 
Cambie Street on the west side to Boundary Road on the east 
side and from the waterfront on the north side to Grandview 
Highway in a zigzag on the south side.
<P>
	I cannot imagine myself representing another area. I chose 
Vancouver East for the work I have done in that area over 20 
years and I am glad I did. Vancouver is a very seductive city.
<P>
	Since my arrival from Italy in 1966 Vancouver has grown by 
leaps and bounds and is becoming an international metropolis 
by the day. Vancouver East is a microcosm of Canada with its 
many immigrants and interesting people representing the fabric 
of the entire nation.
<P>
	In Vancouver East the Chinese population at over 30 per cent 
outnumbers the British group at 16 per cent, followed by the 
Italians, who used to be the largest group, the aboriginal people 
and all other ethnicities such as Filipinos, Vietnamese, 
Indo-Canadians and Latin Americans, to mention a few.
<P>
	In Vancouver East 45 per cent of the population is classified 
as immigrants. Almost six people out of ten do not speak 
English. Vancouver East also has one of the largest aboriginal 
urban populations in Canada. The port of Vancouver is in 
Vancouver East and so are many of the labour unions.
<P>
	In Vancouver East one can find several cultural centres, such 
as the Aboriginal Friendship Centre, the Native Education 
Centre, the Chinese Cultural Centre, the Italian Cultural Centre, 
the Croatian Community Centre and the Sikh Gudwara.
<P>
	In Vancouver East we have the police department and several 
small business owned by families. A colourful part of the city 
with core streets such as Commercial Drive, Powell Street with 
Gastown, Pender Street with Chinatown and Hastings Street, 
Vancouver East counts on a large number of caring people who 
provide support to the many needy in the area and who are the 
heart and soul of the riding. These people operate from centres 
such as the Carnegie Centre, the neighbourhood houses, the 
churches and the non-profit organizations' headquarters.
<P>
	I thank them for the tremendous job they do. I want to thank 
the constituents of Vancouver East for believing in what I have 
to offer and for voting for me. They will not be disappointed. But 
I need them now more than  ever. I also thank my son David and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2097"> 2097 </A></B>
<P>
all the people who supported me, those who worked with me in 
my campaign and ensured my victory.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The human element was the most important factor in my 
campaign. Because of the nature of Vancouver East, I asked to 
speak to the budget which contains much of what is needed in a 
riding like Vancouver East. This was the new government's first 
budget and was a blueprint of the red book that got the Liberal 
Party elected.
<P>
	This budget is the first step of this new government to bring 
back dignity to our population by creating jobs and restoring 
faith in government. However, let me speak to some of the 
important issues for Vancouver East and for Canada.
<P>
	No tax increases. What a challenge. A fairer use of UIC and 
lower UIC premiums, giving businesses a chance to reinvest the 
premium money they save in creating more jobs. This was 
another challenge and this time it came from the business 
people.
<P>
	The support for housing through the RRAP, the continuation 
of subsidies to the needy on reserve housing, projects to help 
victims of family violence and the use of RRSP for first house 
purchases. We would like to see more funding for new 
subsidized housing but I feel we must become innovative and 
find private funding as well to be able to continue a subsidized 
housing system which is the envy of the world.
<P>
	The infrastructure program for the present and future of our 
transportation network and of tourism. The prenatal nutrition 
and the aboriginal head start programs are two very important 
programs for our newborns. The court challenges program and 
the establishment of the Canadian race relations committee 
needed for all minorities.
<P>
	The centre of excellence for women's health and the national 
forum on health are two very important initiatives for the 
prevention of illnesses. The youth services corps, the youth 
internship program, the literacy programs to help our youth 
become independent and start their lives. The unification of 
families during the year of the family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All that was done by the Minister of Finance with the advice 
and support of government members. The Minister of Finance 
took into account the requests made by Canadians and often 
changed the course of his budget according to the advice given 
to him by his colleagues.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also considered the fact that, next 
year, we will have the results of the consultations that will be 
held in the areas of defence, human resources and immigration. I 
think that this budget is a very good example of the 
government's determination to change course.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What I feel is so important is the slight shift of the work 
burden from the government to the business sector. We have 
been counting for too long on the government for our jobs. By 
offering incentives to businesses, the Minister of Finance is 
beginning to give the business sector a chance of expanding and 
creating more jobs. Even the change in UIC is a good step 
toward creating more commitment on the part of the worker.
<P>
	During the campaign many single mothers living in my riding 
called. They want to get off welfare, get some training and start 
working. This is the answer to their requests.
<P>
	As a woman, I am quite happy to see that for the first time 
women's needs are reflected in the budget. I am sure this is the 
beginning of something.
<P>
	Sure we would like to see more funding for various programs, 
but unfortunately due to our financial constraints we all have to 
share the burden and co-operate. Sure we would like to see a 
much lower deficit forecast, but this cannot be done without the 
suffering of all Canadians who are asking for jobs.
<P>
	Mark Hill, an Ottawa writer, has tried to get rid of the deficit 
and the debt, but after much general cutting, after: ``slashing old 
age security, unemployment insurance, health care, social 
assistance and education by 25 per cent'', and this on top of what 
he has already cut, he has concluded by writing: ``what if we 
allowed our elderly to fall into poverty, our sick to go without 
treatment and our poor to go without decent food or shelter? 
How many years would we have to suffer after we paid off our 
debt''? The answer is 22 years of suffering.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to bring up an issue that troubles 
me a great deal. In 1976, I took part in various initiatives aimed 
at keeping Quebec within Canada. When I arrived in this country 
in 1966, Quebec was part of Canada and it must stay that way.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I want to offer my assistance to Quebec members who want a 
united Canada and who would like the support of a Canadian of 
Italian origin, from Western Canada, who speaks French and 
who is interested in keeping Canada together.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Permit me to congratulate the hon. 
member on her maiden speech.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
congratulate the hon. member on her maiden speech. As I have 
said before, that is a very special moment in our political life in 
this House. I do congratulate the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2098"> 2098 </A></B>
<P>
	I am going to be very short. I am going to address the issue 
of jobs and job creation. In this budget, $725 million in UI cuts 
means 40,000 jobs. A $6 billion infrastructure program means 
65,000 jobs. Sixty-five thousand and forty thousand certainly 
does not add up to 1.2 million. That is currently the number 
of people in this country who are out of work.
<P>
	I am having a really hard time understanding how this 
disparity of 100,000-plus jobs is supposed to get 1.2 
million-plus people in Canada back to work. I would like the 
hon. member to respond to that, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see the concern and I know 
it is only 10 per cent of what we need.
<P>
	With the infrastructure program it is not just roads and the 
infrastructure we need. Some moneys are also set aside for arts 
centres. Fifteen per cent of it is earmarked for other programs.
<P>
	I would like to say that this is another opportunity to increase 
jobs. I would also like to say that we cannot get 1.2 million jobs 
on the first budget and we cannot get the deficit down while 
trying to do some work in the area of the economics of the 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would also like to thank the hon. member for the 
quality of her maiden speech. Many of us here have had to make 
this first speech, and it is always a rather moving experience.
<P>
	I have a comment about a remark she made in her speech on 
the change of direction brought about by the new government. 
We, on this side of the House, do not agree at all that there has 
been change, considering some significant items in the budget. 
For instance, this is the record deficit. Never before had the 
government forecast a $39 billion deficit. There is also the 
increase in the number of weeks of work needed for entitlement 
to unemployment insurance benefits coupled with a reduction in 
the number of weeks people can get these benefits. To me, this 
looks much more like a continuation of the previous 
Conservative government's policy.
<P>
	That is why Canadians and Quebecers find it very hard to 
accept the results of this budget. During last week recess, people 
told me this was another case of all talk and no action, since after 
telling us for two months how serious the situation was, the 
government ended up with no real cuts. It is just business as 
usual.
<P>
	I have a second brief remark. The hon. member said that she 
wanted to work with Quebec members at building a united 
Canada. I would invite her to work at making sure that Canada 
and Quebec set up structures that would make them able to face 
global competition in the years ahead. In that regard, Canadian 
federalism no longer represents the kind of structure that will 
allow us to be competitive in the global market.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to 
comment on the second remark of my colleague. The fact that 
Quebec has tried to separe from Canada for many years did have 
an impact on our economy. It is well known that problems are 
not limited to Quebec but affect the whole country. I believe 
that, as we say in Italy, united we stand, divided we fall. I do not 
know how they say it in France, but we say that unity is strength.
<P>
	As to the first remark on a new direction for our country, I 
must say I am convinced there is indeed a new direction. This is 
our first budget, and it was tabled only four months after the 
government came into office. It is the first of two phases, and the 
second one will come next year. It will then be possible to 
discuss the budgetary content because we will have all the 
findings of the consultation process. The opposition may find 
that we are right in what we do and do it in the best interest of 
this country.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the whip of the Reform Party, I would like 
to advise the House that pursuant to Standing Order 43 our 
speakers on this motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
	I am more than pleased to address an area of concern that is 
very real to Canadians. Last week I spent time in my riding of 
Port Moody-Coquitlam, the first extended opportunity I had to 
meet with individuals and groups since the budget was 
introduced. I was met with three main areas of concern, two of 
which I would like to touch on today.
<P>
	The first topic is the budget. The other is immigration. Both 
deal in very real terms with the concern of ordinary Canadians 
about the future directions and opportunities of Canada.
<P>
	Most Canadians view the budget of February 1994 as a 
stop-gap measure, an attempt, however feeble, at holding the 
line on the deficit and yet it has not done too much damage in 
their own backyard. Predictably those whose livelihoods have 
been directly affected through base closures or wage freezes or 
other means are angry. Others who have watched our nation's 
economy closely through the last several decades are angry.
<P>
	I put to it the House that this budget is a failure and that all 
Canadians should be angry.
<P>
	Canada's debt and deficit situation is now at a point at which it 
is affecting every individual and every business through 
exorbitant taxation. Every personal paycheque is slashed by 
taxes and reduced buying power. Our debt load of over half a 
trillion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2099"> 2099 </A></B>
<P>
dollars, among the largest per capita debt of the industrialized 
world, will destroy trade, jobs and our standard of living.
<P>
	The deputy finance minister admitted yesterday that the tax 
burden on individual Canadians and corporations is higher in 
Canada than in any other major industrial power except France. 
One-third of every dollar we pay in taxes disappears to debt 
servicing. Those moneys are not there for our country's needs.
<P>
	Allow me to illustrate. Every second eats up $1,300 in debt 
interest payment, enough to employ two Canadians for a week. 
In six seconds you could feed a family of four for a year. In the 
10 minutes I have for this speech the debt will have increased by 
$780,000. It will take an average Canadian 20 years to earn that 
much.
<P>
	Remember, this money is not owed just to ourselves as some 
may like to think. It is a fact that our largest export as a nation is 
Canadian dollars owed to foreign lenders each year.
<P>
	Yet with this budget government spending for the coming year 
has actually increased by $2 billion. As with so many previous 
budgets there will supposedly always be more revenues, better 
economic conditions to bring our debt problems in order. Not so 
then and not so now.
<P>
	The problem is too severe to be left to the future because it is 
that future that will inherit not the promises but the crushing 
load of today's inability to face the problem. Spending must be 
reduced and Canadians must be prepared to face the problem 
squarely and honestly.
<P>
	This current situation demands that all areas of expenditure 
and human capital be addressed. That is why the budget debate 
is an ideal time to examine the issue of immigration.
<P>
	On its own it has been relegated to an untouchable topic 
associated too easily with suspect motives and easy labels. Our 
financial and human resources must be opened up for close 
inspection in this area as well as others.
<P>
	As the <I>Globe and Mail</I> stated on its 150th anniversary, the 
biggest story of the nineties will be whether we learn to live 
within our limits in a world already stressed by our excesses.
<P>
	Our world has become a place of movement, of capital and 
humanity. Recent reports in the media remind us that the 
economic and migration issues are not ours alone.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Bosnia is one of almost 50 identifiable areas of civil war. Up 
to 22 million people in Africa will need emergency food this 
year. There are 20 million refugees worldwide, plus another 24 
million people displaced inside their homelands. One-third of 
the world's labour force, more than 820 million people, is either 
not working or is living below a subsistence level.
<P>
	This dilemma only intensifies as it becomes too apparent that 
there are no easy solutions. The 1991 Geneva Convention cannot 
adequately address these developments. International 
co-operation must be pursued quickly to deal with shared long 
term solutions.
<P>
	Canada has one of the most generous immigration policies in 
the world. We accept more refugees as landed immigrants than 
any other nation in the world per capita. On February 2, 1994 the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced the target 
for this year's immigration level set at 250,000 or 1 per cent of 
our population. Per capita it is double that of Australia or the 
United States, the other two countries which receive the largest 
amounts of immigrants.
<P>
	We pride ourselves on our humanitarian and multicultural 
policies. Yet according to a recent Vancouver <I>Sun</I> article recent 
studies on immigration demonstrated that federal planners 
cannot know for sure what impact these new arrivals will have 
on Canada. Reports and studies are mixed. Even the much 
quoted Canada Council report of 1991 recommends an 
immigration target of 1 per cent of population only after 25 
years.
<P>
	Historically, Canada's immigration rates have been erratic 
since the 1970s, ranging from a low of 84,000 in 1985 to more 
than 200,000 in the last three years. Typically, rates have 
reflected economic trends with numbers dropping in harder 
economic times. Historically, the largest flows have been in 
response to definite need as when record numbers came in the 
early 1900s to populate a vast western prairie.
<P>
	Studies seem to indicate immigration has been economically 
neutral, neither helping nor hindering the economy to any large 
extent. That would seem to depend on the receiving conditions 
and the adaptability of the immigrants to the needs of the 
country. Both these factors have changed dramatically in the 
past few years.
<P>
	Canada and Canadians are facing a tremendous economic 
challenge as we adjust to new world market conditions. Our debt 
puts us at a growing disadvantage. Domestically, new 
technologies demand major shifts in a struggling labour force. 
Jobs are no longer there not only for the untrained but neither for 
the student nor those in middle management careers.
<P>
	The present unemployment rate is 11.4 per cent and much 
higher if we take into account those who no longer are looking or 
are underemployed. Add to this an immigration policy that will 
introduce 2.5 million new people in the next 10 years. More than 
half of the new arrivals coming as refugee or family class 
immigrants will not have the skills needed in the new economy.
<P>
	The independent class of immigrants with job and language 
skills dropped from 54 per cent in 1954 to 27 per cent in 1992. 
The family reunification class increased at the same time by a 
similar amount. Immigrants who spoke no English or French 
used to be only 10 per cent of new arrivals. Last year that soared 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2100"> 2100 </A></B>
<P>
to nearly half with  over 100,000 of Canada's 250,000 
immigrants with no official language capacity.
<P>
	I saw a living example of such proportions in a Port Moody 
school last week. Fully half of the students in that school are in 
the ESL program stream. Students there take their seat in the 
classroom having arrived two or three days earlier in a brand 
new land surrounded by brand new sights and sounds.
<P>
	Immigration decisions made here in Ottawa are being lived 
out in the burgeoning budget needs of local school boards and 
the stress of overworked teachers. Language training for new 
immigrants currently costs the Canadian taxpayers over $100 
million a year.
<P>
	The life and the blood of our nation are its people. 
Government can seek to prescribe remedies to all kinds of our 
country's ills through tinkering with this one factor. Will 
immigration really save our pensions? Will immigration save 
our dwindling revenues?
<P>
	Increasingly, we see the band-aids that must be applied to the 
serious side effects of these choices, whether it be the rising 
racial prejudice, immigration dependency on social services, 
perceived welfare abuse and criminal activity among new 
arrivals, or the stress in our education system.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time to go back and honestly review the doctor's 
prescription. Basic immigration policies and assumptions must 
be opened to re-examination.
<P>
	Last week I met with representatives of a Chinese immigrant 
service organization. Their greatest concern was not in 
supporting the cultures of those they represent. Their role is to 
help give new arrivals the tools to make a new life in their new 
chosen home. For that they need more and more resources to 
meet the escalating demands of greater numbers and greater 
needs. They see their main goal as effectively integrating these 
new Canadians in a prosperous new country. Present 
immigration policies are ruining their effectiveness. Present 
economic policies are ruining their hope for a prosperous 
country.
<P>
	We have a responsibility therefore to ask ourselves the 
following question: What drives government policy that invites 
record numbers and new classifications of new arrivals into an 
unpredictable future?
<P>
	I urge all members of all parties of this House to be truly 
humanitarian and truly compassionate by giving our 
immigration policies a responsible scrutiny and careful 
assessment. As members of Parliament we are watchmen at the 
gate for those who live in this land as well as for those who will 
come to join us. We must therefore seek out those policies that 
are proven, which will strengthen and create opportunity and 
unity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member's remarks with great interest. I must say I heard 
very much of a mixed message. I do not know where she gets 
some of the literature she cites.
<P>
	In the province of Ontario, which I know best but I am sure the 
figures are roughly the same, its population would have 
decreased every year of the last 10 years if it had not been for 
immigrants. The population of the province of Quebec would 
have decreased even more quickly. What is perhaps more 
important for us all is that while that was occurring, the 
population of the province of Ontario would already have been 
close to 25 per cent senior citizens. That is one aspect. How she 
thinks that works into the mix of our economy I do not know.
<P>
	The other matter is that the immigrants-by that I mean new 
immigrants, not established immigrants like myself-in my 
riding are almost invariably contributing members of our 
community. They are people who often take jobs well below 
their qualifications and work very hard in those jobs. They rent 
first of all and then buy small houses and improve them. They 
see that their children get educated.
<P>
	Also in the hon. member's figures she mentioned immigration 
of 1 per cent. She knows this country has never had 1 per cent 
immigration. There have been targets of 1 per cent. There is a 
target at the present time but there has never been 1 per cent 
immigration.
<P>
	She mentioned Bosnia. She mentioned unemployment. She 
mentioned compassion and humanitarian feelings for people in 
other countries. Does she realize that in her lifetime the world 
population will double and will then double again? That 
assumes, by the way, that she lives an average life and I hope she 
lives longer. What are we supposed to do in this country while 
the world population doubles and redoubles?
<P>
	For the member's information 1 per cent of our population, 
which is the target for immigration we have at the moment, 
represents at this moment one day's increase in the world 
population. Do we move into a bunker and let the world 
population grow around us and try and live as increasingly aging 
and wealthy people not reaching out to help these people in other 
countries?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments and questions. Actually I am getting a mixed message 
from the member as well.
<P>
	As we look at the immigrants who do come to this country, the 
thrust of my talk and feeling is we need to give them opportunity 
when they arrive here, as well as provide opportunity for 
Canadians who are here already. That should be our bottom line.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	I did not say anything about a 1 per cent immigration rate 
before this time but that is our target. I think we agree with that 
as the established government target.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2101"> 2101 </A></B>
<P>
	There are no studies indicating that 1 per cent is where we 
should be at. What I do see though and I referred to this in my 
speech are the surfacing problems. In today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
over one-half of Canadians perceive we are accepting too many 
immigrants. That tells me there is a perception problem which 
needs to be addressed.
<P>
	Why is that perception there? The immigrants that do come to 
this country tend to come to three urban centres. They come to 
places that are already stressed. They come to places where jobs 
are not available. They come to expectations we cannot provide 
because we have not been able to assess how we are going to 
accommodate these people.
<P>
	The hon. member has admitted in his question the reasons our 
immigration policies are what they are. The government wants 
to provide pension funds because of its own mismanagement of 
funds in the past. Those pension funds will not be there if 
present trends continue. Is it fair to the immigrants if we bring in 
the possibility of reduced employment, fewer jobs for the 
Canadian population?
<P>
	I would agree that immigrants are necessary and immigration 
is a positive force in our country if it is done wisely. Where is the 
proven wisdom in our present policy? That is what we need to 
challenge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, to be quite 
frank, I find the statements by the member to be quite 
troublesome.
<P>
	The member quoted a poll from today's paper which clearly 
shows there is a problem. Perhaps the problem is accentuated by 
the fact that people who claim to be leaders in the community 
stand in places like this and in provincial legislatures and allow 
the perception that immigrants are a drain on the Canadian 
society to be put out there without any type of substantiation 
whatsoever.
<P>
	It is very dangerous to stand in the House of Commons and 
give a speech that lends credibility to an argument that has 
absolutely no foundation in fact. The problem is not that 
immigrants are becoming an undue burden on our major cities. 
The reality is that more immigrants with different skin colours 
are coming to Canada from places like Asia. That seems to be 
the problem I hear. I would like the member to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment certainly 
on what the hon. member has said.
<P>
	You say that I have no substantiation in that I repeated 
something in the paper. The substantiation I have is that it is in 
the paper. The public perception is there. What are we going to 
do about it? I would challenge you on your substantiation of the 
numbers that are now used for the immigration policy. There is 
no basis for those numbers in the world, except Canada, or in 
proven studies.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would please ask members to try to 
say ``the member'' rather than ``you''. It is supposed to lower 
the temperature and I think we will all benefit if we use that 
method.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to participate in the debate following the first 
budget presentation in this, the 35th Parliament. My 
constituents expect me to bring some new perspective and sanity 
to how government spends the taxpayers' dollars and to what 
effect and purpose.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	My west coast riding covers one half of Vancouver Island's 
coastline as well as one half of the mainland coastline of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	My riding generates major wealth. Its contribution to our 
gross domestic product is one of the country's highest, if not the 
highest. It is a resource based economy. We have five pulp mills 
with the two fastest papermaking machines in Canada, logging, 
three major mines, sawmills, fisheries and a highly developed 
tourism industry.
<P>
	My constituents contribute in a big way to the wealth of this 
country but do not enjoy the level of services provided in other 
parts of this country. It is not a question of more government 
employees. We already average 8,000 federal, provincial and 
municipal government employees per riding in Canada. What is 
required is downsizing, better deployment of employees and 
priorizing of services.
<P>
	The federal government has cut jobs such as lighthouse 
keepers and federal fisheries officers, the very people and 
institutions which deliver services in the field in an 
irreplaceable way. We all know that reductions in services and 
employees should be in middle and upper management, not in 
the field.
<P>
	There are indications that the federal government is 
considering closing the fisheries offices in small coastline 
communities in my riding. This policy is totally contradictory to 
the government's pledge for example to maintain rural post 
offices in Canada and is detrimental to hands-on enforcement 
and habitat measures. These policy decisions send a strong 
negative signal to these rural communities. It also sends a signal 
to the people who ask if the federal government has the 
competence to manage this resource''.
<P>
	It is the only resource managed by the feds and they cannot 
even get it right. The sports and commercial fisheries ask: 
``Where are the enforcement, habitat and budgetary priorities of 
fisheries and oceans going?'' The demise of the east coast 
fishery is on the minds of everyone.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the budget document. It is very 
disappointing to me and my constituents to deal with the 
fisheries issues I have just articulated in the face of increased 
federal spending. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2102"> 2102 </A></B>
<P>
At the same time the  government projects 8 per cent growth in 
revenue after a drop in revenue last year. This is absurd.
<P>
	Allow me to put the national debt into a constituency 
perspective. The Powell River area's cost of servicing national 
debt allocated on a pro rata basis is $17 million per year. This 
money is blown out the window. The entire cost of local services 
provided by the Powell River area for police, fire, garbage, 
water, sewer, sidewalks, streets and all those other valued local 
services also runs at $17 million per year. If this does not point 
out the profligacy and penalty of federal spending, I do not know 
what does.
<P>
	Incidentally, similar national debt comparisons can be made 
for other local governments in my riding such as Campbell 
River. Our local B.C. governments do not run deficits by 
legislation. The debt and deficit are weakening confederation 
and the federal government is in danger of becoming impotent. 
This government had better get its act together on spending 
decreases. No tax increase during the life of this Parliament is 
essential.
<P>
	Allow me to turn to the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development. Most government departments had a 3 
per cent cap in the growth rate of departmental budgets in the 
last Parliament. The department of Indian affairs has enjoyed 
exclusivity from this policy. The budget of this department 
should be frozen at 1993-94 levels at the very least.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Since the 1988-89 fiscal year, the departmental budget of 
Indian affairs has increased $1.6 billion, averaging a $275 
million increase every year. This fiscal year departmental 
spending is projected to increase $396 million over fiscal 
1993-94, representing an increase of 8.6 per cent. Compare this 
with the Environment Canada total operating budget of $737 
million. The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development increase is almost half of its total budget.
<P>
	Is there anyone who believes that these spending increases are 
sustainable or can be attributed to demographics? According to 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
there are 997,000 people in the aboriginal population in Canada. 
Total federal aboriginal spending now exceeds $7 billion or 
$28,000 per family of four. I ask if this spending has brought our 
aboriginal peoples any closer to self-sufficiency.
<P>
	The myriad of programs and services provided by other 
government departments for Indian affairs confuses an already 
complex situation regarding programs and their delivery.
<P>
	One does not have to look far to find examples of a lack of 
accountability within the Indian affairs department. For over 20 
years the Auditor General has been raising concerns over the 
management of programs and delivery of services by Indian 
affairs. In his 1993 report, the Canadian aboriginal economic 
development strategy is cited as a function where lack of 
appropriate  performance and evaluation information impedes 
the necessary accountability within the aboriginal communities 
and between the government and Parliament. This has cost the 
taxpayer approximately $1 billion since 1989.
<P>
	The Auditor General went on to say that the department could 
not demonstrate that it was meeting the strategy's objectives.
<P>
	As another example in 1992-93 Canada's status Indians and 
Inuit received non-insured health benefits totalling $422 
million administered by the Department of National Health and 
Welfare. The Auditor General's 1993 report states that the cost 
of this program could have been reduced by $85 million or 20 
per cent if the benefits had been provided in accordance with 
national program directives and principles.
<P>
	The Auditor General concludes that the information provided 
to him on the program continues to fall far short of reasonable 
and adequate disclosure.
<P>
	It is evident that reforms must be initiated. A Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development budget freeze at 
1993-94 levels would stimulate activity in priority setting in a 
long overdue way. The current situation stifles creativity.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the first budget 
of this government announced on February 22 by my colleague, 
the hon. Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This budget deserves the support of this House because it 
provides a solid framework which will both stimulate economic 
growth and set the course for long term fiscal restraint and 
responsibility. As the member for Edmonton Northwest, I am 
very encouraged by this budget. It addresses those issues that 
the residents of my riding raised with me during the election, 
issues of job creation, deficit reduction and meaningful reforms 
to Canada's social programs.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	In addition, there are several announcements concerning the 
activities of my department, Natural Resources Canada, that I 
wish to highlight.
<P>
	First I wish to discuss aspects of the budget which affect my 
constituents in the riding of Edmonton Northwest. The 
unemployment rate in Edmonton Northwest is high. However, 
with this budget the government will help restore hope and 
prosperity not only to the residents of Edmonton but to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	A key component in restoring this hope and prosperity will be 
the creation of jobs by the private sector. In my riding as in many 
others these jobs will be created primarily by small businesses. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2103"> 2103 </A></B>
<P>
For example, mine is a riding of small businesses. There are 
over 5,000 such businesses creating employment in my riding.
<P>
	This budget recognizes the importance of small business, 
supports its further growth and encourages its natural creativity 
and initiative. For example we have cut back on premiums for 
unemployment insurance. That will save businesses $300 
million a year which they can now reinvest in new jobs. The 
government will consult with banks for the first time to develop 
a code of conduct for small business lending.
<P>
	The budget also creates Canada business service centres in 
every province to facilitate contact with our government. It 
establishes the Canada investment fund to streamline badly 
needed access to venture capital for small enterprises.
<P>
	In addition this budget addresses the badly needed reform of 
our social programs. Our social security system was designed 
for a different era and no longer meets Canadians' needs. We 
have hundreds of thousands of Canadians who are unemployed, 
underemployed or stuck on social assistance, who see unfairness 
and disincentives in the system and who live in poverty.
<P>
	We will undertake this reform of Canada's social programs 
through a wide ranging process of consultation involving other 
levels of government, the private sector, members of Parliament 
and their constituents. There will be numerous opportunities 
over the next few months for constituents in Edmonton and 
elsewhere to participate in this process and I encourage them to 
do so.
<P>
	Now I would like to turn to another key component of the 
budget, deficit reduction.
<P>
	As stated by my colleague, the Minister of Finance, the 
budget reduces the deficit from $45.7 billion in 1993-94 to 
$39.7 billion in 1994-95 and $32.7 billion in 1995-96. In terms 
of spending cuts this is the most significant budget we have seen 
in this country in 10 years.
<P>
	One of the key components of the deficit reduction program is 
major cuts in defence spending, some $1.9 billion over the next 
three years. The budget contained the announcement that 21 
defence facilities across Canada would be closed or 
restructured. While these decisions were not easy they are an 
example of the tough choices this government has promised to 
make to get our spending under control.
<P>
	In Alberta alone the net saving which will be achieved 
through cuts in defence spending is approximately $44 million 
annually. We in Edmonton with a proud and long military 
tradition know that we must do our part to ensure an efficient 
and effective yet streamlined military force.
<P>
	At CFB Edmonton several operations will be transferred out, 
including the search and rescue squadron to Yellowknife and the 
air transport squadron to Trenton and Winnipeg. These and other 
operational changes will result in a net saving of approximately 
$36 million annually.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time the Lord Strathcona Horse Brigade will be 
transferred from CFB Calgary to CFB Edmonton. By reducing 
the transit time to the main training area for these troops at 
Camp Wainwright and by closing the Harvery barracks, this 
move represents a saving of $6 million annually to taxpayers. In 
addition, the closure of CFB Penhold will achieve another $2 
million in annual savings.
<P>
	The government believes that our defence infrastructure has 
far exceeded for many years any probable and reasonable 
defence needs. The announcements of reductions reflect the 
realities of the nineties that with the end of the cold war 
Canada's military presence must be rethought and reconfigured.
<P>
	The budget also focuses on achieving greater equality in 
social conditions for all Canadians. In this budget we see 
investments made in women's health care issues, the well-being 
of children, young Canadians and aboriginal peoples. These 
issues are very important to me as they are to many in my riding.
<P>
	I am very pleased to note several announcements which 
follow from our promises to Canadians in the red book. The 
budget provides funding for a centre of excellence for women's 
health, a prenatal program for low income pregnant women, an 
aboriginal head start program, a new youth service corps and 
youth internship and apprenticeship programs.
<P>
	I believe these programs are long overdue in terms of 
responding to the needs of these groups and individuals. The 
introduction of these initiatives demonstrates that this 
government is committed to the equality of all Canadians.
<P>
	Further, these programs represent a key step toward meeting 
the challenge which the Minister of Finance identified in his 
budget speech, the challenge to construct responsible social 
programs which are affordable.
<P>
	Several aspects of the Minister of Finance's announcements 
will have a direct effect on the women of this country. For 
example, I would like to note that the package of reforms to the 
unemployment insurance program will help the women of 
Canada. As the Minister of Finance said, it is often women who 
bear the brunt of social stress and economic dislocation.
<P>
	He said that during our budget consultations a number of 
issues were raised regarding disparities in the tax and income 
support systems.
<P>
	Specifically, while the unemployment insurance benefit rate 
will be reduced to 55 per cent, the rate will be 60 per cent for 
individuals with modest incomes who support children or older 
parents. Many of those people are single mothers. There will be 
amendments to the provisions governing workers who quit their 
jobs voluntarily or are fired for misconduct. This acknowledges 
the concerns of the many women who  voice their opposition to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2104"> 2104 </A></B>
<P>
the introduction of these provisions by the previous 
government.
<P>
	Furthermore, I am very pleased to note that the Minister of 
Finance announced that he will act on the recommendations of 
the federal-provincial family law committee which has been 
studying the issue of tax treatment of child support payments 
and the related issues of their levels and enforcement.
<P>
	While these measures respond to the specific needs of 
Canadian women, they also respond to the pressing need to 
reform Canada's outdated social security system to ensure that 
system builds bridges to work and that system encourages 
independence, not dependence.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also discusses in the budget a number 
of measures which will create economic renewal and 
revitalization, including the infrastructure program. In Alberta 
total investment in infrastructure development and 
enhancement and job creation will be $518 million. The creation 
of both short and long term employment, particularly in centres 
with high unemployment such as Edmonton, comes as welcome 
news.
<P>
	Moreover, the infrastructure program will improve national, 
provincial and local competitiveness and help promote 
improved environmental quality.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, I know that the Edmonton city council is 
considering a number of projects, including the construction of 
a major roadway interchange along a truck route, improvements 
to the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant and the extension of 
its river valley park system.
<P>
	Such programs will help to ensure that Edmonton not only 
remains a good place to conduct business, but also that its 
citizens continue to enjoy a high quality of life.
<P>
	I have addressed some aspects of the budget which directly 
affect my constituents in Edmonton Northwest. Now I would 
like to turn to issues which deal with my responsibilities as 
Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	Let me emphasize the fact that Canada's natural resource 
sectors are industrial cornerstones of Canada's economy. 
Through our general economic policies and the work of my 
department this government is committed to ensuring that the 
energy, mining and forestry sectors continue to provide jobs for 
Canadians, stimulating the economies of hundreds of 
communities in all regions of this nation and continuing to 
contribute to Canada's positive balance of trade.
<P>
	Before I discuss specific budget announcements affecting 
these industrial sectors I would like to address two key concerns 
identified by Albertans in discussions leading up to this budget. 
First, the federal government's acting unilaterally to impose a 
carbon tax was of great concern to some Albertans prior to the 
budget speech. The Minister of Finance did not impose a carbon 
tax.
<P>
	In addition, the Minister of Finance did not reduce tax rebates 
for privately owned utilities.
<P>
	One of the things this new government will accentuate is a 
partnership approach with all key stakeholders such as other 
levels of government, industry, labour, et cetera. Gone are the 
days when governments could impose solutions without 
consulting with those who will be most affected.
<P>
	The goal of the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act, also 
known inelegantly as PUITTA, is to reduce interprovincial tax 
disparities and provide a balanced playing field for crown and 
investor owned utilities and their customers wherever they are 
located in Canada.
<P>
	The principal beneficiaries of PUITTA are those provinces 
with investor owned utilities of which Alberta, Nova Scotia and 
Prince Edward Island are the main examples. Under the PUITTA 
legislation the federal government rebates 85.5 per cent of the 
federal income taxes paid by investor owned utility companies 
back to the provinces.
<P>
	The government is not abolishing PUITTA but merely 
extending the current restraint on its growth. Albertans are not 
being targeted. Their utilities receive better treatment from the 
federal government than from their own provincial government.
<P>
	In 1990 the Alberta government abolished its own equivalent 
of the federal PUITTA program.
<P>
	I would like to turn now to the changes affecting class 34, 
capital cost allowances. First, I should explain that class 34 
allowed the right-off of certain equipment used in 
co-generation, the recovery of waste heat and renewable energy, 
including active solar heating, small hydro, energy from wood 
and municipal wastes and wind energy.
<P>
	In this budget class 34 has been eliminated and we have 
created a new and expanded class. Class 34 was created in 1976 
and was designed to encourage business and industry to reduce 
energy waste and use renewable energy sources.
<P>
	On the energy efficiency side many of the standards used 
under class 34 were based on the technology of the seventies. 
Since the purpose of the tax write-off mechanism is to 
encourage the use of leading edge technology the standards 
needed to be revised, and accordingly the new class does just 
that.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	On the renewable energy side we have created a new class that 
now has expanded to include three new renewable energy 
sources. Photovoltaic energy, geothermal energy for electricity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2105"> 2105 </A></B>
<P>
production and methane from landfill sites and sewage 
treatment facilities are now included in the new class.
<P>
	The initiatives under this new class will contribute to the 
government's greenhouse gas emission objectives. In addition, 
the government is examining a variety of measures under the 
national air issues co-ordination mechanism. This examination 
includes several measures to increase the use of renewable 
energy in Canada.
<P>
	There has been criticism about the fact that this budget does 
not do anything to improve the prospects for mineral 
exploration in Canada. First of all, the Liberal Party of Canada 
was the only federal party to have a platform on mining during 
the election campaign.
<P>
	Let me also point out that this budget was one of the first in 
years to address the concerns of the mining and mineral industry 
in this country. The tax changes concerning mine reclamation, 
which I will discuss in a few moments, prove that this 
government is committed to the future of this industry in 
Canada.
<P>
	The mining policy mapped out by my party notes the serious 
economic implications of Canada's declining ore reserves due to 
inadequate grass roots exploration. The Minister of Finance has 
listened carefully to my concerns regarding the ore reserve and 
mineral exploration issues.
<P>
	He has also carefully considered concerns registered by 
organizations such as Save Our North, the Prospectors and 
Developers Association of Canada and various regional 
prospectors and developers associations. However, the 
government's immediate agenda for taking action to stimulate 
mineral exploration and other desirable economic activity must 
take into account constraints imposed by the country's current 
fiscal situation.
<P>
	I should also point out that this issue is being examined 
through a consultative process called the Whitehorse mining 
initiative. This initiative, as I know members are aware, is 
driven by industry and includes federal, provincial and 
territorial governments, native peoples, environmental groups 
and other related stakeholders.
<P>
	Mining has been a significant factor in this country's 
economic growth since before its very inception. As I mentioned 
earlier, the mining industry has demonstrated its commitment to 
Canada through the development of the Whitehorse mining 
initiative. Late last September the industry launched an 
impressive public information campaign called ``Keep Mining 
in Canada'' which my department enthusiastically supports.
<P>
	In this campaign's ten point plan the industry called on 
government to change the tax laws on mine reclamation funding 
to encourage investment in new mines. Briefly, mine 
reclamation is the process of decommissioning and 
rehabilitating mine sites following closure and the termination 
of production. It involves restoring the site to the same or better 
state than existed prior to the development of the mine. As I am 
sure members can appreciate, this often costly process supports 
our commitment to sustainable development.
<P>
	By bringing in changes to the mine reclamation tax fund 
regulations, the Minister of Finance has created greater equity 
in the tax system. The government has taken a position that is 
fair to both small and large companies. Smaller single mine 
companies are put on a level playing field with large mining 
corporations.
<P>
	With the new measure such small companies will be able to 
take the deduction up front to the extent that they are required by 
provincial governments to make payments into mine 
reclamation funds.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	In short, the measure the Minister of Finance has taken is 
good for environmental protection. It has brought greater 
equality into the income tax system and has increased the cash 
flow of large and small mining companies.
<P>
	This measure also represents an annual investment of about 
$15 million by the Government of Canada in our mining 
industry. I believe this measure addresses some of the concerns 
raised by the Keep Mining in Canada campaign. It also supports 
the improvement of the investment climate without doing 
something which could prove to be fiscally imprudent.
<P>
	I should add the perception that this new measure creates a 
system of double taxation for mining companies is false. While 
fund earnings are taken into taxable income twice, there is a 
corresponding deduction for the amount of reclamation 
expenses. Therefore in reality tax is paid only once on the fund 
earnings.
<P>
	Finally I should emphasize several measures announced by 
the Minister of Finance which have positive benefits for client 
sectors of Natural Resources Canada.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier the reduction of UI premiums is 
estimated to provide businesses with some $300 million to put 
people back to work. I believe this will spur job creation in small 
businesses engaged in energy, mining and forestry activities 
throughout this country.
<P>
	The establishment of the youth corps is also expected to 
provide young Canadians with the opportunity to gain valuable 
on the job experience in our forestry sector. The apprenticeship 
program will enable other young Canadians to get valuable 
experience in all three sectors supported by my department.
<P>
	The technology network represents a first step toward 
improving the linkage between federal government research and 
development institutes, universities and the private sector. That 
linkage will be extremely important as every country in the 
world seeks to set up electronic highways to improve its 
competitive edge.
<P>
	Besides the potential increase in demand for forestry products 
the residential rehabilitation assistance program may also 
increase demand for energy efficient products that have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2106"> 2106 </A></B>
<P>
developed by industry in co-operation with my department's 
research and technology arm, CANMET.
<P>
	The redefinition of Canada's involvement in space will boost 
our commitment to the continued development of Canada's 
expertise in remote sensing. As members know the Canada 
Centre for Remote Sensing which is a division of the surveys, 
mapping and remote sensing sector of my department was 
almost single-handedly responsible for the push in the early 
1970s to develop our expertise in the field of space.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see that my time is almost up.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I was just going to ask the 
hon. minister if she could give me some assistance and possibly 
indicate as to how much longer she might be.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Two minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent for the minister to conclude her remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, these last two points I have 
raised only begin to scratch the surface of my department in 
terms of its importance in the development of Canada's science 
and technology expertise.
<P>
	I can assure members of this House that Natural Resources 
Canada is committed to greater efficiency in its operations in 
order to maximize its contribution to Canada's science and 
technology capabilities which are key to our future prospects for 
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	In closing, as the member for Edmonton Northwest and 
Minister of Natural Resources, I urge this House to fully support 
the announcements my colleague the hon. Minister of Finance 
has made concerning this government's first budget.
<P>
	Canada faces serious challenges as we move together toward 
the next century. I believe these measures provide an extremely 
positive and useful series of first steps to get this country on the 
road to a more competitive standing in global markets and to get 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
	Much has been said about this government's commitment to 
the concept of sustainable development. It is clear we must 
move carefully to achieve a balance in decision making between 
environmental and economic objectives.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	At this time our movement toward sustainable development 
must progress carefully. We know very well that the wrong 
signals to the marketplace will have a drastic effect on our 
ability to encourage environmental sensitivity. All Canadians 
must work to balance environmental and economic objectives. It 
is that simple.
<P>
	In conclusion this budget will rekindle that confidence. It is 
the kind of confidence this country needs to get hundreds of 
thousands of Canadians back to work and to fulfil their desire to 
make a positive contribution to the future of this great nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think the 
Secretary of State for Human Resources really understands what 
the budget does. At least not the way I understand it. I do not see 
how she, as the Secretary of State for Human Resources, could 
let the Minister of Finance increase unemployment insurance 
premiums by $800 million. And since she is supposed to help 
Canadians who need assistance, I wonder why she let the 
Minister of Finance raise the minimum entrance requirement 
and reduce the number of weeks during which claimants can 
collect benefits. It seems to me that the minister does not have a 
great deal of influence with the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	She also talked about research and development. I may 
remind her that at this very moment, $1 billion more is being 
spent annually on research and development in Ontario than in 
Quebec. I hope that from now on she will monitor the situation 
closely and ensure that funding is distributed more equitably.
<P>
	She also mentioned infrastructures and the many jobs this will 
create. I say it will not happen, because increasing 
unemployment insurance premiums by $800 million means that 
consumers will have that amount less to spend. The government 
reduces our purchasing power by $800 million but allocates $1 
billion for infrastructures, which means zilch for job creation.
<P>
	It is clear this budget is not about job creation but job 
reduction.
<P>
	Furthermore, corporate taxes will be increased by $1.7 billion 
and individual income tax by $1.8 million, over the next three 
years.
<P>
	If the government thinks this is going to create jobs, I think 
the reverse will happen. That is why I completely disagree with 
the secretary of state. And now for my main question, which 
concerns her directly. Considering her responsibilities in this 
area, how could she let the Minister of Finance raise 
unemployment insurance premiums for the current year and 
reduce unemployment insurance benefits? In other words, how 
can she let the Minister of Finance do the exact opposite of what 
she should be doing in her own department, which is to improve 
the well-being of Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps my hon. colleague is 
under some misapprehension as to who I am and what I do. I am 
not the secretary of state for human resources. I am the 
Ministerof Natural Resources. There is a difference, although I 
take the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2107"> 2107 </A></B>
<P>
point that perhaps our greatest natural resource in this country is 
our people.  Having said that I will respond to a couple of the 
comments made by my learned colleague.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	In relation to his concern about unemployment insurance as 
my comments indicated the reforms of this system are ongoing. 
There will be a far reaching consultative process with 
Canadians. In the interim however we have targeted those 
people most in need to ensure that their benefits are increased. 
Those most in need with modest incomes, with dependents be 
they children, elderly parents or disabled family members, are 
going to see their benefits increase to 60 per cent.
<P>
	In relation to the hon. member's concern about jobs and job 
creation this government believes the single greatest engine of 
job creation in this country will be small business.
<P>
	I reiterate those steps the Minister of Finance and this 
government have taken to encourage small business to create 
more jobs. The Minister of Finance offered small business a 
challenge in his budget. I have no reason to believe that the 
small businesses will not take that challenge and create tens of 
thousands of new jobs across this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, in her 
concluding remarks in answer to the previous question the 
minister said she had every reason to believe business is going to 
take up this challenge and create hundreds of thousands of new 
jobs. Why then do we actually need an infrastructure program 
which is going to cost the taxpayers another $6 billion?
<P>
	The minister asked us to endorse the budget that was brought 
down by the Minister of Finance. In her speech she talked about 
creating jobs through small business. Why do we need a $6 
billion infrastructure program that loads more taxes and more 
debt on the taxpayer? We have argued for a long time to start 
reducing taxes and allow business to do its job and that is how 
we will start creating employment.
<P>
	In her remarks on unemployment insurance she was taking 
great credit for the fact that government is reducing UI 
premiums. Remember however that on January 1 the 
government increased the UI and now is taking it back. The net 
result is absolutely zero. For the government to take credit for 
reducing the UI premiums I think is false on its part.
<P>
	The hon. minister talks about the budget, taking great credit 
for reducing the deficit to $32 billion. By the minister's own 
admission it will drop on its own to $41 billion this coming year.
<P>
	Why is the minister asking for our support when the Minister 
of Finance brought down a dismal budget? It has not been 
accepted by Canadians and Canadians recognize that 
government has not even started to address the deficit problem, 
adding another $100 billion in debt.
<P>
	Will the minister please explain why we should support the 
budget as brought down by the minister because I do not think 
we should.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, in relation to the infrastructure 
program and small businesses, small businesses will create jobs. 
What do small businesses need to create those jobs-renovated 
and rebuilt infrastructure. They need good public 
transportation, good roads, good sewer systems, cleaner air. 
That is what they need to compete with their competitors around 
the world.
<P>
	It is interesting that our major global competitors, Germany, 
Japan and the United States, are contributing billions and 
billions of dollars over the next 10 years to renovate their public 
infrastructure. Why? They know it is a public responsibility to 
provide the foundation, the bricks and the mortar, so businesses 
can then do the job they do best which is to create wealth and put 
people back to work.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	That is why this government, with its commitment to long 
term thinking, is making this short term commitment to the 
renovation of this country's infrastructure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House today to speak on 
behalf on the citizens of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead about 
the budget tabled recently by the Minister of Finance. Let me 
assure you that my constituents, like Quebecers and Canadians 
everywhere, have become acquainted with the measures 
contained in the budget and, like the Official Opposition, are 
extremely concerned about the budget's implications on their 
day-to-day lives.
<P>
	In the past few days, as I was thinking about what I would say 
on the subject, the front page of the Saturday, March 5 edition of 
<I>La Tribune</I> caught my attention. In fact, two headlines caught 
my attention. I would just like to mention that <I>La Tribune</I> is 
owned by the Power Corporation. It has no ties to the Bloc 
Quebecois and is in no way sympathetic to the Bloc's position. I 
would invite my colleagues on both sides of the House to 
subscribe to this daily which, I might add, focusses on the 
Eastern Townships. On reading the editorial page, they will see 
that this newspaper has nothing in common with the usual stands 
taken by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	As I said, this daily newspaper is sold in the Eastern 
Townships and outside this region. So, naturally it also reports 
on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2108"> 2108 </A></B>
<P>
goings-on in the riding of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead 
which I am honoured to represent in this House.
<P>
	As I was saying, two headlines in the newspaper caught my 
attention. The first one, which I would like to show to my 
colleagues, proclaimed the following: ``Record Number of 
Social Welfare Recipients''.
<P>
	Last January, 21,539 people in my region received 
unemployment insurance benefits, according to statistics 
supplied by the Department of Human Resources Development. 
How in all conscience can we speak of human resources 
development in the face of such a high level of unemployment? 
In addition, 17,600 people received social welfare benefits 
during the same period. These figures do not include dependants 
of unemployment insurance and welfare recipients. In reality, 
what all of this means is that 28.6 per cent of the region's labour 
force is unemployed.
<P>
	The 1994-95 budget launches an assault on the least 
fortunate, the very group that the Liberal government and its 
Minister of Finance profess to staunchly defend.
<P>
	The second headline in this newspaper was a statement made 
by the Prime Minister of Canada which earned-the statement 
that is, not the headline-the applause of 700 people attending a 
luncheon given by the Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce. I 
assume that very few unemployed people must have attended 
that luncheon. The Prime Minister is quoted in this article as 
saying: ``Stop complaining. The time has come to stop whining, 
to forget about the Constitution and think about creating jobs''. 
He goes on to say: ``Stop whining-you know what I am talking 
about-and you will make progress''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's comments show unacceptable scorn 
towards the thousands of people who find themselves 
unemployed, not because of their own iniquity but mostly 
because of mismanagement by all federal governments of the 
last 20 years, in particular that of Pierre Elliott Trudeau in 
which, as Minister of Finance, the current Prime Minister was 
one of those who started the monstrous deficit spiral that has led 
to a debt of over $500 billion.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	However, we understand why the Prime Minister drew 
applause from the richest members of our society, since this 
government has not touched the outrageous family trust system.
<P>
	I want to point out another perverse effect of this budget on 
unemployment insurance. I refer to the study done by three 
economists from Quebec University in Montreal, Pierre Fortin, 
Pierre-Yves Crémieux and Marc Van Audenrode. What are the 
conclusions drawn by these economists?
<P>
	They point out that the new unemployment insurance 
measures are generally more stringent than the 1990 Tory 
reform that caused an outcry among members of the current 
Liberal government then in opposition, and make the 
unemployed bear the burden of the unemployment insurance 
reform now under way, which represents 60 per cent of the new 
budget cuts announced by this government.
<P>
	According to these three economists from Quebec, the new 
cuts are in the order of $4.1 billion, $2.4 billion of which comes 
from savings made possible by the changes to the 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	In the face of such measures, how can we assume that the 
government is acting in good faith when it claims it wants to 
improve income security programs through an extensive reform 
process and when, even before knowing the first thing about this 
reform, we already know that this government intends to make 
cuts of between $5 billion and $6 billion in unemployment 
insurance and who knows how much in the Canada Assistance 
Plan? Only yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Prime Minister announced outside this 
House that they would make cuts not only in unemployment 
insurance and social assistance but also in old age security 
pensions.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the Minister of Finance to intercede with 
the Prime Minister to make him show more compassion towards 
the disadvantaged and more common sense in the administration 
of federal affairs. If the government really wants to save $280 
million at Quebec's expense, it only has to put Quebec in charge 
of managing job training programs, as all Quebec stakeholders 
are asking; it will thus save $250 million a year while ensuring 
that job-seekers receive better services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the following question: Does he 
believe that the victims, whom he mentioned in his speech, are 
the result of policies of the former Conservative government or 
are they victims of the policies of the new Liberal government, 
which has been in office for a little over four months? Of whose 
policies are they the victims? That is my first question. I would 
like to have a very honest answer to a very specific question.
<P>
	The second question I would like to ask is as follows. He 
mentioned that the Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Hon. 
Jean Chrétien, made a speech where he said that we need to have 
a positive attitude and stop whining and so on.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Does he really believe that this Prime Minister was targeting 
people who are unemployed or on welfare? Frankly, that is what 
I understood, and if that is the message he was sending, I am 
very, very disappointed, because no member and no party in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2109"> 2109 </A></B>
<P>
House, be it the  Prime Minister or anyone else, would wish such 
a misfortune on anyone. If I am wrong, let him correct me; if I 
am right, I would like him to withdraw that comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will first answer my colleague's first question, in 
which he refers to his government's responsibility for the state 
of the Canadian economy. I come back to what I just said in the 
last ten minutes, something that is mentioned very eloquently in 
the study done by economists at the Université du Québec. I 
remember the figures given in this study by the economists, 
which incidentally was published in the newspaper <I>La Presse</I> 
last Monday:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal budget provides for a net deficit reduction of $8 billion in 
1995-96. However, slightly less than half of this had already been proposed by 
the previous Conservative budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The new Liberal cuts are thus about $4.1 billion. Of this amount, $2.4 billion is 
from savings made through changes to the unemployment insurance program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So the responsibility belongs both to the previous government 
and to the present government, because in fact just the label has 
changed from Conservative to Liberal but the measures are the 
same.
<P>
	So, yes, the present government bears some responsibility for 
the drastic economic situation in which we find ourselves. As I 
said, the present Prime Minister, when he was Minister of 
Finance some 15 years ago and more, was one of those who 
started this deficit tragedy which means that today we have a 
debt of over $500 billion.
<P>
	On the second point, I will answer my colleague that I believe 
that people in all parties are sincere when they feel sorry for the 
unemployed and welfare recipients throughout Canada, except 
that a government is judged by its deeds and its actions.
<P>
	In this budget, dear colleague, the cuts being made are aimed 
at the unemployed. Again, I take the example of family trusts, 
on which nothing is being done, although they could 
immediately have obtained large amounts from them.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister or members of the government are not 
talking about the unemployed when they say to stop 
complaining, I would like them to tell me whom they are talking 
about. The unemployed people whom I met in my riding last 
week feel these remarks were meant for them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth 
day of debate on the 1994-95 budget. According to this budget, 
expenditures will reach $160.7 billion, which is $39.7 billion 
more than the anticipated revenue.
<P>
	While the expected deficit should be 0.2 per cent lower than in 
1993-94, it still remains an enormous burden for Canadians, and 
particularly for the middle-class and the poor.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, this budget asks the unemployed to tighten their belts 
even more. It asks the middle class to forget about salary 
increases, even though this has been the case for the last four 
years. It asks the elderly to accept smaller pensions. It asks 
small businesses to still wait for an economic recovery which 
will come of course when the recession ends. It asks 
municipalities which, in many cases, cannot afford it, to get 
even more into debts to improve their infrastructure and create a 
few thousand temporary jobs.
<P>
	However, this budget reassures the well-to-do by 
maintaining most of the benefits which will enable them to 
increase their wealth as well as the gap between them and their 
less fortunate fellow Canadians. The rich will continue to get 
richer by taking advantage of tax shelters. Wealthy families will 
continue to avoid paying taxes, thanks to the maintenance of 
family trusts. Similarly, major corporations will continue to 
cash in millions in non-taxable profits, thanks to tax havens. 
The 90,000 companies which, in 1987, realized profits of $27 
billion without paying any taxes, according to professor 
Léopold Lauzon, will carry on their operations without having 
anything to fear from the tax man. The underground economy 
will be able to continue to prosper.
<P>
	Yet, according to the Association of Canadian Distillers, 
liquor smuggling alone results in an annual loss of $1.2 billion 
for the various governments in Canada. Last November, Gallup 
conducted a survey to ask Quebecers and Canadians if they had 
contributed to the underground economy in the 12 previous 
months. Thirty-three per cent of Canadians and 42 per cent of 
Quebecers candidly admitted to having paid cash for purchases, 
so as to avoid paying applicable taxes.
<P>
	In fact, it looks as though it is perfectly acceptable to promote 
the emergence of two classes of citizens: the poor who have 
trouble meeting their basic needs, and the rich who live the life 
of Riley. The noble definition of just society advocated by the 
federal Liberals since the days of Mr. Trudeau has very little to 
do with the reality experienced by Canadians as well as with 
their perception of that notion.
<P>
	The deficit is a chronic problem for which the federal 
government is the primary responsible, since close to 80 per 
cent of the total public debt in Canada is attributable to it. Yet, 
the Auditor General tells us that, for several years now, the 
federal government has been doing a rather good job of 
monitoring its budgetary expenditures. This was also the case at 
the end of the Conservative administration. So where is the 
problem?
<P>
	To understand the root of the problem, you have to realize that 
this federal debt results from the accumulation of deficits over 
time. If we look at the evolution of the deficit in relation to the 
GDP, we can see that the debt really grew primarily under 
Liberal governments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2110"> 2110 </A></B>
<P>
	Indeed, from 1970 to 1985, the debt-over-GDP ratio went 
from a surplus of 0.3 per cent to a deficit of 8.5 per cent, an 
all-time record.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Usually, increases in budgetary revenues tend to follow a rise 
in GDP. However, during the 1992-93 fiscal year, the federal 
government's budgetary revenues fell by 0.41 per cent, despite 
an increase of 2.6 per cent in GDP during the same period.
<P>
	The trend has continued. According to the forecasts of the 
Department of Finance, budgetary revenues will decline by 3.74 
per cent or $4.592 billion during the 1993-94 fiscal year. This 
was abundantly confirmed by the results for the first eight 
months of the current fiscal year, since federal budgetary 
revenues were down 5.2 per cent, from the same period in the 
previous fiscal year.
<P>
	During the second and third quarters of 1993, GDP increased 
3.6 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively, on an annual basis. 
The decline in revenue is largely attributable to a decline in 
personal income tax payable, another indication Canadians' 
fiscal threshold had been reached.
<P>
	Despite the extent of the deficit and the national debt, 
Canadian taxpayers may be willing to make additional 
sacrifices, provided all members of society and all economic 
partners do their fair share. And also provided that those 
sacrifices will be used solely to improve their individual and 
collective economic situation. As a guarantee to Canadians that 
this will indeed be the case and that the objective will be 
achieved, the government should immediately put in place 
mechanisms that will inform Canadians quickly and accurately 
on the state of the economy.
<P>
	Since so many complex factors are involved, it is not easy for 
the average person to get a clear picture of the country's 
financial situation. Since the experts often disagree on the best 
way to deal with the economic situation, I realize it must be hard 
for the average citizen to weigh his own immediate interests 
against the broader, long-term interests of the country.
<P>
	However, we must not underestimate the ability of average 
Canadians to make up their own minds if they are given clear 
and precise information or a number of simple indicators. As 
was pointed out by the Auditor General in Chapter 5 of his report 
to the House of Commons, it is important the government 
provide Canadians and their elective representatives with the 
appropriate tools they need to grasp the essence of the problem.
<P>
	Simple tools and periodic information must be made available 
to Canadians so that they can evaluate the government's 
forecasts and its achievements. Any discrepancies between the 
two should be explained to them.
<P>
	Canadians must be told with delay about the impact their 
future choices will have. For example, if it had been properly 
explained to them that the revisions to the 1992 economic plan 
made in the 1993 budget would mean an $8 billion increase in 
the projected deficit for 1993, if they had been told clearly that 
this would translate into an increase of $65 billion in the total 
debt six years down the road, then they would have understood 
that the government's objectives sometimes have considerable 
future cost implications.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The more Canadians know about the state of the government's 
finances, the less chance they have of being taken in by 
questionable interests. Better still, they will understand when 
the time comes to make difficult decisions.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me just say that if this government honestly 
believes that it can achieve the economic and financial goals set 
out in this budget, then it should have the courage of its 
convictions and immediately provide the public with adequate 
evaluation mechanisms so that all Canadians can judge for 
themselves well before the next election whether they made the 
right choice when they democratically elected this government.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the member 
opposite that I was quite surprised when he was delivering his 
budget remarks that he did not mention the two initiatives he 
talked about in his prebudget speech. He asked the government 
to make sure these were included in the budget speech.
<P>
	I refer to the speech the member gave on the budget day 
consultation when he talked passionately and convincingly 
about the necessity to maintain the homebuyers permanent plan, 
allowing first time homeowners to buy homes out of their RRSP 
funds.
<P>
	I remember saying to the member that he made a compelling 
argument.
<P>
	We listened to the member and as he knows that is in the 
budget and I thought it very strange that the member did not 
acknowledge that we on this side of the House had listened to 
him for that idea he put forward.
<P>
	That was a good idea and is part of the comprehensive 
package that this budget is putting forward in trying to put 
people back to work. As the member knows, with low interest 
rates right now this is a period in which young people with 
families could have a chance to get into first time homes. That 
will create jobs for people in trades.
<P>
	That is the thrust we are putting all of our energy into, putting 
people back to work. The member had a very good idea. We 
listened to it and I am surprised he did not acknowledge that the 
Minister of Finance had listened to him.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2111"> 2111 </A></B>
<P>
	To simply focus on some of the problems with the budget in 
terms of the unemployed, just to talk about that, is a bit 
unreasonable. All of us in the House realize this has been a 
tough budget, particularly for those who are unemployed, but 
we are trying to get them back to work.
<P>
	It is very important also that the member should have 
acknowledged some of the things we are doing in this budget for 
small business, particularly the study in the industry committee, 
the study on access to capital for small business. Many of the 
Bloc members are participating constructively.
<P>
	My point is that although there may be room for some 
constructive criticism on this budget, it is also important that the 
opposition recognize some of the good things in this budget.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Our responsibility in this House is to deal in hope for the 
people who are trying to get this economy going. I am 
wondering if the member could maybe acknowledge that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not want the hon. member 
to be too disappointed at not hearing my thanks. I am pleased to 
thank him today because the Liberal Party decided to accept one 
of the many measures which we proposed.
<P>
	Since not many of our suggestions were accepted by the 
Liberals, you will agree that I cannot spend ten minutes thanking 
them. I would rather let the hon. member remind me that he 
congratulated me, and I really appreciated that.
<P>
	As for the other measures, particularly as regards 
unemployment, I want to point out, as I said in my speech, that 
the poor might once again be willing to make an additional and 
ultimate effort. People in our ridings discuss this issue when we 
meet them. If ordinary Canadians could be guaranteed that this 
ultimate effort would eventually help improve their financial 
situation and reduce the deficit, I think that they would be 
willing to make that extra effort, but only on the condition that 
they would not be the only ones to pay. But the government still 
has not given us that guarantee.
<P>
	Indeed, the poor and the middle class are affected, but the 
wealthy have kept their most important privileges. They are 
only affected in a symbolic way. This is what the poor find 
unacceptable. They say: If we are an integral part of this society, 
are we an integral part only when the fiscal burden must be 
shouldered? Are we there only ones to pay? Should we not also 
get some benefits?
<P>
	The humble privilege which should be granted to the poor is 
the right to collect UI benefits when they become unemployed, 
usually involuntarily. Instead, the government decided to 
impose stricter conditions for them to be eligible to UI benefits.
<P>
	I do not think this is the just society which the Liberals were 
so adamant about, and I will be very pleased, in a future speech, 
to thank the hon. member and the government opposite if they 
are willing to accept our numerous other requests.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to join all 
members from both sides of the House today to thank you also 
for your co-operation.
<P>
	I recognize the hon. member for Rosedale.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pride that I rise today to give the first speech in this House in 
which I have the opportunity to speak to the members of this 
House, my colleagues, to some extent about the nature of my 
riding in introducing my observations about the budget.
<P>
	I am very proud to stand here as a representative of the people 
of Rosedale riding and to take the place of a great Liberal who 
was the last Liberal to represent that riding, the Hon. Donald 
Macdonald. I do not say that I will be able to fill his shoes. As I 
am sure you, Mr. Speaker, and his other friends in this House 
will remember, that would be a difficult task both physically and 
mentally.
<P>
	I would like to introduce my remarks by saying to my 
colleagues in the House that the name Rosedale does not entirely 
describe the diversity of the riding. I would like to tell members 
about the diverse areas that we have in our riding. It stretches 
from Davisville to the waterfront and includes such interesting 
areas as Moore Park, Rosedale itself, Cabbagetown, Regent 
Park, Moss Park, Crombie Park and St. Lawrence.
<P>
	In this area are located six major hospitals, two universities, 
part of the University of Toronto and a new university, Ryerson 
University, and other institutions of higher learning.
<P>
	Toronto's financial district, the notorious if I may say that, 
King and Bay area is located there and includes the headquarters 
of five major banks and many other financial institutions. 
Osgoode Hall, the seat of the justice system of the province of 
Ontario, is also located there as are many theatres of local and 
national reputation including the Théâtre Français of Toronto 
and some 18 co-operatives. In addition, I am sure it will be of 
interest to members of this House to know that we also have the 
Riverdale Farm located in the riding. It is perhaps not of enough 
size to give me credibility among my colleagues in the rural 
caucus but is at least a presence and a reminder to the people of 
this urban riding that we too must always be conscious of rural 
issues.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2112"> 2112 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In human terms, we have here a complex urban mixture, a 
microcosm, as other members of this House have said, of the 
society in which we live and, if I may say, not only a microcosm 
of Canadian society but in fact of the integrated world which we 
are now living in and adjusting to. It is an exciting dynamic 
community which represents, if I may say, the best of what 
Canada has to offer.
<P>
	The area of Rosedale proper of which I spoke contrasts in 
some ways with St. James Town, Regent Park and Moss Park 
where we have many people living in assisted housing, many 
seniors and single mothers, and others who are working hard to 
keep ahead. All are united in their desire to have good 
government, a government with a sense of balance, a 
government that puts their interests first. Our government I 
believe achieved that in this budget.
<P>
	We have in our riding a large component of new Canadians. 
Some have come to us as immigrants, some have come as 
refugees. All are decent hard working people, bringing their 
skills to contribute to this country in the tradition of our 
forefathers.
<P>
	The riding also contains the largest gay and lesbian 
population in Canada who bring a sense of diversity to our 
community and who enrich many areas of our community life, 
including the artistic and cultural life of the city. These people 
look to this government to fulfil long unkept promises of many 
previous governments to ensure that discrimination in their 
lives and in their employment will cease so that they may play 
their full role in our society. It is their right to live in a world 
with a level playing field and we owe that to them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You will also find in my riding a French community which 
may not be large, but is important to us. This community is 
proud, different, and fully contributes to our culture and our 
economy. Our French Canadian community considers the 
presence of Quebec within our federation as an asset and a 
source of inspiration for its own linguistic and cultural future. 
And our French community hopes that our friends in Quebec are 
aware of it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This diversity raises challenges and opportunities. I would 
suggest that many of those challenges and opportunities are 
reflected in the budget which we are discussing here today. The 
merit of this budget in my view is its balance between the 
various financial imperatives which influenced it, the directions 
that it sets for the future and the way in which it relates to real 
people's lives. It puts people first. It does not sacrifice them on 
the altar of fiscal dogma or orthodoxy.
<P>
	The people in my riding have responded well to this budget. 
The people in Rosedale proper who are self-employed were 
pleased to see that they will be able to contribute to their RRSPs 
and guarantee their financial future so they will not become a 
burden on future taxpayers of this country.
<P>
	The small and medium sized businessmen in the riding were 
pleased to see their initiatives adhered to and their concerns 
referred to in a way which will enable them to compete more 
effectively in this complex world in which they have to operate.
<P>
	The new Canadians of whom I spoke seek to employ their 
skills to advantage and are looking for ways to use their 
languages and their cultural skills in a way in which they can 
take them out and invest them into medium and small sized 
businesses and the export markets. This budget points the way in 
that direction. These skills are a resource of this country which 
we owe to ourselves to mobilize for the good of all of us because 
it is the future of the world and the future of Canada which is at 
stake in the way in which this particular community brings its 
cultures and skills to play. This budget specifically focuses on 
that.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	People in my riding living in assisted housing see the human 
resource development initiatives in this budget as an excellent 
beginning on the way to ending their dependency and giving 
them back control of their lives so they may live productively 
without having to rely on the government handouts which they 
despise.
<P>
	I had the opportunity last week during the break to assist in a 
very proud moment in my riding. I went to a meeting at George 
Brown College where, because of a grant of the Government of 
Canada, Goodwill Industries was able to reach out and train 
people who hitherto had been unable to get training. Some of the 
people had disabilities, some had had drug problems, they all 
had problems which had inhibited them from being able to take 
advantage of their lives. They were given a program, thanks to a 
government grant, which enabled them to complete this 
program and 70 per cent of them had jobs as of the night they 
graduated.
<P>
	When I heard the leader of the Reform Party speaking 
yesterday about the need for budget cuts and Draconian 
measures I could not help but think of the smiles on their faces 
and the smiles on their families' faces, showing the pride with 
which they graduated from this program. Those programs are 
the type of programs that this government is creating for people 
to enable them to get back to work. This is a resource that we 
cannot afford to lose in our society. This is the budget that is 
going to enable us to do it.
<P>
	That is why I am proud on behalf of the people who live in my 
riding to speak for them, whatever class of society they come 
from.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2113"> 2113 </A></B>
<P>
	It is that element of the budget which makes me proud. I think 
it maintains an essential, constructive, necessary Liberal role 
of government and the people of my riding, all parts of it, 
support it.
<P>
	Even in the university community there are many problems of 
finance. I was speaking to the president of the University of 
Toronto the other day. He told me that the cuts in unemployment 
insurance premiums, which have had to be paid by the 
university, are a significant contribution. Universities are very 
big employers. This will make a contribution to their financial 
stability.
<P>
	The infrastructure program has been ridiculed on the other 
side of the House as being nothing but a bricks and mortar 
operation. The president of the University of Toronto tells me it 
is creating a tremendous opportunity for his institution of higher 
learning to do a better job of training young Canadians who are 
going to take us forth into the 21st century.
<P>
	Why do we do negative things like this, just for partisan 
political purposes? I heard the minister speak, just before I got 
up to speak, eloquently about the need to deal with our 
infrastructure. We all have to realize that this infrastructure 
program has an intellectual component to it which is just as 
valid as bricks and mortar and I am proud to be part of a 
government which has seen that, seen the need to renew and seen 
the need to look forward to the future.
<P>
	Let me conclude my remarks where I began. I am proud to 
stand here in this House and make my first speech, recognizing 
the people of Rosedale who elected me and who put me here. I 
will do my best for them. I will do my best for my country. I will 
do my best for this government which I think in this budget has 
set the framework for a productive and human future for this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very reluctant to interrupt 
the question or comment period that is about to start on my 
learned colleague's speech, but I wonder if I might seek 
unanimous consent of the House to revert to presenting reports 
by standing and special committees. I have a committee report 
which I think will be of interest to members that I would like to 
table at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the hon. 
parliamentary secretary have the agreement of the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to make a brief comment on my 
colleague from Rosedale, with whom I had an opportunity to 
travel to Vancouver a few weeks ago. I got to know him better 
and I believe that he is someone who can be called a gentleman, 
as the term was understood in the Middle Ages, that is, a man 
who is sincerely open-minded towards all his colleagues in the 
House. I do not at all doubt his sincerity when he speaks or when 
he expresses the wish that Quebecers feel at home in the 
Canadian federation.
<P>
	I also want to tell him that should Quebecers in the near future 
choose to take charge of their own affairs and thus make Quebec 
a sovereign country, Quebecers will still be happy and interested 
to maintain ties with neighbours who show this 
open-mindedness, like the hon. member for Rosedale.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2114"> 2114 </A></B>
<P>
	I commend him for what he said and I hope that we can 
indeed maintain such a relationship, whatever the future holds 
for us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Graham:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
very nice comments about me but he also reserved something for 
the end that may give us the opportunity to voice more 
opposition than today.
<P>
	I would like to put some emphasis on what I said about 
Rosedale. I suggest to him that it is not only a matter of 
Quebecers being welcome in other parts of Canada. I assure you 
that Quebec's attitude and the fact that Quebec and Quebecers 
have succeeded in keeping alive their culture and their language 
is an inspiration to francophones outside Quebec, including 
those in my riding.
<P>
	I urge you not to endanger, through your actions and what you 
will do in the future, this fragile flower that must be tended by 
you, by us and by all members of this House so that the 
francophone culture can flourish in the rest of Canada like it did 
in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
preface my remarks in my first address in this House by offering 
my own congratulates to our Speaker and our Deputy Speakers 
for the even-handedness in the way that they have conducted the 
interventions in this House.
<P>
	We are witnessing a new civility and decorum in this place 
rarely witnessed in recent memory. I think all members, 
regardless of their politics, are showing Canadians that serious 
discussion, debate and, yes, some disagreement can take place 
with respect and honour.
<P>
	I want to take a few moments to reflect on my riding and the 
wonderful people who elected me as their representative and 
voice in Ottawa.
<P>
	My riding of Huron-Bruce is situated on the easterly shore 
of Lake Huron. It is a riding that consists of the entire county of 
Huron in the southerly half of the county of Bruce.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	It stretches from Grand Bend in the south to Southampton in 
the north. This beautiful riding includes towns and villages such 
as Kerkton, Dublin, Teeswater and Zurich, and on the far 
easterly boundary, Paisley. My riding constitutes 43 
municipalities in total.
<P>
	It is without doubt one of the most truly rural agricultural 
ridings in Canada. It is decisively agricultural in its base, with 
pork, beef, dairy and poultry all being produced in great 
numbers.
<P>
	The climate is also well suited for beans, navy beans and other 
cereal grains including canola. I would also like to mention that 
my hometown of Zurich boasts being the bean capital of Canada. 
While the town of Goderich boasts being Canada's prettiest 
town it is also the manufacturing base of Champion road graders 
which builds graders and other road building equipment. I am 
glad to see some of that equipment on the streets of  Ottawa. 
Farther to the north of Lake Huron we have the Bruce nuclear 
power plant, the largest nuclear generation plant in the world.
<P>
	Among notable Canadians to have come from my area of 
Huron-Bruce, Paul Henderson in 1972 scored what proved to 
be the winning goal and made world history in the 
Canada-Russia summit series.
<P>
	Timothy Eaton, upon immigrating to Canada, established his 
earliest roots in Usborne township in the southeast area of my 
riding.
<P>
	Kipple Disney, the grandfather of the famous Walt Disney, 
settled on the family farm in Bluevale. This is where Elias, 
Walt's father, was born and later went to central school in 
Goderich.
<P>
	Most recently we were made proud when another famous 
person from my riding, Lloyd Eisler from Seaforth, or as he 
would like it to be known, Egmondville, the suburb, and his 
partner Isabelle Brasseur from the riding of Richmond-Wolfe 
won a bronze medal in the 17th Winter Olympics in 
Lillehammer, Norway.
<P>
	To all those people who worked and voted for me in 
Huron-Bruce I offer my sincere appreciation and gratitude. 
Their friendship and encouragement are reward enough for a 
task that at times seems impossible.
<P>
	Most important in my life has been my family, my wife Kathy 
and our two sons, Cam and Brian, their wives Kathy and Bonnie 
and our two grandsons, Brent and Shawn. They have all 
supported me in my efforts to come here and they have also 
given me great encouragement in the many years I served in 
municipal politics. Thank you for your love.
<P>
	This being the year of the family causes me to reflect in the 
directions we take as we determine social policies for the 
country. My view, which I think is shared by many hon. 
members, particularly my hon. colleague from Central Nova, is 
that life is sacred from conception to natural death. This view 
will obviously give cause for some difference of opinion. I 
welcome the opportunity to debate and address this and other 
issues in this place of democracy.
<P>
	Prior to the election, Canadians had lost confidence in their 
political representatives and the institutions in which they 
served. I believe we as the new government have begun to 
reverse this opinion and return people's trust and confidence in 
us as members of Parliament.
<P>
	During the election the public had some clear choices before 
it, parties with very different policies and ideas. We as Liberals 
believe that the people should know exactly what they were 
voting for and that is why we put our policies in our famous red 
book.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2115"> 2115 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians overwhelmingly chose to support our party and, 
most important, our policies. This is where the confidence 
factor comes in. What better way to improve Canadians' 
confidence toward politicians than to give them exactly what 
we promised and ran on in the election?-not exactly a new 
idea, but one that has been forgotten for some time.
<P>
	People's confidence is essential if we as a government hope to 
be successful in making the necessary reforms to a whole host of 
policy areas from social security to foreign affairs and defence.
<P>
	Confidence in Canadian institutions has also increased due to 
the unprecedented level of consultation and open debate that 
occurred on recent peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and cruise 
missile testing discussions in northern Canada. This open 
consultation has also shown that this place does serve as a forum 
for constructive debate on matters of national interest.
<P>
	These changes are just the beginning and I look forward to 
future debates and changes that will further improve our 
representative role.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	If we look at the budget that the hon. Minister of Finance 
presented last month we see that the commitments made in the 
red book are almost kept item by item. If I look at page 111 of the 
book I cannot find anything that has not been acted upon.
<P>
	As I have told my constituents, the contents of the budget 
should come as no surprise to anyone. This most of all will 
increase the people's trust in their representatives. I am also 
proud of this budget and have absolutely no problem with 
defending it and selling it to my constituents. It is a balanced, far 
reaching budget that lays the groundwork for future reform on 
improvement to programs and services.
<P>
	In my riding over the last couple of weeks I have spoken with 
a great many people and have conducted several media 
interviews. In all instances people had a positive opinion of the 
budget. What I think people like about this budget is that it is 
realistic. People were tired of budgets that promised the 
impossible and then failed to deliver. It is realistic in terms of 
deficit reduction, economic projections and job creation.
<P>
	What we did was lay out before the people the serious 
financial problems of the country which included a deficit that 
has skyrocketed to $45 billion, far more than what was expected.
<P>
	We as Liberals believe in getting our fiscal house in order and 
that is why the minister has put forth a budget that over three 
years attains a ratio five to one in terms of spending cuts to 
revenue increases. This sets us well on our way to meet the 
deficit target of 3 per cent GDP in three years; again, something 
which was in the red book and is what Canadians supported.
<P>
	To those who would say that we have not gone far enough, I 
want to say that we are not going to abandon  those in need or 
risk spiralling back into recession by cutting and chopping, 
spending wildly or giving no thought to the consequences at a 
time when 1.6 million people are unemployed, when welfare 
rolls are skyrocketing and child poverty is up 30 per cent. It is 
not the time to abandon these people.
<P>
	Those people who argue for deeper cuts forget that we did not 
get into this situation overnight and it will take time and a great 
deal of fairness and compassion to get out of it. These people 
forget that they were not on a different planet during the time of 
deficit spending. They voted and supported governments and 
benefited from the spending just like we all did.
<P>
	We must now not take radical approaches but take a balanced 
approach that emphasizes building a framework for economic 
growth, restoring fiscal balance and creating jobs.
<P>
	This budget pursues job creation, not in the old ways in which 
government provided the jobs, but in a way that produces the 
climate and provides business with the tools to create the jobs.
<P>
	I also want to point out that the government wanted to invest 
in the infrastructure of this country, an investment that will 
enable Canada to stay competitive in this time of increased 
globalization. This will create approximately 50,000 to 60,000 
jobs.
<P>
	The minister has listened to Canadians who said that they 
wanted deficit reduction without tax increases. They wanted a 
beginning to policy reform without drastic cuts to programs for 
the most needy. They wanted job creation. They wanted a 
constant, systematic decline in the deficit. They wanted 
investment in R and D. They wanted economic renewal and 
revitalization, and they wanted a fair and more equitable tax 
system.
<P>
	This is the budget we delivered and it is the one that I am 
proud to support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in this House today to not only express my 
dissatisfaction over the budget that the finance minister 
introduced on February 22, but moreover I want to state for the 
record the dissatisfaction of my constituents in the riding of 
New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	A measure of opinion was expressed to me publicly in a recent 
town hall meeting. It was specifically called to discuss the 
budget and the fiscal priorities for the nation. I took the public 
risk and advertised very widely for an old-fashioned town hall 
meeting in which any constituent could express himself or 
herself on the budget in front of their own community. The 
meeting went for over two hours and I listened to the line-up of 
speakers who came to the open microphone.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2116"> 2116 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	Government ministers should have been there for they would 
have heard that the Liberals have no political mandate to do 
what they are doing in this budget. I did not hear a positive thing 
said with regard to this budget except a relief that the 
government did not announce massive new spending on grand, 
misguided schemes. Most complained that there was no long 
term job creation in this budget. The budget did not inspire hope.
<P>
	The election was a mandate for change. What the country got 
in this budget was just more of the same.
<P>
	There was a promise in the budget to fix sewers and repair old 
roads. Suffice it to say these are not long term jobs to put us on 
the international cutting edge.
<P>
	In the budget the finance minister withdrew the government's 
support for the KAON particle accelerator project in British 
Columbia. I suppose it is more important to pave old roads than 
to keep Canada at the competitive forefront of science and 
technology.
<P>
	I can remember back in the election campaign when the 
Liberals promised Canadians jobs and hope for change. When in 
opposition, the Liberals decried that the Conservative 
government had let the unemployment rate rise to 11.2 per cent. 
The red book, which now looks like the Liberal red ink book, 
promised to put Canadians back to work and decrease the 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	When the unemployed of New Westminster-Burnaby 
watched the budget presentation on TV they were expecting, and 
I repeat expecting, that the finance minister would give them a 
job or at least the hope for one and provide a plan to slash the 
rate of unemployment.
<P>
	In his ultimate prediction the Minister of Finance did predict a 
lower unemployment rate, a walloping .1 per cent. Canadians 
from coast to coast could not believe what they heard: .1 per 
cent. Unbelievable for a party that spent the entire campaign 
promising jobs. We all heard it: ``We have the plan, we have the 
team, trust us''.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance wants us to believe that next year is 
when more jobs will occur and that is when we will see an 
improvement in the economy. The mandate for this election was 
crystal clear. It was to change, to drastically reduce spending, to 
go in a new direction and thus spur on the economy. The 
mandate was not to shuffle a few things and hope that the 
economy would turn around on its own.
<P>
	The people in New Westminster-Burnaby know that in our 
present predicament high taxes, the high spending of this budget 
and high unemployment are directly linked.
<P>
	The government needs to go on a diet. For starters it should 
have put a cap on all federal spending at $153 billion bringing 
the deficit to $27.8 billion rather than the predicted $39.7 
billion. This would have been a modest broadly based goal that 
would have sent the right  message to the international markets 
where we are ultimately judged.
<P>
	Instead of making an effort to lower federal spending, the 
government raises it by $3.3 billion to $163.6 billion from 
$160.3 billion just the year before.
<P>
	If the finance minister had done nothing at all the federal 
deficit for 1994-95 would have been $41.2 billion. However, 
since it is mandatory for the government to introduce a budget, 
the minister put on his new footwear and lowered the deficit by a 
mere $1.5 billion.
<P>
	Folks in New Westminster-Burnaby wonder how federal 
spending can be so high. I will zero in. Some of my 
responsibility is in the field of justice and legal affairs. I will 
comment on some of the spending in that area.
<P>
	The continued funding for special groups is incredible. For 
example the Law Reform Commission which was reinstated in 
this budget had previous expenditures of $4.8 million in 
1992-93, $4.9 million in 1991-92 and $5 million in 1990-91. 
All of this is for an unaccountable organization of academics 
who turned out obscure reports that were mostly forgotten the 
day after they were published.
<P>
	The taxpayers are going to foot the bill for this Liberal 
academic think tank. It will clothe itself with credentials in the 
appearance of political neutrality while preaching Liberal 
dogma. Political parties have their own funding from their 
supporters. Now the taxpayers are going to fund a Liberal think 
tank. This is old Canada thinking of the Pearson-Trudeau era. 
We should support the legitimate academics in our universities 
to do research on legal public policy. We do not need the social 
engineering of a reconstituted Law Reform Commission.
<P>
	Another example of waste is that of the court challenges 
program. The actual expense of this program for 1992-93 was 
$1.06 million. In 1993-94 the forecast was $1.26 million. For 
1994-95 the main estimates show it will be allowed to use $3.35 
million. What a retirement plan for lawyers, well the Liberal 
lawyers anyway who might get the retainers.
<P>
	If I sound cynical it is because I watch from here and see it is 
business as usual, old Canada thinking from yesterday's leader 
who peddles an outdated budget philosophy ill-suited for the 
new world economy.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	The court challenges program was initially introduced in 
1978 to fund individuals who brought forward constitutional 
cases based on equality and language rights. It was expanded in 
1982 for the new charter arguments.
<P>
	The scope of the program has changed dramatically. It now 
serves as a taxpayer supported platform for radical feminists, 
the gay-lesbian agenda and other social engineering groups who 
want to revise the political landscape via the back door of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2117"> 2117 </A></B>
<P>
court rather than obtain a mandate for their changes at the ballot 
box.
<P>
	The appointments to the selection committee for this program 
will be suspect and most financially burdensome as there will be 
no market forces to moderate who gets what. If a case is worth 
fighting to the Supreme Court of Canada the people of Canada 
will voluntarily support it. If it cannot fly in the marketplace of 
ideas in the community, then it should not proceed to court.
<P>
	I also hear now that salary increments are frozen for the 
RCMP which is causing an internal uproar. Yet the government 
is committing millions for court challenges and a commission. 
What does this say about the priorities of this government? Our 
economy is in a tenuous state.
<P>
	The government should have realized that the first cuts to be 
made should have been to the special interest groups. The 
National Action Committee on the Status of Women has 
regularly received $300,000 since 1991 with the exception of 
last year when it received $270,000. The government gives this 
group over $250,000 and then the group complains that it is not 
enough.
<P>
	By cutting off all spending to every special interest lobby 
group the government would eliminate two problems. One, it 
would reduce a substantial part of federal expenditures. Two, it 
would eliminate the bickering and rivalry that goes on among 
groups if the government cuts part of their budget. It would stop 
the divisiveness in our communities.
<P>
	For Canada the international community is holding its breath 
and has given the government a short term breather. I am not so 
optimistic that the Liberals can or will deliver later. Reformers 
have asked for a minibudget in the fall to stave off what is now 
starting to happen, especially with those in the area of more 
liquid assets.
<P>
	Investors are increasingly betting against Canada and money 
is going offshore. That trend will continue at a steeper rate until 
it will actually develop into what is commonly known as a run on 
the dollar.
<P>
	Right now Canada is draining its gold and foreign reserves to 
buy up Canadian dollars on the international market just to keep 
the price from falling too fast. It is the old law of supply and 
demand. The problem is that Canada does not have the deep 
pockets to keep up this defence for any sustained period.
<P>
	The old standard advantages of political stability and a 
prospect for reasonable return may not stay in place for Canada. 
When one places the political instability of Quebec along with 
the general fiscal malaise we are due for a major shock from 
offshore.
<P>
	If we do not straighten ourselves out then the international 
community will do it for us in blunt, brutal terms. The best 
predictor for future performance is past behaviour. At least 
since 1984 the world community has listened to Canadian 
governments promise time after time to deal with deficits and 
proportional taxation levels. Then they see a stay the course 
budget delivered time after time.
<P>
	The prescription is that we must now run consistent balanced 
budgets for a number of years because of where we have been 
economically in the past few years. The cure is known but it 
takes courage to act. The overweight needs a crash diet to bring 
us back to health. The pain must be shared equally by all.
<P>
	The first dramatic steps need to be done with Parliament Hill 
operations and general spending at the top for a leadership by 
example package.
<P>
	Currently the burden is not equally shared. Eighteen new 
spending programs for ideological reasons are outlined in this 
budget. Debt charges are underestimated, a very risky forecast. 
The international capital markets are waiting until this fall but 
not much longer.
<P>
	Parliament is where government comes to the people to get 
permission to tax and spend. This House bears the responsibility 
for the financial consequences of this nation. It is up to members 
to decide to take action.
<P>
	Those in the Reform camp, those who are indeed in touch with 
their communities, have heard the people speak and have made a 
start. However, there must be 100 ways for members who are not 
Reformers to apply pressure against those stuck in yesterday's 
old Canada thinking. To put it in psychological terms, spending 
behaviour reveals inner character.
<P>
	Let it be said right now that where there is conviction let there 
be the courage to act. If we believe in what we do we can journey 
to the new Canada where equality is our standard and 
compassion is our principle, where humility is our manner and 
truth is what we say.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the member on his speech. At the same time 
however I would like to ask him to perhaps go back and check 
his arithmetic.
<P>
	He criticizes the rather modest expenditure the government is 
undertaking in re-establishing the Law Reform Commission, 
but criticizes the rather sensible decision the government made 
about the KAON factory. The hon. member should know that the 
KAON factory would cost the Canadian taxpayers in excess of 
$200 million a year in capital and operating costs.
<P>
	Given that extremely high cost and the futuristic nature of the 
science involved, the government's advisory councils made a 
recommendation. The National Research Council, the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the Science 
Council of Canada and a committee of the National Advisory 
Board on Science and Technology appointed by the previous 
Prime Minister unanimously recommended this expenditure 
could not be justified given the country's priorities with respect 
to science 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2118"> 2118 </A></B>
<P>
and technology and the current levels of science and technology 
spending and the other needs we have.
<P>
	The hon. member also failed to mention in his speech that this 
government has committed in this budget substantial resources 
to implement the red book commitments for example to upgrade 
the industrial research assistance program and create a Canadian 
technology network. There are very important expenditures on 
the diffusion of technology.
<P>
	That will benefit the many small and medium sized 
businesses which really comprise the Canadian economy. 
Canada has a small firm economy and that is where the efforts of 
this government have been directed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, it comes down to a matter of 
opinion concerning basic government priorities. I talked about 
how spending behaviour reveals inner character and a person's 
underlying philosophy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the anniversary of the birth of Father Albert 
LaCombe, born on February 28, 1827.
<P>
	Father LaCombe migrated from his native community of St. 
Sulpice in the province of Quebec to found the settlement of St. 
Albert in 1861 and several other missions in the province of 
Alberta such as St. Paul de Cris.
<P>
	He worked with the native Indians of Alberta, the Cree and the 
Blackfoot. His efforts led to the peaceful acceptance of the 
building of the CPR. During the 1885 Louis Riel rebellion he 
acted as a calming influence in the region. He was also an 
adviser on the negotiations of Treaty No. 8.
<P>
	Father LaCombe was also an accomplished linguist. He wrote 
a dictionary and a grammar book of the Cree language and he 
translated the Scriptures into native languages.
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish to recognize Father LaCombe as a great 
Albertan and a great Canadian.

<P>
	Each year I have risen in the House on this date asking our

violation of human rights in Tibet, the destruction of its 
environment, and the denial of its self-determination.
<P>
	During the past year political arrests have risen by 30 per cent

<P>
	Yesterday China was once again successful in having the 
United Nations put aside the resolution criticizing its human

	The people of Tibet have always pursued a non-violent 
approach in dealing with this issue. In 1989 the Dalai lama won

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are many success stories among women but some are more 
touching than others.
<P>
	Paige was a prostitute sexually abused at a young age. In spite 
of trying to get into a normal lifestyle she ended up on the streets 
and became more and more involved in drugs to the point of 
having seizures when she was clean.
<P>
	After many years of prostitution Paige had the good fortune of 
learning of a woman who started Prostitutes Anonymous. This 
fortunate turn of events helped Paige start on her difficult road 
to recovery.
<P>
	Battered women's shelters, drug and alcohol centres and 
recovery houses became Paige's new environment. In 1991 
Paige started Prostitutes Anonymous in B.C. She is now a 
member of an ad hoc citizens' committee of elected women 
helping women.
<P>
	Last week I participated in my first committee meeting. I met 
Paige and also Cindy-Lou. These women are only two of many 
who fortunately were able to get out of prostitution. Paige needs 
help in her task. Transition houses are crucial to give prostitutes 
a chance.

subsequent parole resulted in the sadistic murder of Jewel

he be released into our neighbourhood?

	Considering the fact that national polls consistently indicate

forgotten members of our society.
<P>
	It found that food bank clients receive incomes far below the 
poverty line; 94 per cent have incomes of less than $1,000 a 
month. For the few who have incomes of slightly more than 
$1,000 a month, most have households of four or more persons. 
Forty-four per cent of food bank clients experience days when 
they go without food. Many of these are parents who go without 
food to ensure that their children have enough to eat.

consideration in tax laws as those of self-employed men.
<P>
	The number of women in the workforce with children younger 
than school age has risen to 68 per cent. The majority of these 
women are working or running a business full time and cannot 
claim child care expenses as a business expense.
<P>
	Child care is an important family support service and an 
integral part of society's ability to sustain a broader income. 
Because women are the parents whose careers are still most 
affected by child care responsibilities, the inclusion of child 
care expenses as a business expense would certainly give 
women more incentive to further develop their entrepreneurial 
skills and ingenuity.
<P>
	Surely child care is more of a true business expense than 
country club memberships, seasons tickets to a sporting event or 
the rental of a luxury car.

Canadian Farm Women's Network, my constituents and, in

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals have been in office barely four months, but the new

	When the time came to translate the red book into a budget, 
we see that it was not the corporations or the wealthy families 
who were enlisted to help fight the deficit, but rather the least 
fortunate, including the unemployed. The eagerly awaited, 
much-ballyhooed GST reform will be a camouflage operation 
aimed at hiding the tax in the overall price, meaning that it will 
apply to all goods, including food.
<P>
	The Liberals speak of strengthening the social fabric of the 
country. Instead, they are dividing society. Retired persons are 
being asked to sacrifice their pensions for youth training 
programs.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2122"> 2122 </A></B>
<P>
	We are gradually getting a better idea of the government's 
real plans for changing our social programs. Yesterday, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development confirmed that he 
wanted to review old age security programs. However, during 
the election campaign, the Leader of the Liberal Party strongly 
condemned the Reform Party's plans to cut old age pensions 
and said that it was not something he would recommend.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister feel that cutting old age 
pensions is advisable today, while that was not the case just 
before he went to the polls? Why is he coming down hard on 
senior citizens today and why has he reneged on his commitment 
to leave old age pensions intact?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said it before and I say it again, we do not intend to cut old age 
pensions, and those who insist on spreading these rumours are 
trying to scare people.
<P>
	What we have to do is look at the serious problems we have in 
connection with the Canada Pension Plan. This is a very 
long-term program, and we know that in 2005 and 2010, it will 
be difficult to finance the program.
<P>
	Since we want to do a good job, we are trying to anticipate the 
problems we will have when we form the government in 2010.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, instead of daydreaming, the Prime Minister should 
look at the source of these rumours. He should look at his 
Minister of Human Resources Development and tell us whether 
he endorses the minister's irresponsible statements. Does he 
wants to force Canadians to choose between training for young 
people and old age pensions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make it clear that I have full confidence in the minister, 
who is working very hard to reform what needs to be reformed in 
this country. As Canadians we must ensure that we can once 
again give people on welfare and unemployment insurance the 
dignity of having a job. That is what the minister is trying to do 
now, and I think he is doing a very good job by consulting the 
provinces and all concerned.
<P>
	I think there is no connection with what I mentioned earlier. 
Because of an aging population, we expect that the Canada 
Pension Plan will run into problems after the year 2000. Our 
government must start looking at these problems right away, and 
the minister is doing an exceptional job in trying to restore the 
dignity of Canadian workers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is the kind of ambiguous statement that will revive 
the fears haunting the elderly today in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	Now that we have a government that attacks the universality 
of old age pensions, I think we should ask the Prime Minister 
whether we are to conclude he  deliberately hid his true 
intentions during the election campaign.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can certainly be no clearer than I was on the first question. It is 
quite possible that all three questions were prepared ahead of 
time, so he read them! I said we did not intend to cut old age 
pensions. Stop trying to scare people! I cannot be any clearer 
than that!
<P>
	In a way, I rather enjoy seeing the Bloc Quebecois defending 
the Canadian status quo every day in this House. We want to 
introduce reforms, but they do not want us to change anything in 
Canada. They want us to keep Canada the way it is. We want to 
introduce reforms for the benefit of all Canadians, including 
those in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The policy of the government is becoming increasingly clear. 
After launching an assault on the unemployed, the government 
is now setting its sights on seniors. By reducing the tax credit for 
seniors, the government is actually increasing their tax burden 
by $500 million over three years. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development has also announced a review of social 
programs for seniors.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Instead of targeting the pensions of senior citizens, why does 
the Prime Minister not have the courage to eliminate tax 
shelters?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member 
and the leader before him, if they want to look at the intentions 
of the government I would suggest the first page they should 
turn to is page 56 of the budget wherein we commit to 
substantial augmentation and addition to old age security 
programs over the next four or five years. If they want the 
answer it is in the book.
<P>
	We are trying to say that over the next couple of decades we 
will have a full doubling of Canadians who are eligible for 
various kinds of security. We want to ensure the next generation 
has the same security as this generation. To do that we have to 
find a way to ensure that we pay for it.
<P>
	This means that much of the investment now generated out of 
pension plans and RRSPs must be used more effectively to 
generate jobs and growth in Canada today so young people can 
go to work and can pay for the pensions of tomorrow. That is 
what we are trying to do.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in 1985, the Conservatives were assailed by the Liberals for 
wanting to eliminate the indexation of old age pensions. What 
has happened to the convictions of the Liberals in 1994? Now 
they are directly attacking the very existence of old age 
pensions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only person in the House who 
attacked the existing benefits for seniors is the Leader of the 
Opposition when he was a member of the previous government. 
He is the only person in the House to do so.
<P>
	We are trying to make sure the system is strengthened and 
maintained for the future. We are not talking about cutting the 
budgets now. We are not talking about affecting universality. 
The budget makes that very clear.
<P>
	We are talking about an open consultation with all kinds of 
Canadians so that we can have a full discussion about the future 
security of Canadians, how we use the pension funds to invest in 
Canada, how we make sure there is a proper CPP, and that we 
have a proper system of payment.
<P>
	This generation of Canadians has to look at how we begin to 
ensure the future of Canadians is as good as the one that we 
provide for seniors today.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence. It is also on 
the social implications of the budget.
<P>
	The minister has announced plans to reduce the size of 
Canadian forces in his department by 16,000 people. Many of us 
in the House regard this downsizing as a test of the capability of 
the government to help workers shift from employment in one 
sector to productive employment elsewhere.
<P>
	Specifically what steps are the minister's department and the 
department of human resources development taking to help 
these 16,000 Canadians find and fill productive jobs elsewhere?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps my colleague, the Minister of Industry, can talk about 
the defence conversion program; he has responsibility for that.
<P>
	We are trying something very new and bold in dealing with 
our public servants and the military, in trying to give them a 
combination of moneys-we call it an enhanced buyout 
provision-so they can take early retirement. In some cases 
money is applied for retraining and other allowances that will 
help them make the  necessary conversion the hon. member is so 
concerned about.
<P>
	With respect to the conversion on a mass scale, that is 
something we are committed to as a government under the 
defence conversion program. I will be working along with my 
colleague, the Minister of Industry, to ensure this is done as we 
gradually downsize the armed forces.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would remind the minister we are not talking here about 16,000 
tanks or trucks but about 16,000 people with families.
<P>
	My question is for the minister. Would he be prepared to 
submit to the House a registry containing the names of these 
16,000 people so that Parliament can monitor how many are 
forced on to UI or welfare or on to dead end jobs and how many 
in fact make their way to jobs in the new economy the Minister 
of Industry is talking about?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
leader of the Reform Party has certainly an odd version of 
democracy where we make the private lives of individual 
Canadians known on the floor of the House of Commons. We do 
not do this with the tax system. We do not do this with health 
benefits, and we are not going to do it with the people 
concerning defence. I cannot believe the Reform Party is 
preaching this Orwellian view, something that we totally reject.
<P>
	We respect the privacy of individuals. We are very concerned 
with those people who are losing their jobs. I think the 
statements I made following the budget underlie that.
<P>
	If the hon. member looks at the severance packages that have 
been announced, that are now being negotiated base by base and 
throughout the department, I think he will see we are treating 
people in a most generous fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
will the minister then acknowledge that what happens to these 
16,000 people being laid off by his department is a fair test of the 
government's ability to help the unemployed in general?
<P>
	In other words, if the government cannot guide 16,000 people 
laid off by the minister's department into a new economy, who 
in heaven's name would believe that it could help 1.6 million 
unemployed people to that destination?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
obviously the hon. member has not read the budget documents 
or listened to the speeches I have been giving.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2124"> 2124 </A></B>
<P>
	There will be generous severance packages. We probably will 
have to legislate one part of it over and above the workforce 
adjustment provisions of the collective agreements that are now 
in place.
<P>
	From the discussions we have had with the unions, obviously 
they are not happy with the numbers of people who are going to 
be phased out over four years. They recognize that the end is not 
going to come tomorrow and that this is going to be a regulated 
process through which everybody is going to be dealt with 
fairly.
<P>
	I find it rather ironic the hon. member woke up two weeks 
after the budget to talk about the plight of these 16,500 people 
who will be phased out, yet for the last couple of years he has 
been talking about much more Draconian cuts in the public 
service.

never has any questions to ask. He would like to ask his 
government a few questions.
<P>
	Yesterday, on the subject of the eventual closing of the 
military college in Saint-Jean, the Minister of National Defense 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is one that I opposed, the Prime Minister opposed and many people 
opposed. We would have liked to have done it another way rather than close this 
college. However, from the point of view of financial sense, it seemed to us that 
the best business case was to concentrate the college in Kingston.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Can the Minister of Defence assure us today that the decision 
to close the military college in Saint-Jean was made ``only'' to 
save money and not for political reasons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
answer is certainly yes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I should explain that in looking at our proposed reductions if 
we had been able to cut other facilities that were surplus we 
would have done it. It made sense to rationalize the colleges, all 
the arguments that have been given here by myself and my 
colleagues. Naturally no one likes to phase out the jobs of 
16,500 people; no one likes to have such a difficult effect on 
various communities. It was a tough decision that we had to 
wrestle with. However, in the final analysis, I put forward the 
list and that was in the budget. It is something that we will 
defend. The closing of the two colleges is regrettable, Royal 
Roads and CMR, but it is a decision that is final.

<P>
	People do not understand the minister's decision. In 
Saint-Jean, they are preparing for a big demonstration to protest 
the minister's decision. Why is the minister stubbornly refusing 
to disclose the figures at this time? Could he be fiddling with 
them to justify his decision?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know that when we ask questions, we 
sometimes get carried away. I am sure that the hon. member 
could replace ``fiddle'' with another word.

some very bad things that I am alleged to have done. In normal 
cases I would demand an apology, but I understand the hon. 
member is new to the House and perhaps we can overlook this.

<P>
	According to the minister's own numbers, government will

almost twice as many jobs as spending tax dollars then why is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2125"> 2125 </A></B>
<P>
this government still planning to launch such an inefficient 
infrastructure program when it can simply cut taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the infrastructure program was launched at the request of the 
municipalities across this country because they recognized that 
to create jobs in this country and to get people back to work we 
needed to keep up the infrastructure in our communities so that 
we could attract investment to increase our competitiveness in 
this increasing global economy.
<P>
	The purpose behind the program was partly that and partly to 
get Canadians back to work. That program is being fulfilled and 
it is being fulfilled in partnership with municipal and provincial 
governments all in agreement right across this country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Yesterday the Deputy Minister of Finance admitted that 
Canada's corporate and individual tax rates are the second 
highest in the industrialized world. Surely the minister 
understands that there is a direct link between high taxes and 
high levels of unemployment.
<P>
	Does the minister have a long term plan to create jobs by 
seeing Canada's taxation levels reduced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Minister of Finance spoke 
well at the meeting yesterday. In fact, there is no doubt about the 
tremendous burden of taxation which Canadians are forced to 
bear at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. It is 
certainly a major inhibition to job creation.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	It is exactly for that reason that in the last budget for every $1 
in revenue that is raised this government imposed $5 in 
expenditure cuts.
<P>
	It is also for that reason that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development was able to announce through the budget that we 
were reducing unemployment insurance premiums which are in 
fact a tax on jobs. We have begun to attack this cancer on job 
creation in this country.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Really. Seriously. I do not analogize numerical 
superiority with intellectual superiority. I would like to work 
with my hon. friend because if the Reform Party truly wants 
self-sufficiency and self-government and self- determination, 
these are issues that we have to define collectively.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	It is not like doing a budget. It is not like altering a figure. It is 
really altering opinions or mindsets. We want to work together. 
Consequently, we have entered into what will be extensive 
discussions with the Manitoba chiefs. They will be difficult, 
they will be hard. We are not kidding ourselves. But they will be 
done.
<P>
	Our commitment to self-government, self-determination and 
self- sufficiency is in the red book. Because it is difficult does 
not mean that this government will shy away from it. I hope that 
my hon. friend will work with us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
recognize that defining self-government may be difficult but 
when the Government of Canada makes a commitment, an 
agreement to enter into self-government, I think somebody had 
better know what agreement they are entering into. That is what 
we are getting at.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the House who he is negotiating with and 
how he is going to let the aboriginal people ratify any final 
self-government agreement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> My hon. friend I think should know that there is 
a system in place through the First Nations, through the 
assemblies, through the various tribal councils, to do just that.
<P>
	As we said initially, there will be six months of discussions 
with these people. As we said, we will do it within a timeframe 
that is acceptable to the First Nations. It will be done. There will

<P>
	Some economists and tax experts are recommending that the 
GST be applied to food items. In November 1989, the Liberal 
opposition said, in a report tabled in this House: ``The Liberal 
members of the Finance committee cannot accept that basic 
food items be taxed''.

apply the goods and services tax to the food sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am asked to answer a 
question which is already being reviewed by a parliamentary 
committee. As you know, the mandate of that committee is 
really to listen to Canadians and get their opinion.
<P>
	It is certainly not the role of the government to tell Canadians 
that they have no right to express their views. This is one of the 
fundamental freedoms in our country. I think the committee is 
doing an excellent job and we support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians 
want to know the minister's opinion.

items, as the same Liberals did when they were in opposition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

before the end of June, when it will table its report. It is not the

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On Friday, March 4 I attended a rally with over 1,200 gun 
owners in Preeceville, Saskatchewan. They are extremely upset 
with the government's new gun control regulations.
<P>
	There are two types of gun owners in Canada: law-abiding 
citizens and criminals. According to the Canadian Centre for 
Justice Statistics less than one-tenth of one per cent of 
registered handgun owners commit crimes with guns.
<P>
	Could the minister explain how putting more controls on 
responsible gun owners better protects law abiding citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the legislation in place today 
to ensure the safe use, storage and maintenance of firearms is 
intended to reflect that firearms are themselves inherently 
dangerous.
<P>
	Whether it is the intention of the owner to use it lawfully for 
proper purposes or otherwise, the fact of the matter is that this 
government has decided and I believe it is quite correct, that 
anyone who wishes to acquire or use a firearm should be subject 
to the reasonable controls in the law today.
<P>
	In terms of the use of firearms for criminal or improper 
purposes, we are taking a variety of steps to ensure that does not 
occur. We are tightening up border controls with respect to 
illegal smuggling of weapons from the United States.
<P>
	The hon. member knows our platform has specific proposals 
for strengthening measures to ensure that criminals do not have 
weapons in their hands. We will be introducing measures to 
ensure that occurs so the people of Canada can feel safe from the 
improper use of firearms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Saskatchewan gun owners are not against safety and training in 
the use of firearms. They asked me to ask the minister how does 
putting more restrictions on law abiding and responsible gun 
owners in any way deter criminals from illegally acquiring these 
guns?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have met with chiefs of 
police in Moncton, Fredericton, Edmonton and last week in my 
own riding in Etobicoke near Toronto.
<P>
	Those chiefs of police made the point very forcefully to me 
that weapons used in criminal offences are often stolen from 
lawful gun owners who keep them improperly or in insecure 
circumstances or do not look after them with a reasonable 
degree of prudence.
<P>
	The laws, regulations and administrative controls to which 
the hon. member has referred are intended to bring home to 
every person in this country who owns a firearm that a 
reasonable standard of safety and security is required. In that 
way we can limit the prospect of someone stealing that weapon 
and using it for criminal purposes.

too much pressure is being applied in certain areas and that we 
are not completely satisfied with matters. I hope that this will 
produce some positive results.
<P>
	Of course, considering that nearly 80 per cent of our trade is 
with the United States, it is normal to encounter the occasional 
irritant. However, we ensure that we make the best 
representations possible. I have to thank the Leader of the

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this report was asked for by the previous government. The 
salaries of MPs are frozen, the same as for everybody else in the 
public service.
<P>
	However, we received this report. It has been referred to a 
commission that is always there. After every election it reviews 
problems of compensation for members of Parliament.
<P>
	At this moment we said very clearly in the budget that salaries 
for members of Parliament are frozen.
<P>

rise on a question of privilege regarding the 10th report of the 
standing committee on House management which deals with 
Private Members' Business. I would submit the process that has 
been followed infringes upon my right as a member of 
Parliament to advance Private Members' Business.
<P>
	The House has been in session for almost two months and we 
have yet to begin debating or discussing Private Members' 
Business. Standing Order 94(1)(a) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker shall make all arrangements necessary to ensure the orderly 
conduct of Private Members' Business</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is your responsibility, Mr. Speaker. I would submit it is your 
responsibility as well to ensure that the process is fair to all 
members.
<P>
	The process that has been followed thus far is unfair. It 
infringes upon the rights of certain members of Parliament, 
particularly my rights as far as the private member's bill I 
introduced on February 17 dealing with the Young Offenders 
Act.
<P>
	In effect, as a result of the 10th report of the committee, the 
private member's bill I introduced-and I undertook to my 
constituents during the election campaign to advance it in this 
Parliament-has effectively been blocked by a small committee 
of individuals meeting in camera to decide for whatever reason 
what bills and motions to pick as votable items in the House.
<P>
	I would ask Your Honour to consider the following. The 
committee was required to select five bills and five motions to 
be debated, discussed and voted upon in the House. The 
committee was required to consider certain factors in its 
deliberations.
<P>
	After these behind the scenes, in camera proceedings, which I 
as a member of Parliament was not entitled to attend, a decision 
was made on which bills were in the national interest and which 
bills would be given three hours of House time, plus committee 
time, plus the opportunity to be voted upon by members of 
Parliament. What are those bills?
<P>
	The committee in its wisdom decided that designating hockey 
as the national sport of Canada was a more important piece of 
legislation than amendments to the Young Offenders Act. The 
committee also decided that it was more important to devote 
House time to a bill that would deal with the witness protection 
plan as if it affects a lot of Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Given the commitment of the government and

surely we have the right as private members to present a piece of 
legislation and to expect that the piece of legislation will be 
considered by the House in a meaningful way, if our 
commitment to parliamentary reform is genuine.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I think the hon. member will know the 
report has been adopted by the House. I suggest he may wish to 
take this particular grievance to the committee. I would 
recommend, at this point at least, that he give some 
consideration to doing that rather than raising it as a question of 
privilege in the House.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes me to rule on the question of 
privilege, I will take what he has said today under advisement 
and I will consider it.

and the person responsible, to ensure fairness and to ensure that 
private members have the opportunity to be meaningful in the 
House. I ask you to review the process.

happens to be my bill. I did not even know it had been chosen to 
be votable.
<P>
	However, I want to tell the hon. member and other members in 
the House that I too committed to my constituents during the 
election that if I were re-elected I would attempt to bring 
forward a national witness protection plan. I told tens of 
thousands of people who signed petitions across the country, 
which I presented to the House, that I would do so. I take great

bill.

with great respect to the difficulties that have been raised, I 
think Your Honour will appreciate that the argument advanced 
by the hon. member for York South-Weston is not a valid 
question of privilege in the House.
<P>
	Frankly he is complaining about the decision of the 
committee. We have heard the opposite side in effect from the 
hon. member for Scarborough West. I recognize the committee 
has a difficult decision to make with respect to votable items, 
particularly on the first selection when it has to choose 10 items 
out of the 30 on the order of precedence.
<P>
	The hon. member for York South-Weston first complained 
about the length of time it has taken to get to this point. If he 
reads all of the rules relating to Private Members' Business, he 
will know that Private Members' Business cannot begin until 
there are items on the Order Paper from at least 30 members of 
the House. There was a lengthy delay in the early part of this 
Parliament in getting the requisite number of members to table 
motions or private members bills in order to reach the point of a 
draw.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	That point was finally reached. A draw was held and the 
committee which I chair met promptly through its 
subcommittee. The subcommittee has met three days this week. 
It submitted its report this morning to the committee. That 
report was adopted by the committee, tabled in the House earlier 
this morning, and was concurred in on tabling.
<P>
	The hon. member for York South-Weston was here in the last 
Parliament. He has known of this procedure for years. That has 
been the practice in the House for many years, certainly since 
before 1988 when I was first elected. I cannot say when the 
procedure was first adopted. It was modified a bit in the last 
Parliament to increase the number of opportunities for members 
to present private members bills and have them voted on in the 
House.

debate. It may be that at the end of the time the House will be 
willing to allow him to go to a vote on it. I do not know; that is 
not a decision that I can make.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that first of all it is not a matter for 
Your Honour to decide. In support of that proposition I cite page 
222 of Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 760(3):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker has ruled on many occasions that it is not competent for the 
Speaker to exercise procedural control over the committees. Committees are and 
must remain masters of their own procedure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the citation and I invite Your Honour to direct the hon. 
member for York South-Weston to direct his criticisms, if any, 
to the committee. He can go there and make his submission 
again. He and every other member had an opportunity to appear 
and make their submissions before the subcommittee, which 
then rendered a decision.
<P>
	I submit the decision was fair. He had an equal opportunity 
with every other member of the House who had been in on the 
draw to make his submission. The committee did not happen to 
agree with him and so he is here today complaining.
<P>
	I also submit it is not a question of privilege. The committee 
has acted entirely properly. Its report has been tabled in the 
House and adopted. I suggest there is not a question of privilege 
here. In fact the committee has acted extremely carefully in this 
matter and with due consideration to all factors it is required to 
take into account.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Submissions have been made to the Chair with 
regard to privilege. I suggested the hon. member for York 
South-Weston might want to appear before the committee. The 
fact is that the report has been adopted by the House of 
Commons and it cannot be reversed by the Chair. That does not 
negate the chance of the hon. member appearing before that 
committee at some future date to plead his case.
<P>
	At this point it is clear to me that I would rule there is no 
question of privilege, that the report has been accepted and that 
it cannot and will not be reversed by the Chair. I would like to 
put this question of privilege to one side.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. A decision has been taken by the 
Chair. I have made my ruling now and the ruling will stand. This 
question of privilege is over.
<P>
	Are there any other questions of privilege or points of order 
hon. members would like to raise? On a point of order, the hon. 
member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us perhaps sum this up by saying 
that there is a process in place. The parliamentary secretary just 
went through it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I am sure the hon. member will 
understand that this question of privilege is over. Unless the 
hon. member has another point of order or question of privilege I 
would like to proceed with the affairs of the day.
<P>
	If there are no other points of order or questions of privilege I 
will proceed from here to House business.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
the Government House Leader to tell us what the business of the 
House will be for the next few days.

<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today the House will conclude the budget debate.
<P>
	Tomorrow, Friday, the House will consider Bill C-5 regarding 
the customs tariff and Bill C-6 concerning oil and gas 
operations.
<P>
	Next week, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday shall be 
allotted days. On Tuesday of next week the House will consider 
a motion by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to establish a special 
joint committee of this House and the other place to review 
Canada's foreign policy.
<P>
	The business for Friday, March 18, next week will be 
legislation to be announced later.
<P>
	Having given that statement of House business, I would like 
to say that there has been consultation and I believe if you seek 
the view of the House you will find agreement that the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs be allowed to revert to the period of 
Statements by Ministers to make a statement and opposition 
critics can reply. Therefore, considering the consultation that 
has taken place, I would like to seek unanimous consent for my 
colleague the Minister of Foreign Affairs to make his statement.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs to make a statement at this time?

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to thank the hon. members of this 
House for allowing me to make this statement at this time.
<P>
	I would like to inform the House of a decision the government 
made in this morning's Cabinet meeting regarding the presence 
of Canadian troops in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that last January, the 
government consulted the House on the future of our troops in 
that part of the world. During the debate, a majority of hon. 
members stated that they were in favour of maintaining a 
Canadian presence within the United Nations Protection Force 
in the former Yugoslavia. The House decided that Canada was 
making an important contribution to the objectives of 
preventing the war from escalating and getting out of hand, 
trying to negotiate an end to the conflict and participating in the 
humanitarian effort. The House also reaffirmed Canada's 
commitment to its traditional role of peacekeeper, the 
promotion of stability and security in Europe, and the quest for a 
negotiated solution to the situation in the Balkans.
<P>
	I am pleased to announce today that in light of that debate and 
the developments that have taken place in recent weeks, the 
government has decided that the Canadian troops, whose 
mandate was set to end on March 31, will remain in the area for 
another six months.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> The number of troops will not change. In 
connection with this decision, the government will consider the 
possibility of redeploying some Canadian troops to the Balkans 
theatre, if that is what the United Nations Protection Force 
Command wishes, to provide maximum support for the current 
effort to achieve peace.
<P>
	In making its decision, the government took into account the 
encouraging progress that has been made in the area. 
Specifically, ceasefires have been negotiated and observed in 
Sarajevo. The Archbishop of Sarajevo was here in this House a 
moment ago, and this seems an opportune time to make this 
statement when all parties involved are trying to find a peaceful 
solution to the conflict in Sarajevo. We should also say that 
ceasefires have been negotiated throughout Central Bosnia, the 
parties in the conflict have begun serious negotiations, the 
airport in Tuzla has been turned over to the United Nations, and 
our unit in Srebrenica has managed to leave the enclave and 
rejoin its battalion in Visoko.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I can say today that Canadian soldiers carried out in 
Srebrenica an outstanding mission that brings credit to the 
Canadian armed forces.
<P>
	We are now in a situation where major steps have been taken 
toward a peaceful solution, in particular the agreement between 
Croats and Muslims in Bosnia to form a Confederation. It is 
important to underline the vital diplomatic intervention of the 
Americans, who invited Croatian and Muslim representatives to 
Washington and helped them take this very big step toward 
peace.
<P>
	Ceasefires have helped create an atmosphere of negotiation, 
facilitated the delivery of humanitarian aid and reduced the 
danger for the troops stationed in the area.
<P>
	Canada has been a full participant in the diplomatic talks 
surrounding these developments in NATO, the United Nations 
and other forums. On the international scene, Canada has a duty 
to speak up whenever it does not agree with something but it also 
has an obligation to protect the unity of the allies. That is what 
the Prime Minister of Canada did at the NATO summit in 
Brussels when he vigorously opposed a military escalation in 
favour of diplomacy. Canada delayed the use of air strikes that 
could have been launched last January.
<P>
	Today, without the use of air strikes, the airport in Tuzla has 
been liberated, our soldiers have left Srebrenica, and the peace 
process is resolutely moving forward. In its own way, Canada 
has served the cause of peace.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, the presence of Canadian troops 
is more important than ever. We have an obligation to continue 
supporting the efforts being made by the international 
community under the direction of the United Nations in order to 
consolidate what has been accomplished in the past few weeks 
and clear the way for more progress in implementing the 
ceasefires and agreements. Canadian troops will be used more 
and more to carry out their traditional role as peacekeepers and 
will continue the task of helping ensure that humanitarian aid 
reaches the area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I should also point out that Canada will continue to be an 
active player in the international effort to help in many ways. We 
will continue to provide financial support for various 
international humanitarian aid agencies and make military 
flights available to the United Nations to deliver that aid. We 
will continue to facilitate implementation of the United Nations 
sanctions, particularly through our naval units that are there.
<P>
	Canada is also prepared to continue its effort in other 
non-military sectors, such as the presence of a large contingent 
of Royal Canadian Mounted Police and civilian experts. We will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2133"> 2133 </A></B>
<P>
also continue our efforts to find an overall diplomatic solution to 
the current conflict.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to draw special attention to the 
outstanding job the Canadian military is doing in the former 
Yugoslavia. Despite conditions that at times have been very 
difficult, its contribution to peace is something that Canadians 
can be proud of and something that we in this House of 
Commons should commend.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
January 25, the Official Opposition actively participated in the 
debate held in this House on the future of peacekeeping 
operations and of Canada's commitment in Bosnia.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was totally sincere in deciding to reverse 
its position on this thorny and pressing issue. For a while, public 
opinion was shaken by the apparent futility of our efforts, the 
danger to which our soldiers were exposed, the costs of the 
operation, and the complexity of the political and military 
situation in Bosnia. However, the encouraging results achieved 
in recent days in Bosnia are restoring Quebecers' and 
Canadians' confidence in our commitment in that country.
<P>
	In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, Canadian missions and 
CIDA are great sources of pride in Quebec and in Canada. Both 
have helped to establish Canada's credibility in the world.
<P>
	It would have been easy to give up, to pick up all our 
equipment and leave, but it is not how Canada earned a solid 
reputation as a peacekeeping nation ready to make the extra 
effort to preserve it, as the Leader of the Opposition said earlier.
<P>
	The truth is that the Prime Minister was at least careless when 
he mentioned, on leaving Brussels at the beginning of January, 
the possibility of a unilateral withdrawal of Canadian troops 
from the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. Today, the 
government is at last reassuring its allies, with whom it must act 
in concert. It could not break the solidarity pact that Canada was 
courageous enough to draft with its NATO partners.
<P>
	The government then decided, after alarming all its partners 
involved in the United Nations Protection Force in the former 
Yugoslavia, to extend the presence of Canadian troops, whose 
mandate was set to end on March 31, for another six months.
<P>
	However, Canada refuses to respond favourably to the urgent 
appeal made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who is asking for more peacekeepers in 
Bosnia. Since strengthening the peace process requires a larger 
number of peacekeeping contingents, the Bloc Quebecois asked 
the government on many occasions to reconsider its decision not 
to send more Canadian troops to Bosnia.
<P>
	Incidentally, on this issue, today's newspapers widely report 
the opinion of Canadian General Lewis McKenzie, who 
commanded UN forces in the Sarajevo area at the beginning of 
the war.
<P>
	In his opinion, if the UN does not succeed in convincing 
member states to provide extra troops within a month, the 
opportunity for peace will be lost.
<P>
	The government must reverse its decision and respond 
favourably to the urgent appeal it received, so that peace 
achievements to this day can be built on and moved in the 
direction of total peace.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to point out once again the courage and 
dignity with which our soldiers carry out their difficult task 
overseas. They deserve our admiration and full support. We also 
think of their loved ones who are also going through a very 
difficult time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I extend our 
appreciation to the minister and to this government for allowing 
this House to discuss the Bosnian issue in January. We have 
received many comments from our constituents about the 
excellent state of those statements. I want to extend our thank 
you.
<P>
	This not only allowed the MPs to have input, it also gave the 
people of Canada the opportunity to have input. It got people 
listening, reading and discussing the issue. This form of 
consultation is not only appreciated but helps return some 
credibility to this parliamentary process which has been 
tarnished by previous governments' lack of consultation.
<P>
	The situation in the former Yugoslavia is not one which has an 
easy solution. As we expressed during the debate, none of the 
warring factions are totally right or totally wrong and an easy 
settlement is not possible.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Like the minister we appreciate the level of service our troops 
have shown and continue to show. Certainly their actions are 
what build the national pride in this country and make us the 
proud Canadians we are. The level of humanitarian aid which 
has been provided is unquestionable and the fact that our 
presence has made a difference is obvious.
<P>
	Because a tenuous ceasefire has been in force for some two 
weeks now it appears that the will of the people to settle their 
differences may exist and we should help to make it happen.
<P>
	Because some light appears at the end of the tunnel, we agree 
with this announcement today. I wish, however, this 
announcement would have included a cost estimate for this 
decision. We simply cannot keep making statements in the 
House and not include what it costs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2134"> 2134 </A></B>
<P>
	As I understand it, we will incur an additional cost for such 
things as delivering more humanitarian efforts, more military 
flights, enforcement of the UN sanctions, the RCMP, civilian 
experts, and so on. The depth of our financial crisis must be 
recognized and must be foremost in every decision we make.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see the member for Kamloops rising. 
Is there unanimous consent to have the member for Kamloops 
give a position on behalf of his party?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues in the House of Commons for this generosity.
<P>
	I feel today it is appropriate to join with others to thank the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs for his statement in the House today 
following up on the tradition that was first introduced in the 
debate in the House of Commons. As my friend in the Reform 
Party indicated, we appreciated the opportunity to share our 
views on behalf of our constituents and our political parties as to 
what the course of action ought to be in our judgment.
<P>
	At that time our spokesman, the hon. member for Burnaby, 
indicated a Canadian presence ought to be maintained, the 
traditional role of Canada in its peacekeeping tradition ought to 
be maintained, and it was crucial that our presence be there.
<P>
	I am pleased that the minister has taken time in the House 
today to announce the government's decision. We support that 
and encourage that.
<P>
	In conclusion, I simply want to say that we want to 
acknowledge the extraordinary contribution Canadian troops 
have made to bring peace to this troubled part of the world. We 
also recognize, as my colleague in the Bloc earlier indicated, the 
support for the families. They also have borne a tremendous 
burden in this effort as their friends and loved ones were serving 
in the former Yugoslavia area.
<P>
	There is a cost associated with this initiative. While we must 
be sensitive to that cost, if our contribution along with others 
representing the United Nations can be there and can bring peace 
to a part of the world where we have seen what can only be 
described as barbarism, it is a worthwhile cost.
<P>
	I thank the minister for his statement in the House today. We 
support it and are very pleased that our troops will be there to 
assist in peacekeeping and making the peace for the next six 
months.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before the member for Crowfoot 
begins his maiden speech-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	-I wish to inform the House that because of the ministerial 
statement, Government Orders will be extended 14 minutes, 
pursuant to Standing Order 33(2)(b). The hon. member for 
Crowfoot has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I rise to give 
my maiden speech in this House I would like to extend my 
personal congratulations on your appointment as Deputy 
Speaker. I would like to express my feeling of respect and 
honour for the career that you have had in politics. It is truly an 
honour for me to be making my maiden speech in this House 
with you, a fellow Albertan, in the chair.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I would like to begin by taking this opportunity to thank the 
people of Crowfoot, my constituents, for giving me the privilege 
of representing them in Ottawa. The Crowfoot riding is 
comprised primarily of farmers, ranchers and people in the 
service industry who are hard working, honest and frank.
<P>
	I have pledged to represent their views in the same open 
manner in which they conduct their lives. I live in Camrose, the 
largest urban centre of Crowfoot, with my wife, Glenna, and our 
four children Anne-Marie, Jackie, Spencer and Sterling. I 
would like to put it on record that I love them very much and I 
miss them very much. I appreciate the position of all hon. 
members who are separated from their families for long periods 
of time and the position of their families as well.
<P>
	I am proud to represent this riding which is named after the 
great Blackfoot chief, Crowfoot. Although the Blackfoot band is 
no longer in my riding, its present chief, Striker Crowfoot, is a 
direct descendant of Chief Crowfoot. We met with him some 
time ago as a caucus committee and it was wonderful to sit in his 
presence and listen to his wisdom.
<P>
	Given that my riding is larger than the province of Nova 
Scotia, it is a real task to travel to each part of my riding to 
consult with my constituents but I am committed to listening to 
the numerous opinions and concerns of the people of Crowfoot 
and to making their voices heard in the nation's capital.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2135"> 2135 </A></B>
<P>
	During the election I encountered a great deal of anger, 
frustration and a feeling of betrayal from the voters that stem 
from a belief that the politicians and government had violated 
the faith and trust that people had placed in them, that members 
of Parliament had exceeded the parameters of fair play and 
common sense and that they had been irresponsible in the 
manner in which they had conducted the affairs of this country.
<P>
	The people of Canada know that the stability of every 
organization, whether it is the family business, church or 
community organization, is governed by the fundamental law of 
economics which simply states that one cannot continually 
spend more than one brings in. If one does, one's organization 
will cease to exist.
<P>
	For more than 20 years the people of Canada have seen their 
government violate this fundamental law of economics. By 
doing so, the government has left the impression it is beyond the 
law and immune to the consequences of non-adherence to the 
economic principles that govern the private sector.
<P>
	The federal government has not balanced its budget in 20 
years. It has simply refused to live within its means. This 
government's budget has shown that it is no different than the 
past Tory and Liberal governments that have brought us to the 
brink of financial despair.
<P>
	It has ignored the enormous danger that overspending and 
over taxation poses to the economic well-being of our people 
and our nation, and by doing so has displayed contempt for the 
principles of economics that govern the private sector and that 
ultimately hold such dire consequences for every citizen of this 
country.
<P>
	The greatest threat to the economic stability of the individual 
and the family is the unrestrained power of government to tax 
away our wealth. The federal government has increased taxes 
more than 35 times in the last 10 years, adding a tax burden of 
close to $1,900 to the average Canadian family.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute claims that over 50 per cent of all we earn 
now goes to the three levels of government in the form of 
taxation. In spite of the enormous amount of wealth the federal 
government has taken from the people each year, we find 
ourselves in a debt hole of over half a trillion dollars and 
plunging another $40 billion into debt this year.
<P>
	This represents a colossal mismanagement of Canada's fiscal 
and monetary affairs and a degree of irresponsibility unheard of 
in the private sector. While the politicians have been plunging us 
into debt the people of this country have watched as the same 
politicians gave themselves pensions so extravagant and 
outrageous that Mr. Clark, for example, will receive over $3 
million in benefits by age 75 and Perrin Beatty will receive close 
to $5 million.
<P>
	These politicians take home a pension cheque each month 
greater than the paycheque of the average Canadian worker. This 
is unfair and unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The perception that politicians ignore proper practices and 
procedures has been reinforced in the past five years by the 
almost daily violation of the rule of law that governs the 
procedure of the House of Commons by members of Parliament.
<P>
	On almost any day during the previous Parliament, Canadians 
could have tuned in and witnessed a violation of Standing Order 
16 when hon. members interrupted procedures by shouting, 
hollering and hurling insults at each other. Canadians watched 
the complete disregard for the rule of law that governs the 
procedure of the very institution that creates the laws of this 
nation.
<P>
	When hon. members show contempt for the rule of law in this 
House, why should we be surprised when those outside this 
House show a similar contempt for the law?
<P>
	If we as members of Parliament cannot govern our own 
feelings and emotions, why should the people trust us to govern 
the affairs of this nation?
<P>
	No wonder people have lost faith in their government and no 
wonder politicians are held in such contempt across the country. 
The faith and trust of Canadians have been violated and they feel 
betrayed.
<P>
	What has been the result of this feeling of betrayal on the part 
of Canadians? The reaction has been two-fold. The political 
reaction of Canadians has been the complete destruction of the 
Tory government, the decimation of the NDP caucus and the 
election of 52 Reform MPs who campaigned on a platform of 
fiscal restraint, tax relief and parliamentary reform.
<P>
	The economic reaction of Canadians to this betrayal of trust is 
much more ominous. An underground economy has developed 
in this country which some estimate at $100 billion per year. 
People are opting out of a tax system which they consider to be 
unfair and threatening to their personal and family survival. 
Canadians living near the U.S. border are shopping in the states 
to avoid the GST and other taxes. The number of normally 
law-abiding citizens willing to risk prosecution to purchase 
bootlegged cigarettes and other products to avoid high taxes is 
growing. These people are rejecting our tax system because they 
consider it unfair and a threat to their economic survival.
<P>
	They see government over-spending and they see the waste of 
taxpayer's dollars on every side and they feel betrayed. They see 
a justice system run amok; a parole system that releases violent 
criminals onto the streets who continue to rape and murder; a 
Young Offender's Act that cannot hold 10-year olds accountable 
for their criminal conduct. They see legislation that is impotent 
and unable to protect society against criminal acts; legislation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2136"> 2136 </A></B>
<P>
such as the ill-conceived gun control bill which  is wrongly 
aimed at law-abiding citizens and not at the criminal use of 
firearms.
<P>
	Canadians have seen wave after wave of political patronage 
which has such a demeaning and destructive effect upon the 
integrity of politicians and government in the minds of 
Canadians. Now they hear the Prime Minister telling them it is 
disgusting and revolting to allow them the right to have a say in 
deciding important issues, moral issues like mercy killing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister repeatedly reminds this House that 
Canadians knew what was best at election time. It was not 
disgusting and revolting for them to participate in the election of 
their representatives. However, as soon as he became Prime 
Minister he suddenly knew what is best.
<P>
	From this I know best attitude, the hallmark of the Trudeau 
and the Mulroney administrations and now continued by the 
present Prime Minister, we have a nation beset with high taxes, 
enormous debt and a justice system that cannot protect the 
property and lives of Canadians.
<P>
	In spite of all the budget consultations throughout the country, 
the I know best attitude is still evident. Canadians did not ask for 
or want another $100 billion added to the debt and yet that is 
exactly what the Liberal government is doing with this budget.
<P>
	The government did not inform Canadians of this planned 
addition to the debt and it has omitted mentioning the dangers of 
adding $100 billion to the existing debt of half a trillion dollars.
<P>
	Why does this budget not say a word about the consequences 
this will have upon our nation and our people? What will it do to 
our social programs, to our economic stability, to our 
international credit rating and to the one million children 
reported to be living in poverty? What will the addition of 
another $100 billion to the debt do to further enhance the sense 
of betrayal felt by a growing number of Canadians throughout 
this country?
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	This budget shows a lack of concern with the debt. This 
government is spending $3 billion more this year than last. It is 
taking more money from Canadians and out of the economy than 
it did last year. This budget shows no concern for the dangers to 
Canadians posed by the ever-rising debt.
<P>
	Past governments, including Liberals, showed no concern 
about the dangers of debt. The Liberals left us with a $200 
billion debt in 1984. The Tories could not handle that debt and 
simply added another $300 billion to it.
<P>
	Now this government is promising to add $100 billion to the 
federal debt in the next three years with no mention of the 
devastating consequences this debt poses for our nation and our 
people.
<P>
	This irresponsible action by the governments of the old line 
parties which is contained in this budget is absolutely 
unacceptable to me and to Canadians. These governments 
through the force of law have imposed a tyranny of debt and 
taxation upon the people of this nation. The mismanagement of 
our fiscal and monetary affairs by this and past governments is 
destroying the economy of this nation.
<P>
	The life of this nation depends upon the economy and it 
depends upon the spirit of the people who constitute the nation. 
The feelings of anger, frustration and betrayal run deep in this 
country and are taking their toll upon the spirit of Canadians.
<P>
	Nothing will change those feelings until Canadians are able to 
place their trust in the people whom they have chosen to govern 
them. This budget could have been a start. This budget could 
have helped heal the broken economy and sparked the spirit and 
hope of our people. It has not done this.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to address the good that is in this 
budget and there is good in this budget. It has been spoken of by 
members on both sides of the House. From my particular 
viewpoint, I view the good in this budget like adding a needed 
piece of furniture to a house that is burning down.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to support the budget that was tabled on February 22 
by my colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The federal budget has set out a responsible course of action 
to bring the deficit under control and put Canadians back to 
work. It builds on the need to tackle the deficit, reform social 
programs and devise plans to assist our unemployed.
<P>
	This budget reflects the government's belief that, by working 
together with Canadians, we must make changes to improve the 
economy. The budget's provisions will have a significant impact 
on every Canadian, but I believe the Minister of Finance has 
struck an equitable balance between spending restraints and 
carefully-planned measures that will encourage economic 
growth.
<P>
	The goal of the budget, said the Minister of Finance is, and I 
quote: ``- a balanced approach to fundamental reform-to 
create jobs, to continue to care for those in need, and to get the 
deficit down''. Indeed, the diverse nature of Canada's economy 
places ever-increasing importance on a fast, reliable and 
low-cost transportation system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2137"> 2137 </A></B>
<P>
	Transportation is the life-support system of the country's 
exports and a critical factor in the competitiveness of Canadian 
industry. A prime example of the importance of transportation 
efficiency is the share of export prices attributable to transport 
costs. Between 18 and 45 per cent of the selling price of our 
primary products-coal, forest products, grain and 
lumber-goes to transportation. Transportation represents an 
estimated five per cent of the cost of manufactured export 
goods and, in some cases, is as high as 17 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The transportation industry is a major employer, providing 
for more than 442,000 direct and 378,000 indirect jobs-many 
of them highly skilled.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are many significant challenges facing the 
transportation sector in our country. Changes brought about by 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement demand an efficient 
transportation system. With the globalization of markets and 
new trading arrangements, Canada's focus is shifting to the 
growing north-south traffic and our increasing exports and 
passenger travel overseas.
<P>
	Our east-west transportation demands must continue to be 
met and these needs should expand in the future with the 
successful completion of internal trade negotiations and 
improved market access for our primary commodities through 
the Uruguay round agreements.
<P>
	However, our transportation industries, notably the airlines 
and railways, have suffered and continue to suffer major 
financial losses. Canada's two major airlines are in serious 
financial difficulty. Only time will tell whether they can 
survive.
<P>
	Recent developments, such as the end of the Air Canada legal 
action and the entanglement with Canadian Airlines 
International over Gemini and other issues, illustrate our 
commitment as a government to work closely with the industry 
in every way and certainly to try to improve its commercial 
viability and its ability to compete in the global marketplace.
<P>
	We are looking forward to analysing any proposals that may 
be brought forward by CN and CP to merge or otherwise 
rationalize their operations in Canada from coast to coast. Our 
evaluation of any rail rationalization proposal will attempt to 
strike the appropriate balance between the needs of users and the 
interests of workers. However, I want to stress that for me, for 
the government and for the department our primary concern will 
be the interests of the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	Our decision will take into account the many dynamic 
changes in the North American rail industry and the economy in 
general, including the growing importance of north-south 
traffic, intermodal competition and integration, the possibility 
of increased competition from south of the border, which 
certainly exists, technological  change and any potential 
economic efficiencies we may be able to achieve.
<P>
	VIA Rail is another entity for which our department is 
responsible and which faces a very, very troubled future. There 
will have to be a remarkable combination of efficiency gains at 
VIA Rail and rationalization of its operations or the cost to the 
Canadian taxpayer to support VIA will escalate even far beyond 
where it is now.
<P>
	We have to recognize that some of Canada's transportation 
systems are overbuilt and far too heavily subsidized. 
Ninety-five per cent of all Canada's air passengers and cargo are 
handled at only 25 of our many, many airports. Eighty-four per 
cent of rail traffic is carried on 33 per cent of the lines. Eighty 
per cent of port traffic passes just through 5 per cent of our ports.
<P>
	We are spending a lot of money in this country for 
transportation. In the main estimates we have indicated that it is 
the government's intention to spend $619 million on the 
Canadian Coast Guard, $710 million on the air navigation 
system, $430 million on airports. We will pay $331 million for 
passenger rail services, $159 million for ferry services, nearly 
$650 million under the Western Grain Transportation Act and in 
excess of $100 million on the Atlantic Region Freight 
Assistance Act and the Maritime Freight Rates Act.
<P>
	These are huge numbers, beyond the comprehension of most 
Canadians, but they are numbers that are going to have to be 
looked at very seriously.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must separate the desirable from the essential-and the 
essential must be the focus of the transportation system of the 
future. There are tough decisions to be made. In this context, the 
budget calls on me, as Minister of Transport, to discuss with my 
provincial colleagues the development of a highly-effective, 
integrated, affordable, surface freight transportation system, 
and the redirection of subsidies to improve the efficiency of that 
system. For example, it has become clear that the national 
highway system in this country needs to be upgraded. The 
provincial and federal transport ministers have agreed on what 
has to be done. Now, the finance ministers must find a way to 
pay for it.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Scarce financial resources must be redirected to the 
development of an integrated, multimodal, affordable 
transportation system. We must bring together many of the 
components that are available to us in the transportation sector 
to make sure we have the best possible system. The challenge 
undoubtedly is going to be very difficult for industry to meet, 
especially for the railways and airlines when they are struggling 
to find more efficient ways 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2138"> 2138 </A></B>
<P>
to conduct their business. The government too has to meet the 
challenges of very limited resources.
<P>
	For our part at Transport Canada, we are implementing our 
own cost-cutting initiatives in keeping with the provisions 
contained in my colleague's new budget. We are pursuing 
approaches that involve a mix of modal integration, 
pragmatism, innovation and most of all hard-nosed realism. We 
are focusing on solutions that will be important for Canada's 
future rather than dwelling on the romanticism and nostalgia of 
the past, as important as Pierre Burton's view of Canada might 
be.
<P>
	The budget provides for increases to the air transportation tax, 
an opportunity to demonstrate that we want to reduce the 
transportation cost burden on the taxpayer and shift costs to 
those who use the various systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Transport Canada provides many services. Users are 
contributing 42 per cent of the $2.1 billion cost of these 
services, but the taxpayer is picking up the remaining 58 per 
cent.
<P>
	We are going to ensure that those who benefit most directly 
from a service or facility pay a fair share of the cost. A better 
balance between taxpayers and users was strongly supported by 
the Royal Commission on National Passenger Transportation 
and by the National Transportation Act Review Commission. 
Let me emphasize that Transport Canada's proposed fee 
increases for 1994-95 are related directly to inflation rates since 
the last increase.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The time has come for government to look at new ways of 
providing services. In his budget the Minister of Finance stated 
that we would look at initiating the concept of 
commercialization at Transport Canada.
<P>
	I am a strong believer in the ability of the private sector to get 
the job done. In Canada, if ever there was a time when those who 
do the job best should be allowed to do just that, this is it.
<P>
	We will look at every opportunity to collaborate with the 
private sector to provide transportation services to Canadians. 
We will not be timid about asking the private sector to do what it 
can do best. We will also make sure that the role of government, 
however, continues to be to set policy and to ensure adequate 
services for all Canadians.
<P>
	Traditional ways of the past do not allow today for quick 
responses to rapidly changing needs. The government does not 
have to own and operate a system in order to achieve its public 
policy goals. I believe that commercialization is an attractive 
option since it brings business discipline to the provision of 
services often traditionally delivered by government.
<P>
	Commercialization can take many forms from government 
operations to non-profit entities, special operating agencies and 
crown corporations and can include privatization, can include 
mixes of those various components. Regardless of the form it 
means we must adopt a businesslike approach which is more 
efficient, more responsive to clients and less dependent on the 
Canadian taxpayer. The benefits can be better capital planning, 
access to private financing, faster approval, easier introduction 
of new technologies and more user and client input.
<P>
	There is great potential for commercialization including for 
example the air navigation system, St. Lawrence seaway 
activities, short line railways, coast guard. I believe that 
commercialization in these and many other areas of government 
activity can bring major savings to taxpayers and better service 
to clients. Any move to commercialization will respect our 
government's commitment to maintaining Canada's high 
standards in the transportation sector.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We cannot ask more of users than we ask of ourselves so I am 
pleased to tell the House today that new management initiatives 
at Transport Canada with respect to overhead costs will result in 
annual savings of some $50 million. This will involve the 
reduction in the number of positions in our department by about 
1,000 over the next four to five years.
<P>
	Overhead costs will be examined every year and in this 
context Transport Canada managers are aware of my very 
serious and deep concern about employees who may be affected 
by such changes that they must be dealt with sensitively and 
fairly in accordance with the government's workforce 
adjustment policy.
<P>
	Over the years Transport Canada has achieved significant 
reductions in expenditures in the provision of facilities and 
services. Overall the net result has been a reduction, for 
example, in operation budgets from 1985-1986 to 1993-1994 of 
$.5 billion.
<P>
	During the same period the workforce was reduced by 2,400 
person years or over 11 per cent. These reductions have been 
achieved despite an increase in most aggregate workload 
indicators.
<P>
	I have discussed some of the transportation issues that must 
be examined in the context of our new budget. I believe the 
components of the budget and the actions we are taking together 
with the co-operation of users of transportation services 
represent a balanced national program to meet Canada's needs.
<P>
	Our government is fully committed to helping Canadians 
build a stronger economy. We intend to move forward on 
policies that will bring immediate gains in transportation 
efficiencies and we will try to protect jobs but we have to 
maintain transportation security and safety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2139"> 2139 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians want to control their future and they are very 
respectful of their past. I have said on many occasions that aside 
from railroads and the nostalgia of the building of this great 
country, as important as it might be, we now have to look at 
the realities we face today. I will paraphrase the words of 
Geoffrey Simpson in the introduction of his book ``Faultlines''. 
He discussed the national railway as the national dream of the 
19th century.
<P>
	I think for most Canadians, as we go through this process of 
trying to find an equitable equilibrium between our resources 
and those services we want to provide for Canadians, recognize 
that there is a national dream at this stage in our nation's history. 
It probably has to do with taking care of people in social 
programs such as medicare.
<P>
	Times have changed and we are going to have to reflect that. 
At Transport Canada because of the tremendous contribution 
that various sectors in the transportation industry have made to 
the development of Canada I know it is very difficult for many to 
accept these changes.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians insist that their government have the 
means to maintain vital programs, policies and services and that 
we must have the flexibility to respond to priorities that we have 
become all too much aware of.
<P>
	A national, integrated and affordable transportation system is 
not the new national dream. As we prepare for the 21st century a 
national, integrated and affordable transportation system is a 
national necessity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> I can say that after 
listening to the Minister of Transport, there is one point on 
which I agree: if our current railway network corresponds to the 
national dream, that dream is pretty obsolete.
<P>
	After listening to his speech, I concluded that the Minister of 
Transport had become a subsidiary of Treasury Board, because 
he told us basically that we had to cut costs and raise fares. I 
expected some vision of the future.
<P>
	He told us that if there was a merger between CN and CP, they 
would examine it. But why does the minister not make a merger 
mandatory and provide clear guidelines on maintaining 
essential services, cutting costs and making railway services 
competitive?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Why is the minister waiting for CN and CP to come up with 
proposals, when today we are told this will take at least another 
year. Meanwhile, they will sell off assets. A lot of this property 
is on railway lines, and major assets will be transferred to real 
estate subsidiaries of these companies. These assets are now 
worth a lot of money and were probably acquired for a song, 
with government assistance.
<P>
	There is another matter that is even more important for the 
future of this country, and the Minister of Transport did not even 
bother to mention it. The high-speed train project for the 
Quebec City-Windsor corridor, a project for the future, a project 
based on new technologies that will be able to meet both 
transportation requirements of a billion dollar North American 
market for new technologies, and would you believe, Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport did not say a word about this 
project?
<P>
	Could the Minister of Transport perhaps give us some idea of 
what the prospects are for the future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding the hon. member's 
comments about the merger being discussed by officials of CN 
and CP, we said that we will certainly consider the proposal that 
might be made to the Government of Canada as CN's 
shareholder.
<P>
	Of course we are willing to look at all these possibilities. 
Those who know Canada's railways even a little already know 
that Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not have any 
rail service. CP will abandon its lines in eastern Canada, east of 
Sherbrooke, next January.
<P>
	My hon. colleague was there when all these things were 
decided by the previous government. For our part, we will 
certainly listen to what the two railways have to suggest to us. 
We are very aware of the need to find an efficient system that can 
be maintained in Canada, but we insist that all elements of the 
transportation sector must be combined in a system that is 
efficient and that we can afford.
<P>
	Line abandonments will certainly continue. The Canadian 
taxpayer is certainly unable at the end of the 20th century to 
support a system that was undoubtedly efficient 30 or 40 years 
ago, but we are trying to phase it out as fairly and equitably as 
possible, taking account of other alternatives.
<P>
	As for the high-speed train, my hon. colleague no doubt 
knows that the governments of Quebec, Ontario and Canada are 
now conducting a multi-million-dollar study. This study is to be 
completed in the spring and I hope that a report will be available 
to us this summer. I believe that it would be very wrong of me to 
say whether or not we should have a high-speed train system 
before listening to our colleagues from Quebec and Ontario, 
because we think that they have worked hard and deserve a 
hearing when they come to us with a report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the minister on his speech. It was 
certainly positive and we need to look forward to efficiency at a 
reasonable cost today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2140"> 2140 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister is genuinely trying to go in that direction. It is 
encouraging that the ideas coming out have not been shown in 
decades. I congratulate the minister for that.
<P>
	Airports, particularly small airports in this country, have cost 
taxpayers millions of dollars. That is unfortunate but sometimes 
often considered necessary because small airports have trouble 
getting revenue from landing fees, expansion, and so on.
<P>
	In my own community the Abbotsford airport, home of the 
International Abbotsford Air Show, has been trying for several 
years to have its own airport authority which would have seen 
the result of fewer tax dollars in the federal government and 
local taxing authority looking after the airport.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	In many discussions we had in previous years with the 
previous government it seemed that we got into the bureaucracy 
and there ended what would be considered a fruitful discussion.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister might enlighten us as to where these 
small airports are going to go eventually. Is the minister open to 
trying to get some of these communities that want their own 
airport authorities to get them moved from the Department of 
Transport locally?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps a small airport, yes. We are 
all very familiar with the activity at Abbotsford with the big air 
show.
<P>
	I reassure my friend that it is the intention of the government 
to facilitate the devolution of operations for airports to 
communities across the country. We will probably encourage 
them very aggressively to do that.
<P>
	I want to indicate that the operating budgets for smaller 
airports generally speaking should be manageable. We do 
recognize that the capital investment is not always possible. It is 
very difficult to raise capital. It is very difficult to find sufficient 
capital to be able to do the things that are required to maintain 
the levels of service at airports.
<P>
	We want to be very even handed about it. We have said that 
with respect to Pearson and other large airports across the 
country. We want to be consistent. It is our philosophy to look at 
the wide range of options from government operated airports all 
the way out to privatization.
<P>
	I suspect that we will be recommending a form of local 
authority with some degree of accountability. Where individuals 
from the community who best know their needs manage those 
airports in a form of relationship with the Government of 
Canada that will respect the interest of the Canadian taxpayer, 
we intend to do that very soon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the Minister of Transport who said that some 
significant investments of the order of $470 million are 
expected for airports, at least in the budget, if I understood 
correctly.
<P>
	Also, I took note of the answer he gave to the hon. member for 
Rosemont earlier in which he said that he could not commit to a 
high-speed train project because a study was underway. I would 
like to point out to the minister, before I ask him a question, that 
all the studies on the expansion and upgrading of Jean Lesage 
Airport are done. They have been shelved and we are only 
waiting for the Minister of Transport to release the money 
needed to go ahead.
<P>
	I would like to remind the minister that, in the Summer of 
1993, this facility was given the status of an international 
airport. However, we are under the impression that this is only a 
token status, since Jean Lesage Airport is in rather poor shape, 
compared to other airports in Halifax, Winnipeg, and Edmonton. 
It only has a third of the space these other facilities have.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to do something in 1994 to expand 
this international airport so it can meet current needs? There is 
consensus among experts in the field on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am well aware of the situation in 
Ancienne-Lorette with respect to Aéroport Jean-Lesage, 
Quebec City's airport. You are correct in saying that studies 
have been carried out and proposals and specifications have 
been drawn up. I am sorry to have to tell my hon. colleague that 
we have not been able to do everything in four months. When we 
started to review these files, plans had been under way for some 
time already. Discussions had taken place and representations 
had been made. I regret that the previous administration was 
unable to complete the Quebec City airport project.
<P>
	However, I want to assure the hon. member that we are 
working on proposals based on what it would cost to carry out 
the needed work at the Quebec City international airport. I hope 
that I will have an answer for him fairly soon. However, while 
we are on the subject of the budget, the figures that I quoted in 
my speech are generally associated with the cost of airport 
operations, rather than with airport construction costs. I hope 
that a decision can be reached, and that the comments of my hon. 
colleague will be taken into consideration.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to comment on the Budget brought down by the 
Minister of Finance on February 22.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
and as the Official Opposition critic for training and youth, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2141"> 2141 </A></B>
<P>
think, Mr. Speaker, it is only appropriate that I should address 
the social impact of the  Budget and especially the impact on the 
future of our youth.
<P>
	I would like to start by discussing the proposed changes in the 
unemployment insurance plan, because I think that is where the 
Liberal government has been most remiss since it was elected. 
But is unemployment not our most pressing problem?
<P>
	In 1989, one million Canadians were unemployed. In 1993, 
there were 1.6 million, an increase of 60 per cent. Unlike what 
the Liberals said when they were in the opposition and during 
the last election campaign, they are applying the same policies 
as the Conservatives, in other words, they would rather attack 
the unemployed than try to create jobs.
<P>
	For instance, they decided to maintain the increases in 
unemployment insurance premiums proposed earlier by the 
Conservatives. Although yesterday during Question Period, the 
Minister of Finance admitted this did not make sense, he will not 
make any changes for another year, apparently hoping that the 
social program reforms being discussed today will provide the 
necessary funding to create 40,000 new jobs next year.
<P>
	Why not do it this year? After all, the government had no 
qualms about cancelling the helicopter contract and 
backtracking on the privatization of Pearson airport. Freezing 
unemployment insurance premiums last January would have 
been easier than rolling them back a year from now.
<P>
	Generally speaking, the changes in the unemployment 
insurance program will mean that people will have to work 
longer to be eligible for lower benefits received for a shorter 
period of time.
<P>
	A study by professors at the department of economics of the 
University of Québec in Montreal shows that more than half of 
the cutbacks announced in the latest federal budget will be at the 
expense of Canada's unemployed.
<P>
	By introducing different benefit levels, the government is 
dividing the unemployed into two categories: low income 
unemployed people with dependants and the others. To justify 
its decision, the government cites a supposed notion of equity, 
when instead it is a breach of the universality principle which 
has been the cornerstone of our social programs since the 
beginning. It amounts to discrimination based on family status.
<P>
	For example, what will happen to equity when both spouses 
are unemployed? Which one will be entitled to higher benefits? 
Time does not allow me to give more examples, but there are a 
lot more. With more diversified eligibility standards, it will 
become increasingly necessary to monitor claims. After the 
boubous macoutes we have seen in Quebec, are we going to have 
Martin macoutes and Axworthy macoutes?
<P>
	Another one of the perverse effects of UI reform is the fact 
that it passes the buck to the provinces. By reducing the duration 
of benefits and delaying eligibility, in a time of high 
unemployment, this reform will push more people onto welfare, 
which will mean more expenses for the provinces and a loss of 
dignity for individuals.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, a greater number of persons who want to 
participate in various training programs will be disqualified 
because, as you know, most of the federal training programs are 
now intended for UI recipients.
<P>
	On the other hand, if the benefit period is shortened, 
unemployment insurance reform will lead some people to accept 
insecure, often low-paying jobs bearing no relationship 
whatsoever with their skills. By forcing them to accept 
low-paying jobs just to survive, we are preventing these people 
from seeking more appropriate employment.
<P>
	Is that this government's new philosophy on human resource 
development? Being unemployed often pushes people into 
insecure, precarious jobs. The proposed reform affects honest 
workers who are actively looking for work and who have a hard 
time finding a permanent job because of the present economic 
situation.
<P>
	Several studies have shown that more than 90 per cent of the 
unemployed have lost their jobs through no fault of their own or 
are looking for their first job. Most of them have no control over 
the duration of that job. The problem is not that the unemployed 
do not want to work, but rather that there is not enough work for 
everyone.
<P>
	I also want to mention some statistics regarding our young 
people, such as the fact that 17.5 per cent of young Canadians 
and 20 per cent of young Quebecers are currently unemployed, 
for a total of more than 600,000 individuals. In Canada as well 
as in Quebec, the drop-out rate in high schools is around 30 per 
cent. According to a report published by the Conseil permanent 
de la jeunesse du Québec, close to 40 per cent of young 
Quebecers live in poverty. Across the country, there are two 
million young people under 30 who live below the poverty level.
<P>
	Yet, in its budget, the federal government offers nothing 
really new to young people. The Youth Service Corps, which 
was widely publicized in the red book, seems to be the only 
government initiative for our young. Some meetings took place 
in December and in January, but a report has yet to be released.
<P>
	According to the most recent information, that is according to 
copies which were circulated when those consultations took 
place, the Youth Service Corps would only include 2,500 young 
people the first year, 5,000 the second year, and 10,000 after 
three years. Is that an adequate measure, considering that there 
are 600,000 young unemployed in Canada? We do not think so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2142"> 2142 </A></B>
<P>
	Moreover, it seems that young people participating in this 
program would only receive $61 a week if they still live at 
home, and $121 otherwise. Ask yourself this question: Would 
you accept such an arrangement for your own children who are 
old enough to work?
<P>
	To make things even worse, the Youth Service Corps seems, 
for the time being, more geared to occupational activities, with 
no direct link to the labour market, as was the case with the 
Katimavik project abolished by the Conservatives in 1986.
<P>
	So far, all the organizations dedicated to helping young 
people which have been heard by the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development have said that when young 
people leave school they need practical and relevant experience 
to find real jobs. The federal government would be well advised 
to increase its financial support to existing organizations instead 
of creating another structure such as the Youth Service Corps.
<P>
	Since I sit on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development, I would like to conclude by relating what I have 
heard over the last few weeks from various groups and 
individuals during our public hearings on social programs 
reform. What has struck me so far is that the majority do not 
seem to be in favour of a reduction of resources, quite the 
contrary. Other trends are also evident. There is fairly 
widespread support for a major decentralization of the 
management of social programs and for greater involvement of 
local communities.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Also, it is increasingly obvious in this consultation that there 
are two social realities in Canada and two expectations with 
respect to the federal government.
<P>
	Some groups in English Canada want a greater federal 
presence in social security and even more national standards; on 
the other hand, Quebec groups and organizations in general have 
a completely different vision. They turn more to the 
Government of Quebec. But the most significant trend with all 
groups is deep concern about employment. Obviously, we must 
bring together all available resources and target all our efforts to 
increasing the number of jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	The Official Opposition talks about reducing the deficit but 
continues to seek increases in federal transfer payments. The 
Official Opposition talks about deficit reduction by cutting 
government administration, yet federal transfer payments and 
social programs amount to 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the 
budget. The books cannot be balanced without cutting federal 
transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	When will the member realize that his plan falls considerably 
short of doing any such thing as reducing the deficit when he 
insists on having lucrative social programs supported by the 
federal government?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer might sound, to the hon. 
member's ears, like a repetition of what has already been said, 
but I believe that, at times, repetition is a good thing.
<P>
	First, as far as job training is concerned, it is clearly 
established-and nobody denied the validity of the 
figures-that the elimination of all duplications would produce 
savings of $250 million in Quebec alone, which extrapolated for 
the whole country would mean a billion dollar saving. This is a 
first step.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois never concealed the fact that it wanted 
cuts in military spending, but we were talking about 
administrative costs. In that sense we agree with several 
comments of your party. However, there is another question to 
consider, and that is unemployment among young people. 
Allowing young people with a university or college degree, and 
very often a heavy debt load, to be without a job paying decent 
wages, is denying the government revenues in the future, 
revenues that could help finance its spending program. More 
unemployed young people means more spending and less 
revenues. It is very important that we reflect on this and that we 
do it rather quickly.
<P>
	Being unemployed is always traumatic, but for young people, 
studies have shown that failure to find employment related to 
the acquired knowledge or skills within two years can lead-and 
this is a widespread conclusion-to total despondency and 
erratic behaviour. This in turn could create serious social 
problems and significant expenses. So, we can expect more 
spending in the future and, primarily, people who will be unable 
to contribute to deficit reduction.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac): </B>Mr. Speaker, in 
response to the Minister of Finance's budget statement, I would 
like to make a three-pronged retrospective. First of all, I would 
like to talk about the last election campaign, about the purgatory 
of the federal Liberal Party, the nine years it spent on this side of 
the House, and also about the nine years the Conservative Party 
was in office.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the party in office, under 
its leader, created a lot of hope among the people. Quebecers, as 
well as Canadians, were given the usual package of election 
promises and slogans which they sincerely believed in for a 
while.
<P>
	Today, we have a rude awakening. We suddenly realize that 
we did not have just a bad dream, but that, once again, reality is 
striking us savagely in the face. The change of direction that 
Liberals were proposing is quickly becoming totally meaning-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2143"> 2143 </A></B>
<P>
less, and people are  stuck with this monotonous, Conservative 
continuity, void of all rigour and fairness.
<P>
	This government, opposite, promised without any restraint a 
major job renewal to the people, and here I quote a part of what it 
was promising: ``We will, once and for all, put the people of this 
country back to work''. What a lie!
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians fell into a trap. That party that now 
forms the government is far from the innovation that it was 
promising in the red book, and I quote again: ``When we form 
the government, we will innovate, we will look at our problems 
in a new light. We will not go for the usual recipes''. Again, what 
a lie!
<P>
	National Defence, public service, unemployment insurance: 
the same targets, the same cutbacks as those of the previous 
governments, whether Conservative or Liberal.
<P>
	On top of that, this government has misled the average 
workers, the senior citizens and those in need by emphasizing 
interesting future opportunities through a rewarding job or 
through social programs which would be humane and sensible.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that the people of the county of Frontenac 
as well as those from the other counties in this country, once 
their votes were assured, were ignored, scorned by this 
government, which is quite clearly demonstrated in this budget. 
As a popular song written by the great Quebecer Felix Leclerc 
says: ``The day before the election, he calls him son, but the day 
after, as one might expect, he has forgotten his name''.
<P>
	The average taxpayers from the county of Frontenac and 
elsewhere were deceived and they are the ones who will have to 
pay the tab. The Minister of Finance predicts a revenue increase 
of 15 per cent for 1995-96.
<P>
	This increase will have to be made possible through 
additional taxes imposed on the middle class taxpayers, because 
of the 10 million taxpayers, almost 85 per cent declare an 
income which is less than $30,000. So it is an unfair and 
shocking measure.
<P>
	Older people as well are getting a taste of the same medecine 
since they are progressively losing their tax credit while 
dividends on shares and family trusts are still exempt from tax. 
It is the very taxation system which is scorned by this 
government.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	How am I going to explain to the unemployed in the riding of 
Frontenac-whether it be in Thetford Mines, East Broughton, 
Sainte-Méthode, Coleraine or Plessisville, that this liberal 
government has no plan whatsoever to create jobs and has not 
considered any-I repeat, has not considered any-long term 
job creation measures?
<P>
	How am I going to explain to the people of the riding of 
Frontenac that this budget does not contain any measures to 
stimulate economic growth or any measures regarding job 
creation, in view of the fact that this  governement has been 
elected on a platform that proclaimed loudly and clearly its 
strong commitment to the creation of good jobs to restore 
dignity and hope?
<P>
	Yet, Canadians, in particular Quebecers, have two clear and 
well defined objectives. First, they want a gouvernment that 
creates jobs and at the same time a government that has a broad 
plan towards employment. Second, they want the governement 
to be more responsible in its management of taxpayers money, 
especially in these times of recession.
<P>
	How am I to explain to the unemployed in the riding of 
Frontenac that from now on, the period during which they will 
be allowed to receive unemployment benefits will be shorter, 
that their benefits will be 2 p. 100 less and that they will have to 
work longer in order to qualify for unemployment benefits, so as 
to help reduce the deficit? How do I explain to unemployed 
workers that they must tighten their belts while the member for 
Hull-Aylmer, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
spends more than $150,000 in travel costs to give a brief 
speech-listen to this-on the benefits of sound management?
<P>
	How do I explain to them that the Minister of Finance spent 
$800,000, or nearly $1 million, on public consultations? How do 
I explain to the president of the seniors club of Saint-Alphonse 
parish in Thetford Mines that 800,000 people age 65 and over 
will see their age credit reduced or quite simply eliminated, 
depending on their income, while at the same time, the Governor 
General hosts a costly reception to mark the opening of the 35th 
Parliament?
<P>
	My constituents no longer trust the old-style federal 
politicians who often treat them with cynicism and indifference. 
The Minister of Finance saw this for himself during the last 
election campaign during a swing through Thetford Mines. At 
the Balmoral, barely 30 people showed up to greet him at a $30 a 
plate evening fund-raiser. Not 3,000 people, but barely 30 
voters.
<P>
	The budget is unfair in that it spares the wealthy, who are 
often friends of the government, contribute to the election 
coffers and enjoy a strong, well-organized and effective lobby 
to influence the policies of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	With his half-laced Kodiac work boots, our Minister of 
Finance was not a bit like our asbestos miners. He bore no 
resemblance whatsoever to a good, hard-working individual. It 
was a disgraceful spectacle, one that only seasoned actors can 
get away with. Only, the spectators certainly did not enjoy being 
the butt of this joke.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2144"> 2144 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The clever tricks employed by the Minister of Finance during 
the pre-budget period did not escape the public eye. No one was 
fooled by the old trick of setting people up well in advance to 
expect the worst in order to get them to swallow a very bitter 
pill.
<P>
	However, and this concludes my remarks, the medicine has 
had the desired effect. My constituents are bitterly disappointed 
and sick at heart. They feel betrayed and victimized because 
they have been repeatedly targeted. As environment critic, I 
must comment briefly on this department's budget.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions and comments period. I am 
willing to recognize the hon. member for Rosemont, but he 
should stand in his place. I can wait for him to go back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> I appreciate your great 
kindness, Mr. Speaker. If I may, I would like to ask my hon. 
friend from Frontenac, who is the Bloc Quebecois critic for the 
environment, to tell us what this budget means for the 
environment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Rosemont. It is a very pertinent question, because, 
as you very well know, Mr. Speaker, in 1994, the economy and 
the environment go hand in hand. Moreover, it was a very 
important part of the red book. Since the member for Rosemont 
is also a well-informed environmentalist, he is interested in the 
environment and I want to take the opportunity to denounce 
what the budget does on environmental issues.
<P>
	The Department of the Environment is one of the few to have 
its budget increased-you will see later why I mention this. Of 
course, we must be grateful for a 4.1 per cent increase, but some 
measures are not so good. Listen to this: the budget for Phase II 
of the St. Lawrence Action Plan will increase by $18.4 million. 
Of course, I am pleased with this initiative that will implement 
Phase II of the project. This increase shows that this program is 
giving excellent results. So why has the agreement for this 
second phase, which was to be signed with the Government of 
Quebec in December, still not been signed, and even worse, has 
$18.4 million been added to this part?
<P>
	It would also seem that 40 per cent of the pollution in the St. 
Lawrence River comes from the Great Lakes. From the latest 
report of the International Joint Commission which was 
presented to us less than three weeks ago, we know that 
pollution in the Great Lakes affects human health. Despite that, 
the Liberal government opposite is cutting $5 million from the 
budget to clean up the Great Lakes, and we know that 40 per cent 
of the pollution in the St. Lawrence River comes from the Great 
Lakes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Something is not working!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Yes, something is not working. 
So on the one hand, the budget to clean up the river is being 
increased and, on the other, the budget for cleaning up the more 
polluted body of water, the Great Lakes, is reduced. It makes one 
wonder what has become of the coherent approach to sustainable 
development, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I conclude with that and I thank all hon. members for listening 
to me so kindly.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order! Pursuant to Standing Order 38, 
it is my duty to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for Bourassa-Immigration.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me as the 
member of Parliament for York West to participate in the debate 
on the government's budget.
<P>
	Budgets are about many things. Budgets are about ledgers. As 
the government and specifically the Minister of Finance 
approached the budget essentially two ledgers were imposed on 
him, on the government and indeed on Parliament.
<P>
	On the one side of the ledger was a population of Canadians 
who were looking to the government and to Parliament to try to 
control spending and to try to bring the deficit and the debt into 
line. On the other side of the ledger were those who expressed 
themselves through the recent election campaign and essentially 
demanded some economic renewal, some economic hope, a 
strategy and a plan to put Canadians back to work.
<P>
	Those in essence were the two ledgers with which the 
Minister of Finance and Parliament has had to come to grips in 
the budget. I would suggest we will have to come to grips with 
the two ledgers for the duration of Parliament and this mandate. 
They are not two easy ledgers. Both are very real. Both are very 
worthy. At the same time both are priorities as articulated by 
average Canadians.
<P>
	We have talked about the budget cuts. We have talked about 
the $8 billion in cuts. We have talked about the base closings. 
There is a base right next door to my riding that was closed. 
Those decisions are not taken easily. Those jobs that have to be 
transferred from the bases to other sectors of our economy are 
not easy. In fact that was debated moments ago during the 
question and comment period. Yet I believe Canadians are 
understanding.
<P>
	Budgets have to go beyond ledgers. Budgets have to go 
beyond simple figures and numbers that obviously make up the 
bottom line. Budgets are also about a document that should 
provide and inspire a sense of hope and a sense among the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2145"> 2145 </A></B>
<P>
population that budget and fiscal commitments have been 
honoured and kept.
<P>
	I would like to spend the few minutes available to me talking 
about the ledger, about jobs and about keeping economic hope 
alive. Individuals in the House have suggested much more 
Draconian cuts to try to bring the deficit and the debt under 
control. They have a cost; they certainly do not come free of 
charge. In fact the ultimate aim of the budget was to try to 
balance the two ledgers.
<P>
	During the recent election campaign I heard that the ledger on 
the side of jobs and economic growth was not only important to 
the future aspirations of Canadians looking for work but as a 
long term answer to the other ledger, trying to come to grips with 
the debt and deficit. Particularly as a member coming from the 
region of metropolitan Toronto I am sensitive to the kind of 
commitment Canadians gave to the government which had the 
ability to convince them that it was in a position to offer 
economic hope.
<P>
	I come from a city that is not and should not be seen as the fat 
cat city of Confederation. Yes, there is the city on the shining 
hill. That is certainly a side of metropolitan Toronto and we are 
very proud of it. However there is another city in metropolitan 
Toronto. There is a chronic underbelly that speaks to a sense of 
despair over the last number of years. We have been through a 
very brutal economic recession that has also touched 
metropolitan Toronto.
<P>
	Sometimes we thought that Toronto would have been 
sheltered, given that Toronto and Ontario are seen as the 
economic engine in terms of the manufacturing heartland of the 
country. Sometimes we felt Toronto would be sheltered from the 
ravages of a national recession.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Obviously the reality is there for everyone to see. There are 
record line-ups at food banks and record welfare rolls. 
Canadians who for the first time in their lives found themselves 
on the unemployment line were embarrassed to come to see me 
during my Saturday constituency days. They were actually 
embarrassed to ask me how to fill out a claim for unemployment 
insurance or to ask me to help them find a job that would give 
them back dignity.
<P>
	I am familiar with that side of the ledger. In the last number of 
years metropolitan Toronto and other parts of Canada have not 
had an easy time of it. As a government we have lived and seen 
reality. We have campaigned largely on the question of how to 
put the economy back on track and to focus on job creation and 
economic growth. That bottom line dictated the outcome of the 
election campaign.
<P>
	There were many more issues than just that one, but the 
national overriding concern was who had the answer, who was 
able to capture the imagination and create economic growth and 
economic hope. I would submit the budget that was presented 
kept faith with that side of the ledger. It kept faith on what we 
talked about with respect to small businesses. The budget also 
kept faith on a  number of areas we have talked about in the 
throne speech and during the campaign.
<P>
	I remember when I was sitting on the other side of the House 
in the last Parliament. I moved, for instance, an opposition day 
motion respecting the credit crunch faced by small businesses 
because, like many members of Parliament in this House and in 
the last Parliament, we ran into countless numbers of small 
business and medium size business owners who simply could 
not get the time of day from lending institutions.
<P>
	Many individuals who had been good corporate citizens of 
lending institutions, who had good ideas and good projects, who 
had track records in their communities, who in the end wanted a 
lifeline not only to be able to expand their businesses and realize 
those ideas and dreams but to see their way through the 
economic drought, were simply turned down.
<P>
	I believe there needs to be a shift in the banking culture in the 
country. In the red book and in the campaign we talked about 
moving and encouraging our lending institutions to be better 
equipped and better structured to meet the realities of the small 
business sector.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance followed through on that in the 
budget by establishing a task force of small business leaders and 
with the leadership of lending institutions to come to grips with 
the credit crunch. I believe that crunch is a reality. We are not 
trying to suggest that the blame should be cast on the our lending 
institutions; far from it. However, they have a key role in the 
economic equation of our country. They have to go the extra 
mile to put on solid footing the network of one million small 
businesses.
<P>
	Why is it that banks, parliamentarians, economics professors 
and economists tell us freely that 80 per cent or 85 per cent of 
job growth and job creation comes from small and medium size 
firms? Why is it that 25 per cent of the overall business loan 
portfolios of our big five or big six banks, if we include the 
National Bank of Canada, are loans to small and medium size 
firms? This means that 75 per cent of business loans go to the 
large multinational corporations of the country. Why is that? 
Why is it so out of whack that 85 per cent of job growth comes 
from small businesses, yet only 25 per cent of business loans or 
thereabouts, according to the Canadian Banking Association, go 
to small business?
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I am not suggesting that we have to tell the banks who to 
support. I am not saying that the banks should not be beholden to 
their shareholders. I am not suggesting that the banks should not 
worry about their credit worthiness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2146"> 2146 </A></B>
<P>
	I am suggesting that if politicians and Parliament have to 
change the way they do business and if the world is changing 
at a rapid pace, just maybe the banks have to revisit how they 
do business.
<P>
	Sometimes it is easy to understand why a lending institution 
would rather make 10 loans of $10 million each rather than 200 
loans of $200,000 each. Obviously there is a greater investment 
of time and labour. Obviously the big corporations might have 
the business plans all fit and proper with professional 
accountants, as opposed to spending time with small and 
medium sized entrepreneurs. If job growth is to come from the 
small and medium sized sector there is an onus on the banking 
fraternity that gets its licence exclusively from Parliament, 
through an act of Parliament, to work with us and with the small 
and medium sized businesses in better partnership to try to 
resolve the credit gridlock.
<P>
	If we were to do so, we could imagine the one million plus 
small industries across the country and the kind of job creation 
that would accrue through that partnership. Therefore I am 
excited by a task force that tries to create that partnership. I am 
excited when the Imperial Bank of Commerce appoints a small 
and medium sized business ombudsman, a senior corporate 
vice-president to redress and look at the complaints with respect 
to lending applications of small and medium sized firms.
<P>
	Some may say it is a small step, but it is an important 
recognition on the road to trying to change the way the lending 
fraternity does business with small and medium sized firms. 
Therefore I believe the budget has kept faith with the small 
business sector. In addition to the other issues enunciated by the 
Minister of Finance including the premium rollback on UI, a net 
creator of some 40,000 jobs with the millions of dollars that will 
be saved through that program initiative, the budget keeps faith 
with the infrastructure program. Some will say it is not a good 
program. Some will say it is a wasted program that talks about 
tinkering with construction.
<P>
	During the election campaign the former Prime Minister 
almost ridiculed the kinds of benefits that would accrue in 
construction, trades and home industries across the country, as if 
construction workers, trades people and the infrastructure of our 
cities and towns were not important enough.
<P>
	We should talk with the mayors of the municipalities. Many 
individuals in the House were municipal politicians. I started 
there. I only served two years, but I speak from experience about 
the numbers of projects that would otherwise dwindle on the 
shelves, that would never see the light of day because there was 
no partnership with senior levels of government. For instance, I 
served on the city of North York council. Given that it only gets 
dollars from the local property tax base, it was not in a position 
to fund many of those projects; it was not in a position to fund 
100 cents on the dollar.
<P>
	Now we have a partnership, one program. We are not saying 
that is the nirvana of the economic miracle. We are saying it is 
one program. Nonetheless it now offers the city of North York, 
as it does cities across the country, the opportunity to fund some 
of those projects and kick in 33 cents on the dollar. Yet, as we 
contemplate that, it would be doing two things. First, it would be 
upgrading their facilities, their infrastructure as a city or as a 
town. Upgrading our facilities is paramount to trying to upgrade 
our competitiveness. That is a variable in the competitive 
equation, whether members like it or not.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Second, it would create and stimulate jobs in a key economic 
sector of our country. I was in Windsor last week and, 
automotively speaking, people in Windsor were very happy that 
the big three would be moving positively and aggressively in the 
coming months and years. The prognosis is very healthy for a 
kind of recovery in the automotive industry. That is a key 
economic indicator.
<P>
	So is construction in the trades and in the home industry. 
Certainly in my home town of metropolitan Toronto where that 
part of the economic pie has been dead as a door nail for far too 
long they see this as an economic hope or a partnership that 
stretches out an olive branch.
<P>
	When we look at the creation of 50,000 to 60,000 direct jobs 
across the country, we are putting people back to work. We are 
stimulating the local economy because there are spinoffs and 
indirect jobs that flow from those direct job impacts.
<P>
	We are upgrading our cities and towns, our communities, our 
neighbourhoods. Which country can afford not to upgrade its 
cities and municipalities? We do it as a family, we do it in our 
homes, and as each of us does it our neighbourhoods go up.
<P>
	Look at the city of Montreal. I believe that Montreal, with all 
due respect, is a classic example of how the lack of upgrading of 
its infrastructure has reduced the ability of Montreal to be able 
to compete aggressively. In a city like Montreal, which I visit 
from time to time because my wife's family is from there, you 
can see over a number of years that the inability or the avoidance 
of keeping those infrastructures upgraded has had an impact in 
the overall economic life of that urban centre.
<P>
	Third, this budget has kept its faith with training. We also 
know that we have to do a better job about how we go about 
training and educating our workforce. We often have pointed out 
by constituents and colleagues alike some of the European 
models. Germany is often put on the table very quickly. We are 
told that we need to do a better job of equipping individuals, our 
youngsters as well as those who are displaced from one 
economic sector and have to face a future of shifting their 
education or their training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2147"> 2147 </A></B>
<P>
	Our budget has committed itself over the next couple of years 
to investing almost a billion dollars in the area of training. It 
creates youth internship and apprenticeship programs in 
partnership with the private sector, not at the exclusion of some 
big government program, but together with the private 
industries of this country. Only in that partnership will those 
training programs be the success that we all hope they will be.
<P>
	It keeps its commitment to trying to equip our country and our 
peoples with the right tools. That too is upgrading our national 
infrastructure. As we give our Canadian people the skills and the 
equipment needed, we are also upgrading the skills and the 
talents of our country.
<P>
	It also keeps its faith with the youngsters through its youth 
corps. Again one program, but we heard countless times over the 
course of the campaign and certainly after it about the 
consternation that parents have about the future for their 
children. Here is one project, just one, and we are not suggesting 
that it is the cure-all, that once it is up and running will take 
approximately 15,000 young Canadians per year and have them 
do a job in a community outside their own so that they get to see 
what this country is all about. It will also give them that first all 
important experience so that they can hopefully get on the march 
toward establishing themselves in their careers.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	You mentioned, Mr. Speaker, that my time has just about run 
out. I suppose I should have timed my remarks because I had 
wanted to say a few other things in terms of the innovation, the 
new economy and the job and entrepreneurial skills that 
immigrants, for whom I have the honour of being the minister, 
bring to this country.
<P>
	I look forward to concluding my remarks at another time and 
answering any questions if there are any.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister said a number of things in reference to the budget 
which I would like to address. I know that you are going to limit 
my time in making those remarks so I will limit myself to two 
points.
<P>
	The first point is the deficit. The minister mentioned that 
cutting the deficit would impose costs on the population of 
Canada. Unquestionably that is true. He also implied that more 
severe cuts than the present government has made would really 
impose undue hardships.
<P>
	Has the minister considered the other cost, the cost of not 
having taken sufficient measures to cut the deficit? This 
government has admitted that over the next three years $100 
billion will be added to our deficit. Even at a nominal rate of 
interest of 8 per cent that means that the interest on that 
additional money will be $8 billion. There is no question that 
has to come from the taxpayers of Canada. I suspect that it will 
entail extra taxes.
<P>
	The minister also mentioned small business and the 
reluctance of banking institutions to loan them money so they 
can improve their business. I agree with that, but we too did a 
survey of small business during the election campaign and prior 
to it. What they kept telling us was that the best thing that 
government could do for small business was to reduce taxes and 
reduce the bureaucracy: ``Get out of my pockets and get off my 
back''. They said that if the government does that they can make 
a prosperous business work. It will get the economy going, 
people will have more money, they will spend it more and our 
businesses will flourish.
<P>
	Has the minister considered the effects that this minimal 
intrusion into the deficit is going to have downstream because 
we will now be $600 billion in debt? We are going to have to 
borrow that money because even then, if we achieve the 3 per 
cent of the GDP which the government aspires to, we are still 
going to be borrowing $25 billion in that final year.
<P>
	Has the minister considered whether this is really the best way 
to go?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his two 
questions on the aspect that small business requests less 
government and less taxes.
<P>
	I think those were the very words the Minister of Finance 
spoke about when he announced his budget in reference to small 
businesses. The payroll deduction, the question of trying to have 
less red tape and less bureaucracy for small businesses and a 
consistency in trying to allow them to grow with some kind of 
predictability are the very elements that underline the elements 
in the budget with respect to small business.
<P>
	I believe we are both on the same wave length in terms of the 
budget as it treats small businesses.
<P>
	With respect to the deficit and the debt, obviously he and I are 
agreeing to disagree. His party certainly came at the national 
campaign and since then with the feeling that we should have 
moved further. There have been a number of commentators in 
the country who have suggested that we cut too much and others 
who have said that we have done too little. Perhaps once one gets 
commentaries on both sides there is an indication that one has 
probably done the right thing at the right time.
<P>
	We come to this Parliament with our first budget after nine 
years of a Tory administration that made it its focal point to be a 
government that was going to reduce debt and deficit. We 
certainly know something untoward and something very 
different about that. We believe that the commitments we made 
in our red book with respect to the 3 per cent that the member 
alluded to is the correct approach.
<P>
	This budget starts us down that road. We believe that allowing 
the economy to grow, providing some job creation and some 
confidence in the marketplace is certainly an impact that should 
not be underestimated in order for us to address the other ledger. 
It is also a question about balance. I think the budget that my  
colleague, the Minister of Finance, presented spoke to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2148"> 2148 </A></B>
<P>
balance between the two ledger sheets that are both, not one but 
both, on the mind of Canadians. Both are priorities.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I think we can only do justice to both if we try to balance both 
a responsible reduction in our costs of government and doing 
government which we did and at the same time try to ensure that 
the economy will certainly produce as Canadians would want it 
to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to try once again-I have tried this several times-to 
go through this funding for the infrastructure program.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is supposed to spend $6 billion, $2 
billion from municipal sources, $2 billion provincial and $2 
billion federal. At the end of the day through this exercise we 
have spent $6 billion.
<P>
	The minister has indicated that the municipalities were in 
favour of this. Having talked to a mayor of a municipality his 
feeling was that ``my public works program is going to continue 
as it always did''. The difference here is that the residential 
taxpayer will only see one-third of the usual cost because the 
provincial and the federal governments are going to share.
<P>
	No wonder the municipal politicians are in favour of it. We 
are going to carry a fair bit of burden at the federal and 
provincial levels. Nevertheless it is the same taxpayer who pays 
regardless of which level provides the funding.
<P>
	My question I suppose is going to be obvious. What can the 
minister tell us that we have at the end of two years other than 
spending $6 billion and employing 60,000 people, I believe the 
number of their book was, over two years? What is left after the 
two years besides $6 billion in expenditures, some kind of 
capital structure and maybe a very few people employed to 
maintain the structure? What is left for employment, besides a 
very large bill to pay?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member points out one 
particular mayor in one particular municipality. He should know 
that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities was a big 
supporter and initiator of this program. In fact some of them 
have suggested that we should have gone even further.
<P>
	I do not hear too many municipalities disputing this program. 
We do not hear too many provincial governments disputing this 
program. I think the member puts a very negative spin on what 
can come out of an infrastructure program.
<P>
	Yes, there are jobs and that is important. I tried to allude to the 
fact that this is but one program. We are not suggesting that the 
economic recovery of Canada is simply and solely on the back of 
this infrastructure program. We are saying that it is a very 
important cog in the economic wheel.
<P>
	Second, it will upgrade our infrastructures. Whether the 
member likes it or not those infrastructures must be upgraded in 
order for our cities and towns to be competitive.
<P>
	Third, there are going to be infrastructures that are also going 
to attract further business and further investment. There are 
proposals being submitted to the city of Toronto that if in fact 
realized will attract additional tourism, additional dollars in the 
marketplace. It is not only a question of simply upgrading 
sidewalks or bridges. Those are also important. We are also 
trying to realize innovative and creative structures that are 
needed and are going unaddressed in terms of trying to capture a 
greater market share of that tourist dollar or of those convention 
goers or of trying to provide some additional lifeline into some 
of those municipalities.
<P>
	I do not think we should be inhibited by the lack of creativity 
that the member brings to the infrastructure program. It is an 
important sector of our economy. I think if we get that sector 
going, together with the automotive sector and the other sectors 
of our economy in terms of the home building and the programs 
that we have in terms of home ownership, the cumulative effect 
and the cumulative impact of those different programs kicking 
in will make our economy more vibrant and psychologically lift 
the spirits of Canadians. Quite frankly we have been living 
through an economic depression and a psychological 
depression.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I think if people get the confidence that things are moving, the 
confidence factor in an economic equation is absolutely vital for 
that equation to be alive and well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, before the 
House recessed almost two weeks ago my colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan spoke about the Official Languages Act 
and reasons for cutting costs of implementing its policy.
<P>
	I will be speaking on how the Official Languages Act ought to 
be changed so that it is fair and just for all Canadians.
<P>
	The year 1994 is the 25th anniversary of the Official 
Languages Act. This law, enacted by the Trudeau government in 
1969 and later revised by the Mulroney administration in 1988, 
was intended to bring unity to the country, to end the unjust 
treatment of French speaking Canadians and to help defuse 
Quebec separatism.
<P>
	We learn from authors as respectable as Quebec's 
distinguished Christian Dufour that: ``Some forget that it was 
not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2149"> 2149 </A></B>
<P>
bilingualism that made this country, that it cannot ensure its 
survival and that it could even lead to its destruction''.
<P>
	Those of us who have lived and worked most of our lives far 
away from the centre of power in Ottawa may have agreed with 
the original intention of official bilingualism. It was described 
eloquently in the 1968 throne speech of the first Trudeau 
government as exemplifying the essential connection between 
justice and national unity.
<P>
	We also wonder whether the Official Languages Act has 
actually brought justice to the area of official languages. If the 
law is as badly flawed as we believe it to be, and therefore 
unjust, where does that leave Canada's unity?
<P>
	It is my contention that language policy cannot and will not 
achieve the justice and fairness that is its stated goal until it is 
fundamentally rewritten.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of colleagues to just one 
aspect of official bilingualism in order to show how badly 
flawed the present policy is and also to show how a careful and 
thoughtful revision of the policy could do much to reunite the 
country by removing an institutional irritant which sets 
anglophones against francophones and provincial majorities 
against their minority populations.
<P>
	As it is presently written, the Official Languages Act requires 
the federal government to provide services in English in those 
parts of Quebec and in French in those parts of the other nine 
provinces wherever there is sufficient demand.
<P>
	However, the act fails to define the concept of sufficient 
demand. Instead of providing a clear and easily understood 
definition, the act states that sufficient demand will mean 
whatever the federal cabinet decides it ought to mean.
<P>
	The law recommends that the size of official language 
minorities be taken into account but so may, and this is from 
section 32 of the act, any other factors which the governor in 
council considers appropriate.
<P>
	What this provision of the law means is that when the Official 
Languages Act was passed this House never debated-it never 
had the chance-the level or the extent of minority language 
service that seemed most appropriate. The provision of minority 
language services is the most politically sensitive aspect of the 
act and yet it was determined in virtual secrecy by order in 
council.
<P>
	When highly contentious issues are developed in secret rather 
than in open debate in the people's house, the House of 
Commons, the resulting information vacuum opens the way to 
rumour and innuendo. Conspiracy theories come to be taken 
seriously.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	This in turn has the potential to breed suspicion, resentment, 
prejudice and ultimately hatred along linguistic lines. For this 
reason, section 32 of the Official Languages Act needs to be 
rewritten to remove the arbitrary authority of the governor in 
council.
<P>
	In its place there should be a clear, easily understood 
definition of the criteria that would cause a region of the country 
to be declared a bilingual district. This definition could be 
debated openly so that the resulting formula would be a just and 
moderate compromise between the rightful aspirations of 
Canada's linguistic minorities and the rightful concerns of our 
majority populations.
<P>
	What I am proposing is hardly a new idea. It was first 
recommended nearly 30 years ago by the Royal Commission on 
Bilingualism and Biculturalism. Before this the concept of 
openly defined bilingual districts, also known as territorial 
bilingualism, had existed in the laws of Finland for several 
decades.
<P>
	In that country, the system has produced a sense of national 
unity between the Finnish speaking majority and the Swedish 
speaking minority that is enviable by Canadian standards.
<P>
	Obviously it is not possible at this time to state categorically 
what definition my hon. colleagues might give to sufficient 
demand if they had the chance to review the concept in open 
debate.
<P>
	However, I do feel confident that they would not choose to 
make it as loose as the definition that the federal cabinet chose 
to impose by order in council on January 1, 1992. This definition 
is so lopsided that it mandates services in English in Barkmere, 
Quebec, which has an anglophone population of 20, and in 
French on Baffin Island where 10 government departments and 
agencies, including the RCMP, the CBC and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, must provide bilingual services for the 
benefit of 220 francophones.
<P>
	My guess is that my colleagues would stop the charade in 
which Toronto was designated bilingual for the purposes of 
federal services despite the fact that French is only the 11th most 
widely spoken language after such languages as Chinese, Italian 
and Spanish.
<P>
	Nor do I think they would continue to let English services be 
imposed in east Montreal where they are an affront to the 
homogeneous francophone population that nonetheless feels 
that its linguistic heritage is gravely in peril.
<P>
	I believe that my colleagues would adopt a definition of 
sufficient demand very similar to the one advocated by the 
Canadian Federation of Municipalities which maintains that 
services should be offered in an individual town, city or rural 
district only when the linguistic minority meets two statistical 
measures.
<P>
	The minority must be above a certain percentage of the local 
population and it must also be above a certain total number. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2150"> 2150 </A></B>
<P>
federation uses 5,000 as the minimum and absolute number and 
10 per cent as the lowest acceptable percentage.
<P>
	With these two criteria set, sufficient demand would include 
the vast majority of French speakers living outside Quebec and 
most English speakers inside Quebec but it would not be nearly 
as much of an intrusion as the present secretive definition.
<P>
	In short, both minority rights and majority rights would be 
acknowledged. Canadians would be one step closer to true 
linguistic justice and, by extension, one step closer to a genuine, 
lasting national unity.
<P>
	In closing, I draw the attention of my colleagues to another 
important anniversary. The year 1994 is not only the 25th 
anniversary of the Official Languages Act, it is also the 50th 
anniversary of D-Day. Half a century has passed since our 
fathers shed their blood on the sands of Normandy so that we 
could live in a country characterized by free and open 
government.
<P>
	Let us take this opportunity to honour their memory by 
amending the act to remove its secretive, arbitrary aspects. Then 
perhaps we may consider ourselves worthy of the legacy of 
freedom that they bequeathed to us.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me tell 
the House what official bilingualism has done for Canadians. I 
am unilingual and my options were not great. The opportunities 
were not great.
<P>
	My children are bilingual. Language is more than just a means 
of communication, it is another way of thinking. I would like to 
remind the hon. member that bilingualism is not the cause of 
polarization and division in this country today. It is ignorance 
and intolerance, not the 200 and some odd members mentioned 
who are being provided with bilingual services. That is not what 
is causing the divisions in our country today. It is intolerance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am unilingual 
like my hon. colleague. My children as well took French in 
public school. Certainly the more languages one can speak the 
more rounded an individual one is. At the same time, when 
official bilingualism was instituted in this country we did not 
have two full blown separatist movements in this country. We 
had them after official bilingualism was instituted.
<P>
	I believe that the Official Languages Act has gone a long way 
to bring this country to the state it is in. All we have to do is look 
across the way to see our 54 hon. members from Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
English-speaking colleague from Ontario for her comments. 
But first, I would like to make a correction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the Official Languages Act the wording is not ``where 
sufficient demand''. The wording is ``where numbers warrant''.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to my colleague that a few years 
ago I was in Calgary and I was invited to be part of a festivity 
commemorating St. Jean Baptiste. That francophone 
community in Calgary, the home province of the member for 
Yellowhead, was so vibrant with life, happy to be together, 
happy to have cousins from elsewhere in Canada at its festivity. 
It was happy also to invite other Albertans to its festivity to be 
part of the culture.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In French, we say ``<I>enlever les oeillères</I>'' to take off one's 
blinkers or ``<I>regarder plus loin que le nez</I>'', not to see the end of 
one's nose. When the hon. member says the Official Languages 
Act was never debated in this House, he should go back and 
reread the newspapers. Besides, when the Constitution was 
patriated in 1982, a nation-wide debate went on for months, not 
only in this House, but all over the country. Canadians from 
coast to coast reaffirmed their commitment to bilingualism.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	I would also tell the hon. member that my father-in-law, Mr. 
Maltais, a French-speaking New Brunswicker, was in Holland 
on D-Day. He was a proud participant in a war which brought 
democracy and tolerance to Canada, the Commonwealth and 
Europe.
<P>
	If the hon. member in unhappy about the kind of Official 
Opposition we have got, I can tell him that I do not like the 
philosophy of his party either.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
hon. member's emotions and comments. I can also appreciate 
that our philosophies do not agree.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about blinkers and not seeing to the 
end of our noses. I would point out that Alberta did not 
implement bills 101 or 178, if the hon. member wants to talk 
about blinkers and not seeing beyond our noses.
<P>
	I would suggest that the Saint-Jean Baptiste days she enjoyed 
in Calgary would have transpired even if we had not had official 
bilingualism. Those festivities were there before there was 
official bilingualism in this country and I would suggest that 
even if we rewrite the laws of the Official Languages Act they 
will be celebrated for many years thereafter as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to add my voice to those of my colleagues who lament the 
government's budget of February 22. This budget is not a 
disappointment as some members have suggested. It is a 
disaster.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2151"> 2151 </A></B>
<P>
	The government says it wants to create jobs, yet this budget 
is disastrous for job creation. The reason for this is the heavy 
burden of taxation everyone in Canada faces now and in the 
future as a direct result of the failure to curb government 
overspending.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that taxes are job 
killers for its 170,000 members. For every dollar the 
government taxes away, it is another dollar lost which could 
have gone toward job creation. Furthermore, the budget is 
disastrous for export trade because it stunts our ability to take 
full advantage of a golden opportunity.
<P>
	We have just signed two very important trade agreements, 
NAFTA and GATT, that lower tariffs for our products around the 
world. I heartily commend this government for its role in those 
agreements.
<P>
	Our Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
has been doing an excellent job in developing markets abroad. 
Canada has gained a good reputation as a leader in helping the 
GATT to be established after the second world war and now the 
new world trade organization.
<P>
	However our efforts are futile if we cannot give our industries 
a fair chance to compete. Our companies, small, medium and 
large, which have to break into and develop these foreign 
markets cannot do so effectively. They are hampered by 
disappointing results at home. They are hampered because our 
government will not act responsibly in fiscal management. They 
cannot sell strongly into their domestic market because their 
consumers are overtaxed and the cost of doing business is so 
high. That leaves them with limited resources to operate 
aggressively abroad.
<P>
	At the moment our major trading partner, the United States, to 
whom 80 per cent of our exports go, is experiencing incredible 
growth. Our economy is also starting to pick up, led by 
promising increases in our exports.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	If only this budget could have given a strong signal that we 
were getting our fiscal house in order the response from our 
business sector would have been incredible. The incentives 
would have been there to invest and take risks. The incentives 
would have been there to expand and hire new employees 
because the promise of tax relief would have been just around 
the corner.
<P>
	By failing to deal with the deficit we are missing a golden 
opportunity to move further and forcefully into export markets. 
Canada is a trading nation. We simply do not have the 
population to warrant economies of scale that many businesses 
need. Our ability to be competitive internationally is crucial to 
our ability to grow and create jobs.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is presently doing a 
massive poll of 2,000 corporate members and 1,000 
entrepreneurs. The purpose of this poll is to identify obstacles to 
job creation. Business people have been asked to list the five 
things that would improve their ability to create jobs. Guess 
what heads the list of responses: getting the federal debt and 
deficit problem under control.
<P>
	The reason for this is that deficits and debt have caused the 
government to overtax our citizens. In fact personal income 
taxes have more than doubled in the last 10 years. Excise and 
sales taxes have gone up by almost 75 per cent. That means 
consumers have less disposable income. It also means Canadian 
companies face a smaller demand at home.
<P>
	It was reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this morning that 
Canadian individuals and corporations are the most heavily 
taxed in the industrial world, with the exception of France. This 
statement comes from our own Deputy Minister of Finance.
<P>
	What is more, the $500 billion debt and the burden of 
refinancing approximately half of that every year crowds out 
other borrowers. When the federal government borrows huge 
sums of money it competes with private industry for the 
available capital. That reduces the amount of money available to 
finance private business expansion. It also drives real interest 
rates far higher than they should be.
<P>
	Seventy per cent of the businesses reporting to the Chamber 
of Commerce survey are saying that the cost of business in 
Canada right now is much higher than in other countries. That is 
alarming. What is worse is that preliminary findings show that 
22 per cent of the respondents intend to relocate all or part of 
their businesses outside of Canada because of high taxation and 
the cost of government regulations.
<P>
	When taxes are too high businesses simply cannot survive and 
be competitive outside Canada. Many are forced to pass these 
taxes on through higher prices. If that means they cannot sell 
their products abroad they might as well move to where the cost 
of doing business is less.
<P>
	This budget should have started the process of lowering 
government spending. That did not happen. Instead government 
spending increased. The promise that next year it will happen or 
maybe the year after it will really happen is not good enough.
<P>
	There are lots of areas where cuts should have been made. 
Obviously social programs which consume a major share of the 
federal budget should be targeted to those who need it the most.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party and others in the Reform Party 
have spoken of this already. This budget should have shown 
Canadians that government was really serious about job 
creation. We all know, or at least we should know, the private 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2152"> 2152 </A></B>
<P>
sector, particularly small and medium sized businesses, creates 
jobs, not government.
<P>
	This budget should have shown Canadians and the 
international community that the government is serious about 
tackling its huge deficit. If the government cannot bring its 
spending into line with revenues, how on earth are we ever going 
to handle the growing debt? In fact the international community 
is now responding to its concern about our failure to control 
government spending and overspending.
<P>
	Canadian interest rates are rising. A good part of the reason 
for this rise in rates is the lack of confidence internationally in 
our ability to finance our debt. Higher interest rates mean it will 
cost more to refinance the federal debt and this will only 
compound our problem.
<P>
	The way to job creation is to stop overtaxation. Let us not 
make our Canadian businesses have to compete with one hand 
tied behind their backs. The way to tax relief is to stop 
government overspending, not next year or the year after, but 
now.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pride and deep humility that I rise today to speak in this House of 
Commons as the Liberal member for Fundy-Royal. It is with 
pride because the Minister of Finance has continued the Prime 
Minister's commitment to all Canadians. That is the 
commitment in this budget which offers a balanced plan for 
governing our country. It is a plan about economic renewal, 
deficit reduction and necessary reforms to social programs.
<P>
	This budget invests in the skills of Canadians and supports the 
small and medium sized business sector which has been and will 
continue to be the number one job creator in Canada.
<P>
	This budget and this government are being watched by the 
people of New Brunswick particularly the people of 
Fundy-Royal. That is because for the first time in the history of 
the riding of Fundy-Royal they have chosen a Liberal to 
represent them. It is an honour to represent the people of 
Fundy-Royal.
<P>
	I am delighted today to tell the Minister of Finance that the 
people of my riding like this budget. I join them in offering the 
minister congratulations and support from one of the most 
diverse ridings in Atlantic Canada. More than half of the 
population of this bedroom community works in one of the three 
major cities of Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton.
<P>
	This riding includes the oldest industries on our continent like 
coal mining in Grand Lake and farming in King's and Queen's 
counties. There are the newer industries of potash and food 
processing and traditional industries of fishing, lumbering and 
wood lot management. Then of course there is our tourism 
industry. We have the powerful Bay of Fundy and Fundy 
National Park with some of the most beautiful scenery in New 
Brunswick, Canada's picture province.
<P>
	The people of Fundy-Royal are a people of faith, faith in 
God, faith in themselves, faith in each other and faith in Canada. 
I am proud of the people of my riding. They offer a fine example 
to the rest of Canada. I am committed to them and committed to 
political leadership that protects family values, family farms, 
and family business.
<P>
	Small business people and self-employed New Brunswickers 
are the lifeblood of our economy in Fundy-Royal. This budget 
offers a realistic plan for them.
<P>
	It is unlike any other budget in Canadian history because it is a 
people budget. It is the result of an unprecedented consultation 
with the people of Canada from coast to coast to coast. This 
budget reflects the concerns of people. It addresses deficit 
reduction today and sets us on a clear path of further deficit 
reduction in the future.
<P>
	This budget saves $300 million in unemployment insurance 
premiums. That $300 million can be reinvested by small 
businesses to create new jobs. This budget revives the 
residential rehabilitation assistance program for home 
renovations and boosts the construction industry. This budget 
makes the temporary home buyers plan permanent. This budget 
will improve access to capital for small business. This budget 
will establish Canadian business service centres in every 
province to provide one-stop shopping for government services.
<P>
	With this budget we begin a process that will replace the 
unpopular GST. Nothing will please the people of my riding 
more than the demise of the GST. Nothing has hurt them more.
<P>
	Governments cannot solve all our problems. But this 
government knows that governments must lead and must lead by 
example. The people of Fundy-Royal like all Canadians are 
tired of governments saying one thing but doing another.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	In my travels throughout Fundy-Royal I have found there 
are two key areas of concern, lack of jobs and the government 
debt. Most people agree that these problems are related. With 
approximately 37 cents of every federal tax dollar going to serve 
the debt, our government resources for investing in education, 
infrastructure and social programs are very limited.
<P>
	While it is easy to recognize that excessive debt and deficits 
impact negatively on our country, what is not well understood is 
that about one-third of the federal debt is owed outside of 
Canada. In simple terms that means we are paying millions of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2153"> 2153 </A></B>
<P>
dollars per year in interest to non-Canadians. This means we are 
losing Canadian taxes and losing control of our own destiny.
<P>
	It is time to do something about this problem. I believe it is 
time for Canada Savings Bonds to be replaced with Canada 
deficit bonds. The revenues raised by the sale of such bonds 
could be applied directly to the foreign debt with a plan of 
repatriating the debt from the current level of 33 per cent to a 
level of about 20 per cent over a five year period.
<P>
	Significant benefits would flow from such a proposal. 
Canadians would own more of our debt and interest payments 
would be made to Canadians instead of to the Japanese or the 
Germans.
<P>
	I strongly agree with the Minister of Finance's plan to cut $3 
billion in government operations over the next three years. 
However, I believe that we must cut further and deeper. I believe 
we can achieve this by passing legislation in this House that 
would mandate expenditure reductions in government 
departments by 5 per cent per year to a maximum of 20 per cent.
<P>
	Perhaps the last five years of the Auditor General's report 
would provide a good beginning to identify sectors in need of 
immediate attention.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about free trade in Canada. 
Since the federal election Canada has joined in forming the 
world's largest trading bloc, yet we still do not enjoy free trade 
within our own borders. Interprovincial trade barriers must be 
removed. While I am encouraged by the progress we have made 
on this issue, we still need to do some significant work.
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians have grown accustomed to the boom and 
bust cycle that often grips our world and more often chokes our 
region. When the world sneezes we in Atlantic Canada get 
pneumonia. We in Atlantic Canada are prepared to shoulder our 
share of the burden when it comes to leading the Canadian 
economy into the new world economy. We know the importance 
of information management, of vigorous national science 
education programs and the development of energy 
conservation technology.
<P>
	We will shoulder our burden but we also want our share of this 
Canadian dream.
<P>
	As we rationalize government expenditures and services in 
our province I believe we must have a commitment for a strong 
port in Saint John. These past two years have shown that even 
with icebreaking in the St. Lawrence, Mother Nature proved too 
much for that river and Saint John filled an important national 
transportation role.
<P>
	We also must have first-class trans-Canadian highways in 
New Brunswick from St. Stephen through Saint John, Sussex 
and to Moncton. These days in Canada we hear a great deal about 
the information highway. In southern New Brunswick we want 
to hear more about an economic highway, an economic highway 
that links communities together and enables them to prosper.
<P>
	I will commit all of my effort and energy to make sure that 
southern New Brunswick, the engine of economic growth in 
New Brunswick, gets its fair share from this government, a fair 
share for ports and a fair share for highways.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I have a great deal of faith in our transport minister to be a 
strong advocate for these interests. This budget is only the first 
of many steps Canadians must take together, arm in arm on the 
road to a future that delivers dependable economic growth and 
better and more secure employment.
<P>
	I believe Canadians can fashion such a future but it will 
require hard work. It will require a resurgence of the Canadian 
tradition of looking out for our neighbour and working for those 
who cannot work or who cannot find work.
<P>
	Fundy-Royal as one of the oldest settled communities in 
North America has fostered those traditions for centuries. I 
know the people of my riding value the realistic approach of the 
finance minister and the courage and the decisiveness the Prime 
Minister has shown since the election, a leadership that is 
decent, fair and responsive.
<P>
	In closing, I offer a humble thank you to the voters of 
Fundy-Royal who placed their confidence in me and gave the 
Liberal Party their trust for the first time in Canadian history. I 
promise these people I will continue to work hard, to listen well 
and to act decisively on their behalf.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
my neighbour. One of the things that makes his riding so great is 
that it happens to be next to mine. It is a pleasure to hear him 
extol the virtues of southern New Brunswick and the 
contribution that is made by that part of our country to Canada.
<P>
	In listening to what the member for Fundy-Royal had to say 
about how good this budget is, and we on this side recognize the 
benefits of a balanced approach to getting the economy working, 
I am sure that because of the shortness of time he wanted to take 
some time to talk about the tremendous infrastructure program 
and the importance that it is going to have to all of the 
municipalities in his riding.
<P>
	They offer the opportunity for smaller communities to be able 
to do that minor work but for important work like the sewer 
programs, water programs, recycling programs and those types 
of things and I am sure that had he had more time he would want 
to talk about that.
<P>
	I want to give him an opportunity to extol the virtues of both 
the benefits of putting Canadians back to work that the 
infrastructure program offers and also the benefits to the many 
smaller communities in his riding that will be able to have the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2154"> 2154 </A></B>
<P>
types of programs that are  essential to small communities for 
their economic development and growth.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the member whether he is supportive of the 
position that this government has taken with respect to the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, the infrastructure program has been 
very positively received.
<P>
	In fact in Fundy-Royal there are 32 municipalities and as 
one can imagine the difficulty is to balance those various 
municipalities and their interests in receiving this important 
program. Most of the municipalities expressed their interest in 
this program through the Canadian Federation of 
Municipalities.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Moncton knows, the members of the 
Canadian Federation of Municipalities had an opportunity to 
express to the then opposition their interest in this program. The 
Liberal Party listened to that and adopted it. I can tell the hon. 
member that it is very positive. If anything I will be one of those 
people who will be back here next year hoping that the program 
is continued.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
became excited a few moments ago when the hon. member was 
mentioning his appreciation that about a third of our national 
debt is offshore. Therefore it entails a whole bunch of interest 
dollars leaving Canada and being unusable for our economy. I 
got really excited when he said the elimination of provincial 
trade barriers would be a tremendous bonus and benefit to 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I was about to offer him a membership in the Reform Party 
until he responded to his colleague who said: ``How about this 
infrastructure program''? He endorsed the infrastructure 
program. Here we are with $6 billion of borrowed money that 
may create 60,000 jobs that will be gone after the end of two 
years. Now what do we do? We just pay the interest on the 
money we borrowed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> For years and years and years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member will let us all 
know whether any of the municipalities in his riding take 
advantage of this important infrastructure program.
<P>
	It will be interesting to see how many communities in the 
member's riding benefit from it and it will be more interesting, 
of course, to see how the member's party responds to some of 
the other important initiatives in this budget.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member that I am pleased to hear he is 
interested in at least some of the things I had to say. I look 
forward to working with him on those things we agree on.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Fraser Valley West, 
briefly please. Again I would ask members to say ``the member'' 
not ``you'', especially with the Speaker standing nearby.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
come back on that comment as to how many municipalities and 
ridings will get involved with the infrastructure program. Why 
would they not want to because one third of the cost only is 
going to be attributed to residential taxation. They are going to 
pass the other part off on federal and provincial taxes.
<P>
	I must remind the hon. member that there is only one taxpayer 
paying three portions at three levels of taxes.
<P>
	My question is what is left after the two years of the 
infrastructure program after $6 billion has been paid out? What 
is left for the Canadian taxpayer other than some form of capital 
structure?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member what is left. We 
will have billions and billions of dollars worth of necessary 
sewers, safe water systems, bridges, roadworks and other 
community projects throughout this country that but for this 
program these projects would not be there. It will be interesting 
to see whether in the hon. member's riding there will be projects 
taken up by that one taxpayer and whether the program is being 
positively received in your riding, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You tell them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to give the 
members two specific examples of how municipalities are in 
fact handling the infrastructure program. When I was in one 
community in my riding not so long ago, I was told: ``Well, we 
are going to look after our sewers on the main street''. The 
councillor admitted to me that this work would be done next 
year but they were pushing it ahead one year because the 
infrastructure program was there.
<P>
	A second community in my riding, and these are communities 
that have no reason to tell me other than the truth, said they were 
going to modify their beautiful ice arena equipment so that it 
would be upgraded, work they would do simply two years down 
the road.
<P>
	My comment is that I do not believe that many of the things 
that are being done with the infrastructure program should be 
done with borrowed money. I would be more than willing to 
have the member's comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, my comment is simply the fact that 
both of the municipalities have indicated that they are advancing 
work ahead of schedule is precisely what the program is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2155"> 2155 </A></B>
<P>
supposed to do. It is not a single program. One cannot look at 
this infrastructure program as a  single initiative. It is part of a 
broad initiative that this government is moving forward with.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	You have just given us, Mr. Speaker, the evidence that we 
need, the fact that both of the communities that you have 
mentioned, but for being involved with our program, would not 
go with the program for some other time in the future. That tells 
me that jobs are being created now rather than being created at 
some other time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems that another member of the 
Liberal Party wants the floor, the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth, as well as two other members. Is there 
unanimous consent to give them ten minutes each, for a total of 
30 minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
fundamental change is sweeping this country and this 
government's budget reflects it. It is a change that more than any 
other will determine a united Canada's prosperity for the next 
century.
<P>
	Others have spoken in this debate on the budget's fiscal 
provisions, the changes in unemployment insurance, cutbacks in 
defence spending, new rules for capital gains exemptions, and 
so on. I propose to draw attention to two other areas which I 
believe when linked are to me more significant than all the 
others combined.
<P>
	I look to new incentives for small businesses on the one hand 
and reallocation of spending on research and development on 
the other. Put these two concepts together and I believe we see a 
fundamental truth about today's economic reality and a glimpse 
of the economic opportunities of tomorrow.
<P>
	On the historical perspective, for the better part of this 
century Canadian industrial production has been dominated by 
major foreign owned companies, principally those based in the 
United States and Britain. Research and development, industrial 
scientific research, if you will, was concentrated in the parent 
companies rather than in their Canadian subsidiaries. The 
ability to do quality industrial scientific research is a national 
asset which is not willingly shared by the United States, Britain, 
Japan, Germany, France or any other major economic power. 
That is a fact of international life.
<P>
	Canada's answer to the problem in 1916 was to set up 
government funded laboratories grouped together as the 
National Research Council. I wish hon. members would take 
time some day to visit the old NRC building at 100 Sussex 
Drive, built during the depression in the 1930s. Not only is it one 
of the most interesting architecturally of the buildings in Ottawa 
but it also speaks through its bricks and mortars, through its 
terrazzo floors, its tiny laboratory rooms, of that moment in 
history when Canada finally invested in the brains of Canadians, 
in our  ideas. It is a place that evokes the era of Banting, 
Rutherford, Best and the Canadian pioneers of this nuclear age.
<P>
	The Canadian version of the National Research Council was 
an experiment that had no parallel in Britain and the United 
States, but it began poorly. Scientists are like artists. If funding 
is unconditional, they would rather work on pure research. They 
would rather explore ideas for the sake of them instead of what 
they might mean in terms of a country's technological progress. 
Most would prefer to be Einsteins, not Edisons.
<P>
	The research in the early days of the National Research 
Council merely wandered through the woods of scientific 
inquiry and rarely glimpsed the sun.
<P>
	The Second World War changed everything. In 1940 France 
collapsed. All Europe echoed to the measured tread of Hitler's 
armies. The United States was still neutral. The night sky over 
London flickered with the flashes of exploding bombs. Britain's 
only remaining ally of consequence was Canada. Now the 
National Research Council really came into its own, for Britain 
needed more than men and weapons, it needed science.
<P>
	In co-operation with Canadian universities, the National 
Research Council led an incredibly varied program in applied 
research: new explosives, radar, sonar, chemical weapons, high 
altitude research. No other country, I firmly believe, given its 
economic size and population, contributed as much brain power 
to the war as Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	I apologize for speaking so much of the past rather than of the 
present, but surely our actions and attitudes of today are 
governed principally by what we know and what we do not know 
of our own history.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Bloc for example embrace separatism 
because they perceive the historic threat only as it pertains to 
Quebec. Yet we all move forward, Canadians of all provinces, 
we all have been moving forward together. The fault is that none 
of us, Quebecers, Albertans, Nova Scotians, pay serious 
attention to our collective past, to our own accomplishments as 
Canadians.
<P>
	How many of the 295 MPs in this House know that Canada 
was the second country in the world to achieve nuclear power? 
The first nuclear reactor outside the United States to go critical 
was built just upstream from Ottawa at Chalk River. We were 
ahead of Britain, France and even the Soviet Union. That was in 
1945. We declared then that we would use nuclear energy only 
for peaceful purposes and we have kept faith with that promise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2156"> 2156 </A></B>
<P>
	The National Research Council was instrumental in the 
development of Canada's nuclear program. However after the 
war both nuclear and military research were spun off to other 
agencies or to the Department of National Defence. The 
National Research Council reverted mainly to pure research.
<P>
	Meanwhile Canada's branch plant economy boomed while 
applied science, industrial research and development, 
languished. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the foreign parents 
of Canadian subsidiary companies had for the most part little 
interest in promoting research in Canada.
<P>
	Now everything has changed again just as dramatically as 
with the advent of the second world war. This time however the 
two instruments of change are computers not weapons, and a 
global recession not war.
<P>
	Think of it. Up to about 10 years ago a scientist had to have 
access to a multimillion dollar computer that only a large 
corporation could afford if he wanted to work out complicated 
equations or do deep statistical analyses. Now he can do the 
same thing with a 486 computer worth $1,000. If he links that by 
modem to other computers and other information systems he has 
power at his fingertips which exceeds the largest supercomputer 
and he can work right at his own desk or even in his own home.
<P>
	As for the large corporation either foreign owned or domestic 
they are everywhere retreating. Like the giant department stores 
of old they are subject to relentless competition from small 
enterprises which are unfettered by the leaden bureaucracies of 
large corporations. Even IBM long seen as the bluest of blue 
chips is downsizing as it contemplates diminished bottom lines.
<P>
	I cannot resist citing an opposite example in my own riding. 
The company is called Westcam. It occupies an unprepossessing 
collection of old buildings next to a rural bush lot. It employs 
less than 100 people. Its product is spy cameras, the kind of 
devices that can photograph a postage stamp from miles away. 
Its market is highly specialized but it is worldwide. It is a small 
business.
<P>
	High technology, small business. That is where this budget 
rings with a clear pure note. Out with the old, in with the new. 
The large corporations no longer have the lion's share of 
research and development. Technological innovation is going to 
come from the little companies, not the big ones. This 
government's budget addresses that fact.
<P>
	Consider what the budget says. Free up capital for small 
business through the Canada investment fund and by putting 
pressure on banks. Simplify paper work. Provide funds for small 
businesses to hire scientists and engineers. Establish networks 
to share technology and business savvy. Set priorities for 
research directly funded by government.
<P>
	There are casualties: the funding for the KAON nuclear 
accelerator project in British Columbia for instance and 
Canada's participation in the U.S. Space Station Freedom. That 
is another prestige project many in the American scientific 
community consider a wanton waste of money in terms of the 
return on scientific knowledge.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada should be getting out of that, and so we are. What are 
we doing instead? Canada is putting $800 million into a new 
space program centred on remote sensing and satellite 
communications. This historically is where Canadian 
technology has shone. We are known the world over for our 
prowess in this field. This expertise has largely come from 
medium and small businesses, not from the multinational 
corporations.
<P>
	The National Research Council also has been revamped. For 
years under the previous government it has endured a steady 
erosion of financial support. While the Tories proclaimed to the 
press their dedication to science, they starved the institution that 
has done more for Canadian science than any other.
<P>
	This government in this budget has thrown out a lifeline to the 
National Research Council. The schedule of cutbacks instituted 
by the Tories has been halted. The National Research Council 
can breathe again.
<P>
	The future is bright. Canadians have an incredible talent for 
innovation. I do not care if we categorize ourselves as 
Quebecers or Torontonians, easterners or westerners; the fact 
remains we are one of the most versatile peoples on earth.
<P>
	Our strength is in our tolerance, our diversity, our constant 
search for new ideas. These are qualities we all share. We share 
them in this House on all sides, not just the Liberals, but the Bloc 
and the Reform. In that sense, to all my colleagues I say we are 
one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
reply to the Minister of Finance's budget, I wish to underline 
that the government totally ignored the recommendations found 
in the Auditor General's report.
<P>
	Canada is going through a major crisis. The accumulated debt 
exceeds $500 billion, and the annual deficit now totals $41 
billion. In other words, each year, this unmanageable country 
earns less than it spends, and is inevitably heading toward 
economic bankruptcy.
<P>
	Big corporations and capital holders say that a decrease in 
their profits resulting from a fairer tax system would cause 
irreparable damage to the economy.
<P>
	So, they argue that the government must slash budgetary 
expenses. The business community, the decision-makers in the 
world of high finance suggest that the time is right to dismantle 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2157"> 2157 </A></B>
<P>
what is left of the welfare state. The neo-conservatism of the 
1980s is now the philosophy of the Minister of Finance in the 
present  Liberal government, since he fully approves of the big 
corporations' approach, and his budget proves it.
<P>
	In fact, this budget speech announces that the government 
will, during the next three years, cut more than $7.5 billion from 
social programs, particularly unemployment insurance. Thus, 
the government has avoided launching a frontal attack on major 
great financial interests, while it has ignored waste within its 
bureaucracy and mismanagement by senior civil servants and its 
own policy-makers.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to remind the House of some of the 
comments the Auditor General made in his last report about 
waste and mismanagement of public funds, which comments the 
Minister of Finance totally ignored while preparing his budget.
<P>
	The government is doing absolutely nothing to reduce the 
structural deficit, since it avoids dealing with waste and 
mismanagement. Let me give you some examples of waste. The 
federal vehicle fleet costs more than $500 million and 4,000 new 
vehicles are added every year; Investment Canada has spent 
$132,000 to set up a new office, complete with a kitchen and a 
bathroom, for the new president, even if the office of the 
previous president, located in the same building, provided all 
those amenities. The cost of the use of the Challenger aircrafts 
reached $54 million, more than half of which was spent for 
transporting ministers. According to the Auditor General, this 
comes to $19,650 per hour of flight. More than 800 civil 
servants who received a cash out to retire were rehired 
afterwards. About $30 million was wasted that way.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission has made an <I>ex gratia</I> 
payment-and I remind you that an <I>ex gratia</I> payment is one that 
is made as a gift, in the public interest, and not because it is 
legally necessary-in the amount of approximately $657,000 to 
some producers as compensation for losses incurred because a 
seed cleaning company that had obtained a licence from the 
Commission went bankrupt.
<P>
	What measures in this budget tend to eliminate such waste, 
which is only the tip of the iceberg? None. And what about the 
mismanagement that has become generalized within the Public 
Service since the Liberal Party was in power at the end of the 
1960s and beginning of the 1970s? The Auditor General has 
given several examples of this, which we have grouped 
according to three types of problems: program assessment, 
identification of program overlapping, and a more general view 
of certain expenditures reflecting poor management on the part 
of the government.
<P>
	On the subject of program assessment, in his 1993 report, the 
Auditor General especially blamed mismanagement of public 
funds on a glaring lack of close examination of government 
spending. He recommended that programs be judged on their 
results so as to guide policy decisions. The Bloc Quebecois has 
already raised  this point, but it is worth repeating that nowhere 
in this Liberal budget is the problem of program assessment 
really addressed.
<P>
	From a quantitative standpoint, between 1989 and 1992, 
program evaluation spending fell by 28 per cent, resulting in a 
much smaller number of program evaluations being performed. 
In 1987-88, 99 program evaluations were conducted, compared 
to only 80 in 1992. Again according to the Auditor General's 
report, in 1991-92, the government spent $125 billion on 16 
programs, only two of which were thoroughly evaluated. It is 
not the most expensive programs which are evaluated. It is 
estimated that twice as many programs worth less than $250 
million are evaluated compared to those worth more than $250 
million.
<P>
	From a qualitative standpoint, since the responsibility for 
program evaluation rests with the department, the immediate 
needs of managers prevail over the government's needs and the 
public interest. When interviewed by the Auditor General, the 
persons responsible for program evaluation within the 
department said that the most important role of an evaluation is 
to assist managers in solving organizational problems. So they 
pay no attention to the fundamental function of program 
evaluation, which is to measure the effectiveness of a program 
and to question its relevancy if necessary in order to achieve 
optimal resource allocation. It is to be noted that this type of 
information would be most useful to Parliament in allocating 
resources and to Canadians in rating government performance. 
In fact, parliamentarians are asked to work blindly, to allocate 
resources without knowing the facts.
<P>
	In his report, the Auditor General says, and I quote: ``In the 
1990s, program evaluation should be seen as crucial to the 
management of government expenditures, because it can help to 
arrive at informed decisions aimed at controlling growth of the 
public debt''. In spite of that warning or, if you prefer, of that 
suggestion by the Auditor General, nothing in the budget would 
lead one to believe that the Liberal government is heading in that 
direction.
<P>
	Overlapping remains one of the main causes of waste and poor 
financial management. The federal spending power in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction accounts for 24 per cent of overlapping 
and the power to legislate in areas of shared jurisdiction 
accounts for 76 per cent of overlapping, but, again, nothing in 
the budget shows that there is a will to change the traditional 
Liberal way of thinking in this regard.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Program duplication is partly to blame for the 
mismanagement of public funds and is therefore responsible for 
the increasing cost of government action. Since it is more 
economi-
<P>

<B><A NAME="2158"> 2158 </A></B>
<P>
cal to give to only one administration exclusive jurisdiction over 
services provided simultaneously; since duplication often adds 
nothing to the quality of government interventions, quite  the 
contrary; since affected employees and facilities could be used 
in a much more rational and relevant way; and since also the 
measures put in place by both levels of government often cancel 
each other out, the competing if not conflicting nature of 
federal-provincial relations makes it difficult to co-ordinate 
programs because neither level of government is ready to make 
major concessions about their own objectives and priorities.
<P>
	Finally, program duplication is an inflationary factor in the 
Canadian economy since an increase in the amount of 
information citizens must have to be able to take advantage of 
the services and financial aid available, or to conform to laws 
and regulations, results in a multiplication of the steps required 
to get that information and thus, in an increase in the number of 
employees involved in a somewhat unproductive task.
<P>
	In conclusion, we find it hard to understand that the Minister 
of Finance, who seems to have made the fight against deficit his 
priority, has ignored the recommendations of the Auditor 
General about waste and mismanagement of public funds. In 
order to eliminate waste, unnecessary spending and 
mismanagement in government, in the name of the Bloc 
Quebecois, I request again that the government create a 
parliamentary committee to analyze and review budget 
spending, item by item.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
dealing with the budget presented on February 22, I think it is 
appropriate to remind everybody that a budget is an instrument 
that a government uses to pursue its objectives. To recall the 
objectives that the Liberal Party had set for itself, I should point 
out what the leader and his candidates said during the campaign.
<P>
	What did they say? They said that it was necessary to give 
hope back to Canadians, to get people back to work and to bring 
the deficit back to 3 per cent of the GDP. They said that they 
would protect the universality of our social programs and our 
health care system against the severe cutbacks announced by the 
Tories and requested by the Reform Party. They said that it was 
necessary to invest $20 billion in the infrastructure.
<P>
	Let us pursue our search for coherence. Immediately after the 
election, the Prime minister announced the cancellation of the 
helicopter contract, thus causing the loss of hundreds of high 
technology jobs in Quebec without compensation, in spite of the 
traditional inequity of the National Defence spendings in 
Quebec: $538 per capita in Nova Scotia, compared to $62 in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Another way to judge the objectives of the government is to 
refer to the throne speech. Allow me to underline the lack of a 
real will to deal with real problems.
<P>
	Apart from the infrastructure program, which was slashed 
from $20 billion before the election campaign to a mere $6 
billion, no concrete measure was taken to revive the labour 
market on a durable basis. On the contrary, the government 
announces the loss of 40,000 jobs due to the unemployment 
insurance premium increase in 1994.
<P>
	There is no will to reduce operating expenditures. There is no 
will to reform the Canadian tax system. Just like the former 
government, the new government announces that it will 
undertake in the next few years a reform of our social security 
system.
<P>
	After such a weak throne speech, how could we expect a 
budget different from the one that was presented in the House on 
February 22? Could we hope for a miracle? Let us recall the 
discussion we had in the House in the weeks preceding the 
budget speech.
<P>
	Every time the official opposition asked the government 
questions on important matters such the national debt, the 
deficit, the tax system, the preservation of our social safety net, 
family trusts, job creation, the fate of young Canadians, we were 
told to wait for the budget, that it would give all the answers. It 
was to be the cure-all, the nirvana of the finance minister. What 
a sham. What a cruel parody.
<P>
	Last week, on February 28, I experienced a truly democratic 
exercise with my constituents whom I had invited to come and 
share their concerns with me.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Among the forty or so persons present, there was a large 
consensus on family trusts and tax loopholes, shelters and 
havens. These constituents are shocked by the government's 
inaction and the absence of adequate measures in the budget 
tabled by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	These voters do not understand why, after having fought 
against the Valcourt plan, the Liberal Party would come down so 
ferociously on UI benefits. According to three economists of the 
Université du Québec at Montreal, who certainly have more 
credibility than the Minister of Finance, the unemployed alone 
will contribute 60 per cent of the savings the federal government 
says it will make in its financial commitments.
<P>
	People in my riding compare the way those less fortunate 
people are being treated with the extravagant expenditures of 
our embassies. They think of the generals and ambassadors who 
are still driven around in limousines and the army, where there 
are more officers than soldiers, more generals than tanks.
<P>
	People I have met in my riding do not understand why the 
Minister of Finance is reducing tax exemptions for seniors while 
refusing to review the entire tax system. They do not admit that 
the federal government, which has often said it was responsible 
for defending minorities in this country, would close down the 
only French-language military college in America in spite of  
<P>

<B><A NAME="2159"> 2159 </A></B>
<P>
the advice given by all stakeholders, including those of the 
Department of National Defence. With this decision, the 
government is showing its real personality.
<P>
	Now let us talk about assistance to developing countries. 
Given the present economic context and our financial state, it is 
fitting to analyze the budget and administrative decisions taken 
by the government regarding aid to developing countries.
<P>
	Such an analysis is made all the more difficult as the 
government announced, a while ago, that it was going to review 
Canada's foreign policy as a whole. It is rather awkward to study 
the budget, public expenses and development assistance in 
relation to these new objectives, since they have not yet been 
set.
<P>
	Another problem comes from the fact that CIDA only tabled 
its 1991-1992 annual report in January 1994. It has not yet been 
critically analyzed by the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	In this respect, we have every right to question the criteria 
used by the government to cut its development assistance 
budget.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois expected to see in this budget a 
substantial increase of non-governmental organization funding, 
even if it meant a reduction of bilateral assistance programs, 
often criticized by people in the field.
<P>
	We believe that the NGOs' share should be much greater than 
it is now, since they work directly with the poorest people of the 
world, with one of the highest success rate in the area, and the 
lowest administration costs. Only 10 per cent of Canadian 
assistance to developing countries goes to NGOs.
<P>
	It is too little and the Minister of Foreign Affairs agrees with 
you since he said in the House on February 9 that the 
government would do everything in its power to not only 
maintain but increase this percentage.
<P>
	The minister did not keep his promise. Neither will the 
Minister of Finance be able to keep his promise to allocate to 
development assistance 0.7 per cent of GDP, an internationally 
recognized standard, given the measures announced in this 
budget. How can he increase this ratio, which now amounts to 
0.4 per cent of GDP, with a 2 per cent reduction in international 
assistance funding and resources frozen at this level for the 
following year?
<P>
	Can the government reveal its magic trick, unless its solution 
lies in reducing Canada's GDP in the next few years?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels that the government should look 
beyond the economic reasons to cut development assistance and 
reconsider the cuts made in recent years. Our position is based 
on several reasons.
<P>
	The first reason has to do with Canada's international prestige 
and reputation with respect to its development assistance 
efforts. This is an essential element of the whole thrust of 
Canadian foreign policy. Cuts in development assistance 
funding will surely have a very negative impact on Canada's 
international image, as well as a potential ripple effect on other 
countries.
<P>
	Another aspect, the most important in our opinion, that the 
government should have considered is the humanitarian 
dimension of international assistance.
<P>
	In short, Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois feels that the 
measures announced by the government in its budget regarding 
international assistance are not very consistent. We are now 
waiting for the review of our foreign policy, which hopefully 
will not be as disappointing as this budget.
<P>
	We particularly hope that the new direction of Canada's 
international assistance policy will not be affected by the 
negative aspects of this budget, and that the federal government 
will set objectives which will take into account the needs of the 
poorest countries as well as the expectations of Canadian 
organizations and individuals involved in international 
co-operation.
