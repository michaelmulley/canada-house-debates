	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, to hold Canadian citizenship is our 
greatest honour and responsibility. It is also recognized around 
the world as a symbol of opportunity, equality, freedom, 
fairness, and above all hope.
<P>
	If we are to move forward as a nation Canadian citizenship 
must be strengthened and appreciated even more.
<P>
	Next week is National Citizenship Week, a time when all 
Canadians are encouraged to reflect on the principles, rights and 
responsibilities of our citizenship. Therefore this is a most 
opportune time for me to make two announcements on behalf of 
the government and the people of Canada.
<P>
	First, I am pleased to announce plans for the development of a 
new Citizenship Act. We have had a proud history of citizenship 
legislation in the country, a history of generosity and 
progressiveness, but the Citizenship Act as it exists today is 
almost 20 years old and we have rarely amended it in any serious 
fashion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to propose far-reaching changes to citizenship 
legislation that will be part of the renewal of our identity as 
Canadians-changes to strenghten the ties that hold us 
together-whether we are Canadian by birth or by choice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are compelling reasons to undertake this initiative at 
this time. It actively addresses an issue important to all 
Canadians, affirming a sense of pride in ourselves and 
confidence in our nation.
<P>
	We also require a new Citizenship Act both to respond to the 
realities of our changing society and to guide us into that future. 
We need a dynamic act that underscores the significance of an 
active, aggressive, enthusiastic citizenship. We need a 
Citizenship Act that also ensures fairness and integrity, one that 
removes certain discriminatory aspects of current legislation, 
eliminates  inconsistencies in the granting of Canadian 
citizenship and improves the process of acquiring that 
citizenship and that Canadian passport.
<P>
	These important issues need the input and deliberation of 
Canadians and the careful consideration by members of 
Parliament in this Chamber.
<P>
	That is why I am pleased to say that the Standing Committee 
on Citizenship and Immigration will be examining the 
principles, rights and responsibilities which are fundamental to 
the Canadian concept of responsible citizenship.
<P>
	I have asked the committee to consider the reciprocal 
obligations inherent in the relationship between Canadian 
citizens and our society.
<P>
	I hope the committee will make recommendations on ways to 
enhance the value and visibility of Canadian citizenship. I am 
hopeful that a report can be completed by June and make way for 
preparations of a bill to come to this place in the fall.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Creating a new vision of citizenship for all Canadians is vital 
but it is not enough. Too many of those who are currently 
entitled to become citizens and desperately want to do so are 
blocked by an administrative system which has become 
overburdened and unable to cope.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Denying would-be citizens the chance to participate in and 
contribute to the life of our society is unacceptable for this 
minister and this government.
<P>
	In Toronto, for instance, people have had to wait as long as 
two years to get their citizenship after meeting all the basic 
requirements and criteria of being landed immigrants for three 
years. That is unacceptable as well.
<P>
	There are a number of serious bottlenecks in the system. We 
are one of the last countries, one of the last jurisdictions, for 
instance, to grant citizenship through a one on one interview 
basis conducted by citizenship court judges. In essence we are 
saying yes too slowly and at too high a cost because 95 per cent 
of all applicants get accepted. Why make them wait and why do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3010"> 3010 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayers have to pay the price for that process to take shape? 
Clearly there is a better way.
<P>
	That brings me to the second announcement. I intend on the 
part of the government to streamline the system by eliminating 
the role of citizenship judges and replacing them with a more 
efficient and effective administrative process. However we will 
not wait until legislation is passed in order to do away with the 
position of citizenship court judges as a way of enhancing the 
processing of time.
<P>
	We will move instead immediately on a series of 
administrative and regulatory changes to speed up the process 
today. This includes increasing the daily number of hearings, 
establishing group hearings to test knowledge and language 
requirements, encouraging applicants to file by mail rather than 
the long administrative process they have to go through today, 
extending business hours to evenings and Saturdays for 
citizenship courts which is also more convenient for the working 
public, as well as inviting distinguished Canadians to preside at 
citizenship ceremonies.
<P>
	These measures will speed up the process. They will also 
strengthen the fairness of the system and ensure that all 
citizenship candidates meet the essential requirements that we 
as Canadians would want. My ultimate goal and that of my 
government is that applicants obtain citizenship six months 
after applying for this privilege.
<P>
	Our judges have done a fine job and we are indebted to them 
for their work. Let us be perfectly clear. The political and 
partisan appointments of citizenship judges will become a thing 
of the past. As vacancies arise new citizenship court judges will 
not be appointed. Current judges will become part of the new 
administrative process and help us in this transition until the 
expiry of their terms.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have discussed this issue with my hon. 
colleague the President of the Privy Council and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. I am pleased to say that these 
changes are in step with the initiative taken by government to 
streamline its agencies and commissions, and to reduce to a 
minimum the number of order-in-council appointments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I propose to ask eminent Canadians, for instance, those who 
have received the Order of Canada, to preside over citizenship 
ceremonies. I also intend to move more of those ceremonies out 
of the citizenship courts and into the heart of all of our 
communities, the heart of Canada, so that citizenships can be 
celebrated in school gymnasiums, in cultural auditoriums, in 
community halls, in church basements where many more people 
from the entire community can join in honouring and welcoming 
the new members of the Canadian family and where all of us, 
young and old, can be reminded of the importance of our 
citizenship. Sometimes the things we value most are the things 
we take for granted. We must start to view citizenship as more 
than just the aspirations of  immigrants and newcomers to 
Canada. We must come to celebrate citizenship as a bond among 
all of us.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I am counting on the members of the House of Commons, the 
members of the committee and my parliamentary secretary, 
whom I wish to thank, to help make this initiative truly 
meaningful and inspirational.
<P>
	I will also work closely with my colleagues, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and others in the development and 
promotion of our new Citizenship Act.
<P>
	A country's citizenship act should be a proud, bold and 
enthusiastic statement of its history, its hopes, its principles and 
its dreams. A revitalized citizenship act should be a symbol of 
what we hold to be important as Canadians.
<P>
	There is an appetite across the country for us to strengthen 
those symbols and to articulate the vision that ties us all together 
as Canadians, irrespective of the fierce loyalty we feel for our 
regions, our provinces and our own backyards.
<P>
	We need a symbol that unites us, east to west to north. I invite 
all hon. members to join with me and the government in this 
exciting endeavour and to seize this opportunity for progress 
and renewal of the Canadian spirit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's 
statement announcing plans for the development of a new 
Citizenship Act as well as measures, some quite vague, to speed 
up the administrative process involved in processing citizenship 
applications.
<P>
	We, members of the Bloc Quebecois, recognize that, in the 
rest of Canada, the Citizenship Act reform announced by the 
minister may seem meaningful, especially in view of the many 
obstacles to obtaining citizenship which, as the minister 
indicated, are attributable to a slow administrative process.
<P>
	We believe that doing away with citizenship judges is a step in 
the right direction. It is a fact that this structure is costing 
taxpayers a great deal and is partly responsible for the backlog 
in the processing of citizenship applications.
<P>
	Everyone agrees that a great many of those appointments 
were actually partisan or political ones. This kind of patronage 
by the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party in our 
citizenship courts has to stop. That such a backlog exists in the 
processing of citizenship applications is incredible. As we 
speak, 220,000 people are waiting to be heard by a citizenship 
judge, and their numbers are growing by 10,000 every month in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3011"> 3011 </A></B>
<P>
spite of the fact that we have 32 citizenship courts across 
Canada.
<P>
	In his 1990 report, the Auditor General severely criticized the 
absence of performance standards within the citizenship 
registration and promotion program.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The amount of time required to process applications had 
increased considerably. In 1986, 91 per cent of all citizenship 
applications were processed in less than nine weeks, whereas in 
1989, only 30 per cent of applications were processed in the 
same period of time.
<P>
	Despite the fact that there have been no follow-up checks, 
delays continue to be a major problem, one that needs to be 
corrected as quickly as possible. Under the circumstances, the 
decision to close the citizenship office on St-Denis Street in 
Montreal is baffling. Will the delays be shortened as a result of 
this closure, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	Clearly, we can no longer accept delays of two years between 
the filing of the application and the actual administering of the 
oath of citizenship. Moreover, this anachronistic oath requiring 
a person to be faithful and to bear allegiance to Her Majesty 
Queen Elizabeth II of England and to her heirs and successors 
should also be carefully reviewed.
<P>
	Having said this, I would also say how surprised I am that the 
minister has asked the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration to make recommendations to him by the month of 
June. This is not very much time, considering that all aspects of 
the citizenship issue need to be addressed. Why does the 
minister not table his bill right away so that the Committee can 
examine it in the usual manner?
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to criticize the minister's 
decision to hold consultations outside Parliament and the 
committee framework on immigration levels for the next ten 
years. This issue is vitally important to the future of the country. 
Furthermore, the Official Opposition has no representation in 
such an outside consultation process. This goes against 
parliamentary standards worthy of a democratic society.
<P>
	It is necessary and useful to discuss the administrative, 
regulatory and legislative measures needed to improve the 
situation. It is surprising, however, to hear the minister say that 
one of the objectives of the committee should be to redefine the 
true meaning of Canada and citizenship, as if somehow these 
concepts became blurred with the passage of time.
<P>
	Clearly, the common vision which he would like all 
immigrants to share is not one-dimensional, but rather 
multidimensional. We have already said here in this House that 
there is not only one Canadian reality, but at least three: one for 
francophones, one for anglophones and one for first nations or 
aboriginal peoples, whether in Quebec, the Prairies or the 
Maritimes.
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, the Canadian reality is not the one 
painted by the minister, one where citizens form one big family 
united by common values and the desire to fit into the same 
mould. As members of a society with its own distinct 
characteristics, Quebeckers feel a sense of attachment first and 
foremost to Quebec's economic, social, cultural and political 
institutions. This was the case long before the Bloc Quebecois 
sent members to Ottawa, or the Parti Quebecois sent 
representatives to Quebec City. This attachment to Quebec soil 
and the unique identity which flows from this sense of belonging 
are historic realities, ones which must be embraced not only by 
those who have lived in Quebec for several generations, but also 
by immigrants like myself wishing to settle permanently in the 
province.
<P>
	This morning, I read the statements made by the minister. He 
is concerned about the vision of Quebec that is being projected 
by the COFIs in the province. There is nothing unusual going on 
here, since it is the minister's Liberal colleagues in Quebec who 
run these centres. Above all, I would ask that the minister not 
interfere in education as this is a provincial field.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	National pride and a sense of attachment to a society, be it 
Quebec or any other, flows above all from the welcome extended 
to immigrants, from the way in which their differences are 
respected and from the process whereby immigrants learn about 
the history and culture of the people of their adoptive land.
<P>
	The residents of the Prairies, British Columbia, the 
Maritimes, Ontario and the Northwest Territories all have their 
own distinctive cultural features.
<P>
	In conclusion, while we do not oppose the reform of the 
Citizenship Act, we must not allow ourselves to be deluded into 
believing that national identity comes only through citizenship. 
No, it stems from a desire to live and work in, and to help build a 
country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my privilege to rise in response to the 
announcement today of the plans to develop a new Citizenship 
Act. It is of great importance to all Canadians and to the future 
of the country that we are all proud citizens and contributors to 
the economic growth, the cultural diversity and the social 
renewal of Canada.
<P>
	Citizens of Canada should have a commitment to the future of 
the country and to their fellow Canadians. I would like to take 
some time to briefly comment on some aspects of the 
announcement of the minister. Today the Minister of 
Citizenship and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3012"> 3012 </A></B>
<P>
Immigration described his department's response in seeking to 
eliminate the patronage aspects of citizenship court judges.
<P>
	With Canadians I have talked to, I have felt that we are truly 
fed up with the perceived misuse of partisan privileges. I asked 
them and members can be sure they are. I am pleased with this 
first step in the right direction in getting rid of patronage 
appointments.
<P>
	Of the 48 judges who now occupy the benches of the 
citizenship court, 34 full time and 14 part time, there surely will 
be a long delay before full implementation of this program. 
They must complete their five-year, average $64,000 a year 
income positions.
<P>
	Some appointments are recent and no announcement of the 
particulars of what their severance arrangements might be has 
been made. As well, there is no comment as to the hundreds of 
other positions within the department and what sort of 
arrangement might be made.
<P>
	We still do not have a concrete government response to the 
issue of patronage within the system or of government 
interference. For instance, we have just seen an election where 
candidates have been appointed. Even in this very department, 
what about all the recent refugee board appointments? They are 
much more numerous than the citizenship court judge 
appointments and just as lucrative.
<P>
	I applaud the government's willingness to include the 
standing committee in the process of the review of the 
Citizenship Act. Hopefully this involvement will be more than 
just recognizing general principles and ideas. I for one have 
input from Canadians for that process.
<P>
	I have a polling system in my riding and just recently I asked 
this question to do with citizenship: ``Should citizenship be 
granted automatically to those who were born in Canada 
regardless of the status of their parents' citizenship?'' The 
response I had has been two-thirds against this notion which is 
now in the system. These things have to be looked at and I hope 
that our committee will have input in these areas.
<P>
	The idea of streamlining the process, as in all processes of 
government, is to be applauded. Other attempts at amnesty and 
streamlining have happened in the past. In fact what comes to 
mind is the streamlining process in immigration between 1991 
and 1992. That addressed a pressing refugee demand need 
within the system.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Those very stresses are now facing the citizenship courts. 
There is a three-year wait between the time people arrive and 
the time they can apply for citizenship. The three-year wait and 
the right of citizenship are putting the onus on the citizenship 
courts.
<P>
	Canadians are again faced with fast tracking of these 
individuals. For the sake of security in our country and the 
maintenance of the value of our citizenship, I demand full 
accountability of any acceptance system.
<P>
	It came to mind that over a century ago people moved from 
one country to another on what was known as an underground 
railroad. We must not be too hasty to change our present 
citizenship system to a Bombardier bullet train.
<P>
	Of greatest importance to me and I believe to all Canadians is 
the elevation of the concept and value of citizenship within this 
country. Does Canadian citizenship at the present time have the 
value it deserves? Has the government helped make that 
citizenship a value by some of the choices it has made? Has it 
helped Canada be an economically viable place in which to live 
where the citizens can be a proud part of that viability?
<P>
	I look at the budget and I see sinking credit rates. I ask if the 
government has helped citizens become part of a country that is 
to be a full player in the trade and economy of this world. I ask 
the government whether citizenship has been helped with the 
continued fractionalization of our country.
<P>
	I look at present policies of bilingualism and 
multiculturalism. I believe they created a country that does not 
stress the equality of Canadian citizens as individuals but stress 
the individual's association with a particular group. I challenge 
that.
<P>
	I ask the government if it has enhanced citizenship with the 
notion that was introduced in that act in 1977, that citizenship is 
a right rather than a privilege to all who qualify.
<P>
	Reformers believe that Canadians should have every reason to 
be proud of their citizenship. It is a pride that should not be 
devalued but strengthened and encouraged because it is a 
privilege to be a Canadian, not just a right.
<P>
	Those who are Canadians by birth or those who become 
citizens by choice should honour this privilege as we work 
together to make this country all it can be. Citizenship should be 
the first step in our commitment and investment toward a 
brighter future. That future is our responsibility in this place as 
the law makers of the country and not only within the 
Citizenship and Immigration Department, but in all 
departments. I challenge the government to make this country 
the best place in which anyone could want to live.

	The House resumed from April 12 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 22, 1994, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before beginning the debate, I wish to 
inform the House that because of the ministerial statement and 
responses thereto, Government Orders will be extended by 28 
minutes, pursuant to Standing Order 33(2).
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
previously addressed the House on the amendment that was 
moved by the member of the Bloc who spoke second in the 
debate.
<P>
	I know there are members in the House who apparently 
oppose the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I can understand the position taken by members of the Bloc 
Quebecois because they are the Official Opposition in this 
House and as such they are obliged to oppose the government's 
proposals, especially the budget. But they fully realize that we 
adopted a budget here in this House and presented it to the 
people of Canada. It is a fair and equitable budget, which is very 
popular throughout Canada.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know it is not popular with some members of the House, but 
the Canadian public thinks the government has performed 
extremely well in the budget. I know members of the Reform 
Party in their heart of hearts know that too, but of course they 
have to oppose it because they want to make more unspecified 
cuts.
<P>
	I would love to go on at length today but I realize there are 
many other members who wish to participate in the debate, and 
having spoken once I feel it would be unfair for me to continue at 
length. On the other hand, we are into 10-minute speeches. The 
speeches are very short.
<P>
	I commend to hon. members opposite in preparation for their 
speeches later today the opportunity to reread the words of the 
President of the Treasury Board which he spoke on the 
introduction of this bill on March 25. If they have time and if 
they want to continue, they could read my speech on that 
occasion which I must say was a masterpiece of clarity and 
explained all the provisions of the bill in great detail.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, we say no 
to Bill C-17; no to the so-called reform of unemployment 
insurance; no to this government's budget measures; no to the 
$735 million grabbed with impunity from Quebec workers; no to 
the $1.620 billion lost by Canadians; no to misleading and 
devastating savings; no to reducing the benefit period; no to 
reducing benefits, sole means of subsistence for many workers;; 
no to offloading expenditures onto the provinces; no to regional 
inequities penalizing Quebec and Eastern Canada once again; no 
to social assistance as the only recourse left after unemployment 
insurance benefits run out; no to undue delays in reducing 
unemployment insurance premiums.
<P>
	We reject any policy conceived and adopted under pressure 
that penalizes workers and the provinces under the guise of 
economy. These savings are achieved at the expense of workers 
who lost their jobs because of the dismal state of the current job 
market. Moreover, half of these so-called savings, in the order 
of $635 million in Quebec alone, must be absorbed by the 
provinces through social assistance payments.
<P>
	Finally, negative consequences will not be distributed equally 
among the provinces. When we hear that the benefits paid to 
Quebec taxpayers will be reduced by $735 million while those 
paid to Western Canadians will only go down by $430 million, 
we must reiterate vigorously the disadvantages suffered by 
Quebec within the Canadian federation.
<P>
	We say no to the harmful attitude perpetuating the idea that 
the unemployed do not want to work. It is not the unemployed 
who lack vision, it is their governments. People cannot be 
blamed for the lack of jobs, but governments can. We say no to 
unsound, ineffective and unfair policies; no to government 
mismanagement; no to the systematic overlooking of the real 
problems and the real solutions. Young people say no to the 
alarming unemployment facing them. They say no to the 
unpalatable placebo called the Youth Service Corps. Young 
people need jobs, not measures which will penalize them right 
from the start. We say no to harassing the poor and the 
unemployed; to conducting underhand attacks against poor 
working women; to letting civil servants interfere in the private 
lives of mothers; to tolerating paternalism toward women; to 
having to prove everything to get some minor benefit; and to 
creating tensions between spouses regarding who will have 
custody of the children.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	We know, and this has been repeated time and again, that 
women have precarious jobs, which do not pay well and which 
are very vulnerable to the swings of the job market. Women need 
permanent well-paid jobs. They have no need for new 
constraints in their family and private lives.
<P>
	We say no to precarious and poorly paid jobs; to the lack of 
job-creation measures which has the shameful effect of 
increasing the number of unemployed; to overlappings in 
training programs and to political decisions which favour the 
rich at the expense of the poor.
<P>
	Until this government takes the required objectives measures 
to ensure that the rich share their wealth with others, we will 
oppose any legislative policy penalizing young people, 
low-income workers, women and the unemployed.
<P>
	We say no to misleading statements to the effect that savings 
will be reinvested by businesses.
<P>
	The government's evaluation regarding the reinvestment of 
such miserly savings is not based on any solid ground. Nothing 
is provided to promote or control this aspect. Moreover, only 
large corporations might be able to create a few jobs because of 
the lowering of contributions. We know that small and medium 
businesses are the ones which create the most jobs. How can we 
expect them to pay a full salary with annual savings of $40, for 
example? Employers need real job creation programs.
<P>
	We say no to the dead-end in which Quebeckers and 
Canadians find themselves and we say no to despair.
<P>
	We would have loved to have the opportunity to support real 
job creation initiatives, as well as the transfer of training 
programs to Quebec, the promotion of social justice, the respect 
of privacy and the implementation of programs which would 
have generated some hope.
<P>
	However, in light of these phoney measures, the people of the 
riding of Quebec say no.
<P>
	The women of Quebec say a flat ``no'', not even a ``no thank 
you''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, although 
the bill is mainly of a housekeeping nature it once again reminds 
us of the tax grab of the previous government. That tax grab is 
being expanded by the present government.
<P>
	A businessman I know got pretty angry recently when he was 
writing his month-end cheques for his business. He had to write 
about six cheques, five of which were for various forms of 
taxation. There was money that had to be sent to the Workers' 
Compensation Board, Revenue Canada for corporate tax, the 
B.C. government for PST, the municipality for a business 
licence tax, and Revenue Canada for the GST.
<P>
	In small businesses taxes have become a major disincentive to 
expansion and job creation. There is some evidence that the tax 
saturation point has been reached.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3015"> 3015 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, the Department of Finance figures list tax 
revenues for September 1992 at $11.07 billion and a year later in 
September 1993 at $10.17 billion. That is down 8.3 per cent in 
one year. The revenue for April to October 1992 was $64.94 
billion. For April to October 1993 it was only $61.22 billion. 
That is down 5.73 per cent from a year earlier. These drops are 
pretty serious because they really interfere with a government's 
ability to raise additional revenues to fund the programs we all 
rely on.
<P>
	If we look at something like the GST, recent figures from the 
GST branch of Revenue Canada show that GST revenues 
dropped about $.2 billion between 1992 and 1993. It is 
interesting that although the GST revenues dropped the actual 
cost of collection jumped 25.4 per cent in one year from $268.5 
million to $336.7 million.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	In one year the number of GST employees increased by 23.3 
per cent. I wonder how many businesses would deliberately 
increase their workforce at a time when revenues were dropping. 
To increase them 23 per cent is a disgrace.
<P>
	A number of votes have already taken place in this House on 
the recent budget of the government. Predictably every Liberal 
MP voted in favour of both the budget bill and the bill 
authorizing borrowing of up to $37 billion.
<P>
	Of course every Reform MP voted against both those bills. We 
proposed an amendment that would cap spending but that was 
rejected by both government members and the Bloc. I had hoped 
that some government members would respond to an intelligent 
debate in the Chamber and would change their votes but it was 
not to be.
<P>
	On Monday, March 8, 1994, the hon. Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism spoke in favour of the borrowing bill. During 
her speech she turned to the public gallery where there were a 
group of high school students. She said she was talking about 
their future and how important the $37 billion borrowing effort 
was.
<P>
	When her speech was over I asked the hon. member whether 
she had ever asked her children or grandchildren or the people in 
the gallery whether they wanted $37 billion more added to their 
mortgage for the future. The hon. member replied that her 
children told her the government was moving in the right 
direction. Frankly I found that hard to believe. I really find it 
hard to believe anyone would approve of someone else 
borrowing $37 billion on their behalf and leaving them to carry 
the can. I find that quite difficult to believe.
<P>
	On the same day I gave a speech about the budget. I explained 
how I felt as I had listened to the Minister of Finance deliver the 
budget. I said I had felt a bit of anger and despair but mostly a 
terrible sense of sadness because of my background with New 
Zealand and understanding the debt crisis situation that had 
developed there. I had seen the same symptoms and problems 
before: the denial  that there was a problem; the failure to act 
soon enough; the rejection of the idea that there would be a day 
of reckoning.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have now been committed to another $40 
billion in debt this year. The national debt federally now exceeds 
$510.7 billion. It is growing by approximately $1,400 per 
second, every second of the day. The debt per taxpayer is around 
$36,500 and per capita is almost $18,000.
<P>
	In relation to this tax load the government has been increasing 
its spending in some programs. It constantly praises the student 
job creation program and brags about its increases of 
expenditures on it. I think that is mainly because it is politically 
correct to do so.
<P>
	An internal audit of the program last year concluded it was 
very poorly monitored. It was rife with political patronage and it 
was a questionable benefit in terms of genuine job creation.
<P>
	That raised a few red flags for me when I received about 80 
applications for grants under the student job creation program, 
the challenge program, in mid-March. As I looked through these 
grant requests from Employment Canada I was shocked to see 
the sorts of things previous MPs had authorized taxpayers' 
money to be spent upon.
<P>
	One of Reform's basic promises is that we will be the fiscal 
watchdogs looking for ways to cut unnecessary spending and 
government waste. Regardless of the party that was in power 
previously, NDP, Conservative or Liberal, all of them were 
rubber stamping these terrible grants that really were quite a 
questionable use of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	I quickly arranged for a small group of North Vancouver 
citizens chosen at random from the voters list to come in and 
have a look at some of these applications. Without exception 
every single one of those people rejected at least half of the 
applications that were put before me. That is a very telling piece 
of information about the value of this student job creation 
program.
<P>
	We are caught between a rock and a hard place. If we do not 
automatically approve these challenge grants we perhaps are 
ruining the prospects for student jobs. On the other hand if we do 
rubber stamp them we are authorizing the wastage of taxpayers' 
hard earned dollars.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Debt should be a major concern to youth. We know many 
Canadians have become very cynical about politicians. Young 
people especially find it very difficult to take part in politics and 
to get involved in the votes. The lack of participation by young 
people in this political process is a major concern for us in the 
Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3016"> 3016 </A></B>
<P>
	Today in the House we are really mortgaging the future of 
Canada's young people. There are many vital government 
activities which young Canadians have a direct stake in 
protecting. These include education funding and student loans, 
job training, and the building of infrastructure.
<P>
	However the most important issue facing the youth of today is 
this debt and taxes problem. Young people need to know that 
every year this federal government is spending approximately 
$40 billion more than it takes in. By next year Canada will owe 
$550 billion to its creditors. That is $20,000 for every person in 
Canada. Approximately $40 billion more is being added to the 
national debt every year.
<P>
	Deficit spending is of critical importance to young Canadians 
because every time the government borrows money to fund 
programs it is picking the pockets of future generations. It is 
guaranteeing they will have to pay more taxes and have a lower 
standard of living than did their parents.
<P>
	Today's high tax burdens are already holding back company 
expansion and job creation and driving businesses out of 
Canada. If the trend is not reversed things will get much worse. I 
urge all young people who are watching this program today and 
hear about the bill which will increase spending to write to the 
Prime Minister: Tell him you want this intergenerational 
transfer of wealth stopped and you want it stopped now. Tell him 
you do not want higher taxes and you do not want your job 
prospects, your take home pay and your health care system put at 
risk by this deficit spending program. Tell him you do not want 
to be left with the bills of my generation. If you are between 18 
and 24 years old and watching this program today, virtually the 
entire $500 billion debt has been incurred during your lifetime.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member and all 
members need to be reminded that the procedure is designed to 
avoid any kind of outbursts. The member will please put his 
remarks to the Chair and not to anybody who might be watching 
on television, be they 10 years of age or 99 years of age.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. I 
got carried away with the excitement of the speech.
<P>
	Through you, Mr. Speaker, if there is anyone watching today 
who feels they should write to the Prime Minister about these 
things, I encourage them to do so.
<P>
	It is important that the young people of today should try to 
take part in the political process. They should become involved 
so that they can direct us as their representatives to work on their 
behalf to minimize the impact of this borrowing and the 
mortgage on their future.
<P>
	Thanks to a lot of publicity by the National Citizens' 
Coalition over the years, the shocking details about a lot of 
government mismanagement of funds have become apparent. 
One of the most public aspects is the MPs pension plan. MPs 
who have served just six years can retire on a pension for life. 
Unfortunately the previous Prime Minister just missed out with 
only five years of service. She was unable to pick up a pension 
for the rest of her life. However many people who have served 
here for just six years have managed to pick up a pension for life.
<P>
	One of the things the Reform movement would like to change 
is this gold plated pension plan. It is just one of the many things 
which contribute to the high tax burden of Canadians and which 
is totally unjustified. Members can be sure that Reform MPs 
will continue to be the watchdogs for the Canadian citizens to 
make sure that we spend less, tax less and add less to the 
borrowing burden for the future.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It should be put on the record that we 
are now on 10-minute speeches. Perhaps some members are not 
aware of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party and 
opposition members are trying to really paint a very bleak 
picture in terms of what is happening in our society in terms of 
what this government is doing.
<P>
	One would have to put things into perspective. We have two 
types of problems in our society. One is what we call a structural 
problem in terms of the infrastructure as a whole. It would have 
to be looked at.
<P>
	The second problem is matter of the spending habits of 
governments of the past. I would suggest that the budget which 
was tabled by the Minister of Finance specifically addresses 
those two issues.
<P>
	On the notion of government spending we have seen measures 
in the budget that specifically deal with government spending. It 
has been the practice of the government that every time we 
introduce a program we look at ways we could see a cost 
analysis of it in order to ensure a net benefit for the community 
as a whole.
<P>
	On the issue of infrastructure, the structural problems, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is undertaking one 
on the most aggressive reviews of not only the ways we deliver 
our social programs but the way we handle our youth across 
Canada as a whole. I commend him for taking this very 
aggressive initiative along with the Secretary of State for 
Training and Youth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3017"> 3017 </A></B>
<P>
	Unless we address the whole notion of our educational 
system, as everybody will know, we are going to continue in this 
limbo. We are going to continue to see those structural problems 
in our society. To that end the government has fulfilled its 
commitment prior to the election of reinstating funding for the 
literacy secretariat. We now have a capable minister in charge of 
that ministry.
<P>
	That in itself does not solve the problem. We can talk all we 
want in the House but unless we have the elective co-operation 
of the provincial government as well as of the municipal 
government we will not be able to move further. The problem is 
not only in the House. People might think the government can 
with the stroke of a pen solve a lot of social and economic 
problems. That is not the case.
<P>
	To that extent there has been a very proactive approach taken 
by this government with a minister specifically dedicated to 
dealing with provincial governments, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. He has undertaken a review in terms 
of how the government at the federal level does provide the 
services to the community as a whole. He is having a lot of 
consultations with other levels of government in order to have a 
collective approach of providing services to the community as a 
whole.
<P>
	The same thing this minister is doing is carried out by all 
members of cabinet, by all members of the government. 
Therefore we are quite aware of the fundamental changes that 
need to be addressed in our society and we have taken action, 
unlike the previous government which talked and talked and the 
community did not see tangible action. We are taking action.
<P>
	Rather than painting a bleak picture in society, the opposition 
should give credit to the government where credit is due, that 
this is a government in action.
<P>
	The Prime Minister on a regular basis, every time he has an 
opportunity to speak anywhere, has clearly stated that 
government agencies, departments, ministers and members of 
Parliament are always on the lookout for ways to save 
taxpayers' money so at the end of the day we can show the 
Canadian public that we are taking action by example and at the 
same time we are serious about seeing the economy turn around.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member that for better or for worse Canada is 
on the leading edge of all the big G-7 countries around the world 
in terms of economic growth. That goes to the credit of both the 
private sector and the public sector in recognizing the need to 
work together.
<P>
	The youth are going to continue to be on the leading edge in 
terms of the changes that are required. Institutions, federally, 
provincially and municipally, have to recognize that unless we 
get to the bottom of the problem, which is the educational 
system, we are not going to be able to find a long term solution 
for our economic ills.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	To that extent it will only be fair for the opposition to give 
credit to the cabinet, to the Prime Minister and to the 
government for taking a leadership role in trying to address the 
whole fundamental structural problem faced by our society 
within the area of training, literacy skills, and for that matter 
working with the provincial level to address the educational 
problem.
<P>
	In closing, I am really proud to be part of a government which 
in a very short time has taken so many aggressive, progressive, 
dynamic, tangible actions and steps to deal with the ills that 
have faced society for the past 15 or 20 years.
<P>
	Not everything is bleak. We still live in the best country in the 
world. We still have the best social programs in the world. We 
still have one of the most accessible educational systems in the 
world.
<P>
	We want to make it even better. Let us stop telling Canadians 
that things are so dark, so bad. They are not that bad but they 
could be a lot better.
<P>
	This government recognizes the fact that we must reach a 
minimal level of unemployment. As long as there is one 
unemployed Canadian the government will continue to work to 
ensure there is an opportunity for every Canadian.
<P>
	We will continue to work but it is time for us as 
parliamentarians from all sides of the House to start working as 
a team in order to address the difficulties faced by our society.
<P>
	It is my hope that when this item comes before the House it 
will receive the unanimous approval of Parliament, that we will 
all vote and give a strong mandate to the Minister of Finance, 
and to the government so it can continue to do the excellent work 
it has begun during the last 115 day or so.
<P>
	We have to start working in a positive fashion. Canadians 
have told us they want us to work together. They want to see a 
team effort in order to address some of the social and economic 
difficulties and challenges facing our society.
<P>
	They are sick and tired of seeing the type of bickering that 
takes place not only in the House but I suggest at all levels 
among politicians from different political parties. Canadians 
have told us clearly they want to see positive steps taken by 
everyone to solve some of the difficulties we are faced with.
<P>
	To that end the call is out for every member of the House to 
work together so we can move forward with tangible steps to 
respond to the needs of Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	I thank my colleagues for their positive comments this 
morning and it is my hope that they will support the bill before 
the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill-17 now being debated is an omnibus measure. It  contains 
some good provisions of which we would approve, as well as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3018"> 3018 </A></B>
<P>
some harmless ones. However, this bill primarily targets the 
unemployed.
<P>
	To decrease the budget allocated to unemployment, the bill 
proposes a reduction in benefits and an extension of the number 
of weeks of insurable employment required for benefit 
entitlement. This certainly represents the biggest part of the 
budget. This year, the cuts will total $750 million, next year, 
$2.5 billion, and the following year, another $2.5 billion, for a 
total of $5.5 billion taken from unemployed Canadians. On top 
of that, another $2 billion in cuts will be made to transfers to the 
poorest provinces, bringing the total to $7.5 billion. This was 
the crux the budget tabled last February, a budget which is 
totally ineffective given the present debt and unemployment 
levels in Canada. Not only is it ineffective or useless, it is also 
totally crazy, because we have a government that, just like the 
previous speaker, the hon. member for Ottawa Centre, is crazy 
to pretend that they are acting, when in fact they are doing 
absolutely nothing to deal with the debt and the unemployment 
situation. Not only are they refusing to do anything positive, but 
they are going after the unemployed, the disadvantaged, the 
poor, the weak, the women, the elderly, and that is crazy.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	That goes to show the evil side of the current Liberal 
government that picks on the weak in our society. It clearly 
shows the total lack of imagination of the government when it 
comes to measures that could be introduced to straighten the 
situation our country is in. The government has got no 
backbone. There are a lot of concrete, fair and equitable 
measures it could introduce, but does not, because it does not 
have the guts to act.
<P>
	Why pick on the poor and the unemployed like the 
government does in this budget, when we could ask healthy 
Canadian corporations to pay their fair share of taxes? Several 
thousand corporations have managed to stay healthy these last 
few years. And when I say several thousand, I refer to the 90,000 
corporations that have paid no taxes at all in Canada over the 
past few years.
<P>
	There are over 200 millionaires who paid less than $100 in 
taxes. These corporations and these individuals should at least 
pay their fair share, especially when the country is in the middle 
of a serious crisis, so serious in fact that it is attracting the 
attention of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is about 
to intervene because the debt in Canada is getting out of control 
and the government is ineffective. In fact, the money markets 
have reacted very badly to this awful and sick budget. There is a 
whole series of concrete, fair and equitable measures that could 
but will not be introduced.
<P>
	Let me give you other examples of how to take the fat out of 
government operations, and God knows there is a lot of fat to 
take out and the government is not doing anything about it. 
Duplication of federal and provincial services, what is usually 
called overlap, costs us an  incredible amount of money. In 
Quebec alone, it is estimated that such duplication costs $1 
billion because the province of Quebec is delivering the exact 
same services as the federal government. Not only is it an awful 
waste of money, it creates more problems. It delays the 
implementation of major programs.
<P>
	Take, for instance, manpower training, an area where an 
estimated $250 million will be wasted. Not only are we wasting 
this money, we are not providing any training.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, 70,000 jobs are available but people are not 
qualified enough to take them. Why? Because the Canadian 
government lacks efficiency and has no backbone. They do not 
want to move although the solutions are there; they prefer to 
take it out on the poor, the unemployed and the destitute. This is 
immoral and crazy. I could never be part of that Liberal 
government. I would be too ashamed to agree quietly to such 
proposals.
<P>
	This government is not even liberal. It has inherited the 
Conservatives' spirit: it helps the rich get richer supposedly 
because the rich will create jobs. This very old conservative way 
of thinking has no basis whatsoever. I have nothing personally 
against the rich but, in a society like ours, I feel that 
corporations and wealthy citizens must pay their fair share like 
everybody else. The poor and the destitute should not be asked 
to pay for the government's mistakes or for the fact that 
Canadian corporations are not taxed enough.
<P>
	This is a conservative way of thinking which borders on 
fascism, since fascism tends to widen the gap between the rich 
and the poor and creates a very unfair situation like the one we 
have in Canada today. That is what we see today: a lousy 
government which merely introduce bills on the back of the 
poor, the destitute and the unemployed, asking them to pay 
more, while the rich and the family trusts are well protected.
<P>
	Here is another example. The Minister of Finance has a family 
trust. Apparently, it is worth $40 million. Others have family 
trusts too. Family trusts in Canada are said to hold $80 billion at 
least and maybe twice as much. This is money that is not taxed, 
that the government does not want to tax.
<P>
	This government is crazy, because it is ignoring the Auditor 
General's recommendations. He said in his recent report that in 
the last three years, $5 billion was wasted by the federal 
government. We do not hear about it, but the government is 
going to take almost $5 billion from the pockets of the 
unemployed. It is forcing unemployed people onto welfare, 
putting more pressure on the provinces. It turns the unemployed 
into welfare recipients and it pretends that it is an aggressive 
measure. The government says that it wants us to move ahead 
with confidence, but I call that the Shawinigan Waltz: two steps 
forward, one step back, change direction, three steps back, one 
step forward. The government tries to solve the unemployment 
problem with an infrastructure program that will create 
temporary jobs for men, but it  forgets about women and young 
people. Moreover, this make-work project will be implemented 
just after the government raised the UI premium rate from $3 to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3019"> 3019 </A></B>
<P>
$3.07. The finance minister himself said that cancelling this 
increase would create 40,000 jobs.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I will tell you that the Shawinigan Waltz 
dancers are having a ball. The government claims that it wants to 
create jobs, but it turns around and does all it can to keep that 
from happening or it implements very temporary, quite 
ineffective measures. I say no to Bill C-17. It must not pass.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate having the privilege of speaking on the 
implementation of the budget that was presented for 1994.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First I would like to comment on the speech made by the last 
speaker from the Bloc Quebecois, whose specialty is the 
Shawinigan Waltz. I do not know if the hon. member is an expert 
dancer, but I can tell you, from watching him and his colleagues 
from the Bloc and from the Reform Party, that all opposition 
members are pretty light on their feet.
<P>
	The member from the Bloc accused members of the 
government of being fascists and of creating mass injustice. He 
also said that all Liberal members should be ashamed. Let me 
tell him that the members who should be ashamed are those who 
refuse to pledge allegiance to Canada and who are willing to 
accept a salary to come to Ottawa with the intention of tearing 
our country apart. I am telling you, members of the Bloc, that 
you should be ashamed.
<P>
	We are talking about finances, about money, but all you want 
to do is laugh at the Bank of Montreal or at credit unions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since the hon. member was not in the 
House earlier, I wish to remind him that he should address his 
remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> My remarks are about the budget and I am 
just giving my impressions of our discussions on the subject.
<P>
	The Reform Party is not being any more objective about the 
bill. You heard the last speaker from the Reform Party say that 
our youth program was a waste of money and that instead we 
should ask our young people not to accept jobs but rather to 
become politically active by writing to the Prime Minister, to 
the Minister of Finance and others, which I find totally 
ludicrous.
<P>
	I think that our bill is a very sound piece of legislation. We 
have a good budget that addresses two major problems. First, it 
addresses the national debt and deficit issues. The Reform Party 
would like us to shut down the government and take what little 
bit of money we have left to pay off the debt.
<P>
	If we did that, we would not be able to provide services and no 
one could pay a lot of taxes. The role of a government is to 
provide services to the community; it is not a private industry. 
Therefore, it has to address the debt problem and cut some 
activities, some programs. It must also create jobs, and we can 
see that the Liberal government is creating an atmosphere that 
gives hope to everybody across the country. What was lacking 
these last couple of years was hope; people were totally 
desperate. Young people, students, university graduates had 
become totally desperate for they had lost every hope of finding 
a job.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	We are now changing this attitude, changing this climate in 
Canada, so that graduates and even drop-outs can find a job. The 
youth program is in the works. I find that very encouraging and 
very positive. There is something positive after all. There are 
some budget items that I personally oppose. The budget is not 
100 per cent perfect. I would give it a mark of 99 per cent, 
perhaps, or of 98 per cent, at times, when I get up in the morning.
<P>
	I deplore the fact that the government has put a wage freeze on 
public servants, that the same wages that have been frozen for 
three years will be frozen for two more years. I truly deplore it. I 
also deplore the fact that employees will not be able to get pay 
increments. I told the President of the Treasury Board and the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs that I deplored the fact 
that public servants would get no wage increases for two more 
years.
<P>
	I appreciated the fact that both ministers promised me that if 
senior management could find a way to further reduce 
government expenditures, this two-year period could be 
brought down to only one year perhaps, or even less. I truly hope 
so.
<P>
	Although there is certainly no such thing as a perfect budget 
or a perfect piece of legislation, contrary to what the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois and of the Reform Party suggest, we are not 
going backwards. We are not taking two steps back, two steps 
forward, one step to the side and then one more step back. We are 
trying to solve problems, the problem with the economy of the 
whole country. Jobs have to be created. Temporary jobs, yes, and 
permanent jobs too, but for that we have to create a positive 
climate where people in the private sector can have confidence 
in the economy, take risks and further develop their businesses.
<P>
	It is not with the solution suggested by the Reform Party, that 
is closing down government, stopping all operations and making 
everybody jobless, that we will create a suitable climate for 
developing this country. And we will surely not do it by 
following the example of the Bloc Quebecois, with their strange 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3020"> 3020 </A></B>
<P>
way of twisting everything towards their own goal, to destroy 
this country. That, Mr. Speaker, I cannot accept.
<P>
	I will be pleased to vote for this legislation. It is not perfect, 
but I would surely give it a mark of at least 98 per cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member opposite just spoke of the budget inspiring hope in 
Canada and among Canadians. Heaven help us if he thinks that is 
what it is doing.
<P>
	It is both unfortunate and undemocratic that the government 
is forcing debate on the entirety of Bill C-17, the budget 
implementation act. Bill C-17 is an omnibus bill. Essentially it 
addresses four major issues and lumps them under one bill. 
Therefore it could be difficult for members to vote totally in 
favour or against the bill as I believe that each issue merits its 
own debate.
<P>
	Having said that, I will be discussing one portion of Bill C-17 
which deals with grain transportation.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-17 would increase production and the government's 
share of freight rates under the Western Grain Transportation 
Act from 10 per cent to 15 per cent for crop years beginning on 
or after August 1, 1994.
<P>
	A goal of the Reform Party is to change the way the 
agriculture industry is dealt with by the federal government. The 
movement of grain to export positions is highly regulated in 
Canada and that is an understatement, to say the least.
<P>
	Since 1897 when the Crows Nest Pass agreement became law, 
the government has regulated and controlled grain freight rates. 
It fixed and set freight rates western farmers paid Canadian 
Pacific to move their grain to what is now Thunder Bay.
<P>
	In the early 1920s legislation was passed expanding and 
extending the effect of the original rate set in 1897 to all 
shipping points on the prairies, to all railways and to additional 
destination points. In short, the legislative action in the 1920s 
was the most significant turning point in the history of the 
Crows Nest freight rates for grain.
<P>
	It changed the system from one governed by a two-party 
agreement between the federal government and CPR to one by 
which Parliament unilaterally imposed a national policy by 
statute. The industry has been paying ever since because of 
government regulation.
<P>
	During the 1960s railways began to absorb losses as the cost 
of shipping grain exceeded the revenue from fixed freight rates. 
As a result, the railways could not afford to make necessary 
investments in the grain rail system. The MacPherson royal 
commission on transport which reported in 1961 concluded that 
the Canadian railways were losing money on transporting grain 
at statutory or government set rates.
<P>
	In 1982 consultations with farm groups were held on 
transportation policies led by Dr. Clay Gilson. As a result, he 
recommended payments be made to the railways initially but 
over a period years these payments would be phased to the 
producers until producers received 81 per cent of the benefit and 
the railways received 19 per cent.
<P>
	One year later in 1993 the federal government's response to 
the transportation crisis was to enact the Western Grain 
Transportation Act. The WGTA provided for the continued 
regulation of freight rates and a subsidy based on the difference 
between what the producer paid to ship grain in 1982 and the 
actual cost of shipping grain in the same year.
<P>
	In essence the WGTA increases the freight rates so that the 
railways would have enough revenue to maintain the grain 
transportation system. What about the farmers? What does the 
WGTA do for them? Government payments to the railways 
would defray the cost to farmers of moving grain but producers 
would pay an increasing portion of rail costs over time.
<P>
	In the WGTA a system was born that has regulations 
regulating regulations. The previous federal government 
reduced the Crow benefit from last year of $720 million to $650 
million in the current year. The Conservatives planned further 5 
per cent reductions next year and the year after if Crow benefit 
payments were not changed to be paid to farmers instead of 
railways.
<P>
	The current government dropped the Conservatives' 
conditions and instead is proposing a 15 per cent cut next crop 
year. That leaves the Crow benefit at about $614 million, a drop 
of $106 million in two years. That means producers are left 
holding the proverbial bag. They will be paying more for freight 
while at the same time putting up with big brother, the federal 
government and its stifling regulations.
<P>
	I submit that the entire system is flawed, bordering on the 
absurd. The WGTA prevents farmers, shippers and railways 
from introducing savings into the system but at the same time 
with Crow benefit cuts farmers have to use a high cost system 
with less money to pay for it. The strangle hold that regulations 
have over grain shipping is squeezing the life out of many 
western producers. Farmers must put out more money for freight 
and severe regulations prevent them from using cost saving 
ways to collect and ship grain.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We are asking the government to consider introducing an 
entirely new piece of legislation to govern the way farmers 
move grain, a piece of legislation that is fair to the farmers and 
railways alike.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3021"> 3021 </A></B>
<P>
	The WGTA promotes provincial offsetting programs, distorts 
domestic prices and promotes railway inefficiency. It is also a 
barrier to investment in the industry. It is clear that something 
needs to be done.
<P>
	We advocate a trade distortion adjustment program to defend 
exporting producers against foreign subsidies on competing 
products. The program is all encompassing to the agriculture 
industry and would benefit producers by taking into account 
their individual needs.
<P>
	The program would include an automatic triggering 
mechanism based on the historic volume of exported products. 
There would be no producer premiums and legislation would 
ensure timely payout to affected producers within this same 
market period.
<P>
	It is important to vigorously support and defend Canada's 
food producers against the effects of matters over which they 
have little control such as foreign subsidies and trade distorting 
influences. What Canada needs is a viable market driven 
industry through the application of federal safety nets, programs 
that are production neutral, not commodity specific.
<P>
	Canadian producers need to be able to transport their grain to 
foreign markets without barriers. The federal government is 
only chipping away at the WGTA, thereby passing further 
financial burden to the producers.
<P>
	As the system now stands the backlog and confusion in grain 
movement are a direct result of the inability of government 
managed system to serve the agriculture industries. We need 
only look at the rail car shortage which is not only cutting into 
sales and costing farmers money but damaging relationships 
with important customers as well.
<P>
	Canadian railways are not meeting their unload targets at 
Canadian ports as required by WGTA. More influence must be 
placed in the hands of those who have a legitimate stake in the 
industry, those who rely on the agriculture industry to make a 
living, namely the farmers. They are the producers and must 
have greater participation in how the industry operates.
<P>
	The federal government is proposing to reduce its share of 
freight rates under the WGTA in the bill. By doing so the 
government is leaving farmers with the worst of both worlds, 
increased freight costs and a high cost, inefficient and inflexible 
system.
<P>
	The federal government has a good opportunity to change the 
way things are done in the agriculture industry. Surely it can see 
that over regulation is crushing the hope of Canadian producers. 
We need a single program to protect our farmers, not a mix and 
match of of programs.
<P>
	There has been some movement in this direction, judging 
from the recent meeting between the federal agriculture 
minister and his provincial counterparts.
<P>
	The government is only justified to protect Canada's 
agriculture producers from international forces as other 
countries are continuing to generously subsidize their 
agriculture industry. I urge the government to continue 
negotiating the GATT in an attempt to get international 
subsidies down so subsidies in this country can go down 
accordingly.
<P>
	We must work to make the agriculture industry more 
self-reliant, not only for today but for the future as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the sudden flare-up of interest rates could kill the 
economy which was slowly starting to recover.
<P>
	To help it recover, to really put it back on its feet again, the 
government should have given it a helping hand, but instead it 
gave it a punch in the face.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	We were waiting anxiously, but full of hope, for a recovery of 
the job market. But it is more unemployment that we will have 
because of rising interest rates. Has the Bank of Canada gone 
crazy? No, it is only trying to cope, as well as can be expected, 
with 10 years of mismanagement of this country. I will not pass 
judgment on its present policy.
<P>
	In the United States, France and Canada, we are now hearing 
the old economic debates are coming to the fore once again. 
How can we revitalize a sick economy, particularly with 
monetary policy? Galbraith, Sorman and others have, I am told, 
opinions on this subject which are as clear-cut as they are 
divergent. People also talk about neo-Keynesianism. I will not 
venture into this subject because whatever I said would surely 
contradict one of these prominent economists.
<P>
	You know what the argument of the Bank of Canada is, Mr. 
Speaker. For Canada to stay competitive on the loan market, 
Canadian rates must be higher than American rates. That is the 
result of our enormous debt. However, American rates have 
been increasing this past month to quell the risk of inflation 
there. Consequently, we are told, Canadian rates must also go 
up. Q.E.D., what perfect logic.
<P>
	The problem, as you know, is that the American economy is 
expanding rapidly. We are told that it will not be hurt by this 
dampening measure. The American economy has a little fever? 
Put an ice pack on its head. This therapy is quite defensible.
<P>
	The problem for us is that our central bank thinks it has to 
apply automatically the same medicine to our economy, which is 
anemic and needs a tonic. If we cannot raise our rates higher 
than the American rates, how will we find investors for the debt 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3022"> 3022 </A></B>
<P>
securities that we have to issue because of our enormous debt? Is 
that the financial independence advocated and promised in the 
famous red  book which will meet the same fate as Mao's little 
red book and be thrown in the garbage with its promises of a 
brilliant future?
<P>
	Do you know what it says in the Canadian red book under the 
promising title of ``independence''? I will tell you right now that 
the red book does not talk about the independence of Quebec, 
but about the independence of Canada from other countries. And 
I quote: ``A Liberal government will end the Conservatives' 
junior-partner relationship with the United States and reassert 
our proud tradition of independent foreign policy''. It is 
mind-boggling! In terms of financial independence, Mr. Dubuc, 
an editorial writer at <I>La Presse</I>, pointed out earlier last week our 
complete dependence upon our creditors. The way things are 
going with this government, our policy will be dictated to us by 
the International Monetary Fund tomorrow, and the pill will not 
be easy to swallow. Will Canada, which is ironically the most 
indebted and potentially the wealthiest country on earth, 
become part of the Third World?
<P>
	This is the result of a decade of unacceptably frivolous public 
management in this unfortunate country. We have accumulated 
the heaviest per capita external debt in the western world. The 
time has come to pay the piper. And we do not want to hear this 
government claim that it has inherited this situation and that it 
has no choice but to face the music. When did our external debt 
begin to rise really? The 1970s. Who was in office at that time? 
The same party as today. And back then, where was our present 
Prime Minister who takes such pleasure reminding our leader 
that he was once a member of the Conservative cabinet?
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	He was the President of the Treasury Board in 1974 and 
Minister of Finance in 1977, 1978 and 1979.
<P>
	I shall now come to the heart of the problem, the icing on the 
cake. The increase in interest rates will jeopardize the recovery 
and who is going to pay the price? The unemployed. However, 
who or what is being targetted by the pitiful attempts of this 
government budget to at least slow down the growth of our debt? 
The wealthy? Those who benefit from tax shelters? The federal 
civil servants who are responsible for duplication and 
overlapping? Ministers' air travel? Not at all! It is always the 
unemployed who must foot most of the bill we now have to pay 
in order stop the deadly increase in the public debt.
<P>
	If we are to go by what Pierre Fortin and his colleagues from 
the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the Université de Montréal 
say, the Canadian unemployed workers will have to pay for half 
the predicted new drop in the federal deficit, even if we take into 
account the budget for social reintegration.
<P>
	As mentioned in the same study, since the unemployed end up 
depending on social security, we are once again witnessing a 
transfer of the deficit on the provinces. We are talking of at least 
one billion dollars. The provinces,  in turn, will pass a part of it 
on to the municipalities, which will have no other choice than 
pass it on to whom? To Canadian taxpayers. We are back to 
square one. I know what I am talking about because I was a 
mayor for sixteen years.
<P>
	It is far from being decent, Mr. Speaker, it is most cynical and 
unbearable. Only the legendary patience of our two peoples can 
explain why no angry outburst has yet occurred among 
unemployed workers and welfare recipients as it would surely 
have been the case in other countries. 
<P>
	Social peace and the most elementary sense of fairness both 
call for a fair distribution of the sacrifices imposed by the 
situation. Since Bill C-17 completely fails to meet those 
conditions, I will not support it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today. Naturally, I will follow my party line 
in opposing Bill C-17.
<P>
	Why will I oppose it? There are several reasons, the first one 
being, and I will explain it immediately, my strong opposition, 
which is not unknown to anyone, to the closure of the Saint-Jean 
military college and military base. As you know, this will lead to 
the loss of about one thousand jobs in the Saint-Jean area. When 
we look at the provisions of Bill C-17, we realize that these 
people will be doomed to a life of poverty in the short or medium 
term.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to explain to this House the whole 
history of the Saint-Jean area, which has always been 
recognized as a very high level military region. Several factors 
can explain that, including geography. We are very close to a 
river, to the American border. When looking back at the region's 
history, we realize that the Indians, the natives, were already 
very much present, precisely because of its strategic and 
geographical location.
<P>
	Naturally, that was followed by the arrival of the French and 
the building of forts. As a matter of fact, my region is known as 
the valley of forts. Then came the British and their resistance to 
the Americans, who attempted to invade Canada. In fact, had it 
not been for that valley of forts, we would probably be American 
citizens today.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	What does Bill C-17 do in terms of the closing of the military 
college? As I already said, an incalculable number of 
unemployed people in the Saint-Jean area. I oppose it for those 
reasons, but also because it is an illogical budget cut that I will 
explain. It has been put forward in some arguments, and it is still 
being done today, that Quebec is already under-estimated, 
under-represented and under-budgeted in terms of national 
defence spending. I think that in Quebec, National Defence 
spending is 15 per cent, while our contribution is 25 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3023"> 3023 </A></B>
<P>
	Same thing for the defence infrastructure. Only 13 per cent of 
the defence infrastructure is in Quebec while our contribution is 
25 per cent. The budgetary cuts in this area, as a result of 
which-as you know-1,000 people end up unemployed, are 
going to widen that gap since officer-cadets from the Collège 
militaire royal de Saint-Jean who are going to leave for 
Kingston are going to be the source of additional defence 
spending and infrastructure in Ontario to the detriment of 
Quebec.
<P>
	The same applies to the military base and the language school. 
Given the circumstances, teachers would have to leave Quebec 
to go and teach in other parts of Canada, which would again lead 
to an increase in the budgets everywhere but in Quebec and 
widen the gap.
<P>
	You certainly know also that Quebec will do without the 
helicopter contract; in fact, we had asked the liberal government 
to cancel that program. This already represents on the part of 
Quebec a sacrifice of 1.7 billion dollars. Unfortunately, the 
government has neglected our recommendation to establish a 
fund for industrial conversion, which would be a better option 
than cutting UI benefits and which would allow people laid-off 
in the military sector to be retrained for positions in other 
sectors of the economy. Unfortunately, for the time being, that 
solution is not accepted by the government, which prefers to go 
after the unemployed with Bill C-17.
<P>
	I want to come back to the military college and say again that 
it is an illogical decision from an economic point of view. It has 
already been proven that in terms of costs per officer-cadet, 
Saint-Jean College costs a lot less than the two other military 
colleges. It costs $58,000 per year to train an officer-cadet at 
Saint-Jean compared to $71,000 at Kingston. We can see 
therefore the illogical situation created by the Liberal 
government's decision to close down a military college clearly 
more productive than other institutions.
<P>
	As regards the military base of Saint-Jean, you know that it is 
the most modern in Canada. So how can you explain that a base 
which cost $180 million will be almost completely shut down 
since its activities are going to be reduced by 75 per cent?
<P>
	These are issues we cannot remain silent about. In the case of 
the language school-and I have documents to prove 
it-Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Addy of Saint-Hubert wrote the 
following-and I have his letters here-to his brother, 
Brigadier-General C.J. Addy: Maybe the issue should be 
reconsidered because the solution will be more costly than 
keeping things the way they are. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, we are 
also facing an illogical situation here.
<P>
	We must also remember the historical context in which the 
construction of the military base took place. That is very 
important. It was built following a Liberal promise. At that time, 
there where three major projects underway in the Montreal area. 
There was Mirabel to the north; Place Guy-Favreau on the 
island of Montreal; and the base of Saint-Jean to the south of the 
Montreal Island. It is also illogical because these promises now 
lie broken  and it is Quebec and Saint-Jean that must bear the 
consequences.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	I will say nothing on the death of bilingualism because it was 
mentioned several times and I am trying to limit myself to fiscal 
arguments. However, the government had other choices to 
make. Take for example the ERYX missile project for which the 
total is now $212 million. At the time, the current Minister of 
Human Resources Development condemned that project; he 
disapproved of the amount of money the Tory government 
wanted to pump into it, some $11 million. Now the 
government's budget projections show that this project will 
reach $212 million. All this for a short-range anti-armour 
weapon system which does not even appear on the list of 
weapons required by the Canadian Forces in Bosnia. It is not 
even recognized by the UN as an effective weapon.
<P>
	So we have a hard time understanding why the government 
chose to close a college with a long standing reputation and to 
pump money into a weapon which produces no positive results 
except the squandering of public funds.
<P>
	It is often said that the Maritime Provinces are also victims of 
plant closures, but nobody talks about the fact that they want to 
build coastal defence vessels. Just imagine, Mr. Speaker, these 
would would be used to clear mines from our ports and harbours, 
as if the Russians were in a position to lay mines there these 
days. That in our view is an absolute waste of $746 million. On 
that point also, I think the budget choices of the government are 
totally illogical.
<P>
	There is also the fact that if the officer-cadets currently in 
Saint-Jean were moved to Kingston, we would have to expand 
the facilities there and we will still have to pay grants in lieu of 
taxes in Saint-Jean, even if the building is empty.
<P>
	A very interesting CROP survey concerning the city of 
Saint-Jean was published last week. It shows that the 
government is not backing down and still intends to close the 
military college and move it to Kingston. We think that the cost 
of adding to the Kingston facilities and laying off surplus 
teachers will more than offset any potential saving. This choice 
was not about saving money, it was not about bilingualism, it 
was not about culture, it was only, as I said before, about 
politics. This decision to hit Saint-Jean with the closure of the 
college was a political one.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that it was a reckless gesture 
and that the government is not seizing the opportunity to convert 
the defence industry. We could put money in a defence 
conversion fund which would help save military industries, 
while at the same time ensuring that such monies are awarded in 
a fair and equitable fashion across Canada, as it should be in the 
Confed-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3024"> 3024 </A></B>
<P>
eration we still belong to. If there are very few military bases 
and colleges in Quebec, it is because, at the  time, there was a 
trade-off for more military contracts. But with the changing 
international situation, these military contracts are going up in 
smoke. Not only that, but the few that are left in Quebec must 
have spin-offs across Canada.
<P>
	So, as you can see, Quebec is a loser with this budget and, on 
top of that, Bill C-17 hits it again. This bill victimizes the 
unemployed instead of setting up a retraining program for the 
1,000 people who will lose their job in Saint-Jean. Once again 
we are sidelined. The government remains insensitive to our 
plea. For all those reasons, I am very happy to announce that my 
party and I will vote against Bill C-17.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to raise a few points on Bill C-17. There are many 
problems with it depending on which area one would want to 
approach it from.
<P>
	Often we hear the other side of the House say they are 
concerned that the Reform Party does not support this or the 
Reform Party does not support that. This certainly is a prime 
example of what happens. They jam a lot of different areas all 
together. If we turn one down because there is something in 
there we do not like, they say we are against everything.
<P>
	I mentioned in the past how they did that with the 
Charlottetown accord. It was not just the other side but in fact all 
parties at that time. They had this huge, all-encompassing 
accord. Then after the people of Canada in their wisdom decided 
to turn it down they forever more are saying each and every part 
of that accord was rejected.
<P>
	Some people voted against it because they did not like the fact 
it was almost impossible to amend it. Some people did not like 
the way the Senate was set up. Some people did not like the 
arrangements for the province of Quebec. Some people did not 
like it because of the concept of aboriginal self-government 
with no definition as to what it really was. The aboriginal people 
themselves did not like it. Yet every time now that we come back 
to one of the issues in there the government says: ``You had your 
chance and you turned it down''.
<P>
	So it is with Bill C-17. The government likes to say we are 
against the individual parts of this, but of course we cannot be 
against the individual parts. We are not allowed. We either 
accept it in whole or reject it in whole. There are many areas in 
there.
<P>
	I talked in the past about the transportation subsidies. 
Unemployment insurance is another example where the 
government is saying we are turning something down that we 
should be embracing. The government in fact is twisting our 
very words.
<P>
	Under unemployment insurance they are dropping the rates 
from $3.30 to $3 and then we are chastised for making any 
comment against its action. The reality is they were the ones 
who put it up to $3.30 in the first place. Then they say a company 
with 10 people or 50-I cannot remember the magic number 
used-is going to save all these thousands of dollars with which 
it can hire new employees. The reality is that nothing has been 
saved because it was a charge imposed by the government in the 
first place.
<P>
	If it were true, and I pointed this out to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development before, it should have put the rate up by 
$3 instead of 30 cents and then dropped it back down. That way 
the companies would save 10 times as much and all our 
economic problems would be over.
<P>
	The reality is whether we should be debating the 
implementation of this budget at all. It is already out of date. 
The budget will not work. It has not taken into account the 
impact and the effect it has had on our economy already, how it 
has shaken the confidence of international lenders around the 
world. Our foreign bond credit rating has dropped. The stock 
market has dropped. Interest rates have climbed and our dollar 
has dropped. We are in big trouble and it started with this 
budget.
<P>
	It is time the government realized this is not a budget that is 
going to work for Canadians. Instead of debating this we should 
be setting it aside and working together to develop a new budget, 
one that will really work and one that will address the real needs 
of the Canadian public.
<P>
	We have to oppose the bill because it is the implementation of 
a variety of acts, some of which might be good but many of 
which will not work. It works toward passing an overall budget 
which itself is flawed and already out of date.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the position taken by my colleague for Mercier 
regarding the amendment to Bill C-17 which changes the rules 
applicable to Unemployment Insurance.
<P>
	Using as a base provisions contained in the 1994 Budget, the 
government has considerably changed the rules of the game as 
far as UI is concerned, without resorting to a special bill. I stress 
that fact, because the proposed changes are more than a simple 
change of rules.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3025"> 3025 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	This is the end of the redistributional effect of Unemployment 
Insurance. What people should realize is that workers should not 
be penalized for the lethargic state of our economy, especially 
when the government was elected on the promise that it would 
create hundreds of thousands of jobs and now looks idly-yes, 
idly, Mr. Speaker-at the waste of government money and at the 
sclerosis of its finances.
<P>
	Up to now, the government has refused to debate its fiscal 
policy with the opposition. Moreover, it rejected the proposal of 
the Bloc Quebecois to create a committee to study all budgetary 
expenditures. However, without any consultation, the 
government decided to cut into UI, without putting into place 
the means to help workers. Mr. Speaker, my question is to the 
Liberal members: Where are the jobs they promised during last 
fall election campaign?
<P>
	Now that Liberals are in power, do they not fear the mounting 
discontent among taxpayers? It seems to me that my colleagues 
opposite, high in their ivory tower, do not realize the seriousness 
of the situation. They have lost touch with the reality of the 
employment market. What we need is an economic policy based 
on employment. We do not need unjustifiable and 
discriminatory measures aimed at the less well-off, which leave 
thousands of families with no alternatives and no hope.
<P>
	As my colleague, the member for Mercier, said so eloquently 
in the speech she made in the House on March 25, the 
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act do not reduce 
the inequities between the rich and the poor of our country, on 
the contrary. The announced changes do not provide for any 
specific measure reducing youth unemployment. Finally, these 
changes do not cancel out the raise in UI premiums of workers 
and businesses as of January 1st, 1994.
<P>
	Several things bother me. What is the real purpose behind 
these changes in the Unemployment Insurance Act? Does the 
government really want to tackle the problems of 
unemployment and the labour market or does it simply want to 
hide its true intentions and have the middle class and the less 
well-off pay the bill?
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announced recently in his budget that 
public expenditure control was one of the main goals of his 
government. I agree that such a goal of fiscal consolidation is 
necessary and even noble, but I am surprised and worried that 
close to 60 per cent of the projected drop in the federal deficit, 
some $2.4 billion out of a total of $4.1 billion, will be assumed 
by the unemployed, who are 1.607 million in Canada and 
452,000 in Quebec.
<P>
	According to the Minister of Finance, at least 85 per cent of 
the unemployed will see their benefits reduced. It is easy to 
figure out. Is it not strange when one is advocating social values 
and equity, as the Liberal government did so well?
<P>
	In terms of equity, the government is making the unemployed 
pay the bill for its fiscal consolidation. That is an absolutely 
disproportionate share of the burden. We ask much more from 
the unemployed than from wealthier groups.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development announced 
drastic measures regarding workers who lose their jobs. He said: 
``The proposed changes prejudge in no way of the social security 
system reform. These interim measures were necessary and 
constitute positive steps. At the same time, we are making 
additional savings by reducing duplication''.
<P>
	What the minister means is that tighter eligibility 
requirements, combined to a shorter benefit period, will force 
UI recipients off UI and onto welfare. These interim, positive 
steps will cost taxpayers in the various provinces at least $1 
billion; Quebec taxpayers alone will have to pay $289 million. 
What do they take us for! Not all of us are wearing blinkers.
<P>
	Basically, the federal government is making budget savings at 
the expense of Quebec's 452,000 unemployed and Canada's 
1,607,000 unemployed. I am afraid that reducing the benefit 
period will be totally ineffective and that this measure will 
actually be counterproductive and fall short of the official 
objective.
<P>
	Increasing the unemployment insurance qualifying period 
from 10 weeks to 12 could affect many of the thousands of 
seasonal workers in the eastern part of Quebec, to say nothing of 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Sixty per cent of UI cuts will be borne by Quebec and the 
Maritimes, two regions where we find the people who will be 
most affected by the increase in the number of weeks required to 
qualify for benefits. In other words, the fishing, tourist, forest 
and construction industries will be the hardest hit by this reform. 
That is unacceptable!
<P>
	To wrap up, unemployment insurance reform reflects the 
Liberals contempt for the unemployed. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development admitted to pursuing the following 
objective: to force recipients to work longer to be eligible for the 
same number of weeks of benefits. As if the unemployed chose 
not to work!
<P>
	But that is not where the problem lies. So, it is not by 
tightening eligibility requirements and reducing the number of 
weeks of benefits that the unemployment problem will be 
resolved. Unemployment in Quebec and Canada is due to a lack 
of jobs for everyone and people have to go from one temporary 
job to another. The proposed reform will do nothing to solve the 
problem of insecure jobs, on the contrary.
<P>
	The government claims that the decision to lower the 
unemployment insurance premium rate from $3.07 to $3 per 
$100 of insurable income in 1995 and 1996 will create 40,000 
jobs by 1996. There is something wrong with that! Last 
December, this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3026"> 3026 </A></B>
<P>
same government raised the premium rate from $3.00 to $3.07. 
Moreover, this  Liberal government, by its own admission, 
eliminated 9,000 jobs on January 1 because of this increase in 
premiums for employers and employees. Is that not sufficient 
proof that the government's proposed reform is ineffective? And 
part of this reform is already in effect, to boot.
<P>
	What does the government really want to do with this reform? 
Are all the facts that I have just given you not enough to prove 
that the proposed reform is not appropriate and that it will do 
more harm than good?
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak in the debate on Bill 
C-17. I might point out that although I have spoken many times 
during the questions and comments periods of the debate, I find 
it hard to believe this is my first speech in the House. I hope all 
the folks back home in Prince George-Bulkley Valley are 
watching today.
<P>
	In my address today I am going to acknowledge some of the 
good points of the budget, which I think is appropriate. Our 
party is not here simply to criticize. Where credit is due we 
certainly will applaud.
<P>
	Accordingly I must inform the House that in our opinion there 
are very few good points in the budget, so a great deal of this 
address will deal with many of the problems in the budget 
generally and the negative effects that we feel it is having and 
will continue to have on the economy of the country.
<P>
	First, I congratulate the government on certain aspects of Bill 
C-17 which indicate at least some fleeting recognition of the 
necessity to curtail government spending within the public 
service and in the area of transfers to persons and provinces. For 
example, the government has extended an existing salary freeze 
for public service employees and has frozen the salaries of 
members of Parliament. I applaud that. The government has also 
frozen transfers to the provinces under the Canada assistance 
plan for the fiscal years 1994-95. As well, amendments to the 
unemployment insurance lengthening qualification times may 
encourage some firms to hire and may discourage the abuse of 
the system.
<P>
	On that point, it possibly would have been appropriate if the 
government had looked at putting a hiring freeze on the public 
service sector as well and let attrition actually contribute to this 
effort to cut costs in the public service sector.
<P>
	Clearly these actions could be representative of a step in the 
right direction. There is some indication that the government 
recognizes problems surrounding expenditures devoted to 
public sector salaries, transfers to the provinces and social 
programs.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is where the government's foray into the 
realm of reality ends. Despite repeated warnings from domestic 
and international investors there has been no significant 
reduction in government spending. Overall government 
spending has increased. The reaction of the markets in recent 
times reflects the government's continued neglect to address the 
financial problems of Canada in its recent budget.
<P>
	On April 22, 1993, the present finance minister questioned the 
Conservative government on its budget. At that time he stated 
that the Conservative budget was a stop-gap budget that did not 
address Canada's real needs. I suggest to the Minister of Finance 
that perhaps he should apply his past comments to his recent 
budget. In so doing he may just come to an understanding as to 
why the financial markets have reacted in the way they have. 
Quite simply, the budget brought down by the Liberal 
government does not address Canada's real needs.
<P>
	It is my opinion that the Liberals are on course to add $100 
billion to the national debt over the term of their mandate. The 
consequences of that will cause severe stress to our economy. 
Specifically it could translate into such excessive tax increases 
that the Canadian consumer will be left with a severely deflated 
disposable income and those who would invest in this country, 
the investors and the developers, would end up having a zero 
comfort zone.
<P>
	Our standard of living and our way of life would begin to 
become dramatically downgraded. The people of the country 
could be transformed into minions of the state, simply working 
to feed the government and its insatiable spending habits.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Some forecasters predict that government growth could be the 
strongest among the G-7 countries in 1994. I believe industry is 
looking to the government for stability in politics and in 
taxation so that as a result of the forecast it may begin to develop 
this comfort zone and take any advantage it can of any upswing 
in the economy.
<P>
	Unfortunately it is not the intention of the government to 
allow industry to have that comfort zone and it has been 
demonstrated in the recent budget. The government appears to 
be well on its way to being a major deterrent to economic 
recovery in Canada as a result of the budget. Nowhere is it more 
pronounced than in the budget.
<P>
	It is the opinion of our party and of millions of Canadians that 
we need serious cuts in federal spending if we are ever to 
transform Canada into an attractive country for investors. As 
well we need serious cuts in government spending and some 
clear indication that the government is getting its financial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3027"> 3027 </A></B>
<P>
house in order if the consumers of the country are ever again to 
develop any measure of consumer confidence.
<P>
	The government has introduced some cost cutting measures. 
However the government will still be running a $40 billion 
deficit this year. This is because it has introduced 18 new 
spending programs and 15 new studies.
<P>
	In the budget speech the Minister of Finance stated that 
people told the government it should freeze spending and it 
agreed. That is what he said.
<P>
	The minister may have agreed with that point but he took no 
action to implement it. In fact he did the opposite. Total 
government spending is up from $160 billion to $163 billion. 
Because of this action and the recent rise in interest rates it is my 
opinion that the government cannot possibly reach its target of 3 
per cent to GDP ratio in three years. It is impossible under the 
present budget.
<P>
	Total debt as a percentage of GDP has been increasing 
steadily over the last 25 years. In 1970-71 total debt represented 
21.8 per cent of GDP. Forecasting predicts that in 1995-96 total 
debt will represent approximately 75 per cent of GDP. By the 
turn of the century, if current government spending habits 
continue, total government debt will surpass our GDP. This 
would mean that we would eventually owe more than we earned 
in a year as an entire nation. I find this a national shame.
<P>
	Our poor financial condition is evident in some recent trends 
in the Canadian economy. The dollar has come under increasing 
pressure and foreign investors are withdrawing their money in 
response to the staggering government debt load.
<P>
	The IMF warned of such a situation last year. It predicted that 
the dollar would begin to slide if ``Ottawa and the provinces fail 
to cut spending in their upcoming budgets''. This is exactly what 
happened.
<P>
	The Dominion Bond Security Rating Service recently 
downgraded its rating on Canada's foreign currency debt from 
AAA to AA high. Dominion stated that it had no choice but to 
downgrade the rating since there were no ``meaningful 
reductions'' in the government's recent budget.
<P>
	This represents yet another harbinger that the nation's fiscal 
house is in disorder and could be on the verge of collapse. None 
of this has frustrated the Prime Minister and his government. It 
has not frustrated them at all. The encouraging news that I have 
just outlined has somehow prompted the Liberal government to 
embark on a $6 billion credit card infrastructure program.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Interest rates have been edging up as foreign investors see 
Canadian debt load increasing and as they react by selling off 
their Canadian dollar holdings. The dollar has lost two or three 
cents since budget day and as well the government deficits will 
continue at unreasonably high levels in the short term.
<P>
	The budget similar to the Liberal election victory is a status 
quo entity, that is if they do nothing and say nothing they hope to 
emerge undamaged by public scrutiny. Contrary to the claims of 
the finance minister the budget is just nibbling at the edges of 
the problem.
<P>
	The one area of spending that needs to be reformed and is not, 
which is the largest government spending program, transfers to 
provinces and persons remains relatively untouched by the 
government. Over 50 per cent of our budget is spent on social 
programs and transfers to provinces and persons. This huge area 
has been virtually untouched.
<P>
	Industry, investors and individuals are looking for signs of 
stability and thereby certainty of the future economic direction 
of our country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is the hon. member's maiden speech. 
I wonder if there might be unanimous consent to let him have a 
little longer to finish it. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am just about done.
<P>
	The budget was supposed to represent stability and certainty 
in the future economic direction of our country. Sadly, very 
sadly, budgets such as the one presented on February 22 do not 
provide any kind of stability or certainty. Continued deficits 
point to higher taxation, individuals are cautious in the use of 
their disposable income as they see it shrinking and as they see 
their job certainty becoming more uncertain and industry is 
looking south of the border for a more hospitable economic 
climate.
<P>
	The underground economy is running at about $70 billion a 
year. This all represents definitive evidence that there are 
problems with taxation on industry and taxation more generally.
<P>
	Alberta has recognized the negative effects government debt 
produces. Accordingly in its provincial budget it has taken 
measures to eliminate the provincial deficit within a few years 
and is predicting a surplus. Those people from western Canada 
hope that will work and they are confident it will.
<P>
	Other provinces and the federal government must take similar 
action. Rosy revenue projections are simply no longer 
acceptable. The federal government needs to take action on this 
issue and we need action today.
<P>
	I will just sum up. We in the Reform Party have been 
constantly speaking about taking action. The government has 
failed to listen to us. We in the Reform Party will continue to 
speak on additional cuts that the government has to make to its 
budget and we have been. We will do all these things in an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3028"> 3028 </A></B>
<P>
attempt to prevent the government's fiscal house from 
crumbling and come crashing down.
<P>
	The implementation of Bill C-17 and the budget generally 
represent the removal of yet another cornerstone of our financial 
house. It is on the verge of collapse and accordingly our party 
and I must oppose it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-17 is a direct result of the finance minister's great budget. So 
just about anything having to do with the budget will impact on 
Bill C-17.
<P>
	Instead of touching on every aspect of the cuts achieved at the 
expense of the unemployed, I will move in a more specific 
direction.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The cuts in the finance minister's budget affect the 
unemployed, seniors and, in large part, the national defence 
budget. The defence cuts were wanted by the Liberal Party 
before it took office; we in the Bloc Quebecois also wanted them 
so I will not question their validity. Of course, I cannot help but 
point out that the military college in Saint-Jean is not and will 
never be part of the acceptable cuts, let alone justified by 
economic arguments which, in my opinion and that of my Bloc 
colleagues, have never been proven.
<P>
	However, section 7.1 of Bill C-17, which deals with national 
defence cuts, seems vague and shortsighted to me.
<P>
	These cuts will translate into civilian and military layoffs. 
Under section 7.1 of this bill, payments will be offered or given 
to employees who have lost or will lose their jobs due to civilian 
and military personnel reductions. We must also speak up about 
staff cuts at the national defence research centres.
<P>
	Section 7.1 is vague regarding the duration and amount of 
payments to national defence laid-off workers. It is also 
shortsighted because it does not offer future prospects to the 
people who have lost their jobs as a result of the finance 
minister's budget.
<P>
	The old saying ``instead of giving a fish to the hungry, it is 
better to teach them how to fish'' can be applied at many levels 
in our society. Why, as the Bloc Quebecois suggested during the 
election campaign, did the government not implement programs 
to convert defence industries to civilian production, in line with 
the red bible of this good government full of good intentions but 
very reluctant to take action?
<P>
	When I see companies such as Paramax and Oerlikon after the 
EH-101 helicopter contract was cancelled, and also in the case 
of Oerlikon after the end of the cold war, I wonder what markets 
these companies can turn to.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I think that the programs under section 7.1 
providing for payments to those who will be affected by the cuts 
leave little hope to the many highly-skilled workers with very 
limited retraining opportunities, given our current economic 
environment.
<P>
	Where do we find in Bill C-17 an incentive to employment 
recovery? Throughout the campaign, the Liberal Party kept 
talking about jobs, jobs, jobs, but we find very little incentives, 
if any. Generally speaking, in life or in the private sector, when 
corrective action is taken in response to some alarming 
situation, you try to plan different options.
<P>
	What options has the government included in Bill C-17 to 
promote recovery? I have met with people in my riding and they 
do not speak highly of this kind of reform which does nothing to 
resolve the real problems. The gap between the social classes is 
increasing irreversibly. The middle class, which is the 
government's major source of income, is starting to wonder if 
the measures we take are not aimed at its elimination. Overtaxed 
and competing against the underground economy, the middle 
class could hardly believe the budget. Why were big businesses 
and trusts still spared, while members of the middle class, who, 
given the present economic situation, have started to join the 
ranks of the unemployed, were being squarely targeted by the 
government?
<P>
	I said previously that if you taught someone in need how to 
manage instead of giving him money, that person would become 
self-sufficient. Here is an original example of job creation 
incentive. My colleague from Joliette has introduced Bill 
C-230, which is an amendment to Bill C-17. This amendment 
would allow resourceful unemployed people to create jobs for 
themselves and maybe even for others. There are many workers 
who were employed for eight, ten or twelve years, who were laid 
off because of the economic situation and who, thanks to their 
entrepreneurial spirit, created small businesses, thus losing all 
the UI contributions they made over those ten or twelve years.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-230 would allow a worker who becomes unemployed 
and decides to invest in a small business to receive, over a 
certain period, 50 per cent of the UI benefits to which he would 
otherwise be entitled if he did not have the will and the desire to 
start a venture. The break-in period for a small business is 
somewhere between three and eight months. Such a measure 
would be an extraordinary boost to job creation!
<P>
	If a person who worked and paid UI contributions for many 
years does not have the initiative to create something, that 
person is entitled to UI benefits while staying at home doing 
nothing. Yet, if that same person has the will to start a business 
and needs help at the beginning, he or she simply loses 
entitlement to UI benefits. If Bill C-17 included measures such 
as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3029"> 3029 </A></B>
<P>
those  proposed by the hon. member for Joliette, I would 
probably support that legislation.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the bill contains no incentive; it merely makes 
it harder for the unemployed to survive and it will only 
accelerate the transition from UI to welfare, without any 
measure to help economic recovery. I have no choice but to 
oppose this bill and hope that it will be amended by including 
measures such as those proposed in Bill C-230.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about the budget. 
In particular I would like to say that as this debate has unfolded 
in the last few days, time and time again hon. members of the 
Bloc have risen and talked about what a horrible deal Quebec 
gets at the hands of the rest of the country.
<P>
	After the last such outpouring of emotion from the Bloc I 
thought it might be interesting to do an analysis, an 
investigation, and see how bad it really is. I would like to read it 
into the record and bring some edification to some of the 
members of the Bloc. Let me quote from the estimates of 
equalization for 1993-94 by revenue, source and province.
<P>
	An hon. member of the Bloc recently talked about the transfer 
payments and equalization and the fact that: ``We recognize we 
are the recipients of transfer payments, but we send a whole lot 
of money into Canada, into the national treasury by way of 
income and corporate taxes''.
<P>
	Let me set the record straight as far as personal income taxes 
are concerned. I will not go through all of the provinces, but I 
will if I may outline Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and 
Alberta.
<P>
	Transfer payments from the federal treasury to the province as 
a direct result of personal income taxes: Quebec is the net 
beneficiary of $1,529,700,000 a year; Ontario pays out 
$2,137,000,000; Alberta pays out $63 billion and B.C. $199 
billion.
<P>
	On business income revenues, Quebec pays out $78 million; 
Ontario $175 million; Alberta $245 million and B.C. is the 
recipient of $109 million.
<P>
	Let us cut to the bottom line. There is a whole stream of 
statistics here and any of my hon. colleagues from the Bloc are 
quite welcome to ask the Department of Finance for the 
information. They can get it by phoning the Library or the 
Department of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Estimates for this year have Quebec being the net recipient of 
$3.730 billion from the federal treasury. Ontario will contribute 
$3.946 billion. Alberta with one-tenth of the population of 
Canada will contribute $4.218 billion and British Columbia, 
$1.294 billion.
<P>
	I thought it would be worthwhile to put this on the record so 
my colleagues in the Bloc and the people of Quebec understand 
that there is a net benefit to Quebec to remain in Confederation. 
This is not a one-way street.
<P>
	The other point I would like to raise in conjunction with the 
debate on the budget is the changes to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act. I am speaking in support of the changes that the 
government has introduced and would ask it to consider 
extending them to some of the recommendations that were 
leaked in the press earlier.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program as it is today is not the 
program that was envisioned when it was first announced. 
Unemployment insurance today is a wealth transfer tax. It is a 
transfer of wealth from those who are working to those who are 
not working.
<P>
	That is fine except let us call it what it is. Instead of calling it 
unemployment insurance, let us call it a wealth transfer tax. It 
transfers that wealth from one part of the country to other parts 
on a sliding scale of entitlements and requirements. It certainly 
cannot be considered unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I ask members to consider the situation of an employee who 
earns $15,000 to $18,000 a year, has never been out of work, 
pays unemployment insurance on a weekly basis and has done so 
for 15 or 20 years. Contrast that with a seasonally employed 
person who might make twice as much money working six or 
eight months of the year. That person is then entitled to 
unemployment insurance for the remainder of the year. They 
already make twice as much money as the person who works all 
year long. Yet the person who is unemployed seasonally gets a 
ton of money from the unemployment insurance program at the 
expense of the person who works all year long and does not take 
any time off.
<P>
	Is it fair? We have to change the unemployment insurance 
program to reflect reality. Just as individuals may take 
advantage of the unemployment insurance program that exists 
today, so do businesses take advantage of it.
<P>
	If a business sees that it is going to have a slow time for a 
month, a month and a half, or two months it is very easy to lay 
people off and bring them back into the workforce. They can go 
on pogey. The employer has no fear of losing them as skilled 
employees because they are not going to find a job in a month 
and a half.
<P>
	When laying off employees the employer can tell them: 
``Don't worry, we will bring you back in a month and a half''. 
What happens? The unemployment program is subsidizing a 
business and their employee pool. That is not what it was 
designed to do. That is a business taking advantage of the 
unemployment insurance program just as some employees do.
<P>
	How do we go about fixing that? If we were to make the 
unemployment insurance program a pure insurance program run 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3030"> 3030 </A></B>
<P>
by the employees and paid for by the employees, there would be 
natural checks and balances  built into the program that would 
prevent abuse. If premiums were abhorrently high because other 
people were abusing it, it would not take very long for all the 
people who found themselves being abused to get in there and 
change it.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, what do we do in order to ensure that those who do 
not have the resources or the employment are looked after? 
Canadians are caring and compassionate. We are not going to let 
people starve in the street. That is a basic understood 
fundamental Canadian value.
<P>
	How do we go about ensuring that does not happen? I submit it 
is time that our country started dealing with situations and 
problems as they are, not as we wish them to be. If that means 
that because of the changing nature of work in our country and 
around the world people are going to be working fewer hours 
and getting more for it, having more leisure time, then we have 
to reflect the realities that exist.
<P>
	If it means that we are going to have to look at a guaranteed 
annual income then let us look at it. Let us look at these things 
honestly so that when we have an area of the country with 
extremely high systemic unemployment, people can say: ``I can 
choose to live here because I like living here. This is where my 
family has always lived. I am only going to simply survive. If I 
want to do well or if I want my children to do well I am going to 
have to do the same thing that my forefathers did. I am going to 
have to go where there are jobs and where the economy is 
stronger''.
<P>
	We have to deal with the reality of the economics in our 
country and around the world as it is and not as we would wish it 
to be. If we continue to look at this through the rose coloured, 
rose tinted glasses that we have been we will never start dealing 
with the fundamental problem we have in our country. The 
fundamental problem is that there are areas where the nature of 
work is changing.
<P>
	We know beyond the shadow of a doubt that the 
unemployment in the maritimes is going to stay high for at least 
our lifetime. It is tragic but the reality exists that if people who 
live in the maritimes or in any other systemically disadvantaged 
part of our country want to do better they are going to have to 
move to another part of the country where their children are 
going to have opportunity just as our forefathers had to leave 
whatever their home country was and come here.
<P>
	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to make these points. I 
wanted particularly to make these points about the value of 
Confederation to my hon. colleagues from Bloc from Quebec 
who are constantly reminding the House of how historically 
disadvantaged they are when the reality is they are not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, let me 
thank you for doing me the honou of asking me to replace you in 
the chair for a few moments. This is a true historical event in this 
House. Imagine, a sovereigntist, a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois in the chair! Both you and I, Mr. Speaker, will go 
down in history for that.
<P>
	I want to discuss here Part V of Bill C-17 amending the 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Talking about unemployment is talking about employment. 
Last March, in the Great Chicoutimi-Jonquière area, the 
seasonally unadjusted unemployment reached 15.5 per cent. 
These kinds of rates bring us back to the inability of our leaders 
to manage our primary resource, that is our human resource. 
Wherever you stand, you have to acknowledge that the situation 
is tragic.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The mechanism we put in place to counter fluctuations in the 
economic cycle really comes into play when we go through a 
period of high unemployment. That is when the Liberal 
government chose to send a clear signal to Canadians. It makes 
far-reaching changes to the unemployment insurance plan. 
Moreover, the government promised jobs. That was the main 
theme of its election platform, but it seems that the colour of its 
red book has been fading in the last little while. I see it turning 
from red to beige a little more every day. What are they telling 
us now? They are tightening the screws. Following the changes 
made by the Tories, the Liberal government is continuing to 
undermine our social safety net.
<P>
	The logical thing to do would be to create more jobs, not to 
dismantle the system already in place.
<P>
	Eligibility for unemployment insurance is reduced, the 
benefit rate will also be reduced for the great majority of 
recipients and the benefit period will be shortened.
<P>
	We are told that the government wants to establish a better 
balance between the period of employment and the benefit 
period. It overlooks some countries which do not follow that 
economic model. One cannot help feeling angry about such 
disappointing measures which show that the government is 
unable to create jobs.
<P>
	According to the budget, there will be a net deficit reduction 
of $8 billion in 1995-96, but only $4.1 billion of that will result 
from the new measures announced by the Minister of Finance. 
The unemployed are the ones who will pay for 60 per cent of the 
deficit reduction effort, that is, $2.4 billion of a total of $4.1 
billion. Even if you deduct the $400 million that the government 
plans to reinvest in order to help unemployed Canadians get 
back into the job market, their contribution is still 50 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3031"> 3031 </A></B>
<P>
	How can the government ask the unemployed to make such a 
large contribution? The government estimates that the 
repercussions on provincial welfare programs will total $65 
million to $135 million. According to three economists from the 
Université du Québec à Montréal, these changes will cost the 
provinces at least $1 billion, including $280 million in Quebec's 
case. Why is there such a big difference between these 
estimates? Who is telling the truth? The government or the 
experts? I think that the experts have more credibility because 
they are impartial.
<P>
	The government says that it wants to strengthen the 
relationship between work history and benefit entitlement. But 
its proposal will only widen the gap between the various regions 
of our country.
<P>
	By increasing from 10 to 12 the number of weeks required to 
be entitled to unemployment insurance benefits, the government 
is shutting out a particular category of workers who would 
barely qualify under the existing system. The increase in the 
number of weeks required to qualify for benefits essentially 
affects the Maritime provinces and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	By restricting accessibility on one hand and by favouring 
applicants who have accumulated a larger number of work 
weeks on the other hand, the government is forgetting how 
shaky the employment situation is in many areas. Moreover, it is 
not taking into account the structural changes that have occurred 
in the job market. Instead of adapting the unemployment 
insurance program to the new realities of the labour force, the 
present government continues to reduce the protection given to 
workers.
<P>
	The government has made up its mind, even though it 
indicates that these measures can be seen as temporary. They 
lead us to believe that the choices have already been made and 
that the broader reform of social programs will only serve as an 
exercise in justification.
<P>
	Finally, lessening the importance of the regional rate of 
unemployment in calculating UI benefits will inevitably 
penalize the regions with the highest rate of unemployment. The 
reduction in the number of weeks of benefits will hit hardest the 
regions with a rate of unemployment over 10 per cent, once 
again the Maritimes and Quebec.
<P>
	Indeed, eastern Canada is hit hardest by these measures. This 
is how an internal document of the Department of Human 
Resources Development estimates the cuts in benefits: $735 
million for Quebec; $630 million for the Atlantic region; $560 
million for Ontario and $430 million for Western Canada. Once 
again Quebec bears the brunt of the cuts. One cannot say that 
this is fair. Quite the contrary, regional disparities persist and 
the gap remains. Provinces with a high rate of unemployment 
will suffer higher cuts.
<P>
	Finally, the government is increasing benefits for 
low-income people with dependents. Their benefit rate  will be 
60 per cent, while it will be 55 per cent for others. According to 
the Department of Finance, about 15 per cent of UI recipients 
will belong to that group. That measure will require women to 
prove that they have the custody of their children and will 
necessitate the introduction of monitoring measures. Besides, it 
was reported in broad headlines in <I>La Presse</I>, on Monday April 
11, 1994, that the New Brunswick government wanted to require 
single mothers to identify their children's father; that those who 
refused would no longer be entitled to social assistance. Is the 
Liberal government, our government, heading in the same 
direction?
<P>
	The government argues that the changes will contribute 
significantly to job creation when the premium reduction will 
come into effect on January 1, 1995. The government has 
postponed until next year a measure it could have applied today. 
There is no doubt that these changes reflect this government's 
inability to offer a real recovery plan.
<P>
	In closing, I will say that the government ought to fight 
unemployment rather than the unemployed. And one of the ways 
to offer a real recovery plan that would restore a balance and be 
equitable to Quebec, Mr. Speaker, is to transfer jurisdiction for 
labour training to the Government of Quebec, with the related 
funding, of course. Quebec already has the expertise in this 
field, being the closest to its constituents. It should have the 
right to manage labour training programs for its workers.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to bring our concerns before the 
House.
<P>
	I would like to focus my remarks on the government's 
proposed changes to the unemployment insurance program. In 
the budget tabled on February 22 the government proposed the 
following changes to the UI program, some of which are 
included in Bill C-17.
<P>
	The government is rolling back UI premiums for 1995 and 
1996 to $3 for every $100 in insurable earnings, down from 
$3.07. It is reducing the benefits to 55 per cent of insurable 
earnings, down from 57 per cent. It is increasing the benefits for 
those UI claimants with low earnings and dependants to 60 per 
cent of insurable earnings. That is up from 57 per cent.
<P>
	The government is increasing the minimum amount of time a 
person needs to work to qualify for UI from 10 weeks to 12 
weeks. It is allowing more workers who voluntarily quit their 
jobs or are fired with just cause to collect benefits. Also, the 
length of time a worker can collect UI in regions with high 
unemployment has been reduced from a maximum of 32 weeks 
to a maximum of 26 weeks.
<P>
	Finally, the length of time a worker can remain on a claim has 
been reduced. For example, workers who work  20 weeks used to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3032"> 3032 </A></B>
<P>
be able to collect benefits for 17 weeks. Under the new schedule, 
they will only be able to collect 10 weeks of benefits.
<P>
	Those are some of the changes. The Reform Party is generally 
supportive of the changes proposed by the government. 
However we maintain that the government did not go far 
enough.
<P>
	On Tuesday of this week the leader of the Reform Party asked 
the Prime Minister if there would be additional spending cuts to 
those outlined in the recent budget and the Prime Minister 
answered yes. Yesterday in the House of Commons the Prime 
Minister and a number of his ministers, despite repeated 
questions from the Reform Party, refused to identify which 
programs would be cut.
<P>
	We maintain there are billions of dollars to be saved by 
returning unemployment insurance to a true insurance program. 
This means to protect workers who become unemployed through 
no fault of their own. That is what we mean.
<P>
	I would like to comment specifically on each of the measures 
proposed by the government and then put forward some 
constructive alternatives for the government to consider. We do 
not just try to criticize, but we also give positive alternatives.
<P>
	The government is to be commended for reducing premiums 
to employers and employees. UI premiums are simply payroll 
taxes and payroll taxes are job killers. This is probably the only 
thing I have ever heard all economists agree on.
<P>
	The government is to be commended for reducing these job 
killing taxes and restoring some confidence in the business 
community by assuring the rates will not increase for 1995 and 
1996. The government says this will create 40,000 more jobs 
than if it had let the rates rise, proving once again that lowering 
taxes creates jobs.
<P>
	In fact the government's own reports show that reducing UI 
premiums is a cheaper way of creating jobs than its own $6 
billion infrastructure program, most of which will be financed 
by borrowed money. That again will increase the deficit and the 
national debt and undermine confidence in the economy.
<P>
	I remind the House this is the same government that increased 
UI premiums by 7 per cent on January 1, 1994 and less than two 
months later announced a premium reduction for 1995. Talk 
about being confused.  This also shows the government can and 
will change the rules anytime it wishes.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The government reports that reducing UI benefits will save 
$725 million this year and $2.4 billion in each of the next two 
fiscal years. Again the government is moving in the right 
direction but not quite fast enough. The government's own 
budget documents show that the cumulative deficit of the UI 
account as of December 31 is $6 billion.
<P>
	The Prime Minister was silent a few weeks ago when asked by 
some angry fishermen in Atlantic Canada where it was written in 
the red book that the government would cut UI benefits. At least 
the Reform Party campaigned on cutting spending on 
unemployment insurance. The Liberal Party did not campaign 
on that. The government is finding out how hard it is to say one 
thing during an election and then to do the exact opposite once 
elected. Canadians will remember.
<P>
	Increasing benefits to UI claimants with low earnings and 
dependants is commendable. It is a recognition of the Reform 
Party principle that assistance should be targeted to those who 
need it most.
<P>
	The Reform Party was vigorously attacked during the election 
campaign for suggesting that universality was not financially 
sustainable. Now the government has contravened the sacred 
principle of universality. Will the government finally admit that 
universality is dead?
<P>
	As a final comment, the reduction in the length of time a 
worker can collect UI benefits in regions with high 
unemployment is a small admission that the current UI system 
creates disincentives to work. It reduces worker mobility, 
discourages self-employment, undermines personal and 
community initiatives and impedes productivity for employers.
<P>
	The Reform Party says it is time to use the government's 
initiative to phase out regionally extended benefits altogether. I 
would like to put the government's UI reforms to a simple test. I 
am going to call it the taxpayers' test.
<P>
	Question No. 1: Do the government's proposals make the UI 
program financially sustainable? Look at it. No.
<P>
	Question No. 2: Do the government's proposals help people 
become less dependent on the system? A little, but how many 
will return to welfare? The entire income security system is sick 
and it needs to be fixed.
<P>
	Question No. 3: Do the government's proposals reduce abuse 
of the UI system? No. Abuse is still rampant. For example, there 
are now 43 just cause reasons which will allow job quitters to 
collect UI. There are 43 different ways.
<P>
	Question No. 4: Are the government's proposals fair and do 
they treat all Canadians the same regardless of where they live? 
No. The UI program still allows people who live in uneconomic 
regions of the country to become permanent wards of the state.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3033"> 3033 </A></B>
<P>
	Question No. 5: Do the employers and employees who pay for 
the UI program with their premiums have a real say in how their 
money is spent? Do they have any say in that? No. The 
government should democratize unemployment insurance. Let 
the people who pay for it run it. That is the essence of 
democracy, not this top down bureaucracy.
<P>
	Question No. 6: Is the UI program a true insurance program? 
No. Unemployment insurance rewards repeaters and seasonal 
workers at the expense of permanent full time workers.
<P>
	In closing, I reiterate that the unemployment insurance 
program is still being used as a vehicle for social engineering. 
The UI program still breeds dependence. The UI program is 
overly generous when compared to other OECD countries.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will soon put 
forward an action plan for the reform of social programs. This 
review provides us with a remarkable opportunity to revamp our 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	I encourage the government to consider the principles the 
Reform Party has put forward to ensure that any future changes 
will pass the taxpayers' test.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, with Bill 
C-17, the government is asking us to amend 11 different laws to 
implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament 
on February 22, 1994. However, this budget, as could be 
expected and as was denounced in this House, is making waves 
in the financial community of this country because it fails to 
meet either the expectations of the financial community or those 
of Quebeckers and Canadians.
<P>
	This government had the opportunity to take some measures 
to put public finances in order, to put an end to wasting money 
and to eliminate duplication and unproductive expenditures in 
programs under both federal and provincial jurisdictions, but it 
did nothing. This government had the opportunity, as it has 
promised during the election campaign, to restore some hope 
among Quebeckers and Canadians, but it did nothing.
<P>
	Rather, the Chrétien government brought about a budget 
which deeply affects our economy-and, God knows, it did not 
need it-and thus deprives us of our hope for economic growth 
and job creation. Those past two weeks, we have witnessed in 
the financial community some reactions which clearly reflect 
the low level of confidence they have in the direction that the 
government wanted to follow in this budget.
<P>
	This government did not go in the right direction: the 
budgeted deficit has never been so high, reaching $40 billion 
and when they propose to cut back on expenses, they bluntly 
attack the most disadvantaged, the victims of  a recession they 
are fueling rather than fighting, they go after unemployed men 
and women.
<P>
	In the same budget exercise, the Liberal government is asking 
us to spend every day some $110 million more than the revenues 
it receives while the unemployed have to bear the largest 
part-almost 60 per cent-of the new budgetary cuts announced 
in the Liberal budget. In this regard, this budget is particularly 
unequitable and unfair, and when the government is asking us, 
through this omnibus bill, to implement measures so 
devastating to the unemployed, we must object to it.
<P>
	The government has announced a comprehensive review of 
social security, including unemployment insurance, and hopes 
to present a reform plan to this House next September. It is 
therefore unacceptable for the government to proceed with such 
important cuts and such drastic changes in the unemployment 
insurance program before the necessary consultations have been 
held and before this whole matter has been thought through.
<P>
	Whether it be the increase of the premium rate for 1994, the 
reduction in the length of the benefit period, the longer 
qualifying period, the two-tier benefit system which will affect 
85 per cent of claimants, or the lesser importance attached to 
regional unemployment levels, these measures have, in our 
opinion, been taken on the spur of the moment and have only one 
purpose, to reduce the budget deficit on the backs of the 
unemployed, in an economy where there are not enough jobs for 
everyone. Instead of helping to reduce unemployment, these 
measures only weaken the social safety net. By impoverishing 
the unemployed, the government promotes the degradation of 
the entire social environment in Quebec and in Canada and 
thereby activates all sorts of ripple effects on such things as 
welfare and health systems.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	If the government thought that the social environment in this 
country was bad enough to require social program reform, why 
does it further aggravate the situation by improvising such harsh 
measures for the unemployed? There were many areas where 
there is fat to be cut, but the victims of the recession have none. 
The Bloc Quebecois spared neither its suggestions nor its offers 
of services to identify areas where major savings could be made, 
and this, through a committee of this House looking at budget 
spending as a whole.
<P>
	But no, this government would rather pursue policies it once 
condemned. I quote: ``Conservative fiscal and monetary 
policies, as we have seen over the past few days, are having 
disastrous effects on the economy and always ask more of the 
poorest''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3034"> 3034 </A></B>
<P>
	We must not fail to mention one of the adverse effects of the 
bill: the shifting of a portion of the deficit burden onto Quebec 
and the provinces. By shortening benefit periods, the federal 
government will more rapidly divert a greater number of 
unemployed people towards provincial social security 
programs. According to three members of the Department of 
Economics at the Université du Québec à Montréal this new 
shift from unemployment insurance to the welfare system will 
cost Quebec an additional $280 million. The provinces as a 
whole will have to pay an additional $1 billion, approximately.
<P>
	Considering the government's promise whereby any social 
program reform affecting provincial finances would take place 
after due consultation, in order to get their prior approval, here 
is a good example of a broken promise. First the cuts, and then, 
the negotiations: what a nice way to instill a climate of 
confidence in future public debate and negotiations with the 
provinces!
<P>
	We must reject Bill C-17 out of hand because it is a rag-bag 
containing radical amendments to the Unemployment Insurance 
Act. Those amendments should have been dealt with in a 
separate piece of legislation in the first place and, most 
important, they should have been preceded by extensive 
consultations.
<P>
	In the present context, the unemployed in Quebec and Canada 
have enough incentive to find work and they do want to work. 
They plead for jobs in our ridings every day. Fraud, which we 
must continue to try to eliminate, accounts for only a very small 
percentage of costs. The basic problem is that there are not 
enough jobs for everyone as things now stand, and reducing the 
amount of benefits and the benefit period will not put more 
people back to work.
<P>
	The government has estimated that every one-cent reduction 
in contributions leads to about 1,300 new jobs. At the same time 
it maintains an increase of 7 cents in contributions, which rise 
from $3 to $3.07. In doing so, the government deliberately 
prevents 9,000 people from going back to work, regaining their 
dignity and taking part in the economic recovery. Mr. Speaker, I 
like to use numbers on a smaller scale, those of a riding for 
instance, since I represent people from a riding in the House of 
Commons. Therefore, if you reallocate equitably on an 
individual riding basis the number of jobs lost because of the 
stubbornness of the government which maintains the 
contributions at $3.07, 32 people are deprived of a job in every 
riding.
<P>
	You might say it is one case among many others. Maybe, but it 
was not so when we were elected or when our government 
colleagues got elected by promising jobs, jobs and jobs. Before 
we vote on Bill C-17, I invite my colleagues to think of those 32 
people and of all those who regularly come to our riding offices 
to tell us about their hardships and their dismay because of the 
employment situation.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while Bill C-17 contains a good number of proposed 
amendments to statutes with which the Reform Party agrees, we 
find that the bill covers so many disparate areas that it is very 
hard to deal with it. It was for that reason that Reform asked the 
Speaker for a ruling on its status as a bill.
<P>
	In any event, to the extent that the theme of Bill C-17 is to 
restrain government spending, we totally agree. Since it is so 
wide ranging I would like to seize one little area of government 
spending to prove that the government not only should but could 
cut back on its spending.
<P>
	I would like to delve into the area of official languages and the 
cost of official languages. More specifically I would like to 
address the issue of bilingual bonuses.
<P>
	The 1983 annual report from the Commissioner of Official 
Languages states: ``Six years and let us say almost a quarter of a 
billion dollars into the game any question of the real 
contribution that the bilingualism bonus might be making to 
federal language programs has been pretty much lost from 
view''. That is from 1983.
<P>
	Two days ago in the House was tabled the 1993 report of the 
Commissioner of Official Languages. Allow me to read very 
briefly from that: ``Unfortunately with regard to the issue of 
bilingual bonus it is obvious that the commissioner's repeated 
recommendations still have not been followed. This year 
approximately $50 million was once again spent without any 
assurance that the payment of such a sum was necessary to 
ensure Canadians of the availability of quality service in the 
official language of their choice. Given the present economic 
circumstances we are more than ever convinced that the 
bilingualism bonus should be eliminated gradually by 
negotiating with the parties concerned. In the interest of public 
finances, as much as that of the official languages program, it is 
high time for the government to take this problem in hand''.
<P>
	What does the government need to get the idea that it should 
take things in hand? I stood in the House two days ago and read 
from the same report to the Prime Minister. I asked him in effect 
what his government will do about these continued 
recommendations on the part of the Commissioner of Official 
Languages. The Prime Minister's response to me two days ago 
was: ``I do not think that the commissioner has made a strong 
recommendation. He has recommended we look into that and we 
will look into that''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> I do not say hear, hear. We have been looking 
into it for 15 years, 10 that the commissioner has put it on 
record. Where are we? The commissioners have advocated 
eliminating the bilingual bonus, not reviewing it again and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3035"> 3035 </A></B>
<P>
again. I put the Prime Minister's response  equally with the 
response that I received a few weeks ago from the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to another question, and I will 
repeat that.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The response that I get from the Prime Minister and his other 
minister is, I am afraid to say, irresponsible. It is too vacuous for 
the circumstances.
<P>
	There are millions of Canadians out there who are waiting for 
some sign from the government that the government is serious 
about its word on cutting back on its spending and getting hold 
of the deficit, waving the red book.
<P>
	This is not good enough. We have a tangible right here 
recommended by the Commissioner of Official Languages 
saying we can save $51 million in one year alone on this and the 
government says it will look at it.
<P>
	I brought up the case in the House of a new government 
information centre being opened in May in Bathurst, New 
Brunswick. I suggested to the minister of human resources that 
instead of employing 65 fully bilingual people at that centre he 
would give better service and save money in the bargain by 
employing essentially unilingual people.
<P>
	The minister did not respond, in my view, properly. He 
attacked me rather than coping with the problem or taking it as a 
suggestion well meant. He said instead: ``You are lucky that you 
have a touch-tone phone and are you not privileged''. His 
response I put with the Prime Minister's two days ago. This is 
part of the problem, I am afraid, that we have not just in this 
Parliament but in the running of the country. If we cannot stand 
here as part of the opposition and honestly put forward some 
ideas that we feel are of merit and have those ideas received in 
kind then where are we? It is small wonder that the electorate out 
there is unhappy.
<P>
	Before we talk a little more on cuts, to shortcut any vehement 
attack on me or the Reform Party I am going to reiterate that the 
Reform Party is not against bilingualism. We encourage 
bilingualism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We encourage everyone to speak French if possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having said that, we are against waste. Let us give bilingual 
services where they are required but let us also protect the 
anglophone minority in the province of Quebec at the same time.
<P>
	In the meantime, let us make cuts and cuts are indeed 
possible. Let me give a few proposed cuts on the official 
languages program. This is for one year. If we were to cut 
one-third of the transfers to provinces for education we would 
save $80 million in a year. We propose this on the basis that 
education is a provincial responsibility.
<P>
	If we also take from the Department of Canadian Heritage 
transfers to the provinces for special interest advocacy groups 
for promotion we would save $41 million. If we were to take 
from the CBC second language broadcasting budget, eliminate 
it totally, because that service should be market driven rather 
than driven by Ottawa, we would save $80 million. If we would 
cut out advertising in minority language newspapers we would 
save $5 million. If we cut from Canadian Heritage the bilingual 
bonus we have already mentioned, we would save $50 million to 
$51 million. On second language training and salaries for 
replacement workers we would save another $50 million. The 
total annual savings are $306 million to $307 million. It can be 
done. Would the government please look at it and do something 
about it. Do not just study it again.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I will make my concluding remarks short. I implore the 
government and everyone else to join with us, re-examine the 
Official Languages Act and look at specific things like bilingual 
bonuses. We can save money, be more efficient and be happier as 
a country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
economic region of the Montérégie is plagued with an 
unemployment rate that reached 11 per cent during the first 
quarter of this year, according to Statistics Canada. What would 
be the impact of Bill C-17 on the unemployment rate? That is 
what we have to ask ourselves to understand fully why the 
budget tabled by the Minister of Finance is an insult to all 
citizens.
<P>
	The Martin budget is based on bad logic. For example, it 
establishes a link between the problems related to economic 
recovery and the labour market, employers and businesspeople, 
and the contributions which help fund the unemployment 
insurance system. Furthermore, since the beginning of the 
1990s, unemployment insurance has become a program which is 
supposed to be self-financing. With Bill C-17, the government 
concludes that we have to bring back the rate of unemployment 
insurance premiums to 3 per cent. By doing so, they think that it 
will contribute 125 million dollars towards economic growth 
and job creation-as shown in Table II of the Budget 
Speech-and save 725 million dollars just in 1994-95-as it has 
been written in the backgrounder on the proposed changes to the 
unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Did the government ask itself what contribution it might have 
done if it had reconsidered other measures? We still do not know 
why the GST applies to essential commodities and not to stock 
exchange transactions. What we do know however is that the 
financing of unemployment insurance has been turned back 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3036"> 3036 </A></B>
<P>
twenty years. This program is more and more restrictive and out 
of reach.
<P>
	The government is again making the mistake of going after 
the unemployed instead of unemployment, as if those people 
had chosen to be without a job. The benefit period for new 
claimants will be reduced. There is another measure which will 
transfer to the provinces the cost of the government's inability 
to strengthen the economy. Where do the unemployed go when 
they have used up all their benefits and still have no job? They 
join the ranks of those who are forced to live on welfare. And do 
not think that these people do not want to work because they do!
<P>
	The Chrétien government was happy with the last Statistics 
Canada unemployment figures. However, it overlooked the 
number of people who have lost hope and have stopped looking 
for jobs. It also overlooked the figures showing an increase in 
the number of welfare applications.
<P>
	Another measure of retaliation against the unemployed is the 
minimum requirements for benefit entitlement which have been 
increased from 10 to 12 weeks of insurable employment. The 
government is really striving to reduce the total number of 
claimants on the books. Can such a measure help solve the 
employment problem? Certainly not. The resulting savings will 
cost a fortune. The Liberal government is only giving us the 
impression it did something; in reality, it has done nothing at all.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The government said that it wanted to encourage small 
business by increasing consumer demand. Do you think that the 
unemployed will be able to contribute to this economic recovery 
effort when their payments are being reduced to 55 per cent of 
their average insurable earnings? Even at 60 per cent, for low 
income earners with children or other dependants such as an 
elderly parent, people are still below the subsistence level.
<P>
	The government has made commitments that it is not keeping. 
Yet, it would be possible to straighten up public finances and the 
deficit, but it would take a major shake up with a view to 
establishing a really equitable fiscal policy. According to some 
experts, it would be possible to find $46.1 billion in additional 
revenues for the Treasury through fiscal restructuring only, 
without touching social programs, without attacking the poor 
who try desperately to make ends meet.
<P>
	Seventeen separate measures have been identified by 
economist Léo-Paul Lauzon, from sources as diverse as the 
Auditor General of Canada, Yves Séguin, Ernst Young, the 
Liberal Party of Canada, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Department of Finance. Among them, the two 
most important are the closing of fiscal loopholes which would 
bring $10 billion to the treasury, and the creation of a new tax on 
securities which would bring in another $10 billion.
<P>
	But the government did not dare touch anything which could 
have displeased its rich friends. However, it did not hesitate to 
do so when it came to the unemployed. That is the main reproach 
we can direct to the government, and Bill C-17 proves once 
again the public was misled by enticing election promises.
<P>
	In the economic region of the Montérégie, an unemployed 
person coming to an employment centre with 15 weeks of work 
to his or her credit would currently be entitled to UI benefits for 
30 weeks. After Bill C-17 is passed, the same person will be 
eligible for only 21 weeks of benefits. That is what the Chrétien 
government just offered. That is their initiative for economic 
growth and job creation. The government just cut nine weeks of 
benefits for this unemployed worker.
<P>
	Do the government realize what they are doing? What they are 
saying by this is that their management of social problems is a 
complete failure. They are saying to Canadians that they would 
be better off if this responsibility was transferred to their 
provinces. It is proving the Quebec sovereignists right. Should 
we go as far as to thank the government for doing us this favor?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am speaking 
today to oppose implementation of the Liberal budget which has 
and will continue to cause hardship for Canadians and damage to 
the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The budget will lead to a deficit of almost $40 billion added to 
the over $500 billion debt the federal government has already 
accumulated. The prognosis for ever dealing with this financial 
mess we are in is becoming increasingly difficult to even 
comprehend.
<P>
	It has now reached a critical point. It is not too late. The 
problem can be dealt with but it has to be done now by making 
substantial cuts in federal government spending.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Before the federal budget was released, the finance minister 
travelled across Canada in an attempt to discover how 
Canadians wanted government overspending to be dealt with in 
this year's budget. He received excellent advice from Canadians 
at these conferences. However, in their budget documents the 
Liberals merely acknowledge the direction that Canadians said 
they would like the government to follow. Unfortunately they 
failed to act on this advice.
<P>
	In the budget debates, Reform MPs clearly laid out their 
proposals for cuts in federal government spending. These have 
also been ignored.
<P>
	One of the first motions that Reformers put forward was for a 
cap to be placed on federal government spending. This spending 
cap would at least have given the Liberals a chance to meet their 
own deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP in three years as outlined 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3037"> 3037 </A></B>
<P>
in the red book. This motion was voted down by the Liberal and 
Bloc members.
<P>
	During the pre-budget debate Reformers tabled a document 
that outlines $20 billion in federal government cuts. There has 
been no indication that any of these proposals were ever 
examined by the government.
<P>
	Before, during and after the pre-budget debate Reform MPs 
have elaborated on our proposals for spending cuts which 
include approximately $6 billion in cuts to government itself, 
approximately $4 billion in cuts to business subsidies and about 
$9 billion in cuts to social program spending.
<P>
	The government completely ignored the message received 
from Canadians and Reformers during the budget debate. The 
early symptoms of the Liberal lack of action are now appearing, 
for example, the rapidly dropping Canadian dollar and 
increasing interest rates.
<P>
	These symptoms alone would not be a cause for great concern. 
However, what concerns us is the underlying problem of the lack 
of confidence in the Canadian economy. This lack of confidence 
has been illustrated clearly by Canadian banks in their hesitation 
to lend to small business.
<P>
	Lack of confidence has also been shown by private investors 
who are taking their capital out of Canada at an ever increasing 
rate. This is further illustrated by Canadian consumers who, 
with good reason, are not convinced their jobs are secure enough 
to spend freely.
<P>
	A further problem is the reality of the huge government debt 
which is increasing at an incredibly fast rate. It is quite possible, 
and many feel even probable, that Canada will hit the wall just 
like New Zealand did. If that happens the Reform's zero in three 
plan will be replaced by the Liberal's zero in three plan, but it 
will not be zero deficit in three years. It will be zero deficit in 
three months, three weeks, three days.
<P>
	This kind of concern is no longer just coming from Reform 
members of Parliament and from the general Canadian 
population. It is also coming from financial experts across the 
country. Warren Jestin, chief economist with the Bank of Nova 
Scotia, states: ``The finance department has to revisit its deficit 
projections and interest rate assumptions before the economy is 
a mess''.
<P>
	Sherry Cooper, chief economist of Burns Fry Limited, shares 
this sentiment. ``We need a mini budget outlining explicitly the 
cuts in government spending that will significantly reduce the 
budget deficit. The financial markets are demanding the cuts. 
We are talking about averting a currency crisis'', said Sherry 
Cooper. These sentiments reflect clearly what Reformers were 
saying following the finance minister's feeble attempt at a 
budget.
<P>
	The weakness could be due in part to the fact that the Liberals 
simply did not have time since the election to come up with a 
real budget. I encourage the finance minister in the strongest 
way possible to bring forward a mini budget in the next few 
months. Joshua Mendelsohn of the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce stated: ``If the rates keep rising, Martin will have no 
choice but to bring in a minibudget''.
<P>
	In the meantime it is essential that the Prime Minister and 
each cabinet minister give Canadians at least a hint as to where 
they will be making further cuts as promised by the Prime 
Minister. These actions will instil enough confidence in the 
Canadian economy, in Canadians and in foreign investors to 
hold off a pending financial crisis.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	To allow the Liberal government to make the changes 
necessary to balance the budget changes must also be made in 
Liberal philosophy. The Canadian mindset toward government 
has been changing but government has failed to recognize it. 
The Liberal philosophy of big government which was fostered in 
the sixties has changed. The Liberals must recognize this change 
and deal with the new political and economic realities we are 
now facing.
<P>
	This outdated mindset was clearly illustrated to me in a 
meeting I had yesterday with a Liberal member of Parliament. 
During the meeting he referred to the relationship between the 
Canadian government and farmers as a partnership. This is not 
what Canadian farmers want or expect. This is not a concept 
Canadians can afford.
<P>
	The Liberal concept of government so heavily involved with 
business is not working. Something else has to give. Canadians 
want government to provide the basic infrastructure that 
business cannot and the basic social programs and to foster 
changes which will allow a market economy to work well, 
nothing more.
<P>
	Mr. Albert Friedberg, author of <I>Friedberg's Commodity and 
Currency</I>, agrees that government involvement in the Canadian 
economy is stunting economic growth. He stated: ``The major 
problem is the rising size of the state and in the economy that 
chases an enormous amount of capital away''.
<P>
	If the government is afraid of making substantial government 
cuts, take a look at Alberta's current situation. Changes in 
Alberta did not happen because Ralph Klein and his 
Conservatives wanted them so desperately. They occurred 
because Albertans were pushing for these changes. Klein's 
government recognized that in order to get elected again it 
would have to make substantial cuts. The people forced their 
wishes on the Alberta government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3038"> 3038 </A></B>
<P>
	The Klein government would not have been elected in Alberta 
if it had not promised substantial government cuts. The Liberals 
will not be re-elected if they do not make substantial spending 
cuts.
<P>
	The Alberta experience has demonstrated this move is not 
only a move that is good for Canadians and is good for the 
country, but it is also good for the government politically. 
Recent polls in Alberta verify that Albertans strongly support 
the Klein government because of tough spending cuts it has 
made. I certainly have heard this loud and clear in my 
constituency.
<P>
	I know the Prime Minister feels that his great political savvy 
can accomplish almost anything on its own, but I believe the 
Prime Minister and the Liberal cabinet could learn a lot from 
Alberta in a political sense.
<P>
	Alberta is poised to reap the benefits in terms of jobs and in 
terms of a buoyant economy which will lead it and Canada 
economically in the future. Alberta's unemployment rate 
instead of rising during these times of cuts is actually dropping. 
Its economic growth rate is expected to increase by a full 2 per 
cent for a projected rate of 5.3 per cent which will lead the 
country.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I regret to inform the hon. member that his time 
has elapsed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
days ago I had the privilege to ask this House to accept an 
amendment to Bill C-17. My hon. colleagues decided otherwise 
and, as any good democrat, I accept their decision. That does not 
mean that I agree with this bill, and for the second time, I will try 
to explain my reservations to this House.
<P>
	Some of the wording of this bill leads me to believe that it 
would be premature to pass it. Let us take, for example, the wage 
freeze. I already said yes to the freeze for certain categories of 
public servants such as federally-appointed judges, 
parliamentary agents, the Governor General, lieutenant 
governors, Parliamentarians, and certain members of the 
Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. But I 
believe that it is very dangerous to remove any incentive for 
public servants and to prevent them from climbing the wage 
ladder.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	This bill also caps payments to provinces under the Canada 
Assistance Plan after the 1994-95 fiscal year. The Canada 
Assistance Plan cannot be modified without a national 
consultation and, for this reason, I found it premature, at this 
point, to cap payments for 1995-96.
<P>
	I do not agree either with authorizing the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation to borrow money. The CBC is a 
public corporation and as such should be funded by government 
grants and advertising revenues. With a deficit of more than 
$500 billion, this government does not need to authorize public 
corporations such as the CBC to borrow money, thus adding to 
the Canadian deficit. Anyhow, if the CBC chalks up a deficit, 
Canadians will end up paying anyway. So, let the Canadian 
government give the corporation the necessary budget to 
promote Canadian culture and inform Canadians but we must 
not authorize it to borrow money.
<P>
	Although this bill contains many questionable and premature 
items, the most questionable of all is the reform of 
unemployment insurance. The changes proposed in Bill C-17 
are unfair and will harm Canadians, especially in Quebec and 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The government proudly proclaims that the proposed changes 
will bring about savings in UI expenditures of $725 million in 
1994-95, and of $2.4 billion in 1995-96 and 1996-97. Does the 
federal government think it is doing Canadians a favour with 
such a measure? Does it really believe that it will create more 
jobs by lowering the premium? No, I do not think it will and I am 
convinced that this government does not think so either. It is just 
passing its financial problems on to the provinces, as it has been 
doing for some time. What will Canadians and Quebeckers who 
will no longer be entitled to unemployment insurance live on? 
On welfare, which is of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The results of this decision are twofold. First, the human 
person, and I often talk about the human person when I address 
this House, will lose dignity, because in addition to being out of 
work, they will no longer have the income to which they 
contributed with their premiums. They will face the problems of 
welfare recipients, despite the efforts of our provincial 
governments to make welfare less painful. Mr. Speaker, human 
dignity means being gainfully employed. As Félix Leclerc, who 
is from Saint-Pierre on Île d'Orléans in my riding, said, the best 
way to kill a man is to pay him to do nothing. With this bill, the 
government is not creating jobs, it is shortening the 
unemployment insurance benefit periods and forcing people to 
depend on the state for subsistence.
<P>
	Secondly, the changes to unemployment insurance will force 
the provincial governments to increase their welfare budgets 
and thus increase their deficits. That is what these premature 
changes will do.
<P>
	The people of Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, whom I 
have the honour to represent in this House, want to have 
something fine, true and real to hang on to so that they can forget 
the recession we are going through and the financial difficulties 
they have had to put up with for several years. The people of 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans are entitled to work  so that 
they can consider themselves full citizens. They are entitled to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3039"> 3039 </A></B>
<P>
believe in their elected representatives. They are entitled to 
hope that their representatives will find solutions for the current 
problems and prepare better days for the years to come.
<P>
	This House where the people of Canada are represented does 
not have the right for partisan reasons to pass legislation that is 
premature and unfair to the people of the Atlantic provinces and 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I therefore ask this House to reject Bill C-17 on second 
reading and thus permit the House to go more thoroughly into 
the proposals which were made to us prematurely in this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Wetaskiwin would have 
the floor if he would care to begin. If not, we can take a minute or 
two and go on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we may, let us go on without 
the hon. member being here.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This seems to work out well. I ask the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières to commence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You can start now for about two or three minutes and then 
resume later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your giving me the floor at this particular time. I feel 
privileged. I am anxious to discuss this government's lack of 
vision in greater detail after question period-because I will not 
have time to do so now, unfortunately. I will tell you about this 
lack of vision in relation to numerous commitments made by the 
government in its red book regarding the fight against 
unemployment.
<P>
	Last fall, the Liberal Party of Canada seemed aware of the 
reality facing Canadians and emphasized in a very convincing 
way-and, in fact, succeeded in fooling a few million 
Canadians, especially in Ontario and in the Atlantic 
provinces-that there were 1.6 million unemployed people in 
Canada, a situation which was unacceptable and attributable to 
the lack of vision, the lack of competence and the lack of 
political will of the Conservative government.
<P>
	Now we can see what kind of innovative solutions the 
government has come up with. It wants to implement an 
infrastructure program which will create 45,000 temporary jobs, 
while there are currently 1.6 million people out of work. Such an 
initiative requires a lot of imagination indeed. It illustrates how 
this government, which was wise enough to hire good freelance 
writers at the right time, does not have the wits to devise 
innovative solutions which would significantly reduce the 
number of unemployed. I cannot believe that unemployment 
will significantly drop in the Atlantic provinces with the 
creation of 45,000 jobs, nor with 15,000 of these new jobs in 
Quebec where some 800,000 people are out of work.  This shows 
a lack of vision regarding the unemployment issue.
<P>
	There is a lack of vision but there is also a lack of consistency, 
considering what is written in the red book regarding the 
reconversion of companies from military to civilian production. 
There again, the Liberals had good intentions, but we have not 
heard anything since regarding this issue, whether in the Throne 
Speech, in the Budget, or from the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Yet, there are concrete examples such as Oerlikon, Paramax 
and MIL Davie, which has its own conversion strategy. So far, 
the government has steadfastly refused to get involved and 
ensure that MIL Davie, among others, which has its own 
conversion plan, can get federal support with the ferry to the 
Magdalen Islands and the smart ship which would be used 
everywhere.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt, but the hon. member 
may continue after three o'clock. It being two o'clock, pursuant 
to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
statements by members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

similar to Bill C-201 presented by my colleague, the hon.

government of the day. The Liberals, including several 
ministers from the present cabinet, voted for the bill at the time.

members of the 35th Parliament entering the merge lane on the 
information highway, our government vehicle can be fairly 
compared with the Model T. Offices which are still equipped

efficient hardware and software.
<P>
	We are expected to govern in the nineties and into the next

we make the system on the Hill user driven by ensuring that we 
have the tools to communicate effectively. With more effective 
communications we can better serve our constituents.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week the Commissioner for Official Languages 
presented his annual report and with it we have heard proposals 
from the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois to cut back 
provisions in the act or abolish it altogether. The Reform Party is 
suggesting that official language rights should be put entirely 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	History shows that would be a complete disaster. The Bloc 
Quebecois supports the act for francophones outside Quebec but 
not for anglophones in Quebec. In this case there is a double 
standard.
<P>
	The purpose of the act is to protect minority language rights in 
Canada and provide linguistic justice to the more than one 
million francophones outside Quebec and the more than 800,000 
anglophones in Quebec.
<P>
	As the commissioner points out in his report, the act is not 
always applied as it should be and there have been some 
setbacks. Without the act and without the commissioner things 
would be much worse. We should work to improve the Official 
Languages Act, not to destroy it.

Speaker, yesterday, the Prime Minister and his colleagues from

incapable of understanding the legitimate aspirations of

consensus achieved in Quebec around the need to patriate all 
powers relating to manpower training.

separatists''.

Speaker, farmers have been very disappointed with the 
performance of the government so far. They have been ignored. 
There was no mention of agriculture in the throne speech. There 
was no mention of agriculture in the budget. The Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has been a virtual non-participate in 
the House so far. It is no wonder farmers have grave doubts 
about the government.
<P>
	The minister appears to be losing a war of words with the 
Americans. Farmers are worried and they have good reason to 
be. The government is giving in to unfounded allegations of 
unfair trade from our friends to the south. The <I>Financial Post</I> 
reported:

asking for more programs. Farmers are not even asking for more

the important contribution of immigrants to Canadian society.
<P>
	Canada is a nation of immigrants. The country as we know it 
would not exist without the struggle and determination of 
millions of people of diverse origin and background who have 
landed on Canadian shores in search of a better life.
<P>
	The bilingual and multicultural character of Canadian society 
is a source of wealth. Immigrants also contribute to the 
Canadian economy through the actual inflow of capital 
investment, the setting up of self-employed businesses and the 
importation of required skills.

willingly the privileges and responsibilities that citizenship 
bestows. As one immigrant Canadian I am both proud and

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. We were shocked to hear that this morning in Sarajevo, 
50 UN observers and 16 Canadian peacekeepers belonging to the 
12th armoured regiment from Valcartier were taken hostage by 
Serbian forces. This is indeed alarming news, especially for 
their families with whom we all sympathize.
<P>
	Could the minister comment on the hostage situation and the 
dangers involved, and inform the House whether UN 
spokespersons have managed to contact the leaders of the 
Bosnian Serbs to negotiate the release of the hostages within the 
next few hours?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his 
question and for giving me this opportunity to say that we deeply 
regret what happened a few hours ago.
<P>
	Apparently, attempts by UN representatives and by the 
Americans and the Russians to get all parties to the conflict in 
the former Yugoslavia to agree on a durable peace process has 
met with a number of problems. Although considerable progress 
have been made in negotiations between the Croatians and the 
Muslims, the Bosnian-Serbs apparently refuse to fully commit 
to this peace process.
<P>
	According to our information, our peacekeepers are not at 
risk, at least for the time being. Negotiations for their release are 
continuing, and we are confident they will be released.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know that a total of 150 UN peacekeepers have been 
taken hostage by the Serbs. I hope the minister is taking 
seriously the potential risk to our Canadian soldiers.
<P>
	Could the minister also confirm that negotiations between the 
Serbs and the UN spokespersons will not start until tomorrow, 
and could he give the House the assurance that Canada will have 
a representative on the UN delegations to negotiate the release 
of the hostages?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg who previously 
negotiated successfully with the Serbs are now on the spot. We 
are counting on their good offices to bring these negotiations to 
a successful conclusion. We believe that reason will prevail. 
Although the UN representatives are at risk, the Bosnian Serbs 
are as well, and in this kind of situation, there is no doubt that 
reason will prevail and that the soldiers and the other UN 
representatives who are being detained will be released.

take more efficient protective measures in order to guarantee the 
security of the peacemaking personnel while carrying out their 
duties.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr.

their responsibilities and their duty as soldiers to risk their lives

or risk their  security. It is part of their job. They understand it

<P>
	Quebeckers and Canadians were appalled by the scenes of 
slaughter and barbarism in Rwanda following a coup by the 
Rwandan army. In fact, the situation continues to deteriorate.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Foreign Affairs comment on current

the minister prepared to ask the UN Security Council to help the 
parties agree on conditions for a cease-fire?
<P>

Speaker, we deplore these unconscionable acts of barbarism, 
and we think every attempt should be made to try to restore 
peace in this country.
<P>
	Over the years, Canadians who worked in Rwanda have 
established close ties with the people of that country, and it is 
clear we cannot let this relationship be compromised by these 
events. When we are in trouble, we know who our friends are, 
and I can assure this House that Canada is prepared to continue

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister or the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.
<P>
	I think it is evident that the Bosnian Serbs are now retaliating 
for NATO's bombing raids on Sunday and Monday. What course 
of action does the Government of Canada propose if this 
retaliation continues or, worse yet, were to escalate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I beg to differ with the hon. member. He is drawing a 
conclusion that is not necessarily the right one.
<P>
	Quite clearly the bombing and the air strikes that took place 
were because there was heavy artillery against the city of 
Gorazde. This city was under heavy artillery bombardment. 
Indications were given that if it did not stop there would be air 
strikes. There were air strikes and we now know that the heavy 
artillery has stopped following the use of air strikes. It stopped 
the heavy artillery bombardment against the city.
<P>
	We believe these incidents are regrettable but we do not 
believe they mean an escalation of the conflict.
<P>
	We hope that good judgment will prevail and the parties will 
accept that the only course to be followed is to go to the table to 
negotiate a lasting peace settlement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for his answer.
<P>
	Whether or not these incidents are retaliatory, I wonder if the 
minister could tell us what specific steps the government has 
taken to make it clear to the Bosnian Serbs that Canada will use 
its status as a recognized peacekeeper to marshal world opinion 
against them and their supporters unless this type of activity is 
stopped immediately.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will certainly press for this type of message through 
the UN.
<P>
	The countries that are involved under the auspices of the 
United Nations are all concerned by this situation whether they 
are Canadian soldiers, French soldiers or other soldiers who are 
victims of this harassment. It is quite clear that we cannot allow 
it to continue indefinitely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3045"> 3045 </A></B>
<P>
	This is why we have asked Mr. Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg to

the Bosnian Serbs the importance of participating in the peace 
process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question. Various observers of the 
Bosnian situation suggest that UN peacekeepers there really 
have three options.
<P>
	One is to do nothing different than what has been done in the 
past and run the risk of the collapse of the peacekeeping effort. 
The second is to issue the Bosnian Serbs an ultimatum with 
respect to this form of harassment and be prepared to back it up. 
The third is to prepare to withdraw.
<P>
	Would the minister make it clear to the House whether the 
government favours any of these options or perhaps some other 
option?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Canada has renewed, with the 
support of Parliament, a further six-month commitment as part 
of the UN forces.
<P>
	Second, Canada is very active on the negotiation side and is 
trying through the diplomatic route to bring the parties to accept 
a peace settlement. We believe we are getting close to it.
<P>
	Some of the parties still resist the process of a negotiated 
settlement but if we pursue it diligently, if we do not lose our 
cool, at the end there will be a peaceful solution. That is the 
course we prefer.

question is for the Prime Minister. The Premier of Quebec said 
yesterday in the National Assembly that job training is, 
according to Quebec's traditional position, a basic issue of 
respect for our jurisdiction over what affects us directly.
<P>
	Given these statements by the Quebec premier, a good 
federalist, does the Prime Minister still think that Quebec's 
demands are mere whims?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> As everyone 
knows, a 1941 constitutional amendment gave the federal 
government responsibility over an unemployment insurance 
program. We have jurisdiction in this area. We use the funds we 
collect for unemployment insurance to help the unemployed 
receive education and training from provincial governments, 
which have jurisdiction in these fields.
<P>
	We want to eliminate overlap and that is why a meeting will be 
held on Monday. Several meetings have already taken place with 
Quebec and the other provinces to try to make the system more 
efficient. That is what we want to do.
<P>
	Both levels of government have jurisdiction in this area and it 
is very important to work together to try to find a way to 
eliminate duplication. As I explained in this House, it must be 
understood that unemployment insurance programs were put in 
place in Canada to allow the central government to use the 
money of those fortunate enough to work and transfer it to the 
unemployed in the provinces or in some regions. Quebec, 
unfortunately, is among the provinces that benefited the most, 
while Maritimers benefited even more. Canada has always 
operated by ensuring a redistribution of wealth in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister realize that, by reviving disputes between 
Quebec City and Ottawa on an issue that is the subject of 
unanimous agreement in Quebec, not only does he give his 
Trudeau-style centralizing vision precedence over the interests 
of Quebec's unemployed workers, but he also clearly shows to 
allQuebeckers-federalists and others-that the only federalism 
possible for them is one of confrontation and scorn for their 
people?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have been in office for less than six months. We have reached 
an agreement on the smuggling problem with the Quebec 
government. We succeeded in setting up with the Quebec 
government an infrastructure program that works very well. 
Other agreements have been reached or will be in the coming 
days.

we are looking for a reasonable solution. I know very well that 
no solution within our system can satisfy people who do not 
want to be part of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the youth action 
plan was announced several times in the media this week, so its 
contents are an open secret.
<P>
	Before presenting his youth plan, did the minister at least 
have the decency to first obtain the agreement of the 
Government of Quebec, since his apprenticeship program is 
another offensive in the field of education?

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, when there are over 400,000 
young people below the age of 24 unemployed, it would seem 
that rather than being critical and trying to poke holes, the hon. 
member should be trying to support constructive collaborative 
partnerships between all levels of government to get young 
people back to work. That is our intention.
<P>
	It would seem that he is engaging in the kind of debate which I 
think many people in the country do not find effective. What 
they really want is to get their sons and daughters and nieces and 
nephews back to work. That is what we would like to do in 
co-operation with the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, tomorrow 
the federal government will announce the youth corps initiative 
that will provide short term make-work positions this year for 
less than 1 per cent of Canada's 400,000 unemployed youth.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us 
why he is creating false hope by spending so much money on a 
program of such limited potential?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must be 
drinking from the same speculative cup as the hon. member for 
Lévis. They are making judgments about programs that have yet 
to be announced. The details are not there and the money has not 
been allocated. All that is there is in the fantasies or the 
nightmares of the hon. member.
<P>
	I would caution him that before he makes comments about a 
program he should see what the program is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
minister should acknowledge that he has great gaping holes in 
his own department. That is where this information came from. 
It is in the media and people have commented on it already.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister admit that what Canadian youth really want 
are real jobs, not phoney government created make-work jobs, 
and that the government's failure to address overspending is the 
primary cause of chronic high unemployment in the country?

members of Parliament of this caucus, the hon. Secretary of 
State for Youth and Training and myself have gone across the 
country and talked to thousands of young people.
<P>
	They tell us that when they come out of formal education, 
when they leave high school or community college, the most 
difficult problem they face is to get into the job market. That 
problem of making the transition from school to work is one of 
the most serious, difficult issues that young people face.
<P>
	Our purpose in putting forward ideas, as we did in the red 
book, about internship programs, the community youth service 
corps, is to give young people that first chance into the job 
market, to get the resumé, to get the experience and to get the 
work practice. That is what young people were asking us to do.
<P>
	It would seem to me that the hon. member should be standing 
on his feet and saying thank God there is a government that 
finally is going to do something about a real problem.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
government ministers and even the Prime Minister were puffing 
out their chests and bursting their buttons following the release 
of the latest unemployment figures. Yet, we are still not out of 
the woods. Taking into account the increase in population, 
Quebec would need an additional 215,000 jobs today to return to 
pre-recession employment levels.
<P>
	Instead of celebrating prematurely, will the Prime Minister 
not recognize that given the current pace of job creation, Quebec 
will have to wait at least another three years before employment 
returns to pre-recession levels?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our government has been in office for five months and the trend 
is improving. Last month, unemployment was down 0.8 per cent 
in Quebec. That is not good enough. More improvement is 
needed. Nevertheless, we are making progress. We must stay 
this course and that is why we are trying to introduce job 
creation programs. Such a high level of unemployment 
throughout the country is unacceptable and certainly no cause 
for celebration.
<P>
	We must never stop working to reduce unemployment. 
Unfortunately, the rate will not fall overnight. However, the 
outlook is very good and we must work doubly hard to ensure 
that we obtain ever better results in the years to come. I am 
confident that the situation will improve within a few months' 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I listen to the Prime Minister speak, I get  the impression 
that we are living on different planets. The outlook is not very 
good. The recovery is more anemic than ever.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister not recognize that since he took 
office, for every two jobs created in Quebec, another depressed, 
discouraged person has joined the ranks of social assistance 
recipients? Does he not realize that his outrageous scheme to 
reform the unemployment insurance system will only make 
matters worse?

report said?

	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Canadian agri-food industry against the other. He will not be 
trading one off against the other. Negotiations are going on in

They are reports from the press only and do not necessarily

States and that grain farmers will not be sacrificed in order to 
achieve a favourable outcome for supply management?

Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. The 
sovereignist option for Quebec includes a firm commitment to 
recognize and protect the historic rights of Quebec's anglophone 
minority and to enshrine those rights in the Constitution of a 
sovereign Quebec. Yesterday in the House, in a disturbing and, I 
would say, deplorable statement, the Prime Minister mentioned 
the possibility that francophone minorities outside Quebec 
would be denied their rights, should Quebec become a sovereign 
nation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. This is a hypothetical question. I would 
appreciate it if questions were a little more to the point. If the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister wishes to respond, he may do so. 
Otherwise-
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just want to say that last week, presidents of associations of 
francophones outside Quebec told a reporter for the <I>Toronto Star</I> 
that considering the difficult circumstances in which they lived, 
it did not help their cause when francophones in Quebec said 
they were prepared to separate from Canada.
<P>
	The French fact has survived in Canada because we 
francophones have all stood together since 1867, and that is why 
we are still francophones, not martyrs as members opposite 
would have people believe. The Leader of the Opposition said 
that in Washington, and he is a French Canadian francophone, 
the Prime Minister is a French Canadian francophone and so is 
our ambassador in Washington. They are telling the world they 
are martyrs. Let us be serious.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> If the

prepared to make a commitment in this House that he will 
reverse the budget cuts affecting francophones outside Quebec? 
That is what people are asking. If he really wants to help 
francophones, he should stop cutting their funding.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have provided very generous funding for a long time to 
francophone communities outside Quebec. There may have 
been a few cuts, but a number of other sectors in our society have 
seen their funding cut as well. However, that does not mean we 
are not committed to the survival of these people.
<P>
	I am glad to see the members of the Bloc want to support 
francophones outside Quebec. If that is the case, the best way to 
do it is to work within Canada with all French-speaking

be about to intervene, despite the fact that this material has been

over education?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration): </B>Not at all, Mr. Speaker. We discussed that 
yesterday with the standing committee. I made three statements. 
First, I said that, during the 25 years of the agreement, the 
government and the province of Quebec had done a good job of 
integrating immigrants.
<P>
	Second, I said to the member of the media who made the 
allegation that it would be a good idea for the committee to 
review this allegation, not investigate, but talk with officials 
from Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Third, I said that you could be proud of being a Canadian and 
at the same time be proud of being a Quebecker or the resident of

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to

activities on the grounds that they serve a useful purpose.
<P>
	I take in good standing the request to submit in advance the

do so in the future because there are regular requests for 
parliamentarians to go abroad to sustain the objectives of the 
Canadian government or to promote the interests and points of 
view of Canadians.

of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to resume where I left out before Question Period. I 
said that so far the main characteristic of this government has 
been its lack of vision. I was talking about the conversion of 
military industries to civilian production, something we have 
not heard much about ever since the government wrote about it 
in its red book, so much so that recently, no later than last week, 
the Quebec Minister for Industry, Trade and Technology was 
getting impatient and-no matter how federalist and Liberal he 
is, just as this government-asked the Canadian government 
what was implied in the statements made in the red book. And 
since then, in spite of his influence, this minister has not heard a 
word regarding three specific matters of some urgency, namely 
Oerlikon, Paramax and MIL Davie.
<P>
	There is another issue that brings to mind the notion of vision, 
if we can use that word, but in this case it is a machiavelic 
vision; I am referring to the Youth Service Corps. We know that 
one of the three objectives of this planned corps, which should 
involve 10,000 participants a year, is to promote a better 
understanding of Canada, and this, strangely enough, just before 
the Quebec referendum. We recognize there the consistency and 
the persistence of these same Liberals who were already very 
actively involved in the 1980 referendum and who used all 
means, from Pro Canada to the Council for Canadian Unity, to 
try to unduly influence the people in Quebec. Next time, they 
will outdo themselves, for sure!
<P>
	We find the same lack of vision and political courage when it 
comes to the information highway. We know that in the United 
States the whole project is being spearheaded by the 
Vice-President, whereas here, all we have is a committee in 
name only which, completely in the dark, is supposed to be 
advising the government. This exemplifies the kind of political 
courage and vision this government has.
<P>
	This is what was written in the red book, but things seem even 
worse when we look at what was not written down in its pages. 
The situation is even worse when you consider the actions of this 
government since the opening of the session, through the 
budget. I am referring to measures which were not mentioned in 
the red book. Indeed, when the government uses nice metaphors 
about modernizing, revitalizing or undertaking major 
initiatives, such as is currently the case with social programs, 
we cannot help but wonder about how sincere it is, about its real 
goals, and about the real motives of the Liberals even before 
they were elected, considering the measures they are now 
proposing to correct the situation.
<P>
	The government targets the unemployed instead of 
unemployment; it targets the poor instead of poverty. Indeed, 
the government targets the poor when it decides to lower UI 
benefits from 57 per cent to 55 per cent, a measure which will 
affect 85 per cent of claimants.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The government is targeting the unemployed, when it decides 
they will need 12 weeks instead of 10 to be eligible for 
unemployment insurance. Does this mean that from now on 
employers, in a show of social solidarity, will hire five, ten, 
fifteen, twenty, twenty-four, fifty, eighty, or a hundred 
employees for an extra two weeks so they can get their 
unemployment insurance benefits? That is not how it works. An 
employer needs an employee for a certain period, especially in 
disadvantaged regions, and unemployment insurance criteria 
are not a consideration when hiring people.
<P>
	We should also realize that because of the latest amendments 
to the Unemployment Insurance Act, people will receive less 
money for shorter periods of time. So the government is 
deliberately targeting people who work and often live in 
unenviable circumstances. The government has decided that 
from now on, they will receive less and receive it for shorter 
periods, although they will have to work longer to be eligible. If 
this is not hitting the unemployed instead of unemployment I 
would like to know what is.
<P>
	If we consider the amendments to the Unemployment 
Insurance Act and if we recall the government's stated intention 
to modernize and revitalize social programs, is it any wonder we 
are extremely concerned about the government's underlying 
motives for making such sweeping changes in the 
administration of social programs and the whole concept of 
government intervention in this area, especially when we 
consider the following. Let me explain. In spite of consultations 
that were held and others that will be held by the minister on this 
subject in the months to come, we know, and this was made clear 
in the Budget speech, that this modernizing and revitalizing will 
save the public purse $7.5 billion at the expense of the most 
vulnerable members of our society, with more than $5 billion 
resulting from amendments to the Unemployment Insurance 
Act.
<P>
	When discussing these issues, we must not forget we are 
talking about fellow citizens and the conditions in which they 
live. We must realize that across this country, hundreds of 
thousands of Canadian men and women are living in a state of 
anxiety and poverty. We know how such conditions can lead to 
criminal activity, family violence, undue reliance on 
medication, malnutrition in children, and so forth.
<P>
	I must say that I deplore the apparent lack of concern shown 
by many members opposite, including the Prime Minister, about 
a situation that is so disturbing and I would ask them to make 
cabinet members realize that something must be done to find 
intelligent and effective ways to improve the lives of these 
people. I think we can all say the unemployment rates in our 
ridings are intolerable, for instance in the Maritimes and Que-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3052"> 3052 </A></B>
<P>
bec, where levels are totally unacceptable, in Ontario, which is 
experiencing problems, and even in western Canada.
<P>
	However, we should talk about the causes as well as the 
effects. In this kind of debate, which is a debate about the kind of 
society we want, one issue is particular important, and that is 
that in a few years, our society may start to resemble what we see 
in other so-called underdeveloped countries, where there are a 
wealthy few in a sea of poverty and a fast-disappearing middle 
class. I think that is something we should consider, namely, the 
kind of social structure we have and the kind of society we can 
expect in the future.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to quote briefly what was said by 
an economist at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. 
André Joyal, a resident of my riding whose work I admire, wrote 
the following in the Catholic magazine RND: ``What we have 
experienced for the past 20 years is probably not, as is often 
said, just another economic cycle, but a thorough transformation 
of our society. A transformation as drastic as that caused by the 
steam engine in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries or by 
the agrarian revolution 10,000 years ago when our ancestors 
realized they could sow and harvest crops, which meant they 
could have permanent settlements. The society of tomorrow 
may be totally different from the one we know today''.
<P>
	In the same vein Louis O'Neil, a distinguished professor at 
Laval University, wrote the following: ``There is no reason why 
we should accept, without further analysis, the disappearance of 
thousands of jobs, today's exclusion after yesterday's 
exploitation, job uncertainty, the dismantling of health care 
services, a return to inequality of access to knowledge, the 
pauperization of rural areas, and regional population loss. We 
have the right and the duty to oppose a return to unbridled 
capitalism, to a system which currently puts 35 million people 
out of work in industrialized countries and which triggers 
disintegration and impoverishment.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on Bill C-17 today. I am 
going to speak for a moment or two on debt.
<P>
	In 1993-94 we all know that the provincial, federal and 
municipal debt amounts to some $660 billion. This is an 
increase of about 11 per cent over last year and it is quite a 
startling number.
<P>
	Put another way, this amounts to some $23,000 for every man, 
woman and child in the country. The net federal public debt 
amounts to some $500 billion and that is an increase over last 
year of some $45 billion or again around 10 per cent.
<P>
	Federal debt divided equally among Canadians comes to some 
$17,600 per person. The federal debt is increasing at the rate of 
$123 million a day. This amounts to some $6,200 per year for a 
family of four. To put this another way, the debt amounts to 93 
per cent of our GDP at the present time. Ten years ago it  
amounted to around 50 per cent. It nearly doubled as a 
percentage of the GDP in 10 years' time.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the Vancouver Board of Trade, which has 
done a considerable amount to draw the Canadian public's 
attention to the debt situation, has placed its debt clock to work 
out that if the debt, rounded off to $.5 billion, were converted to 
hundred dollar bills there would, believe it or not, be enough to 
cover the Trans-Canada highway from Vancouver to Ottawa.
<P>
	If this deficit were reduced to zero, the average employed 
person in Canada would see their taxes reduced by about $3,000 
a year. Bill C-17 deals with budgetary measures and certainly 
unemployment insurance. To me this reduction in the taxation is 
one of the best things that we can do to reduce unemployment in 
Canada.
<P>
	A recent Canadian Chamber of Commerce survey showed that 
if the debt and deficit were reduced, payroll taxes and corporate 
tax rates lowered, government regulatory burdens eased and 
training and education of the labour force improved, small 
Canadian businesses, any business under 100 employees, would 
be able to create jobs at the rate of 14 jobs per firm for the next 
three years. This is certainly another recipe for the reduction of 
unemployment in Canada.
<P>
	The budget has simply nibbled at the edges of the 
unemployment insurance program. By reducing the generosity 
of this program, certainly I have to give the government credit 
for making a step in the right direction. After all, we are aware 
that over generous unemployment insurance programs do have 
the effect of increasing the number of people on UI, not 
decreasing, not putting a lot of people to work. The number of 
people on UI has increased as the debt ratio has increased.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We all know that the cumulative deficit in the unemployment 
insurance account is in the neighbourhood of $6 billion. We also 
know that it is a fallacy to believe that this is an 
employer-employee funded program and that $6 billion has to 
be picked up by the taxpayer of Canada. We pay the shortfall.
<P>
	I have said in the House before that the Canadian 
unemployment insurance plan has become an inefficient income 
supplement plan rather than social insurance. We need to take 
the ``un'' out of unemployment insurance. We should come up 
with a scheme of employment insurance with extra emphasis on 
insurance.
<P>
	The Reform Party's policy is to make employment insurance a 
sensible, sustainable program of social insurance which 
provides compensation for temporary loss of employment. We 
believe the program should be funded by employers and the 
employee and the level of premiums and benefits determined by 
the employer and the employee. This, I am sure, would also go a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3053"> 3053 </A></B>
<P>
long way to reducing the burgeoning underground economy and 
ultimately relieving the tax burden of Canadians.
<P>
	Stephen Van Houten, president of the Canadian 
Manufacturers Association, has extrapolated today's figures to 
come up with a prediction that if the federal debt continues to 
grow at the present rate, by the year 2001 and we will hit the $1 
trillion mark. He has also predicted that when we hit the $1 
trillion mark our deficit will be in the range of $60 billion to $70 
billion. Should it remain the same, the interest on that amount of 
money would amount to some $76 billion, and that is roughly 
double what we have today. In my opinion that would be 
extremely crippling to the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I am convinced that percentage of after tax income has 
decreased, and yet at the same time the same government that 
allowed the debt to escalate to half a billion dollars continues 
along the same path. Really when questioned or pressed on it the 
Prime Minister even makes remarks about that line of 
questioning being irrelevant. It is extremely relevant and we 
look forward to the day when we can reduce taxation and have a 
stimulative effect on our economy.
<P>
	Economic growth is hampered by high social spending. As we 
all know, high social spending is also accompanied by high 
levels of taxation.
<P>
	If Canadians were relieved of this burden of high government 
debt and taxation and government intervention through 
excessive regulation, I believe Canadians would be motivated to 
work harder and to save more and invest more and ultimately 
hire more workers.
<P>
	Investors would be clamouring to invest in Canada and to set 
up business here. It is high time that Canada was open for 
business and took on that posture.
<P>
	We noticed the other day that when the Prime Minister did 
announce that he was willing to make further budget cuts there 
was a dramatic change in the markets. The dollar went up and 
the interest rate went down. I really felt quite heartened by all 
this.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Just the other day I noticed in the <I>Financial Post</I> the headline: 
``Deficit rattles investors''. To say the least it would rattle them.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is time to change this budgetary process and 
admit that we do have a spending problem in Canada. This is not 
a problem that can be solved strictly by revenue.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
believe that the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans spoke just before Question 
Period. So, unless an hon. member from the Liberal Party wishes 
to speak at this time, I would ask that you give me the floor.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Well then, the Chair 
recognizes the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Wetaskiwin for his remarks on Bill C-17. He made 
several worthwhile points, some of which I will raise myself in a 
moment.
<P>
	Let me just say that today is an historic day because this 
morning, for the very first time, the Chair was occupied by a 
sovereignist member of Parliament, namely my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois and member for Chicoutimi. Having 
said this and extended my congratulations to him, I would like to 
speak to Bill C-17.
<P>
	As history has it, Nero played the fiddle while Rome burned. 
This government is doing the same thing. While the country is 
crumbling down, while the poor get poorer and the unemployed 
despair of finding work, while middle-income individuals and 
families see their tax burden grow heavier and heavier, the 
government does nothing. Just like the previous government. 
You would almost think that they fit in the same shoes. This 
government certainly took no time to adopt the same pattern as 
its predecessor. My friend the member for Frontenac was 
mentioning that these shoes are probably Kodiak boots because 
we are not out of the woods yet with the current policies of this 
federal Liberal government which acts the same way as the 
Mulroney-Campbell administration did from 1984. That is to 
say doing so very little. Words, words, words. They are all 
words, but no action. None at all! The only movement we see in 
this House is when the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
walks from the table to his seat once in a while. Very little is 
actually accomplished.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member who spoke before me, the hon. 
member for Wetaskiwin, when he says that the key to economic 
recovery in Canada and in Quebec as well is small business. We 
have relied on big business, like Hyundai in Bromont, for too 
long. Great hopes had been placed on businesses like this one 
which is now in a very precarious situation to say the least, on 
the verge of shutting down and laying off its workers. So, the 
small and medium-sized businesses responsible for creating 80 
to 85 per cent of jobs are really undervalued, underestimated and 
undersupported in the projects they can initiate.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	We see it at our constituency offices when a small 
businessman or businesswoman comes to us with a proposal to 
create two, three or four jobs. It is hard to get the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3054"> 3054 </A></B>
<P>
interested in setting up or improving a small business. It still 
likes to think big, an approach that  harkens back to Mr. 
Trudeau's era. And look where that Trudeau-style vision got us.
<P>
	Our economy is in ruins. Our debt currently tops the $500 
billion mark. Of course, the Mulroney-Campbell administration 
has been blamed for the situation, but previous Liberal 
administrations were responsible for fuelling the debt crisis in 
the first place. It should be noted that when the Conservatives 
took office in 1984, the national debt already totalled $189 
billion. The red ink was already flowing freely. In fact, several 
bottles had already been used up.
<P>
	The budget measures now on the table offer no help to small 
business, no help to middle income families, no help to 
individuals as far as housing is concerned. There are no real 
measures to provide social housing assistance to low income 
families forced to spend more and more on housing. As Bernard 
Derome said, if the trend continues, low income families will no 
longer be able to afford proper housing. What the government 
needs to do is reintroduce a real social housing policy.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> At least I am being applauded by my colleague 
from Laurentides, as well as my colleagues from 
Berthier-Montcalm, Lévis, Brome-Missisquoi, Frontenac 
and Chambly and all those whom I could not see or hear, since 
we sometimes recognize each other by the way we applaud, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	What do we see in this budget for housing? The Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Program, RRAP, is back. It is very 
nice to have such a program, but first you have to have a home to 
renovate, and there is no measure for home ownership, 
especially for a first home. There is nothing for single people 
and young couples, but they are told to improve what they do not 
have. What a fine philosophy, putting the cart before the horse! 
That is the finest example we could give. Our grandparents used 
that expression. It is still current for describing the 
government's economic policies or lack thereof.
<P>
	As my colleague from Trois-Rivières just said, the 
government is attacking the unemployed as if they were 
responsible for their condition. The unemployed are responsible 
for the poor state of the Canadian economy; the government is 
responsible, because of its ineptness and inaction in this area. 
There is no political will to fight unemployment in Canada.
<P>
	All they are doing is to go after UI recipients, blaming them 
for unemployment. They are being penalized. Their benefits are 
being cut. The length of time they must work to obtain UI 
benefits is increased. But hitting the unemployed does not affect 
unemployment. Just as when a mortician does his work, he does 
not attack death, he deals with someone who is already dead. 
The government is the big funeral director of this country and it 
seems it is about to celebrate a funeral mass for the economy. In 
the next election, voters in Canada, the remaining nine 
provinces, will decide this government's fate.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Probably our friends in the Reform Party will have 
alternatives to propose or other parties will come along, because 
we see some parties appear and grow like mushrooms in this 
country.
<P>
	I am glad to see-again you are signaling me that I have one 
minute left-with just a minute to conclude, I have to choose 
between the Royal Military College in Saint-Jean, of which we 
have spoken a lot, and the Prime Minister's statements in this 
House that there would be more cuts, although no minister wants 
to cut in his department. We asked questions yesterday; no 
minister wanted to cut, but the sum of the parts is greater than 
the whole because the Prime Minister said that he was going to 
reduce the deficit.
<P>
	So in closing, I will say a few words about an issue that I care 
about, MIL Davie in Lauzon, where 400 of my constituents 
work. It is high time, and in the 30 seconds remaining to me, I 
will say that it is high time for the government to stop thinking 
about reviving the MIL Davie shipyard in Lauzon and to 
immediately give it the contract for the Magdalen Islands ferry 
to replace the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, 
once again it is a pleasure to speak on a bill in the House of 
Commons but it is not such a pleasure to talk about Bill C-17.
<P>
	In question period today I mentioned the simile of bailing out 
a ship with a thimble. That is what we have here, the government 
trying to deal with the large problem of $40 billion and we are 
playing around the edges with some of the cuts. Most people in 
Canada know that just will not work.
<P>
	I spent some time in Halifax during the spring recess with a 
number of business groups and a model parliament. It was with 
enthusiasm that I watched the prime minister of that model 
parliament and his elected members from the school expressing 
their views and frustrations about things that are happening in 
the country; the criminal justice system, parliamentary reform 
and so on, but expressing long term views of the problems that 
exist in our economy. I do not think we should take this so 
lightly. These young people have reason to be concerned.
<P>
	A lot of people talk about our younger generation today and 
refer to them as generation <I>x</I>, a generation some say that does 
not have its own identity as far as music and other things. My 
impression of generation <I>x</I> is one of young concerned 
Canadians, a group that probably will have, very rightly so, very 
little tolerance with us baby boomers who have managed to 
spend ourselves into oblivion.
<P>
	When it comes time for us to have a pension in the next 15, 20, 
25 years I somehow think that generation <I>x</I> will be very 
dissatisfied with us and our spending and will  have no sympathy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3055"> 3055 </A></B>
<P>
whatsoever. Perhaps it is well deserved by us. The frustration is 
across the country. I see it in my riding every day in Langley, 
Aldergrove, and Max Lake.
<P>
	The budget has created some serious concerns for Canadians 
and as I travel and talk to people in this fair city of Ottawa you 
can hear it every day. It is on their minds. The government has 
not addressed the concerns of the economy.
<P>
	I sense there are some members on the government side who 
want to deal with it. I do not know what the problem is. Maybe 
the cabinet ministers wish to hold them back but I sincerely hope 
those members will convince their leaders that something more 
serious has to take place.
<P>
	I have talked to bankers in the maritimes. They expressed the 
same concerns as bankers in Fraser Valley West. It is no 
different. It is not regional. How can any rational person support 
Bill C-17 which will provide for $3 billion more in expenditures 
next year than the previous year?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal government has provided what I referred to some 
time ago as a flaccid approach to managing Canada. The 
dictionary definition of flaccid is limp-wristed, lacking vigour 
and feeble. At the time when I talked about that I put my own 
definition of the word flaccid. I made it an acronym. Flaccid to 
me really means the federal Liberals are crafty Conservatives in 
disguise. I do not see a lot of difference. Now I am getting a rise 
from the members on the other side of the House so I am starting 
to hit a few buttons here. I expect that will happen over the next 
few years.
<P>
	However, they should not take it so badly because I am going 
to do my very best in the next 10 minutes to explain why 
Canadians coast to coast feel this way and are disappointed in 
the selection of the government in the last election.
<P>
	Let us compare the short record of this Liberal Party with that 
of the Conservatives who were annihilated in the last election. It 
is necessary to make this comparison throughout this speech to 
understand why we cannot support the Liberal budget and why I 
predict that party will fail dismally in the next election. That is a 
pity really but that is the way it is going to go.
<P>
	I can remember back in 1984 when the Liberals were thrown 
out and we brought in the Conservatives. Canada had so much 
hope. What happened? They spent their way into oblivion. Now 
we are just continuing on with the next generation of traditional 
politics.
<P>
	The budget is going to see Liberal spending increase by $3 
billion at a time when our national debt is $40 billion.
<P>
	The financial markets are reacting to it and businessmen have 
reacted to it for the last 10 years. They are concerned. The only 
group that is not reacting to it is the government itself. It is 
ironic.
<P>
	The government does not have the intestinal fortitude to deal 
with reality. It indicates also that the government cannot take a 
tough stand on the big issues and will not. This Liberal 
government really is a Liberal government. It is not 
Conservative in nature and it is definitely not Reform in nature. 
Some of the members are suggesting that is a good idea but we 
will see in the next election.
<P>
	Let me take you into some detail that will astound you, 
Madam Speaker. I want to talk a little bit about just why we get 
frustrated here and why the people out in all of the communities 
in Canada get frustrated. I want to talk about a little organization 
called the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.
<P>
	This council has existed for some years now. I do not know 
how far back, but it existed in the Conservative reign and it 
exists here today. I will just run by a couple of bottom line 
budgets of this organization. In 1991-92 its budget was $90 
million. In the next year, 1992-93, its budget was $101 million. 
The budget has gone up and at one point it was $97.7 million.
<P>
	One might say: ``Well what is wrong with that? It must be a 
good organization and it must do a lot of good things''. I do not 
doubt that. However, in this budget when we were looking for 
some cuts there were no cuts to the organization. In fact its 
budget increased.
<P>
	Let me give you an idea of some of the expenditures coming 
from that organization that have not been questioned at all. In 
fact its budget has been increased. After I read these I think the 
people watching and listening this afternoon and my colleagues 
next will ask themselves the question: Why did we not look a 
little harder at this in the budget? Why did we not take some 
money out of this budget?
<P>
	Payments: $15,435 to study eunuchs in Imperial China. Now I 
ask: Do we have a better way to spend $15,000? The amount of 
$147,827 was spent to examine lullabies, form and function in 
infant directed music.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	While that may be interesting to some, I doubt very much 
whether there are many people in this country who have a lot of 
interest in their tax dollars going this way.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Liberals have.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3056"> 3056 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The Liberals have made no 
changes to the budget. In fact they have increased it, so this is 
the track we are going on.
<P>
	I will just run by a couple more because there are so many of 
them. Let me give members the one that might interest a lot of 
people. There is $21,566 to examine experimental studies of 
interactive gestures. Let members' minds roll a bit on that one.
<P>
	I am sorry I am going to run out of time because I do have a 
bunch of other things to talk about. If members want to look on 
the bigger scale of things, here is a government that is talking 
about spending $6 billion of taxpayers' money on infrastructure, 
another $1.5 billion on child care seats and so on. It is all 
taxpayers' money. There have been no cuts to the budget. It is a 
disgrace to put this in front of the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Madam 
Speaker, to start with I would like to tell the member for 
Saint-Laurent-Cartierville how pleased I was to meet her in 
my riding before the Easter break, for the handing out of a 
cheque. I hope that the day I run into difficulties, I will be able to 
count on the government to help me out. I will be happy to meet 
you in my riding for less auspicious events than the handing out 
of a cheque. Madam Speaker, I mean that in a very friendly way.
<P>
	Having said that, I welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-17, an Act to amend certain statutes to implement certain 
provisions of the Budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 
1994. Under this rather innocuous title, this act has far reaching 
consequences for nearly everyone in Canada and in Quebec. 
This bill affects every household, every family and every 
taxpayer in the country.
<P>
	When reading this piece of legislation, one can really see how 
thirsty the government is for money. There is a problem 
however, the government always digs into the same pockets to 
take the money it needs. This time, once again, it goes after the 
unemployed and pensioners and, as I said before, families, more 
often than not low-income families who can hardly make ends 
meet as it is.
<P>
	I think that instead of bringing the unemployed to their knees, 
the government should have helped them break out of that 
vicious circle and get back onto the labour market. You do not 
keep on hitting somebody who has already fallen to the ground, 
you help him get up. One way to help the unemployed is to agree 
to Quebec's many requests to decentralize manpower training. 
This would improve efficiency and help unemployed workers 
find their way through a maze of 75 programs with different 
entrance requirements depending on whether they deal with the 
federal government or Quebec departments. It would also help 
reduce the cost of overlapping jurisdiction and duplication 
which is estimated to be around $300,000 in Quebec alone. This 
figure was not arrived at by the Bloc  Quebecois but by a former 
Quebec minister, a former minister who was a Liberal and a 
federalist. Three hundred million dollars because of 
overlapping is not chicken feed, it is a lot of money.
<P>
	It is mostly because it has been recognized that a greater 
decentralization, bringing training and re-entry programs closer 
to the labour force, was more efficient than a strongly 
centralized policy such as the approach the Canadian 
government wants to impose on the provinces that the 
government must meet our expectations regarding manpower 
training.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada and other government bodies 
such as the Department of Employment and Immigration, each 
year, there are between 50,000 and 90,000 jobs that go unfilled 
in Quebec alone. With these figures, it is possible to see that 
there is a problem with training. Based on these figures alone, in 
difficult times such as these when everyone is looking for a job 
and talking about jobs, the need to do something is obvious to 
anyone who takes a hard look at the situation. In spite of all that, 
and in spite of the fact that the decentralization of training is 
unanimously approved in Quebec, we continue to negotiate, to 
hesitate and to waver, not knowing exactly what to do. As the 
hon. member for Roberval said yesterday, we discuss and these 
friendly discussions go on and on between Quebec and Ottawa, 
but no decision is ever made. I hope that the future will be more 
promising. I hope that the powers that be in Quebec will wake up 
and put their foot down once and for all.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday too, the Leader of the Opposition was right on when 
he said that in Quebec the issue of training decentralization 
generates a rare consensus. Indeed, it is not often that you have 
Gérald Larose and Ghislain Dufour agreeing on something. 
There is a real consensus and Quebec's position is very clear.
<P>
	We can never insist too much on the fact that the Martin 
budget taxes employment and jeopardizes an already weak 
recovery.
<P>
	The minister who, not so long ago, so vehemently opposed the 
Conservative policy, is now pursuing that policy and is doing 
even more damage than the Conservatives before him. Indeed, 
the minister pursues the Conservative policy of lowering UI 
benefits for the vast majority of claimants. To ease its 
conscience, the government threw in a few goodies in the bill, 
including the provision concerning low-income earners with 
dependent children. This is nothing to write home about, but the 
government put that in the legislation to make it somewhat more 
palatable. But this is only to save face; this is only to create a 
diversion.
<P>
	This policy shifts the emphasis of the problem and makes it 
worse. I represent the riding of Berthier-Montcalm which 
extends to Saint-Michel-des-Saints, Saint-Zénon and all the 
way up to the Indian reserve of Manouane. What did people tell  
me every time I visited those regions during the election 
campaign? They said: ``Michel, is there a policy to help our 
young stay here in our regions?'' I understand these people 
because the population of these communities and villages is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3057"> 3057 </A></B>
<P>
dwindling. Those amendments to the Unemployment Insurance 
Act will not keep the young in the regions. On the contrary, they 
will leave sooner for the city. The shorter the benefits, the faster 
they will go in order to find a job. They will try to find a job 
rather than depend on social welfare, and they will head for the 
city to do so. The problem is they will not find more jobs in the 
city than they do at home. And they will end up on welfare. The 
Minister of Finance will be pleased because they will no longer 
appear in federal statistics but on provincial social welfare rolls. 
If that was his goal, he did succeed.
<P>
	Let met give a few figures on the impact of unemployment 
insurance reform. Eastern Canada and Quebec will be hit 
particularly hard by the elimination of regional rates of 
unemployment beyond 13 per cent. The last word I got from UI 
officials is that the current rate in my riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm is about 15 per cent. Those amendments 
will have a severe impact in my area.
<P>
	When the regional unemployment rate is higher than 13 per 
cent, the number of weeks of benefits for people having just a 
few weeks of insurable work will be greatly affected. The 
impact on Eastern Quebec, where the needs are most acute, will 
be severe. According to an internal document of the Department 
of Human Resources Development, we can expect the following 
reductions in benefits: Atlantic Canada, $630 million; Quebec, 
$735 million; Ontario, $560 million; western Canada, $430 
million.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance argued that the cuts were fair, saying 
that Quebec and the Maritime provinces would still get more, 
per capita, after the reform. If he meant the benefit to population 
ratio, his argument does not hold water. It is natural for a 
province with a high unemployment rate to get more than other 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Since I only have one minute left, I will raise another issue 
which is very dear to me. As you know, 1994 is the International 
Year of the Family. I think this should be a golden opportunity 
for the government to do something to help families.
<P>
	Let me read you an excerpt of a letter I received from one of 
my constituents. The subject is ``The art of being stupid in the 
extreme''. That person wrote: ``You know when the new federal 
policy regarding help to families was released, I was pleased to 
see that children's benefits were no longer taxable. 
Unfortunately, the government announced at the same time that 
my husband and I were too rich to continue receiving such 
benefits''. With an annual salary of $38,000, once daycare and 
babysitting costs are paid, as well as other expenses, there is 
only $11,000 left for the year and for the pension fund. Yet,  the 
minister said that these people were too rich and sent them a 
notice of assessment for a $63 overpayment.
<P>
	``I have a cute little case containing exactly $46.09 in pennies 
and nickels from my little girl's piggy bank. I want to send it to 
the Minister''. The person who wrote asked me to table it in the 
House, but since this is not possible, I will send it directly to the 
minister. This is a good example of the lack of policy and will to 
help families raise children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Manicouagan, the riding that I represent, is one of the regions 
most affected by the lack of jobs. Its geography is quite 
particular. It is so special that to meet all my constituents in the 
towns and villages where they live, I must often use four 
different modes of transport-plane, boat, car, of course, and 
often snowmobile.
<P>
	Unemployment is particularly high because of the 
demographics of the constituency. The latest unemployment 
rate recorded by Statistics Canada, for March, I believe, was 
17.8 per cent in my region, compared to 10.6 per cent nationally.
<P>
	The eastern part of the riding is quite specific, made up 
mainly of fishermen and/or people who depend on that natural 
resource; unemployment insurance is a considerable source of 
income for them. Between 80 and 85 per cent of the people east 
of Natashquan depend directly on income from fishing. Now it 
seems that the measures in Bill C-17 will especially affect 
eastern Canada, including Quebec, and particularly eastern 
Quebec, including my riding.
<P>
	That is why I strongly denounce Bill C-17, especially clause 
28. This clause will be disastrous for those, like many of my 
constituents, who depend on fishing.
<P>
	This is what might happen if Bill C-17 is implemented. For 
one thing, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is reducing 
fishing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence so that the stocks can 
recover. That is most commendable and useful too, up to a point. 
But at the same time, and there is the rub, Bill C-17 will raise the 
minimum number of weeks of work required from 10 to 12.
<P>
	So on the one hand people are prevented from accumulating 
weeks of work and on the other, the number required is increased 
from 10 to 12. These two measures pull in opposite directions 
instead of converging.
<P>
	In March, after the Minister of Finance presented the federal 
budget, three teachers in the Department of Economics at the 
Université du Québec à Montréal, UQAM, openly described 
what they thought of this in the provincial media. They 
expressed surprise and concern at learning that nearly 60 per 
cent of the announced federal deficit reduction, namely $2.4 
billion out of $4.1 billion, will be supported by unemployed 
Canadians. Their statement speaks volumes.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3058"> 3058 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	It means that, once again, the government goes after the most 
disadvantaged in our society and asks them to tighten their belts, 
as if there was fat to be trimmed in the unemployment sector of 
the economy. It is absolutely unthinkable. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development himself said some time ago that 
they wanted to force recipients to work for longer periods to 
continue to qualify for the same number of weeks of benefits.
<P>
	I will repeat only the first part of what he said, which is 
revealing, namely that they want to force recipients to work. To 
say something like that, they must be a little out of touch with 
reality.
<P>
	In Quebec, some 90 per cent of unemployed workers lose their 
jobs through no fault of their own due to lay-offs, illness or 
retirement. Most have no control over the duration of their 
employment and, if they take casual or seasonal jobs, it is not 
because they do not feel like holding a stable, well-paid job but 
because they have no choice.
<P>
	This bill appears to want to protect the country against an 
attack or an invasion by the nasty hoards of unemployed whose 
goal is to remain unemployed until they die. And this is not the 
case at all. No one wants to remain unemployed. In 1987, the 
Human Resources Directorate announced a competition to staff 
positions at the Port-Cartier penitentiary in our riding. Many 
people are familiar with this facility because it made the 
headlines when it opened.
<P>
	A total of 250 openings were announced-openings for 
correctional services officers and for administrative officers. 
The directorate received no less than 23,000 applications for 
these 250 positions. Despite the unique aspects of working in a 
correctional facility, because this is no easy job. There is a 
certain amount of risk involved. Yet, 23,000 people discounted 
the risks and applied because they wanted to work. That is what 
we were told.
<P>
	It is not that people do not want to work. Rather, the current 
state of the economy is not conducive to hiring people. Why then 
take it out on the unemployed?
<P>
	Pursuant to clause 22 of Bill C-17, certain unemployment 
insurance claimants will see their benefits increase from 57 per 
cent to 60 per cent, while others will have their benefit rate 
reduced from 57 per cent to 55 per cent. By the finance 
minister's own admission, only 15 per cent of claimants will see 
their benefits increase, while the remaining 85 per cent will see 
their benefit rate drop from 57 per cent to 55 per cent. Perhaps 
we did not say enough about this particular provision when it 
was announced, but as Official Opposition, we are doing so now. 
This government is merely cementing the policy of the previous 
government. Furthermore, it now says that its priority is to 
reduce the benefit rate, not to reform social programs.
<P>
	Incredibly, I have only a minute remaining. I was coming to 
the best part, Madam Speaker. In conclusion, let me just say that 
in the riding of Manicouagan, just as in other ridings in Quebec 
and Canada, people want to work. They are tired of being 
accused of not wanting to work. They want nothing more than to 
work, Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I am opposed to this bill because I do not believe for one 
moment that legislation like this will help to turn the economy 
around. At best, it will lower the unemployment figures and 
merely mask the true state of this country's economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
begin with, a Canada-wide committee was struck to examine the 
proposed changes to the UI program, as part of the review of 
social programs. I have talked many times about the creation of 
committes up until now.
<P>
	Even before the conclusion of the study, the Prime Minister 
refuses to give Quebec what rightly belongs to it. Everybody in 
Quebec, even the Liberals-and these are the Prime Minister's 
words-who are not big bad separatists, is demanding it, but the 
Prime Minister rejects out of hand what he calls the ``whims'' of 
Quebec.
<P>
	They are not whims, but Quebec's most basic demands; they 
are also a way of asking that the Constitution be respected, as it 
applies to education, which is explicitly described as an area of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	At this point, I wish to announce to members of the House and 
to you, Madam Speaker, that this very afternoon, the National 
Assembly of Quebec voted unanimously in favour of a motion 
giving Quebec exclusive powers in the area of job training.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Quebeckers are standing up for their 
rights!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Madam Speaker, the party across the way is 
acting like a parent who does not want to recognize the 
autonomy of his children who have grown up. The Prime 
Minister says that he has to maintain control over budgets and 
decisions related to job training because we have unemployed 
workers. Are we not big enough and responsible enough to know 
our needs? Have we not proven our economic know-how and 
buoyancy over the past 30 years? Let us go back a little to look at 
the economic expertise of Quebeckers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3059"> 3059 </A></B>
<P>
	There are, for example, the Caisse de dépôt et placement, the 
Société générale de financement, the REAs, the financial 
institutions reform, and Hydro-Québec. I would like to point out 
that these initiatives are mainly the brain-child of a single man, 
who will most likely become the next Quebec premier in a few 
months, Mr. Jacques Parizeau.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau: </B>Our expertise in the management of our 
assets is well established, but given the persistent opposition by 
the ruling government, I repeat, we have realized that it is only 
by being sovereign that we will be able to patriate those powers 
that are essential to Quebec's economic renewal.
<P>
	We must also ask ourselves the following question: In its 
deficit reduction plan, did the government opposite do its share? 
Did it penalize only the unemployed and the old people by 
taking away their tax deductions?
<P>
	Here is a long excerpt from an article by reporter Claude Piché 
which appeared in <I>La Presse</I> on February 22 this year. He wrote: 
``Here are some figures. Let us not forget them when the 
minister socks it to us while saying he has to put government 
finances in order''.
<P>
	It seems that the reduction and restriction spectre did not keep 
our diplomats from sleeping. Last year, and the figures are 
accurate, they are dated February 22, the Foreign Affairs budget 
exceeded $3.8 billion, a 13 per cent increase over the $3.4 
billion recorded in the previous year, when spending was up 5 
per cent as compared to the year before. Alone, spending 
directly related to representing Canadian interests abroad , such 
as embassies, high commissions, consulates and other 
diplomatic activities, including everything that goes with it, 
planes, trips, and soon, increased by 23 per cent over two years, 
a figure that does not show an obvious concern for austerity.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, by 
far the main agency of this department, spent $2.2 billion last 
year. CIDA increased its expenditures by $232 million last year 
and by $133 million the year before, for a 19 per cent increase in 
two years.
<P>
	The budget of the Department of Indian Affairs exceeds $4 
billion. This is another department where it is obvious that they 
do not know about making sacrifices. Their expenditures have 
increased by 7 per cent last year and by 9 per cent the year before 
for a total of 16 per cent. More than half of their budget, more 
than half of those $4 billion is made up of grants and 
contributions to band councils and tribal organizations. These 
payments have jumped 23 per cent in two years to reach $2.6 
billion last year.
<P>
	The inflation rate in Canada was 1.8 per cent last year and 1.5 
per cent the year before. We have to wonder.
<P>
	Let us now take a look at the Correctional Service of Canada, 
the very agency which builds for criminals luxurious condos 
such as the majority of honest workers could not afford. It has 
spent $876 million last year, an increase of 7 per cent over the 
previous year.
<P>
	At Fisheries and Oceans Canada, expenditures took a 30 per 
cent leap over the previous year to $869 million.
<P>
	The increase in Communications Canada's budget is close to 
10 per cent. This department is spending $2.2 billion of your 
taxes and mine, nearly half of this amount being allocated to 
CBC. But the biggest chunk which makes all other expenditures 
look insignificant by comparison is the debt service. This is 
when we stop counting in millions and talk about billions of 
dollars.
<P>
	Last year, Ottawa spent $39 billion to service its debt. If one 
were to add all the expenditures, the subsidies, the 
grants-whether justified or not-and multiply the total by four, 
the result would be the cost incurred last year by the government 
only for servicing its debt.
<P>
	Such is the painful assessment of twenty years of poor public 
finance management.
<P>
	This article tells us what is wrong. The government asks 
Canadians to foot the bill and, at the same time, increases its 
spending-in that case, by an average of 17.7 per cent in the 
departments I have just mentioned. While the cost-of-living 
index rose by 1.7 per cent, government spending increased 
ten-fold.
<P>
	It is also important to recall the position of the Liberals when 
the late Conservatives changed the Unemployment Insurance 
Program. Remember the shouting and the insults of the Liberals 
against such changes when they were in the opposition. They 
changed their tune. Remember the position of the Liberals on 
the issue of granting more authority to the Auditor General. 
Now, they are opposing a motion proposed by their own party. 
Change of side, change of heart.
<P>
	What consistency! They wonder why there is a lack of 
confidence on the part of the public. A used-car dealer is more 
popular than they are! I therefore repeat my position with regard 
to economic recovery and job creation.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government is once again trying to fool the 
public. But this time, it does not work because citizens are much 
better informed than they used to be and cannot abide trickery.
<P>
	The government must stop believing that it alone can create 
jobs. You said it, we said it, we agree on that, small businesses 
have been the main job creators for many years and they have to 
keep on playing that job-creating role.
<P>
	The failure of the previous government and the one foreseen 
for the liberal government should get them to become a bit more 
responsible. They have difficulty doing that. An efficient 
government has to be a custodian of public funds, it has, in 
principle, to keep its spending  under control, to keep the deficit 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3060"> 3060 </A></B>
<P>
under control and to restore confidence in the economy. I said so 
last week.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	That confidence is the basis of a healthy economy. The 
illogical decisions that have been made by governments for too 
long and that are still made today hinder the establishment of 
that confidence, which is essential for the economy to recover.
<P>
	It is not by creating temporary jobs and, while doing so, by 
ignoring the role played by the small business that the 
government is going to revitalize the economy, but rather by 
restoring the climate of confidence which will stimulate 
investment and, at the same time, will create real jobs, for good.
<P>
	However, it is not a federal government, with its departmental 
overlapping and its heavy management, that will meet that 
simple objective, but a sovereign Quebec, sole master 
responsible for its decisions and its management, which will 
inevitably-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but the hon. 
member's time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
try to finish on time.
<P>
	In Laurentides, the riding I proudly represent, the 
unemployment rate is 18 per cent, a far cry from the national rate 
that was leaked last week. As I said a far cry from the rate that 
hon. members opposite are celebrating. A person would have to 
be terribly naive to believe that your policies were able to bring 
down the unemployment rate. All your decisions and initiatives 
since October 25 have been a mere drop in the bucket.
<P>
	These self-congratulatory statements are just an attempt to 
mislead the public. You say your policies are working and 
producing results, but you are just distributing a few crumbs 
here and there. Your response is band-aid solutions and very 
short-term planning.
<P>
	Where is the real vision? Where are the long-term plans that 
would help us look forward to a stabler economy that would 
generate more jobs? Instead of taking a serious approach to the 
problems and the solutions they require, the ministers opposite 
go on trips and come back with so-called good news. A trip to 
Korea, and Hyundai will open its doors again. Good news? News 
without much substance, which has raised a lot of concerns 
among the public. This strategy, which I say is pathetic, is not a 
winner, and no wonder.
<P>
	The people on the government benches are handling problems 
on a day-to-day basis. They do not know what is going to 
happen tomorrow. The unemployed in Laurentides know 
perfectly well nothing has changed. Since you took over the 
government benches, there have been no more jobs for them.
<P>
	They do know that after unemployment insurance comes 
welfare, and that is what really made the unemployment rate go 
down. It is true! Look at what is really happening in our ridings. 
The federal government is passing the buck to the provinces. 
This transfer of the tax burden, which is a disgrace, is a clear 
sign of the Liberals' inertia and indifference.
<P>
	Welfare, cuts in unemployment insurance, jobs without a 
future, tax increases for the middle class and pretty speeches are 
the only results produced by the government's red book.
<P>
	People in Laurentides want work. They are willing to train, be 
retrained and upgrade their skills to acquire the tools they need 
to meet labour market requirements. The 18 per cent who are 
unemployed in my riding-I repeat 30 per cent-want to see 
some light at the end of the tunnel. They want the government to 
implement programs that will help them go back to work. They 
want long-term employment, jobs that will give them some 
security, not the kind of jobs that last only a few weeks, created 
under programs that are only intended get people the number of 
weeks they need to go back on unemployment insurance. 
Workers are caught up in a vicious circle that the government 
merely encourages through these programs. We must change our 
way of doing things, change our approach to get results that are 
more useful and more attractive in the long run, both for workers 
and employers.
<P>
	The economy of Laurentides is based mainly on spin-offs 
generated by the tourism industry and the goods and services 
sector. Except for greater Saint-Jérôme where you find 
well-established small and medium-sized businesses that 
provide good jobs, our economy depends on tourism. Now, the 
nearly total dependence of jobs on the presence of tourists in our 
area means that all workers are considerably exposed to 
uncontrollable elements. As a matter of fact, poor seasons due to 
low temperatures or a lack of money on the part of vacationers 
directly affect employment opportunities in the riding of 
Laurentides.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	There is no doubt that the economy in my region needs to be 
diversified. A few dozen of strong small and medium-sized 
businesses would be welcome. They would help reduce our 
dependence on tourism and protect us against elements over 
which we have no control.
<P>
	A business that manufactures high technology products, for 
instance, could certainly, while diversifying our economy, keep 
it at an acceptable level, guarantee a certain number of jobs and, 
indirectly, an adequate overall purchasing power.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we do not have those small and medium-sized 
businesses in the Laurentians. Moreover, I invite those of the 
other side, the ministers, to come to my region and meet the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3061"> 3061 </A></B>
<P>
business people in order to develop the whole small and 
medium-sized business sector.
<P>
	We must face the facts. The Laurentians depend on tourism 
for a living, as I have already said. Ski resorts, beaches, 
campgrounds, summer theatres, hotels, motels, restaurants and 
shops are the main source of employment for our workers. The 
level of activity of those employers depends on tourism, which 
fluctuates a lot, and on the purchasing power of residents, which 
is linked to the economy of the region.
<P>
	The results for workers who are concentrated in great 
numbers in that sector are seasonal and precarious jobs, 
unsteady and low paid jobs. Our workers are very much affected 
by the fluctuations of tourism. That is why they must get 
unemployment insurance benefits between jobs while they are 
waiting for good seasons. Some wait for summer jobs while 
others work in the winter.
<P>
	At the end of every working season, people come in greater 
numbers to ask for unemployment insurance because there are 
no other jobs available to them in the near future.
<P>
	The recent changes to the unemployment insurance system 
make benefits even more difficult to obtain. In my riding, these 
changes will affect a great number of workers who cannot 
accumulate the required 12 weeks for the reasons I have already 
stated. For them, it means a direct line to welfare. A nice move 
on the part of the federal government. The decision-makers on 
the other side have never realized that, given the economic 
situation in the regions, some workers have a hard time finding 
work for 12 weeks.
<P>
	And the Liberals keep at it. You have to work more, but they 
give you less. Less benefits and for a shorter period. Less money 
to spend, less purchasing power; the economy cuts jobs and does 
not create new ones, and so goes the spiral.
<P>
	The Liberals reduce UI benefits without offering workers 
alternatives. Their thinking is topsy-turvy on the other side. The 
liberal processes follow a logic which is contrary to common 
sense. It is disquieting and discouraging for my constituents. It 
shows clearly that the Liberals have more consideration for 
figures than for persons.
<P>
	Another provision of this reform also seems to be 
stress-generating. The benefit rate of 60 per cent for 
low-income persons with dependent children leads us to believe 
that there will be investigations made in order to confirm their 
status. In Quebec, we already know the welfare 
``boubou-macoutes''; we are aware of all the trouble and 
tension they caused in our province. I hope the federal 
government will not copy that kind of action which is most 
aggravating and infringes on people's privacy.
<P>
	Finally, the impact of these amendments will be disastrous for 
the people of Laurentides. They prove that the Liberals are 
disconnected from the grassroots and from the realities of 
regional economic situations. Together they can shout ``Alleluia 
for welfare'' which  is an easy and shameful way for them to 
shirk their duties and responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Madam Speaker, the present 
government was elected after campaigning on a single theme: 
``jobs, jobs, jobs''. All of us here remember the answers the 
Prime Minister gave to the questions of his opponents and of the 
invited guests during the leaders' debate. To all questions the 
Prime Minister would invariably and tirelessly answer: ``jobs, 
jobs, jobs.''
<P>
	To some of his unemployed constituents who were voicing 
their disappointment in the riding of Saint-Maurice, the Prime 
Minister said: ``-this was in the red book, they should have 
read between the lines-'' To read between the lines is the role 
of the opposition, and it will not fail doing so, whether the party 
opposite likes it or not.
<P>
	Any budget worthy of that name has to bring, first of all, a 
degree of confidence into a failing, not to say moribund, 
economy and to a population also craving security. How do you 
reconcile the words of the Prime Minister ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' and 
the budget of the Minister of Finance? Did the government 
succeed in giving the degree of confidence it wanted to the 
financial world, then to investors, and finally to consumers? I 
doubt it, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Considering the figures contained in the budget with regard to 
social programs, and unemployment insurance in particular, can 
we say that social demands for security and stability have been 
met?
<P>
	The people of Canada and Quebec have the right to expect two 
things of a social policy with an economic goal: First, job 
creation and, second, the assurance that the jobs created will be 
permanent. What kind of jobs were created up to now? The 
infrastructures program leads to the spending of huge amounts 
of money for the creation of purely temporary jobs, almost 
exclusively for men.
<P>
	I agree that in the short term jobs will be created, but because 
of the nature of the work being done, this only postpones for a 
few years the inevitable crisis already obvious. In other words, 
instead of buying chickens, they prefer to steal them from 
someone else's henhouse.
<P>
	What happened to job creation targeting, for example, young 
people, laid-off workers aged 50 to 65, and young university 
graduates, to name a few? Madam Speaker, there is absolutely 
nothing for them in that bill. Instead, the government cut the 
budget for forestry development by 5 per cent. There is nothing 
either for young technicians, no structural project to create jobs 
in companies such as MIL Davie, which could build the 
ferryboat people in the Magdalen Islands have been waiting for 
for so long.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3062"> 3062 </A></B>
<P>
	There has been great uncertainty created by clause 25, and the 
freeze of job-creation programs such as DEPs, which, 
incidentally, we are told, will be managed by a discretionary 
fund at the Department of Human Resources Development; it 
smacks of partisanship. The cut in the unemployment insurance 
premium is postponed till next year, even though the finance 
minister claimed that dropping the rate from $3.07 to $3.00 
would create 40,000 new jobs. Why not create them right away 
instead of waiting until next January to effect this much talked 
about drop?
<P>
	There is a complete unwillingness to discuss the conversion 
of the defence industry, the HST, and Oerlikon's low-altitude 
defence system.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Poor Canadians, poor Quebeckers, poor jobless.
<P>
	Since troubles never come singly, the brand new budget is in a 
bad way and was off to a poor start from the very beginning.
<P>
	Interest rates are rising rapidly, the Canadian dollar is falling, 
which means our foreign debt will cost us even more, and some 
plants have closed, like Hyundai, in Bromont.
<P>
	What does the Minister of Finance have to suggest after the 
fact, since he is really the one who is involved? Nothing, 
absolutely nothing except to take it out on the jobless, in two 
different ways: having them contribute longer by increasing the 
number of weeks required to be eligible, and reducing the 
number of weeks of benefits.
<P>
	That is how the government reacts to the requests of citizens, 
of Canadian and Quebec workers. For my part, I consider that as 
killing them slowly.
<P>
	This government will probably be remembered as the one that 
did the least with the biggest budget. Let us not forget that we 
have a projected deficit of $39.4 billion. It is not chicken feed!
<P>
	There is only one law the government should adopt, because it 
has been enforcing it since the elections, that is, the law of least 
action.
<P>
	It would also seem that the Liberals favourite theme line 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'' was for nobody, especially not the 
heavyweight ministers of this government who systematically 
refuse to carry out the job of creating jobs.
<P>
	The eastern provinces are hit harder than any other by the 
proposed UI changes, with cuts totalling $1.3 billion, and 
Quebec in particular, with nearly $800 million in cuts. These 
cuts hurt. That is why the last time changes were made to the UI 
system more than 50,000 braved bone-chilling weather in 
January or February 1993 to demonstrate their opposition to the 
Valcourt reform.
<P>
	It is both urgent and imperative for the government to have a 
vision for the society it is governing and to stop applying 
poultice on a wooden leg by holding consultations which are 
pointless because of this lack of a global vision of the society of 
the future.
<P>
	It is the Prime Minister's duty to assign to key positions 
people with a vision, with innovative ideas, and capable of 
seeing that they are implemented instead of choosing people, as 
seems to be the case at present, based on their support during a 
certain leadership race.
<P>
	Again, the unemployed are going to be the ones to pay for the 
Prime Minister's political debts.
<P>
	A poet once said that many have died for their ideas, but many 
more have died for want of ideas!
<P>
	For all these reasons, my caucus will not hesitate to vote 
against the bill before us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the budget reflects what we said we would do during the 
election. Let me look at some of the aspects of the budget which 
I find very, very positive and upon which we have already taken 
action in the last little while.
<P>
	Looking at youth for instance, I know that earlier the member 
opposite from the Reform Party was talking about generation <I>x</I>. 
I have some 20 years of experience working with young people 
helping them deal with retraining and upgrading. The first 
aspect of this to look at is apprenticeship.
<P>
	At a conference recently young people talked about making a 
decision by the time they hit grade 10. They said that is when 
they decide whether they are going to continue with 
post-secondary education or whether they are going to quit 
school. The latter means dead end jobs and not much of a future.
<P>
	In this country we have never valued apprenticeships. In other 
countries apprenticeship is valued. In Germany there are 
600,000 graduates a year. In other countries trades are not 
something blue collar workers do, but trades are considered as 
careers and professions and are valued by society.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	In our culture we have not valued trades. We have not valued 
tradesmen and people with skills. We have devalued them. 
Therefore we have not built in infrastructures to be able to assist 
young people to go into apprenticeship programs or a trade if 
they choose not to go to an academic program at college or 
university.
<P>
	We have built into the budget an apprenticeship program to 
deal with this very serious problem. It is a serious structural 
problem in our training and educational programs and affects 
the future of the young people of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3063"> 3063 </A></B>
<P>
	As a country it is time to join the rest of the world in making 
sure our young people have an option when they leave school. 
Those who do not want to go on with academic studies at 
university will have the option to follow a career. It is not just a 
make-shift program but offers a career in technology, in trades. 
It gives them the skills not only to get a job today but also to 
become the employers of tomorrow. In many other countries the 
artisans are the ones who create jobs in the small businesses.
<P>
	By announcing an apprenticeship program in our budget we 
are talking about finally filling the gap and joining the rest of the 
world in the 21st century.
<P>
	Another aspect deals with young people who have lost jobs. 
When the jobs go they are the first to go as they do not have the 
skills and are the most junior members of a company. There are 
also those young people who do not have the skills and have 
already dropped out and need assistance to get back into the 
labour market. We need to develop training programs and 
assistance for these young people.
<P>
	Let us also look at the transition from school to work. Young 
people who have finished a training program or have obtained a 
college or university degree are unable to find jobs. Right now a 
lot of them are looking for work but do not have the experience. 
Quite often as many of us were told when we were looking for 
work they cannot get the job because they do not have the 
experience. They have not yet worked at or practised the trade 
they studied in school.
<P>
	The Canada youth corps program which the government 
mentioned in its budget and which will be announced sometime 
soon by the Minister of Human Resources Development will try 
to address that problem. It will try to give young people at least a 
year of experience in the workplace so they can add those skills 
to their resumes when they go looking for work. That is very 
critical.
<P>
	Traditionally we have not valued young people in the country. 
I know that sounds like a horrible thing to say and people will 
say it is not true. We value certain types but not others. In 
Ontario we have a 30 per cent dropout rate in the school system. 
That means 30 per cent of our young people after grade 10 have 
no skills, not much education and no hope of finding a job.
<P>
	These are the things we are talking about in our budget. It is 
not just false hope, not just unrealistic plans we are making. The 
budget is very realistic, very credible and very practical in 
dealing with the real problems and solutions that today's 
economy requires and that we should have got into quite some 
time ago frankly.
<P>
	The other aspect I want to get into is small businesses. We talk 
about jobs. All day today many members opposite have been 
talking about jobs. They do not develop automatically. We are in 
a recession.
<P>
	Small businesses create many jobs but they need assistance. 
The budget directly addresses the problem of funding for small 
businesses. It addresses directly the problem with banks and the 
relationship of banks and the lending process. The budget deals 
with setting up structures to create an environment where the 
capital needed by small businesses to create jobs and to expand 
businesses and to invest is there.
<P>
	The budget deals with innovative industries. It tries to ensure 
we can develop new technologies and bring them to market in 
this country making sure that it will also create jobs.
<P>
	These are infrastructures this country needs badly and we 
need to work with. The Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business said that this was a good budget and it was sensitive to 
the needs of small businesses. That is something we said we 
would do and something the budget addresses directly.
<P>
	We have to create jobs but we also have to make sure this 
country's companies and industries are able to do that. 
Therefore we have to develop the environment that allows for 
that.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program has sometimes been reviled and 
criticized by the opposition. It is not a program that simply 
allows a few people to dig some ditches; it is a program that 
creates very serious jobs.
<P>
	The construction industry has been devastated. Thousands of 
construction workers have not worked for three or four years at a 
time and have had to collect assistance. Now they will be able to 
work. Spinoff jobs will be created as a result of the 
infrastructure program. This again will stimulate the economy. 
It will get it going and will create some work and restore hope.
<P>
	Finally, I want to make a point on some of the criticism I have 
heard about child care. We talk about jobs. We talk about young 
people. We talk about economic growth. But then, as some 
members opposite like to say: ``But we must not spend money on 
child care''. How can we assist parents and single parents who 
work part time or work nights in finding jobs or being retrained 
to enter the labour market if we do not provide support, 
subsidize or assist with day care? It is just not possible.
<P>
	We are being totally unfair and not very honest with ourselves 
if we do not deal with the realities of the workplace. That 
demands support and assistance to families and to people who 
cannot get back into the workforce if they do not have that kind 
of support. Therefore criticism about additional moneys as was 
coming from the Reform Party a few minutes ago about child 
care is not acceptable. The budget tries to deal with that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3064"> 3064 </A></B>
<P>
	We are looking at trying to deal with some very complex 
problems in a very difficult time in our history but we need to 
address some of the structural problems. We need to deal with 
these problems. The budget tries to deal with them in a realistic 
way, taking into account the fact that there is not a lot of money 
around. That is true. We also need to deal with the deficit. But 
we are trying to deal with these things with some very practical 
solutions.
<P>
	For my part I hope members opposite will find it important to 
support our young people, to support the small businesses and to 
support those parents who need the assistance to get back into 
the workforce.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I 
wanted to ask a question at lunch time but I did not have time to 
do so. I just want to ask it to the Liberal members in power.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Sir, the question period 
if over. You have ten minutes for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, this is part of my 
speech and it is also part of the budget. I wonder why the new 
business centre of the Canadian embassy in Mexico will be built 
by an American company. I think it is important to talk about 
this because, if we want to create jobs and reduce the deficit, we 
must help Canadian businesses to grow instead of asking foreign 
companies to build our embassies and offices abroad. I put this 
question to the Liberals listening to my speech today, so that 
they can ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs to look into it and 
ensure that Canadian businesses will be approached first when 
we have to build embassies and offices abroad.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I do not know who stole the notes I had in 
front of me but they are gone. Ah, I just found them.
<P>
	First I must explain what a budget is. When a family decides 
to draw up a budget, it starts by calculating its income, just like 
the federal government must determine how much it collects in 
revenues. We know that our revenues amount to some $125 
billion while our expenditures add up to about $160 billion.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	We know that $40 billion go to pay interests on the 
accumulated debt. We know that; this is easy to figure out. What 
is more important in making a budget is to establish an order of 
priority for expenditures. How are we going to spend the money 
so as to improve our well-being. For example, a family may 
decide to first spend on a car, on rent, on clothes, on trips or on 
food. What proportion of our revenue are we going to spend in 
order to improve our lifestyle, respect our priorities and meet 
our needs?
<P>
	It is in that sense that a government must look at its 
expenditures: It must ensure that spending is done in a way that 
best serves people, and it must ensure that these benefits are 
maintained. During the election campaign, it  seemed to me, 
based on the red book, that the Liberals' priority was job 
creation. Even though we did not have the same vision regarding 
the country, we fully shared the Liberal's view on job creation.
<P>
	However, we realized, once they took office, that the Liberals 
had completely changed their vision. For one thing, as several of 
my colleagues pointed out, they targeted the unemployed and 
overlooked manpower training. For five years now, Quebec has 
been saying that it must absolutely have jurisdiction over 
manpower training. Again, there is a unanimous motion before 
Quebec's National Assembly-a motion supported by both the 
Liberal Party of Quebec and the Official Opposition-asking 
that jurisdiction over manpower training be delegated to the 
province by the federal government. As you can see, this is an 
important issue.
<P>
	When a government establishes its spending priorities, it 
should first look at manpower training on a budget level, since 
we are well aware that overlapping in that sector costs some 300 
to 350 million dollars each year. Indeed, 300 to 350 million 
dollars are spent uselessly because of this overlapping in the 
manpower training sector. But the inefficiency related to this 
poor management and this overlapping is also very costly. The 
result is that we have people who get less training and who are 
less prepared to face the competition.
<P>
	I also want to reply to the Reform Party member who made a 
speech this morning and said that Quebec is favoured in the 
Canadian federation. He said that we were receiving more than 
we were giving to Ottawa as regards unemployment insurance. I 
think the hon. member is partly right, but the question is: Do 
Quebeckers want to receive more money strictly to help those 
who are in trouble, or do they want to ensure that they are not in 
such trouble in the future? This is an important distinction, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	We know very well that if we managed our own affairs in 
Quebec, we would recover several billion dollars through 
increased efficiency. This extra $800 million which the federal 
government suggests it is paying to Quebec does not mean 
anything, because this is in the context of the current 
management structure. The day we run our affairs alone, we will 
be much more efficient and we are convinced that we can reduce 
our unemployment more and we will not need that extra money 
because our economy will grow much faster.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Sometimes we in Quebec feel that the federal government 
wants Quebeckers to stay unemployed so that it can say that it is 
giving Quebec more money than Quebeckers pay. We almost 
feel that they are acting deliberately in a way to keep Que-beckers out of work more and more. So that is sort of an answer 
to the questions from Reform Party members, who are quite far 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3065"> 3065 </A></B>
<P>
from Quebec. They do not seem to understand exactly what is 
going on in Quebec.
<P>
	I must also say to the people in the Reform Party that maybe 
they should take a look at Quebec's economic structure.Quebeckers have had some successes these past few years, 
although they had to fight incoherent policies that hurt Quebec's 
development. Despite all that, Quebeckers set up some 
institutions. For example, on the economic level, we have set up 
mutual insurance companies, something quite extraordinary. 
We have the Caisse de dépôt, the Desjardins movement and its 
credit unions, the FTQ fund, the General Investment 
Corporation of Quebec. We built some amazing financial 
institutions.
<P>
	Of course, every time the federal government changes the 
laws or regulations, it affects Quebeckers. If we Quebeckers 
were able to set our own budget priorities and make our own 
laws and regulations, we are sure that we could grow much 
faster and solve this unemployment problem that we have to live 
with and, again, be told by the federal government that we get a 
little more than we give, especially when it comes to 
unemployment and welfare.
<P>
	You know that we Quebeckers have a lot more pride than that. 
We want to have the honour and the privilege of being able to 
develop and to earn our living honourably. For that, the only way 
to succeed is to collect all our own taxes and to make our own 
laws and in that way we can set our own priorities and develop as 
we should, Madam Speaker, and the way to do that is 
sovereignty for Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, 
regarding the budget, I would like to discuss two important 
issues today in the House, namely the proposed changes to the 
unemployment insurance system and the current state of 
employment in the country.
<P>
	I spent the last two weeks in my lovely riding of Frontenac. 
Not only did I have the chance to bring myself up to speed on 
certain issues, I also travelled around my riding. My 
constituents were quite taken aback to see me and questioned my 
motives. ``Is there an election on the horizon?'', some asked me. 
``Is everything all right?'', others wondered.
<P>
	Constituents were surprised that a mere five months after the 
election, their MP would come and thank them for their support 
and discuss their problems. It was certainly a politically 
noteworthy event.
<P>
	My colleagues opposite in the Liberal government would do 
well to adopt the same approach. A visit to their ridings without 
the pressure of an election would open their eyes very quickly to 
the real concerns of their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It certainly would have been useful if the Minister of Finance 
had taken this approach before tabling his budget and especially 
before introducing changes to the unemployment insurance 
system. His team of experts, so far removed from the 
day-to-day world of the unemployed, could have learned a lot.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, as you know, the unemployed in this country 
have been left to fend for themselves. While a great deal of 
lobbying went on in the case of cigarettes and alcohol, no one is 
lobbying on behalf of the unemployment insurance or any other 
similar program.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance reform. There, I have said it. Where 
do we stand on this issue?
<P>
	We are struck the most by the lack of respect the Liberals 
opposite have for the unemployed. Several of the amendments 
to the Unemployment Insurance Act create inequities between 
individuals as well as between regions. I will give you three 
examples of such clauses and provide a brief analysis.
<P>
	Consider, for example, clause 22. It provides for an increase 
in the rate of benefit with the introduction of a dual scale. 
However, according to the Minister of Finance, this increase 
will affect only 15 per cent of claimants, whereas the remaining 
85 per cent will see their benefits reduced to 55 per cent. The 
Minister of Finance has shown his true colours and we now see 
where his social program priorities lie.
<P>
	As for clause 26, it highlights the same kind of contradiction 
on the part of the government. It repeals section 48 of the Act 
and reduces the premium from the rate of $3.07 voted by the 
Liberals in December to $3. This point was made several times 
over the course of the afternoon, but I must emphasize it again. 
With this measure, the minister thinks he will be creating 40,000 
job in 1995, because clause 26 will take effect only in January 
1995. Why did this Liberal government, which is apparently so 
clever, increase the rate of premiums in 1994? Why not reduce it 
immediately? This would mean a loss of employment for 1994 
due to poor planning or lack of goodwill on the part of the 
Finance Minister of a government which calls itself a champion 
of employment and yet jacks up UI premiums. I just cannot 
understand it! The Minister of Finance himself has recognized, 
as reported in <I>Le Soleil</I> on April 8, that the existing UI premiums 
constitute a form of taxation that is killing employment.
<P>
	Coming back to clause 28 now, which provides for the 
reduction of the benefit period and hits Quebec and the 
Maritimes particularly hard. I can see several members opposite 
who represent ridings in the Maritime provinces. The fact of the 
matter is that any region with a rate of unemployment above 10 
per cent will be affected by this measure which, combined with 
tighter eligibility requirements, is causing serious problems, 
particularly for young people, and will automatically shift the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3066"> 3066 </A></B>
<P>
load from UI to welfare. That is what we, in Quebec, call  
shifting responsibility to someone else. And, according to three 
economists from the Université du Québec à Montréal, it will 
cost the province the tidy sum of $280 million.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, the idea behind all this, the spirit of 
this reform is more harmful than the measures per se. There is a 
punitive tinge to it. The Minister of Finance is punishing the 
unemployed for not having jobs. In his mind, this is a choice 
they have made. So, their benefit period will be shortened, their 
cheques chopped, their qualifying period extended, and so on 
and so forth. It is unfair to ask as much from the unemployed as 
the Minister of Finance does. And this has prompted Pierre 
Fortin and his team at the Université du Québec à Montréal to 
say that, for the sake of equity, the government is actually 
forcing the unemployed to make an absolutely disproportionate 
contribution to fiscal consolidation.
<P>
	This measure is forcing the unemployed in Quebec and 
Canada to contribute to the government's efforts to put public 
finances in order and to reduce the deficit. How do you want me 
to sell that in the region of Thetford when, just a short while ago, 
an influential minister, namely the hon. member for 
Hull-Aylmer, was reported to have used a government jet, at a 
cost of $135,000 or $140,000, to give a short speech on the 
so-called benefits of sound management? Sorry, but the 
unemployed in my riding do not buy that.
<P>
	Furthermore, the UI reform is attacking indiscriminately 
cheats, profiteers and unemployed men and women acting in 
good faith. On these words, I will end my short speech on the 
budget tabled by the Minister of Finance. Of course it is 
understood that the Bloc Quebecois will not support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to

Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe-Agriculture; the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Gun control.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
participate this afternoon in the debate on Bill C-17, An Act to 
amend certain statutes to implement certain provisions of the 
budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 1994. If we read the 
explanatory notes, we see that this bill deals with several issues 
and I would like to mention those that interest me the most, 
namely the wage freeze, the CBC, of course, and unemployment 
insurance. I will touch on these issues in my short speech.
<P>
	This morning while listening to the debates because I was on 
today, I heard a member opposite give this bill 98 out of one 
hundred. I have the impression that we did not read the same 
bill. Although some sections are interesting-we cannot say, 
even if we are in opposition, that everything is bad-I would 
find it very hard to give such a high mark to this bill. True, when 
I was a teacher I had a reputation for giving low marks, but I still 
learned to read documents and assess their contents.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Wages are frozen for another two years. This time, they add 
insult to injury by suspending pay increment increases, which is 
worse as it will reduce even more the purchasing power of all 
public servants and all those targeted by this bill. I did not take 
any economics classes but, in my opinion, the more people's 
purchasing power is reduced, the slower the economy recovers. 
That is my impression, in any case.
<P>
	So I do not see how this measure will put people back to work. 
The government is always talking about job creation. I would 
very much like to have, outside the Parliament buildings, a 
thermometer that would allow us to see every morning the 
number of jobs created by this government. We are used to red 
mercury, but we would probably see the thermometer dip to the 
freezing point quite often, without rising again because lost jobs 
would also be recorded. It would be hard to get the mercury to 
rise. The exercise could be extremely interesting, given how the 
government side crows over that project saying it will create 
40,000 jobs. They want people to believe them, but they can 
never tell us how many jobs were really created the day before.
<P>
	In my region, I hear people say: ``Yes, three jobs were created, 
but yesterday eight jobs were lost. We are still five jobs short, 
even if we have three new jobs today.'' I think they should stop 
trying to convince people that so many jobs have been created. If 
there were that many new jobs, we would not have such high 
unemployment levels. This is self-evident, I would say.
<P>
	With the wage and pay increment freeze, how will the pay 
equity problem which affects mainly women be resolved? 
Exceptional measures were adopted to provide for the Civilian 
Reduction Program. Here again, this could have been handled 
differently. We could have said: ``O.K. We will freeze the pay 
increments and wages, but at the same time we will resolve the 
pay equity problem.'' That would have been a positive measure 
to take in order to revitalize the economy, since a good segment 
of the population would have regained some of its purchasing 
power, which it does not have because of a kind of 
discrimination that is allowed to go on in the federal system. By 
the way, the Quebec government was able to put an end to this 
kind of discrimination, thanks to the settlement it reached with 
the central labour bodies. In my mind, that would have been a 
very positive measure to take, but they blew it!
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3067"> 3067 </A></B>
<P>
	The first time I spoke on the budget, I mentioned that a lot of 
the workers in my riding have seasonal jobs. Fortunately for all 
of us and also for the Japanese it would seem, crab fishing has 
resumed. Some people will now leave the unemployment lines 
and get back to work. This will make the unemployment rate go 
up and down. And it is from these monthly figures, which do not 
reflect the true situation, at least from my point of view, that we 
are going to decide how many weeks of benefits people will be 
entitled to or what percentage they will receive, and so on.
<P>
	So, we are using a measure which is arbitrary and sometimes 
far-fetched, because if you take the overall number of people fit 
for work who are between the age of 18 and 55 and compare this 
real number to the famous rate we hear about all the time, you 
would be quite surprised.
<P>
	Now, daycare was mentioned in the red book. But, it was 
announced that no money would bet set aside in this year's 
budget for daycare. So, we were not to expect a miracle, because 
this party only does was it promised to do. Moreover, daycare 
subsidies were linked to the GDP. However, we do expect 
families to take care of their children, whether the GDP is rising 
or over 3 per cent. To my way of thinking, it is important that 
children be taken care of, whether the gross domestic product 
stands at 3 per cent, 2 per cent, or 1 per cent. It seems to me that, 
especially in this International Year of the Family, this shows a 
severe lack of vision and long-term planning on the part of the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	So, when it comes to job creation, if we look at Heritage 
Canada, which is, as you know, my favourite department, we 
find that the budget of the National Film Board was reduced by 
$600,000. Why? To prevent independent directors from making 
movies. They create jobs but we cut there too. We heard this 
afternoon and yesterday about francophones outside Quebec. 
When we cut what is set aside for francophones outside Quebec 
by 5 per cent, we cut jobs. They cannot afford to keep their 
employees. Thanks to this measure, francophone organizations 
outside Quebec will undoubtedly disappear and very soon only 
anglophone members will represent Canada in this House. There 
will not be francophone members from Canada any more.
<P>
	So, in my mind, this is also a serious problem. This 
department is always cutting jobs. In the case of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation, this great agency which receives 
$1.2 or $1.3 billion yearly from the government, it has been 
known for a long time that CBC has a major problem, that is a 
structural loss of revenue.
<P>
	In 1990, it was decided to cut the fat and to get rid of the 
regions so that CBC would have the dough it needed to solve its 
problems. Madam Speaker, the figures are astounding. This 
year, that is in 1993-94, CBC will have a $41 million deficit that 
will be covered by the staff  pension fund surplus. Next year, the 
estimated $31 million deficit will be met the same way.
<P>
	I can go on and on. In 1998-99, the deficit is going to reach 
$178 million. To top it all, CBC was just given authority to 
borrow $25 million in order to unfairly compete against private 
corporations and buy the broadcasting rights for the Atlanta 
Games at a cost of $28 million. Obviously, there is something 
wrong with that. This is a major problem. Assistance to athletes 
is cut, but we are going to support the Atlanta Games by paying 
two and a half times more for the broadcasting rights than CTV 
or Tele-Metropole were ready to pay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
many of us are newcomers in this House and we are here to try to 
improve the lot of our constituents. Unfortunately, 
unemployment plagues our country, especially in rural ridings.
<P>
	In 1987, a Senate committee published a report containing 
frightening figures. That was one of the rare occasions in which 
the Senate was useful. Do you know what they said? They said 
that keeping someone on unemployment was more expensive for 
the government than creating a job for him or her. According to 
this report, in 1985, an unemployed person earned an average of 
$14,040 a year before losing his job.
<P>
	Once on unemployment, the same person received more than 
$14,645 in various benefits from the three levels of government. 
That means that when a potential unemployed person works, he 
or she costs $14,040 in salary and produces $14,040 in goods 
and services.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	So, society gets something back for the salary paid to that 
person. When, on the contrary, we pay that person to produce 
nothing, there is no benefit for the community. Where is this 
government's logic? Does it really care about the dignity of men 
and women?
<P>
	The recent budget of the Minister of Finance shows that he 
does not care at all about the reality I just described.
<P>
	Since 1968, the cost of unemployment has equaled the 
national debt. None of the measures put forward by previous 
governments, neither new technologies nor export expansion 
nor reducting the size of government, could make a dent in the 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	There are solutions. It is only by putting the unemployed back 
to work that we will succeed in reducing the deficit. And it is 
only by creating jobs that we will stimulate growth without 
causing inflation to rise.
<P>
	The solutions are within our grasp, but we must have the will 
to implement them. This inaction has terrible consequences for 
the people.
<P>
	Allowing people to stay idle is to strip them of their dignity, to 
tie their hands and feet and leave them in the dark, to make them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3068"> 3068 </A></B>
<P>
suffer. Allowing people to stay idle is also to drive them to 
rebellion, to violence and to suicide.
<P>
	In my riding, during the election campaign, some people 
committed suicide because they had been jobless for five years. 
Two brothers went around and knocked on every door. They 
were told everywhere that there were no openings. I thought that 
this would stop with the new government. But in my riding, 
there are other problems. It is a rural area, an area where 
unemployment is even higher than elsewhere, and you have no 
idea of the kinds of problems that unemployment can create in 
some families.
<P>
	Finally, forcing people to become unemployed is to force 
them and their whole family to live in shame. It is not only the 
unemployed themselves, but their whole family, their whole 
environment.
<P>
	Would it not be more profitable for all communities to give 
work to everybody at a minimum wage? I ask the question. Of 
course, there are some problems with a minimum wage, but it is 
a solution that we should consider.
<P>
	The Economic Council of Canada simulated the 
implementation of such a program under which, for the 
production of essential goods and the provision of essential 
services, unemployed people would get on average as much as 
they were making when they had a job. The Council even found 
that not only was this program workable, it would not increase 
inflation, nor the deficit, nor the tax rate.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Would it not be worth considering? Through such profitable 
programs, and without hurting organized labour-as everybody 
has the right to work-and without additional cost to the 
government, we could use these people to launch a national 
child care program and a home care service program for the 
elderly. How many senior citizens are in need of that service? 
We have nobody to send to help them.
<P>
	Moreover, we could set up a genuine manpower development 
program. We could even launch a national program for the 
revitalization of poor neighbourhoods in our large cities. We 
could set up a program to help farmers deal with the new 
realities of the marketplace. As you know, farmers work very 
hard. They need labourers, but they do not have any.
<P>
	In my district as elsewhere in the rural world, many people 
can create jobs. I will conclude with the words of our great poet, 
Félix Leclerc: ``The best way to kill people is to pay them to do 
nothing''. Paying people to do nothing. I think the government 
opposite is trying to organize something only temporarily 
because people are being asked to tighten their belts again. They 
will need twelve weeks of work to be entitled to UI benefits. 
When they do not receive UI benefits, they live on welfare, and 
that is how these people are being killed, in the end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-17, 
that ill-advised legislation of the Liberal government on 
unemployment insurance will affect three and a half million 
Canadians. Workers in Canada and Quebec who lost their jobs 
may not know it yet, but they also lost up to four months of 
benefits.
<P>
	Workers are not and should not be considered as responsible 
for the lack of jobs and the long unemployment spells before 
they can find a new job.
<P>
	By reducing benefits this government will only inflict greater 
suffering and poverty on the jobless, their families and their 
communities. Those reductions put the blame and the burden of 
unemployment on them, and that is unfair and morally 
unacceptable. Many jobless in my riding in the North End of 
Montreal, some of whom voted for the Liberals in the last 
election, are really angry about those kinds of antisocial and 
cruel policies.
<P>
	But there is worse. The systematic attack by the Liberal 
government against the most vulnerable in our society, against 
the jobless is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, everybody remembers what the Prime Minister said 
when he was Leader of the Opposition. Posing as the champion 
of social rights, he decried the policies of the Conservatives 
who, with Bill C-105, attacked the unemployed instead of 
unemployment. Those are the very words of the Prime Minister. 
It is mind-boggling.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the red book, which served as bible and 
election platform for the Liberal Party in the last campaign, we 
can read word for word on page 74: ``The Tories have 
systematically weakened the social support network that took 
generations to build. Not only have they taken away billions of 
dollarsfrom. . . people who have lost their jobs, but they have set us on a 
path to becoming a polarized society, divided into rich and 
poor-''
<P>
	Seeing how fast the federal government did exactly the 
opposite of what it promised and went even farther than the 
Conservatives in its attack on the most disadvantaged, we can 
rightly say that this government cynically misled the people for 
the sole purpose of getting elected.
<P>
	In fact, not only has the government maintained the same 
immoral and punitive policy that it denounced when the 
previous government presented Bill C-105, but it has done 
worse.
<P>
	Since the UI program was created 54 years ago, no change of 
this magnitude has ever been made. No government has ever 
taken such odious, retrograde and unjust measures against the 
very people this government publicly promised to help.
<P>
	This project hits hardest regions where jobs are the most 
difficult to find. Indeed, the deepest cuts will be made in areas 
where the regional unemployment rate is the highest. So, in a 
city with a 6 per cent unemployment rate, a worker who is laid 
off after nine months will lose five weeks of benefits. But in 
Montreal, where the  unemployment rate exceeds 13 per cent, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3069"> 3069 </A></B>
<P>
and also in the Maritimes, the reduction for the same 
employment period will be twice as big, that is a ten-week 
reduction.
<P>
	The government seems to think that the system to which 
workers are contributing is being systematically abused by 
those people who most frequently rely on unemployment 
insurance. Hence, it considers some citizens as being less 
deserving than others, simply because they live in less fortunate 
areas of the country or work in seasonal industries. It is as if we 
were to refuse to give health insurance benefits to chronically ill 
people because they rely on the system more often than others.
<P>
	For ten years I was a part-time arbitrator at the 
unemployment insurance office in Montreal. In that capacity, I 
witnessed numerous disturbing tragedies suffered by people 
who were seeing their benefits being cut off for different 
reasons. These people who were already living under the 
poverty level were then forced to give up their home because, 
under these conditions, they were no longer able to pay their 
mortgage.
<P>
	These human tragedies have increased and have become even 
more dramatic since April 1993, when Bill C-113 passed by the 
Conservative government was implemented.
<P>
	The government should take into consideration the findings 
of a recent Gallup poll which sets at 70 per cent the number of 
people in Quebec who oppose this unemployment insurance 
reform which will certainly reduce the number of UI 
beneficiaries, but will increase by the same number the total of 
welfare recipients.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Reducing unemployment insurance payments, as the 
government is doing, will not give jobs to the men and women 
thrown out of the work force, even though the Minister of 
Finance is claiming that the 2.28 per cent reduction in UI 
premiums for employers will create 40,000 jobs. If this screwy 
logic were true, all we would have to do would be to reduce the 
premiums by another 85 per cent to find jobs for all the 
unemployed in Canada.
<P>
	In February 1993 already, 50,000 people braved an Abitibian 
cold of minus 25 to demonstrate against a similar bill tabled by 
former minister André Valcourt.
<P>
	Yesterday, the caucus of the Bloc Quebecois received the 
major leaders of the FTQ-the Quebec Labour Federation-for 
which I worked for 19 years. They voiced their strong 
opposition to the cuts in social programs, and in particular to 
Bill C-17.
<P>
	On May 1st of this year, the major Quebec unions will be 
holding a gigantic demonstration against the neo-conservative 
policies of the Liberal governments of Canada and Quebec. Rest 
assured, Madam Speaker, that I will be there.
<P>
	The Canadian union movement-I conclude, Madam 
Speaker-is unanimous in its opposition to Bill C-17, and this 
includes the CLC which has 2.2 million members. For all these 
reasons, I will vote against the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Bill C-17 
proposes many amendments to the Unemployment Insurance 
Act. One of the first occurs in clause 21 and aims at defining the 
word ``disentitled'', ``inadmissible'' in the other language. It 
explains in a very specific and pragmatic way the reasons or 
conditions why someone could be disentitled to unemployment 
insurance benefits according to the government. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development and his advisors have gone to a 
lot of trouble to define a very simple word.
<P>
	If the minister had simply looked in the dictionary to find the 
meaning of the word ``inadmissible'', he would have recognized 
the very essence of his bill.
<P>
	Allow me to quote <I>Webster's New World Dictionary</I>, in the 
hope that this will give the minister the inspiration he needs so 
badly before his bill is passed. I ask the hon. minister to listen 
carefully to the universal definition of ``inadmissible''. In the 
third edition of the Webster's, they say: ``not admissible, not to 
be allowed, accepted, granted or conceded''.
<P>
	Therefore, that term defines Bill C-17. In drafting the 
legislation, did the minister wonder about what is really 
``inadmissible'', according to the unemployed of this country?
<P>
	These people are deprived of one of their most fundamental 
rights, the right to earn an honest living, the right to contribute 
proudly to the economic development of their community.
<P>
	What is ``inadmissible'' for these people, more than anything 
else, is their inability to meet the conditions set forth in 
paragraph B of section 28.3 of the Unemployment Insurance 
Act. No, what is ``inadmissible'', what they cannot accept, is 
that the government, on top of standing idly by as far as job 
creation is concerned, is once again targeting the disadvantaged 
as the solution to its debt and deficit problems.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberals kept promising 
that they would not touch social programs. The last federal 
budget contained some surprises in this regard. Of course, old 
age pensions were left alone, but some tax credits were cleverly 
eliminated.
<P>
	The same thing happened to federal transfers for social 
assistance: transfers were not reduced, but access to the UI 
program was, which in turn increases the social assistance bill 
for the provinces. In Quebec, these measures will not only result 
in a loss of revenues for the unemployed, but also in a series of 
additional expenses that all Quebeckers will end up paying for 
sooner or later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3070"> 3070 </A></B>
<P>
	A recent study by the economics department of the Université 
du Québec à Montréal revealed that the changes the minister 
intends to make to the Unemployment Insurance Act and the 
resulting transfer of expenses will cost the Quebec treasury 
more than $280 million, or 28 per 100 of the $1 billion bill which 
was dumped on the provinces.
<P>
	Has the government not yet understood that it will only solve 
its financial problems by creating permanent jobs? Instead of 
constantly bearing down on senior citizens and unemployed 
Canadians, the government should focus its energy on creating 
jobs that would allow it to increase its revenues in a healthy 
fashion.
<P>
	The closure of the Hyundai plant in my riding of 
Brome-Missisquoi is a good example of the confusion that 
exists within the government with regard to maintaining stable 
and high-paying jobs, like those that the Bromont plant offered 
until recently. We are talking here about 850 jobs that were lost.
<P>
	The government does not know which way to turn and adds to 
the confusion since Hyundai has announced that it does not 
intend to reopen the Bromont plant.
<P>
	The Minister of International Trade, like a heroic avenger, 
rushed to Korea to obtain all the details concerning this matter. 
Upon his return, he made a reassuring announcement, saying 
that everything was settled and that the Bromont plant would 
reopen in the not too distant future.
<P>
	The next day, Hyundai announced that it did not intend to 
resume its activities in Quebec until 1997-98. Who should we 
believe? While the government is treading water on this matter, 
the employees of the plant and their families and the entire 
population of the Eastern Townships are waiting for real 
answers about their economic future.
<P>
	All they have learned until now is that if they manage to find a 
temporary or seasonal job, it will be more and more difficult for 
them to get unemployment insurance if Bill C-17 is passed.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development that he should consult the dictionary 
before asking the House to pass his bill. Maybe he would see that 
the word ``inadmissible'' applies to the way his bill is drafted 
and maybe he would be more inclined to listen to the 
recommendations put forward by the hon. member for Mercier 
on behalf of the Official Opposition.
<P>
	These amendments to Bill C-17 would perhaps help chase the 
word ``inadmissible'' from the mind of every unemployed man 
and woman across Canada.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, it is an 
honour to be able to speak in this House and it is a privilege that 
most of us appreciate. However, it is sad that we sometimes have 
to speak on a measure that would impose cuts on the most needy 
in our society.
<P>
	A few months ago, we would never have thought that we 
would see the implementation of a budget whose main thrust is 
to hurt and injure the unemployed. Our hopes were high and we 
thought that the creative mind of the Minister of Finance would 
lead him to choose the best mix of solutions to control the deficit 
and put the government's finances back in order.
<P>
	Our present finance minister is no better than the Liberal 
Minister of Finance we had when our Prime Minister was 
himself Minister of Finance and beat all the records for 
increased deficits during his term.
<P>
	One would have thought that a few years of reflection in the 
opposition, a few new faces, some ideas mentioned in the 
so-called red book would have given the Liberals a broader and 
more humane vision of the problems our society is confronted 
with. But no, the recipes are the same old ones. We blamed the 
Conservative government for its erroneous forecasts, we said 
that its finance minister was disconnected from reality, that he 
did not understand a thing about the workings of the economy, 
that his measures were counterproductive and that they were 
wreaking havoc instead of helping put our house back in order.
<P>
	We went from bad to worse. The last budget was produced by 
an amateur, who made forecasting errors estimated at several 
billion dollars. He is an amateur who, oblivious to the influence 
of a finance minister's statements on financial markets, toyed 
with the value of our dollar and the nerves of the financial 
leaders. He is an amateur whose only solution to reducing the 
deficit was to attack the most needy members of our society.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues who took part in this debate have 
given some really pathetic examples. With the human misery we 
see nowadays, when 20, 22 per cent or more of the population 
are jobless in some areas, our Minister of Finance, a man of 
original mind who was promising us the moon, has found a 
magic solution. He will cut UI benefits and shift the unemployed 
on to the welfare rolls.
<P>
	When I asked a question of the Minister of Finance and of the 
Prime Minister, I was flabbergasted to hear them both candidly 
tell us: Well, we will cut unemployment insurance and take that 
money to create jobs, and the unemployed worker, instead of 
receiving UI benefits, will be going to work. That sort of 
reasoning does not stand up. If they do believe in their own job 
creation strategy, we have an alternative formula for them. Why 
did they not create jobs first and cut unemployment insurance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3071"> 3071 </A></B>
<P>
afterwards? That is what the Minister of Finance should have 
done but did not do, and  that is why we cannot accept these 
measures attacking the poorest members of our society.
<P>
	In the exclusive club of the finance minister's friends, it is 
obvious that the easiest way to get back on the road to prosperity 
is to slash transfer payments to individuals in the budget. Keep 
shifting your problems onto the shoulders of the provinces. 
What a nice federation, really, what a nice confederation this is. 
Talk about responsible government. Keep unloading your 
problems onto the provinces, as if provincial deficits did not 
matter. Some people find this situation funny. But, Madam 
Speaker, is it not the height of irresponsibility to be laughing and 
making fun when the House is about to vote a bill that will cut 
benefits for the poorest in our society. You really have to be 
irresponsible to keep laughing when the government is about to 
dump the unemployed onto welfare rolls.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The minister quoted employment statistics. Do you know why 
unemployment is dropping? Because people are so discouraged 
they do not even want to say they are looking for a job. There is 
no hope in this country for the young, for seasonal workers, for 
people who can usually earn a living by working five or six 
months a year. There is no hope left for those people. They no 
longer say that they are looking for a job. The worst part is that 
the young are the most severely affected by this unfortunate 
reform by the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government. 
Those young people have no hope.
<P>
	Somebody said that the best way to kill a man is to keep him 
from working. The Minister of Finance is sacrificing future 
generations because of his lack of originality, his inability to 
come up with new and dynamic solutions, his inability to attract 
social activists, entrepreneurs, unions, business people, 
merchants, people with ideas to develop. The Minister of 
Finance failed to create consultation forums from which the 
original ideas he was unable to have could have emerged. It was 
much too difficult, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance traveled across Canada. He met all 
his friends, economists, experts, people from different 
backgrounds, but he was unable to create a dynamic of social 
consultation which would have helped us find new and original 
solutions. He wants examples? A simple one springs to mind: it 
is <I>Corvée habitation</I>, a Quebec housing program which lasted a 
few years. It was a marvellous program which associated 
unions, entrepreneurs, business people and citizens around one 
same cause, the pursuit of a noble aim, to put people to work and 
to stimulate the economy. It was the finest example of a group 
assuming its responsibilities for the unemployed and people 
who are suffering. But because he acted irresponsibly, the 
Minister of Finance did not get to know these original solutions. 
If he really believes what he says, why did he not create jobs first 
and reduce UI benefits after? No, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Time is a detail for a technocrat like the Minister of Finance. 
The period of time during which an unemployed 25 year-old 
man with two children exhausts his UI benefits and has to go on 
welfare before he finds another job three or four years later is a 
technical detail for a technocrat like the Minister of Finance. It 
is an inhuman approach.
<P>
	We cannot agree with such a piece of legislation. It is immoral 
to propose such measures in the House. How do you expect us to 
be able to show our faces in our ridings? How do you expect our 
fellow citizens to believe in the work that is being done here, 
when these people opposite promised jobs, jobs and jobs 
throughout the election campaign? The first steps that were 
taken were not creating jobs, but creating more poor people. 
This government will have created the greatest number of poor 
people; it will win the championship not for creating jobs, but 
for creating poverty. That is what this government will have 
done. That is what this minister of Finance will have done, a 
minister without ideas, without imagination, incapable of 
consulting people, incapable of taking his role seriously, 
incapable of estimating his deficit and totally incapable of 
evaluating the disastrous effects of unemployment insurance 
cuts on the poor people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me say to you that this budget-you are 
telling me that I have one minute left-will have been a terrible 
budget in terms of cuts. Working people are facing cuts, people 
who earn money, even very little, such as old people, are being 
targeted. The provinces are being targeted because the deficit is 
being shifted onto their shoulders. Everyone in Canada, all those 
who deal with the Canadian economy have been wrongly 
targeted. Here is a man without any imagination, a reform that 
hurts and an insensitivity that will cost you dearly one day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this budget is an irresponsible budget. It is a budget 
which does not reflect the promises contained in the red book. 
Quebeckers knew that very well. They did not buy the promises 
of the Liberals and did not elect many of them: no more than 19, 
and mainly in Montreal's West Island. Quebeckers were aware 
that it was all wind. This is the reason why Quebeckers will soon 
break with this system. And I am sure the Liberals know that as 
well.
<P>
	I see ministers confirming what I am saying. The members on 
the other side know all about it, really. We can see them even if 
they try to hide from the camera, but when we talk about that, 
they are not comfortable. They know that when we go over the 
commitments of the red book one by one, it is clear that they do 
not appear in the Budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3072"> 3072 </A></B>
<P>
	I am thinking of social housing for instance. I have discussed 
that issue with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the hon. member 
for Papineau-Saint-Michel who said again and again during 
the election campaign: ``It's terrible what the Conservatives 
have done. They have cut social housing but we, the Liberals, 
will fix that.'' If you compare the Liberal budget to the 
Conservative budget, they are the same, they contain the same 
measures. There is nothing for social housing. So much so that 
social housing interest groups in Montreal and the mayor of 
Montreal denounced this week the federal government's lack of 
action in the social housing sector.
<P>
	They asked for federal intervention because for years the 
federal government was active in that sector, investing in it, 
creating expectations and then it pulls out, as it did in other 
sectors, leaving all the responsibility to the provincial 
governments. Now those governments are passing that 
responsibility to municipal authorities, who pass it on to 
taxpayers who can no longer afford to pay their taxes.
<P>
	I know that taxes do not create any hardship for the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands because his way of living 
in Kingston has nothing to do with the conditions in which the 
unemployed workers live in Quebec. There may be, of course, a 
military college where francophones will not feel at home. A 
city where high schools are not even equipped with toilets for 
the students. I understand why the member for Kingston and the 
Islands does not spend much time in the French high school in 
Kingston. He has natural needs to be satisfied now and then.
<P>
	As regards POWA, the Program for Older Worker 
Adjustment, we have seen the whip of the Official Opposition 
who is now whip of the government, the member for 
Saint-Léonard, the member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, the 
member for LaSalle-Émard present a petition of 10,000 
signatures denouncing the fact that older workers outside 
Montreal, Toronto and a few other large centres had no access to 
programs. They have no access to those programs because a 
given number of workers must be laid off at the same time.
<P>
	Everybody was against that! There were demonstrations in 
Montreal in February, there were promises: when we take office, 
we will change things. Only to discover that nothing has been 
done as far as the Program for Older Worker Adjustment, called 
POWA. Not only that, an MP, parliamentary secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, has come to justify 
the position of the government, using word for word the same 
arguments used by a conservative MP and minister last year. A 
copy-cat!
<P>
	Industrial conversion! The last straw! The helicopter program 
is cancelled. Alright. Quebec was in favour. And this is in 
Quebec, I remind you. On the other hand, the tank contract in 
Toronto was left untouched. This is a different matter. The tank 
contract has been respected. I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, 
that if necessary rescue  operations by helicopter are possible, 
but rescue operations by tank are rare.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> No cuts were made, but we were told that 
money was going to be injected in a fund for industrial 
conversion. However, there is nothing in this program. We are 
told that there is still the program created a few years ago, a 
program that the Minister of Finance disapproved, saying that it 
was totally inadequate. What the Minister of Finance is telling 
us this year is exactly what the Conservatives were telling us.
<P>
	As far as women are concerned, the Deputy Prime Minister 
came to Montreal for a political show, saying that specific 
measures were going to be taken in favour of women. But what 
is there in this budget? Social housing is a major concern for 
women who are single parents. Nothing. When you say that from 
now on, you will take into account whether or not there is a 
supplementary revenue in a couple to make it clear as to the 
unemployment insurance benefits a person will be entitled to 
receive, that concerns mostly women. Then, you go witch 
hunting. A bit like the Bourrassa hit squad, the 
boubou-macoutes, in Quebec, there will be the Martin hit 
squad-the Rin-Tin-Tin brigade?-which is going to check if a 
person lives alone and is entitled to 57 or 55 per cent.
<P>
	In fact, those measures are specifically designed for women. 
Those measures are reactionary and aggressive. You also 
promised health care centres for women and day care centres. 
Then again, we are told that we will have to wait. In three to four 
years, you will come back promising day care centres. A bit like 
Duplessis, who said that anyone who promised to build the same 
bridge at each election would be certain to hold power for ten 
years or so. Day care centres were promised by the Trudeau 
Liberals, the Turner Liberals and the Chrétien Liberals. 
However, as long as the Liberals are in power, our grandchildren 
and our great-grandchildren will never enjoy day care centres.
<P>
	Just think of the cuts in the social programs. During three 
Conservative budgets, all we heard about was cutbacks. 
Meanwhile, the Liberals, who have sensitive souls, kept on 
saying that it was terrible and, while referring to the fine words 
the Prime Minister had on Canada, said that we had to restore the 
help for assistance to social and minority groups. However, the 
Prime Minister reduces help for all French-speaking groups. He 
does not do what he says he is going to do. That is exactly how he 
behaves.
<P>
	I believe that my time has expired. I will come back to that 
later.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should reach agreements 
with the government of Quebec to reactivate the co-operative housing program, 
introduce a renovation assistance program for rental housing and reintroduce a 
social housing program, while leaving complete authority for all these programs 
in the hands of the government of Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, the motion I have the honour to 
present today in the House is composed of two very distinct 
parts, the reinstatement of several social housing programs and 
the transfer of authority for such programs to Quebec. I will first 
comment on the two parts separately before explaining how they 
are linked together.
<P>
	Let us begin with the reactivation of social housing programs. 
Canada is one of the industrialized countries investing the least 
in social housing. In fact, in 1990, the national social research 
institute noted that social housing accounted for only 4 per cent 
of all housing in Canada, whereas it varied between 15 and 40 
per cent in most Western European economies. One can wonder 
why there is such a difference in housing policies between 
governments facing the same economic ups and downs.
<P>
	This government replaced an administration renowned for its 
weak commitment towards social housing. Nevertheless, if our 
new government goes on the way it chose in the last budget, its 
record after one mandate will be even worse than the previous 
one's.
<P>
	A review of the social housing situation over the last few 
years is imperative. In accordance with a 1986 
federal-provincial agreement, funding for social housing built 
in Quebec was shared by Quebec and Ottawa. In the case of 
low-cost housing, federal funding was at 59 per cent. For 
housing cooperatives and non-profit housing for low-income 
persons, it reached 75 per cent. Pierre Graveline, journalist at <I>Le 
Devoir</I>, mentioned in an article published on April 5, 1994 that 
one out of six households renting their dwelling must spend 
more than half its income in rent and one out of three spends 
more than 30 per cent. Since this is too much for some of them, 
the number of claims presented by owners who want to cancel 
the leases and recover their rent has increased by 250 per cent 
between 1990 and 1993. In all, 341,000 households have a core 
housing need in Quebec and would be admissible to social 
housing, and I am not counting the 20,000 totally homeless 
persons.
<P>
	In fact, between 1989 and 1994, federal expenditures for the 
building and renovation of housing units have gone from $112 
million to zero. As for federal budgets for building new 
cooperative housing, they went from $7.2 million in 1988 to 
nothing in 1992.
<P>
	Therefore, people who need housing in Canada have lost a 
total of $119.2 million. Even if, during the last campaign, the 
Liberals committed themselves to unfreeze the CMHC's budget 
in order to make it possible to build 5,000 new cooperative 
housing units annually in Canada, they have made no provision 
for cooperative housing and the building of housing units. On 
February 16, 1994, when answering a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois who was asking if the rents of the recipients would in 
fact increase by 5 per cent of their income, the Minister of 
Public Works declared, in this House: ``One cannot put a hand 
on one's heart and plead for new social housing for Canadians 
across this country and only look at one side of the ledger, which 
is to cut expenditures and duplication, without looking at the 
other aspect in terms of revenue increases''.
<P>
	How can this government make such statements? How can 
this government calmly contemplate the idea of charging the 
population it wants to help for the cost of the assistance it 
brings? This is what will happen in fact. The government will 
say to the have-nots of our society: We will help you find 
housing because you are poor, but you will have to pay an 
additional 5 per cent of your income for rent to cover the costs of 
that help.
<P>
	How can any government look at a social housing program as 
if it were a business deal meant to bring in profit?
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Does the word ``social'' mean anything to this government? 
Madam Speaker, the poor should not have to bear the cost of 
social housing. Governments should cut unnecessary spending 
and reinvest these amounts in programs for the neediest 
members of our society.
<P>
	Different problems require different solutions. People on low 
incomes who are home-owners need financial help to make 
repairs. The RRAP program which has just been reinstated can 
provide a partial response to this kind of situation. 
Unfortunately, the program has its limitations: income criteria 
are such that very few people living in urban areas can take 
advantage of the program.
<P>
	On the other hand, certain needs are no longer being met. 
Take, for instance, people who would like to be part of a housing 
co-operative. This type of housing meets a specific need. Often 
it may be the only way for low and middle-income families to 
become home-owners.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3074"> 3074 </A></B>
<P>
	In its report released in May 1991, the Conseil de la famille 
said that ``a housing co-operative is an excellent way to help 
families become acquainted with the responsibilities and 
advantages of home-ownership''.
<P>
	It is also a fact that housing co-operatives generate 
employment, whether we are talking about construction or 
renovation. Furthermore, every new co-operative housing unit 
that is built provides governments with significant tax revenues, 
including personal and corporate income tax, contributions to 
the Canada Pension Plan, sales tax and development tax. 
Finally, providing access to home ownership makes it possible 
to free accommodation for other families that are in need.
<P>
	There are also people on low incomes who want access to 
low-cost rental housing. As we all know, there is no budget for 
building new units. According to the FRAPRU, we would need 
at least 195,000 new social housing units in Canada. In 
Saint-Sauveur alone, in my riding, an estimated 3,000 new units 
would be required. However, this government has decided not to 
build any.
<P>
	When he appeared before the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, Mr. Brown, president of the canadian 
housing coalition, questioned payments made under the Canada 
Assistance Plan for housing. Like other coalition members, he 
feels that this money could be better spent. They decry the fact 
that a good part of this money goes towards paying the rent and 
ends up in the landlord's pocket. According to Mr. Brown, it is 
not an investment. Instead of being invested in co-op or 
non-profit housing programs, this money is just poured down 
the drain. We agree with Mr. Brown.
<P>
	Current rehabilitation assistance programs for rental housing 
are inadequate. As a matter of fact, studies have shown that 
instead of dealing with things that are important for tenants, 
such as insulation and soundproofing, renovations are done for 
purely cosmetic reasons. Between 1990 and 1992, in Quebec 
alone, $44.84 million went towards painting against $7.31 
million for insulation and soundproofing. One will understand 
that poor insulation affects only tenants since they are the ones 
who have to pay for their own power and heating bills. It was 
also noted that there was no systematic control of rent increases 
after renovations.
<P>
	A study undertaken by the City of Montreal in 1989 showed 
that renovations had disastrous consequences for tenants. It was 
found that the average rent increase was $127 a month. 
Similarly, a CMHC survey concluded that subsidies benefited 
landlords, not their tenants.
<P>
	Indeed, slightly more than half of these tenants stayed in their 
apartments after the renovations and they experienced an 
average rent increase of 11 per cent. So, we can draw the 
conclusion that, in the end, tenants pay for part of the landlord's 
investments and that rents still keep on increasing.
<P>
	To remedy such a situation, we believe that the government 
should implement measures to ensure that subsidies for 
renovations benefit tenants.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	The government could also be in favour of grants being 
directly paid to tenants, which would allow them to get some 
decent housing or even buy a house. This would help people who 
spend more than 25 per cent of their income on rent. As we have 
seen, the needs are great and the programs are inadequate.
<P>
	Let us now talk of Quebec's control. The Canadian 
government stresses the fact that it needs the cooperation of the 
provinces. In Quebec's case in particular, we believe that this 
cooperation is unnecessary, since the whole housing assistance 
budget should be transferred to Quebec, and Quebec should have 
total control over it.
<P>
	The federal government entered the social housing field by 
virtue of its spending power, whereas social housing is first and 
foremost a provincial jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Duff, on behalf of 
the Supreme Court of Canada, stated in 1938, in the referral on 
the Ontario Adoption Act: ``Provinces have the responsibility to 
care for people in need''. Nobody will deny the fact that social 
housing is for people in need.
<P>
	We demand that the federal government give back to Quebec 
total control over social housing programs. We demand also that 
it transfer to Quebec the amounts that are due to it according to 
the needs of the Quebec people.
<P>
	As it was said over and over again, 25 per cent of all renting 
households in Canada that spend more than 30 per cent of their 
income on rent are in Quebec, and 33 per cent of those which 
must set aside more than 50 per cent of their income just for rent 
are also in Quebec. It shows how important social housing is for 
Quebec. It is important that the Quebec government be able to 
decide, according to its needs, its organizational structures and 
its social priorities, where it wants to invest.
<P>
	For investments to be more efficient, it is important that the 
decision-making process be exclusively in the hands of 
provincial and local authorities. It is important that the 
allocation criteria be based upon the situation in Quebec, and 
not the situation in other parts of Canada. Also important is the 
harmonization of the social housing programs with other social 
programs made for and by Quebec, for and by its citizens. 
Quebeckers do not want the federal government to interfere in 
areas of jurisdiction they consider their very own.
<P>
	Thus, to get better social housing, we need massive 
investments, under various forms, to meet the needs of all 
Canadians and Quebeckers. However, Quebec wants these 
investments to be managed by its own government, according to 
its needs, its standards and priorities. Social housing is only one 
component 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3075"> 3075 </A></B>
<P>
of social programs, which fall under provincial jurisdiction. 
Quebec must be put in charge as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in 
the House today to address the motion.
<P>
	Frankly I am dismayed by the apparent substance of the hon. 
member's motion. From my reading of it, she is in favour of 
receiving funding for housing but with no strings attached.
<P>
	Not only does this go against all logic and common sense, it 
goes against the spirit and the tradition of partnership of 
governments working together in the Canadian federation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure members in this House will agree that the federal 
government must ensure equal access to federal programs from 
coast to coast. Moreover, publics funds must be managed in such 
a way as to benefit all Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to stress the fact that the Canadian government 
has always worked in partnership with Quebec and the other 
provincial governments. We deal with the various aspects of this 
very complex housing issue by sharing responsibilities. Why? 
Because Canadians want the same national standards to prevail 
throughout Canada so that access to affordable housing does not 
vary from one jurisdiction to another.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All governments recognize the need to find creative solutions 
to facilitate the provision of affordable and accessible housing 
because housing involves various levels of government, all of 
which must be working in partnership to achieve progress. The 
federal government believes in the need to adopt a 
comprehensive and co-ordinated approach in this sphere.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This being said, the governments of Canada and Quebec have 
a long tradition of working together in the area of housing. We 
intend to maintain that strong co-operation for the good of all 
Canadians. This co-operation has a name, we call it 
compassion. This means that Canadians care for their fellow 
Canadians, and the government will not abandon that 
compassion.
<P>
	Abandon is, in my opinion, something to keep in mind. I 
would like to remind the hon. member that it is the leader of her 
party, when he was a member of the previous Cabinet, who 
oversaw the abolition of all social housing programs, including 
those for housing co-ops, for non-profit housing, and for 
owners, whether they be occupants or leasers. The people who 
used to benefit from these programs are the same the hon. 
member seeks to help with this motion.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the government is presently reviewing these 
programs to make them more responsive to the needs of the 
people who were abandoned by the previous government and the 
present leader of the Official Opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In contrast to the actions of the previous government, I would 
like to make known to the House some of the initiatives of the 
Liberal government. The major effort on the part of the 
federal-provincial-territorial partnership in the delivery of 
social housing funds has been to meet core housing needs. The 
objective is to assist families or individuals most in need, those 
who would have to spend more than 30 per cent of their income 
for suitable, adequate accommodation on the private market.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The latest figures, for December 31, 1993, show that there are 
more than 140,000 family units administered in Quebec and in 
1992-93, the Government of Canada spent over $318 million on 
affordable housing in Quebec alone.
<P>
	I am thinking, for example, of the Creesom housing initiative 
which helps disadvantaged people in southwestern Montreal. 
Madam Speaker, despite the cuts that governments must make, 
the federal government will give this original and innovative 
program $5.1 million in financial aid over a four-year period so 
that it can continue to help people on low and moderate incomes 
own property, individually or collectively. In co-operation with 
the City of Montreal, the Government of Canada will commit to 
100 co-op housing units as part of the Creesom program in 
southwestern Montreal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As well, the Government of Quebec recently announced a 
renovation program for low income home owners, Réparaction. 
In light of the reinstatement and provincial renovation program 
the federal government will be working with the province of 
Quebec to put in place cost sharing agreements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
offers financial assistance for victims of violence. The Project 
Haven and Next Step programs provide emergency and 
long-term shelter for victims and their children.
<P>
	Under Project Haven, which expired on March 21, 1992, 
commitments were made for 458 emergency shelters in 78 
municipalities. The second phase of the family violence 
initiative, Next Step, expires on March 31, 1995. This phase 
provides for 150 independent housing units and 100 emergency 
shelters, with a budget of $20.6 million. By January 31, 1994, 46 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3076"> 3076 </A></B>
<P>
independent units and 53 emergency shelters had been 
completed, at a cost of $4.5 million. That is far from nothing, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	As for Quebec, the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation is working in collaboration with the Government of 
Quebec to create eight new shelters which will be completed by 
the end of March 1995. Three are already in service and the 
others are either under construction or at the design stage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I am sure members can appreciate, the demand for this 
type of facility far exceeds the level of resources that we have 
been able to direct for the establishment of new shelters and the 
funds to March 31, 1995 have already been committed.
<P>
	I think we all understand that the fiscal capacity of all 
governments is extremely limited, and that includes the 
Government of Quebec. However I believe we must also take 
into account societal problems and priorities, and not simply 
focus strictly on fiscal solutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I will say that in this area it is difficult to have a 
perfect balance, but the Government of Canada is trying very 
hard and is having good results thanks to a close partnership 
with all Canadian provinces, including Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
is the second time that the Bloc Quebecois has put forward a 
motion on social housing. This is the second time that I have 
risen to speak against it.
<P>
	The first motion deplored the fact that the government had not 
increased or re-established funding for social housing 
construction programs. However this time its concern is more 
emotional.
<P>
	In the first motion debated on February 16, the Bloc declared 
that it was interested in social housing support for all Canadians. 
Let me be clear, the Bloc carries a singular agenda. The only 
care that the Bloc has for Canada is to take what it can and 
separate post haste.
<P>
	The motion before us is terribly wrong minded. It fails to 
appreciate the economic reality our country faces today. The 
taxpayers of Canada, you and I, Madam Speaker, my children 
and my grandchildren will pay for this folly of overspending.
<P>
	The combined debt is now over $600 billion and the federal 
deficit is predicted to be about $40 billion. Despite this colossal 
financial lodestone, the Bloc Quebecois is saying the 
government has not yet spent enough. It is urging the 
government to spend more, to increase the deficit and the debt, 
to climb aboard this runaway debt train, giving no thought to 
fixing its brakes.
<P>
	It is important to clearly establish what is needed before we 
blindly commit to throwing around millions of dollars.
<P>
	A 1992 study stated that the majority of people on welfare 
received adequate support to meet their basic housing needs. It 
stated that the traditional solution has been to spend a fortune on 
these programs and if things are not improving, throw more 
money at them.
<P>
	In its 1991 annual report the CMHC agrees that social housing 
needs can be met under the existing funding plan. The report 
states that more of an effort must be made to achieve greater cost 
effectiveness so that more can be done with the available 
budgets.
<P>
	I recognize that we need a major social revenue in Canada. 
However, throwing money at a singular and specific problem is 
not a good resolution. We need to assess what the problem is and 
then address it specifically.
<P>
	The clamour for federal funding support is not decreasing. 
The demand is there but there are fewer dollars to spread around. 
Given this, new innovative ideas are needed to ensure sound 
fiscal management at all levels of government.
<P>
	In 1988 all three levels of government spent under $3 billion 
on housing or $114 for every person in Canada. That is up from 
just $366 million or $17 per capital in 1970. Yet poverty 
advocates claim the housing problem is as acute as ever.
<P>
	Given that this funding spiral cannot continue unabated, it is 
more important than ever that housing subsidies, like other 
forms of assistance-and we said this over and over again-be 
targeted to those in need. The Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation ensures that all Canadians, regardless of who they 
are and where they live in Canada, have equal access to federal 
resources allocated for housing. CMHC currently administers 
more than 652,000 units.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Despite these enormous holdings, my hon. colleague would 
have us believe that more money yet needs to be spent on social 
housing programs in Quebec. In the fiscal year 1994-95, 
according to the main estimates for public works and 
government services, CMHC will receive $2,033,779,000 for 
social housing alone. Of this approximately $366 million will be 
going to the province of Quebec. That represents about 18 per 
cent of CMHC's total budget for social housing.
<P>
	In comparison, Alberta, my province will receive 
approximately $150 million. For every dollar that Alberta 
receives, Quebec gets $2.25.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3077"> 3077 </A></B>
<P>
	Believe me, Albertans question this transfer payment ratio 
even more so as they work through a seriously difficult time, 
difficult days of deep, deep cuts to our provincial programs.
<P>
	While we are doing comparisons, let us take a quick look at 
the United States provision for social housing. When the leader 
of the Queen's Loyal Opposition visited the U.S. I wonder if he 
discussed social housing spending habits with the Americans. 
Canada may not yet be a paradise of social housing but we are 
sure not doing too badly in comparison with the U.S.
<P>
	We spend approximately $114 a year per capita on social 
housing while in the U.S. that expenditure is about $40 per year 
per capita. We spend almost three times as much right now.
<P>
	Therefore Canada is not facing serious social housing 
problems. It is facing serious economic problems. This 
government fails to recognize that we are facing a financial 
crisis. This motion shows that the Bloc also fails to recognize it.
<P>
	Canadian and international money markets are hugely 
unstable because this government cannot keep its spending 
under control and shows scant interest in doing so. The 
Canadian dollar is in a sinkhole, interest rates are rising and 
despite a decrease in the unemployment rate the dollar remains 
unstable, an indicator that investors have lost faith in our 
economy.
<P>
	In principle the solution to the problem is simple. The 
government needs to put a cap on spending. The government 
needs to clearly demonstrate to the financial communities both 
within and without Canada that it is serious about reducing the 
deficit.
<P>
	I can assure the government that if it introduced measures of 
this kind it would find support from my side of the House. All 
members of this Parliament should be mindful that we cannot 
spend ourselves out of a recession. Governments have tried this 
for 15 years and it has not worked.
<P>
	It is for these economic reasons that Gordon Thiessen, the 
head of the Bank of Canada, stated on April 5 that to inspire 
consumer and market confidence this government will have to 
address its debt and deficit situation by cutting spending.
<P>
	Given this, when members in this House put forward matters 
for debate, especially when those matters involve the spending 
of taxpayers dollars which are at a premium, they must ask 
themselves: Who will pay? Where will the money come from? 
Could this be done better and more cheaply?
<P>
	I see no indication that the Bloc either heard what Mr. 
Thiessen said last week or that it considered even asking 
questions such as these. It must be too busy figuring out 
strategies for separation.
<P>
	We cannot condone yet more money being siphoned off by 
Quebec. Constituents from my riding are getting very tired of 
seeing their tax dollars inequitably flushed into the province of 
Quebec, especially given the Bloc's mandate for separation.
<P>
	Alberta's transfer payments have been capped and the need to 
cut spending has been recognized there. But here is the Bloc yet 
again with its hand out asking for extra money.
<P>
	In its strategic plan for 1992 through to 1996 CMHC does not 
mention a need for increased funding nor a need to increase 
programs in Quebec. However, in a businesslike move in 
keeping with the private sector, the CMHC is promoting cost 
effective programming and management.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Finally, this demand for social housing support is an indicator 
of a larger economic problem. Simply spending more money to 
alleviate social housing problems is like trying to tend to a fever 
of 105 by rolling someone in the snow. You may cool the body 
for a short period of time but surely you have not found out why 
that body is sick.
<P>
	Quebec needs to look more closely at this problem. The Bloc 
Quebecois is showing that as a province said to be on the verge 
of separation, it clearly lacks an appreciation for its own 
economic, social and political upheaval.

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on this 
motion that raises important issues. However, since this is the 
first time that I rise in the House, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all the constituents of 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle for the vote of confidence they 
gave me last October.
<P>
	I am pleased to address the House in reply to a motion that 
raises very important issues. Our country benefits from a shared 
heritage based on compassion. We do care about the well-being 
of our neighbours. We help them when they are in need and this 
government is not about to end that tradition.
<P>
	I am convinced that hon. members in this House agree with 
me when I say that the federal government must be at the 
forefront, along with the provinces, to ensure that poor 
Canadians can live in adequate dwellings.
<P>
	This government's vision of Canada includes all Canadians, 
regardless of their income, their language or their social 
condition. Our vision is that of a country where everyone can 
enjoy a quality of life, where we are responsible for the 
well-being of each other, and where people remain optimistic 
about their future and that of their children.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that this vision includes the 
provision of adequate dwellings to all Canadians. It is absolute-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3078"> 3078 </A></B>
<P>
ly out of the question to exclude people merely  because they 
need help to meet their basic need for shelter.
<P>
	Our support is necessary and we have found ways to help 
these people. I am referring to the Residential Rehabilitation 
Assistance Program, or RRAP, and to the Emergency Repair 
Program, or EARP.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his recent budget the Minister of Finance has struck a 
balance between the need for fiscal restraint and the need for 
social responsibility.
<P>
	By reinstating RRAP including RRAP for the disabled and 
EARP the government is making a real difference in the lives of 
low income Canadians, families, seniors, people with 
disabilities, aboriginals. Through this program with a total of 
$100 million, $50 million over each of the next two years, we are 
helping these people make basic repairs to their homes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know, however, that these public funds are insufficient. To 
put an end to poverty, we must eliminate restrictive policies 
which prevent innovative solutions.
<P>
	Given the budget constraints, we will look for available 
resources and tools to invest in Canadians, and to create a 
climate allowing native peoples to develop their potential and 
progress towards economic and social self-determination.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are not alone in thinking that these programs are important 
to the people of Canada. We have approached the provinces 
about cost sharing to maximize the impact of these programs. 
We have received favourable responses. With the provinces 
contributing to RRAP and EARP, with the provinces working in 
partnership with the federal government, we will be able to help 
even more people than we expected.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	The social impact of these programs is not to be overstated. 
My colleagues need to be aware of an important element to these 
programs. It is an element I should think they would appreciate 
for not only is this government introducing programs to help 
house Canadians. It is also providing a much needed economic 
boost to the Canadian economy. There is economic stimulus. 
Yes, RRAP and EARP will create thousands of jobs in 
communities across the country.
<P>
	It goes without saying that investment in renovating housing 
enhances older modest income communities and encourages 
other forms of neighbourhood improvement. What we are 
talking about here is an investment in the physical and social 
fabric of our communities, providing more affordable housing 
of adequate quality with a relatively small investment per unit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The RRAP and ERP funds are smart expenditures that will pay 
off economically by stimulating the renovation sector and 
creating much needed jobs and, at the human level, by helping 
people repair their homes to bring them up to minimum health 
and safety standards. That is the purpose of these programs.
<P>
	We are talking about minimum standards and not luxury; 
basic requirements for the health and safety of occupants and for 
energy efficiency. What every Canadian expects. Something the 
government should not have to justify.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am proud of the fact that my government made a firm 
commitment in its red book to reinstate the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program. I am proud the Minister of 
Finance included RRAP and EARP in his recent budget. How 
many other programs do we know of that help low income 
families, seniors, people with disabilities and aboriginals all at 
the same time?
<P>
	We believe we are making the right fiscal decisions and we 
intend to continue to do more. We intend to stretch our social 
housing dollars as far as possible.
<P>
	The federal government currently provides approximately $2 
billion in assistance to over 659,000 households across the 
country. We know that the need is greater than our ability to 
meet it. We know we have to find creative and innovative ways 
to make our social housing dollars work better.
<P>
	One way we intend to achieve this is by identifying savings 
and efficiencies. Taxpayers have a right to expect an efficient 
government. I have agreed with my provincial and territorial 
colleagues that we will work together to ensure efficient 
delivery of housing programs. We will continue to provide an 
acceptable level of service and we will do it while making the 
best use of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are already moving in that direction. Last August, Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation started making loans to 
finance and refinance social housing units to better use available 
resources and reduce expenditures. Through direct loans, 
CMHC will refinance social housing units at balanced rates, 
thus reducing the cost of housing assistance.
<P>
	We are talking about improving social housing efficiency. 
CMHC will save about $120 million in grants over the next four 
years, out of an $11 billion budget. CMHC will lend directly to 
qualified social housing borrowers when loans come due or 
when advances are required for new commitments.
<P>
	This is only one measure, one case of using resources more 
efficiently and reducing expenditures. I made a commitment to 
work with my provincial and territorial colleagues to reduce 
administration costs and make program delivery more efficient.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the end of the day we expect to identify savings that can be 
reinvested in social housing, to keep the existing social housing 
stock in good repair and to allow for new commitments. Our 
commitment to social housing must not simply be measured in 
terms of public expenditure. We have to look at housing within 
the broader and more comprehensive context of market forces 
and overall economic and social policy.
<P>
	Along with the provinces, territories and interested 
stakeholders, we will be taking action to ensure that rules and 
regulations do not impede the creation of affordable housing. 
We will ensure that housing policies and programs encourage 
people to seek new opportunities to break out of the poverty 
cycle.
<P>
	We want to ensure that the private market is able to provide 
affordable housing for Canadians. We are currently looking into 
new financial instruments which will increase access to housing 
for Canadians. We are also considering reintroducing indexed 
link mortgages for co-operatives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Madam Speaker, again 
today, I have the opportunity to rise to ask the Liberal 
government to act quickly to respond to the pressing housing 
needs of 1,200,000 Canadians.
<P>
	So far, the representations and lobbying by community 
organizations, by members of the Official Opposition and even 
by some members across the floor who have shown a little 
interest and resolve, have yielded nothing. Zero, zilch. Since 
January of this year, the government has invested nothing at all 
in social housing programs. Low-cost housing, non-profit 
organizations, co-operative housing were completely neglected 
and forgotten by the Liberals. In fact, the members opposite do 
nothing else but close their eyes and renew the policies of the 
Conservatives. This attitude on the part of the Liberals is 
shameful and totally unacceptable. Do they not remember that, 
not so long ago, when they were the Official Opposition, they 
spent a lot of time condemning the Conservative government for 
withdrawing funding for social housing? Do they not remember 
that?
<P>
	And that is not all. The Liberals said that they wanted to work 
together with housing organizations in order to establish a 
national policy on social housing. They even promised to fully 
restore all programs. The Minister of Finance even wrote this in 
a letter to various organizations dated September 22, 1993, and I 
quote: ``There is no doubt that a Liberal government will ensure 
funding for these sectors. We think that the state must adopt a 
positive and dynamic national policy in this area. It is 
incumbent on general management to ensure that over one 
million Canadian families are provided with decent and 
affordable housing''.
<P>
	The minister ended that letter by stating, and again I quote: 
``to that end, we wish to establish new partnerships with your 
organizations. I believe that over the past three years, our leader, 
our members of Parliament as well as our official critic for 
social housing, Joe Fontana, have consistently showed our 
commitment to social housing. We therefore rely on your 
co-operation on this socio-economic issue, which is of the 
highest importance'', and I stress ``of the highest importance''. 
The letter is signed Paul Martin. Those are the words our dear 
Minister of Finance wrote on September 22 last.
<P>
	Where are they today, those members of Parliament, this 
leader and this official critic, to show their commitment to 
social housing? They have vanished! Gone too are all those 
lovely speeches and the will to provide decent housing to needy 
families.
<P>
	But what happened since then? Why did the members 
opposite completely change their mind? It is unacceptable and 
dishonest for elected and accountable people to alter their 
course in mid-stream. How can the population now seriously 
believe the Minister of Finance? How can he live with the words 
he wrote without feeling shame, without feeling any remorse? 
The minister looks a bit silly today and his credibility is no 
better than his social housing programs which deserve a big 
zero. They call him the sinister Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	And yet, the needs are obviously huge and urgent. The 
Canada, I repeat, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
estimates that 1,200,000 families are in urgent need of housing. 
How can you ignore this reality? How can you ignore such 
glaring statistics? The members opposite so free with their 
promises have no vision. All they are good at is damage control. 
They are unable to plan for the long term. They do not manage 
anything, they only hope and wait for things to get better on their 
own.
<P>
	They put nothing on the table, no plan, no policy to deal with 
the housing crisis. In the meantime, people in substandard 
housing are waiting. They are hoping that the Liberal 
government will be true to its promises and will immediately 
provide funds to build low-rent housing, as well as non-profit 
and co-op housing. Hundreds of thousands of families find this 
wait increasingly hard to take. Several of them spend more than 
50 per cent of their income on rent. Such poverty has devastating 
effects.
<P>
	Every month, these poor families living in substandard 
housing have to make inhuman choices. Every month, in order 
to pay for their rent, they have to deprive their children of such 
essentials as food. Children go hungry and live in substandard 
housing because the government is not acting responsibly. This 
projects a very bad image in a society as affluent and developed 
as ours.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3080"> 3080 </A></B>
<P>
	The government's lack of action is indecent. The minister in 
charge of social housing is telling us his cupboard is bare and 
that we must wait for savings that the CMHC could manage over 
the next few years. The Liberals keep us waiting and waiting. 
They are in favour of a wait-and-see policy. They sit back and 
wait for some heaven-sent manna. We must admire the strength, 
courage and inventiveness of this new government.
<P>
	It is not ten years from now that we need social housing, 
Madam Speaker, it is right now. All the organizations, all the 
municipalities, all the big cities are asking tthe government to 
reinstate and increase funding for social housing. The Liberals 
are deaf and blind. They have been in place for six months now, 
and they still ask the people to be patient.
<P>
	We on this side of the House want the government to release 
public funds immediately so that we can start projects now. You 
do not have the money? Well, cut the fat, put public finances on a 
sound footing and get rid of tax shelters for the wealthy. If you 
had any guts, if you had the political will, you would do your 
homework and find the money.
<P>
	In Quebec, the situation is more problematic because more 
people live in rental accommodation. The problem is more 
acute, more urgent. The federal government is reneging on its 
commitments and the provincial Liberals are not putting up 
much of a fight.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the federal government still has a role to play in 
this area. We in Quebec pay federal taxes and we are entitled to 
our fair share. We want the government to give Quebec its share 
of those taxes and we will take care of our own social housing. 
The Société d'habitation du Québec has all the tools and 
expertise it needs to develop its own programs.
<P>
	Soon Quebeckers will decide what their future will be. We 
will then be able to administer our own social and economic 
development. Meanwhile, give us our share and stop ignoring 
the demands of the poor and people living in substandard 
housing across this country. Patience may be a virtue, but 
enough is enough.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in the House today on behalf 
of the Government of Canada to speak to this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to have an opportunity to stress the commitment 
of this government in the area of housing. This government 
acknowledges the right to adequate and affordable housing for 
all Canadians, not only in Quebec but all over Canada. This is a 
most important commitment for this government.
<P>
	I am sure every single member in this House thinks housing is 
important for our quality of life and for the prosperity of our 
communities.
<P>
	Our government intends to keep contributing to housing and 
working hand in hand with its various partners so that as many 
Canadians as possible can find adequate and affordable housing.
<P>
	This government also strongly supports social housing and 
keeps its promises but it has to consider the present fiscal 
situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our approach balances the need to pursue fiscal restraint with 
the need to recognize and respond to the social needs of the more 
vulnerable members of our society.
<P>
	The federal government is committed to a national 
co-ordinated approach to ensure that Canadians are well 
housed. The federal government has maintained its commitment 
of approximately $2 billion in annual expenditures on social 
housing assistance. Through this funding we are able to provide 
support to some 659,000 low income households across the 
country. These include singles, families, seniors, persons with 
disabilities, aboriginals and fellow citizens who are unable to 
meet their basic housing needs on their own.
<P>
	Given the difficulties presented by the deficit, this is a serious 
commitment that reflects the concern of the government for the 
plight of society's most vulnerable citizens.
<P>
	Let me underline as well that these expenditures provide a 
powerful economic stimulus, generating considerable 
employment in communities across the country year after year.
<P>
	As my colleagues know, we have taken immediate action to 
reinstate the residential rehabilitation assistance program. 
Again this is a program that helps low income Canadians meet 
their basic housing needs. RRAP grants are used to help people 
bring their homes up to minimum standards of health and safety.
<P>
	The federal contribution of $100 million over two years will 
go a long way toward helping low income Canadians make basic 
repairs to their homes.
<P>
	This significant commitment of resources will also generate a 
much needed economic stimulus by creating thousands of jobs 
both directly and indirectly in the construction industry, real 
estate, manufacturing and related services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, to meet the challenges we are faced with in the area 
of housing, we need more than mere financial assistance. We 
need a commitment from all levels of government and from all 
stakeholders in the housing sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3081"> 3081 </A></B>
<P>
	With everyone's co-operation, we will be able to reach our 
goals. To meet the challenges, we must first create solid 
partnerships.
<P>
	The minister responsible for housing has met with many of 
our partners in that area. In fact, he held two meetings with some 
associations in order to better understand the problems facing 
this sector and to invite them to suggest improvements in some 
areas. Given the current financial situation in Canada, all levels 
of government must co-operate more and focus their efforts on 
protecting the social fabric of this country, which greatly 
depends on the housing sector. We can reach this goal by helping 
Canadians find good, affordable housing of the right size.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have a long tradition of partnership in the country. Federal 
and provincial governments have long worked together to create 
cost share and deliver social housing to needy Canadians.
<P>
	In this era of fiscal restraint we no longer have the funding 
levels of the past. Just because our funds are limited it does not 
mean that our imaginations need to be limited or our efforts cut 
short. Partnership has brought us success in the past. It will help 
us to achieve further success today and in the future.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Federal-provincial relations with respect to social housing 
have long been defined by a set of principles. National standards 
are the cornerstone of these principles. Productive partnerships 
through which consensus is achieved have always been an 
important part of relations between the different levels of 
government. This must continue.
<P>
	In an effort to consolidate partnership among levels of 
government the minister responsible for housing met with his 
federal, provincial and territorial colleagues last January. At 
that meeting all ministers agreed on the need to work together on 
behalf of those in need of social housing assistance. They also 
agreed to undertake a concerted effort to identify program 
efficiencies that will lead to savings and ultimately enable us to 
do more with our social housing budgets.
<P>
	The federal government's commitment to housing for 
Canadians recognizes there are groups who have special needs 
to meet. We must strive to meet their needs.
<P>
	Coming from Saskatchewan as I do, I cannot help but think of 
the aboriginal community. The plight of this particular sector of 
society needs to be addressed. CMHC has a long tradition of 
working in partnership with the aboriginal community to work 
out solutions to housing issues. The government is focusing its 
attention on supporting the native community in the goal of 
achieving greater self-sufficiency and control over their lives.
<P>
	Another sector are the victims of family violence. As 
members of the House well know the rate of family violence 
continues to increase. It is my fervent hope the day will come 
when we no longer need to build and maintain shelters for 
women and children who are fleeing domestic violence.
<P>
	In the meantime however the government will continue to 
address these issues in the best way it can by providing financial 
assistance for Project Haven and Project Next Step. These two 
programs provide emergency shelter and long term housing for 
victims of family violence and their children.
<P>
	The government is well aware there is still much work to do to 
ensure all Canadians have access to decent, affordable housing. 
We believe we are on the right track and that we are taking 
positive steps and making a real difference in the lives of many 
Canadians. We are committed to working in partnership with 
housing groups and stakeholders in Canada to pursue our 
objective of providing decent, adequate and affordable housing 
for Canadians.

deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TEAMCANADA">TEAM CANADA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
January 20 and 21 last, my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata and myself questioned the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage about the ever-present discrimination faced 
by Quebeckers in amateur sport in Canada.
<P>
	Just days before the Olympic Games opened in Lillehammer, 
Hockey Team Canada still had not recruited a single player from 
Quebec. We deplored at the time that the team setting out to 
represent Canada in the Olympics in our national sport did not 
reflect more accurately the complex make-up of the Canadian 
society.
<P>
	Shortly after the Official Opposition had raised this issue in 
the House of Commons, one player from Quebec was added in 
extremis to Team Canada's lineup. I think that the contemptuous 
attitude displayed at the time toward Quebeckers by Team 
Canada officials must be deplored. It is appalling and it was not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3082"> 3082 </A></B>
<P>
the first, nor the last, time this kind of thing happened, as we can 
well imagine.
<P>
	In Canada, amateur sport is a real breeding ground of 
discrimination against Quebeckers, yet the minister seems to be 
indifferently washing his hands of the matter. In such instances, 
far from expressing our collective pride, sport breeds nothing 
but spite and injustice. What is the minister waiting for to 
realize there is a problem and to take steps to remedy the 
situation? Is he waiting for more cases of discrimination to 
occur in the amateur sport?
<P>
	Let us take the case of Myriam Bédard, twice a gold medal 
winner, who was harassed and suspended by unilingual 
English-speaking bureaucrats of Biathlon Canada who 
threatened to throw her out of the national team of ``her'' 
country because she refused to obey unjust orders of a federation 
that wanted to break its sole star. Mr. Réjean Tremblay, reporter 
of the daily newspaper <I>La Presse</I> wrote an article on that.
<P>
	There is also the case of the Quebecker figure skaters Paul and 
Isabelle Duchesnay, bronze medallists in dance at the 
Albertville Olympic Games, who were forced to wear the 
colours of France because of the intransigence of the Canadian 
Figure Skating Association.
<P>
	Following the Lillehammer Games, Canada as a whole had to 
acknowledge and appreciate the merits of athletes from Quebec 
who had distinguished themselves by their talent but also by 
their tenacity and determination. And God knows they need a lot 
of tenacity and determination to overcome all the obstacles put 
on their way by the Canadian amateur sport system.
<P>
	Nevertheless, nine of the thirteen Canadian medals were won 
by Quebec athletes. Is it not a clear illustration of a fundamental 
lesson of life, that one should not be afraid to forge ahead and 
have self-confidence?
<P>
	One of the many problems in the amateur sport in Canada is 
that the distribution of powers between the national and 
provincial sports organizations makes the Quebec amateur sport 
system literally dependent on the Canadian system.
<P>
	For sports events outside Canada, the selection of athletes, 
coaches, officials, volunteers and other sports professionals 
depends nearly exclusively on policies developed by the 
national sports associations with the result we know. Unilingual 
francophone athletes have an additional obstacle to overcome, 
in particular at the national selection stages since they cannot 
communicate in their own language with the coaches and people 
in charge of the selection and training of athletes who are 
unilingual anglophones in the majority of cases.
<P>
	Sports professionals who are unilingual francophones face 
the same problem. They have less of a chance of getting a job in 
a Canadian sports organization.
<P>
	In fact, as Sport Quebec was stressing in its submission to the 
Commission on the Political and Constitutional Future of 
Quebec, commonly known as the Bélanger-Campeau 
Commission, on November 2, 1986, and I quote: ``Because it is 
directly related to Quebec's identity, the most fundamental 
problem is that the present system considerably limits the 
assertion of Quebec's policies in the field of sports, since all 
management is directly governed by the Canadian associations' 
policies''.
<P>
	That is another one of the many deep-rooted problems of 
Canadian federalism, a chronic inability to respond to Quebec's 
development conditions, an over-centralization aimed at 
imposing uniformity at all costs. I think that it is a failure, 
nothing less. Will the minister of Canadian Heritage finally 
realize that?
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that, on behalf of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, I will answer to the question raised by my colleague 
from Verchères. He knows very well that his arguments are 
unfounded.
<P>
	First, I would like to make a point: the selection of athletes for 
the Canadian Olympic Hockey Team is ultimately the 
responsibility of Hockey Canada, not that of the federal 
government.
<P>
	Hockey Canada has a very vast network of connections which 
allows it to be aware of the availability of players. The 
organization is in constant contact with coaches, scouts, league 
managers, agents and player representatives, team owners and 
managers. It consults these resource-persons regularly in order 
to stay aware of the schedule and the hours to which the players 
must conform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The majority of the players are professional and Hockey 
Canada had the task of dealing with numerous National Hockey 
League clubs, European hockey leagues, and universities and 
colleges in Canada and the United States for the services of the 
players, not always an easy task.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Olympic hockey team that played at the winter games in 
Lillehammer had 23 players, including two francophones from 
outside Quebec, Adrian Aucoin and Chris Thérien. Jean-Yves 
Roy, from Rosemère in Quebec, presently with the New York 
Rangers, was also a member of that team.

<P>
	It is not true that there were no Quebeckers on Canada's 
Olympic hockey team. Many Quebec players were considered 
for the team, but were not retained, primarily because they 
simply were not available.

	A number of factors influence the formation of the Olympic 
team. Certainly the team rose to the occasion meeting the 
challenge imposed by the Olympics.

	The players showed great determination and unparalleled 
team spirit. Throughout the country, their achievements were a 
source of pride and admiration. That is what is most important, 
in my opinion, for Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
on March 18 I asked a question of the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food regarding comments made by the American 
Secretary of Agriculture. Secretary Espy wanted a cap on wheat 
exports to the U.S. and zero tariffs on poultry, dairy and eggs. I 
asked the minister for his assurance that Canadian farmers 
would be protected.
<P>
	Reports in the media are stating that Canada has softened its 
position in the farm trade battle with the U.S. because of strong 
American pressure. The fact is Canada is not the only country 
that is suspect of its relationship with the United States. There is 
a growing resentment about American bullying tactics from 
several other nations at the same time.
<P>
	What work is the government undertaking to establish 
stronger world trading rules to ensure that we are not subject to 
the continuing American harassment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, in response to 
my colleague who raised that question earlier, I would like to 
emphasize to my colleague, to the House and to all Canadians in 
the industry that the minister certainly has not softened his 
position.
<P>
	This is emphasized by the fact that the negotiations have been 
completed in Marrakech and Morocco for today. They will 
continue tomorrow. I spoke to the minister about 4.30 this 
afternoon and our position there and his position there is still 
firm, clear and forceful to the United States.
<P>
	Let us not be fooled. We are in the midst of some very serious 
and tough negotiations on bilateral issues with the United 
States. We have a large two-way trade with the United States in 
agriculture and agri-food. It is about $11.5 billion so it is 
important that what we get a deal, a negotiated deal with the 
United States, that is in the best interest of Canadians and in the 
best interest of the agri-food industry in Canada. The minister 
will accept nothing less than that.
<P>
	These negotiations were going on before the settlement in 
Geneva on GATT. Canada plays by the rules. Every country in 
the world does not always play by the rules. We will be signing 
on to the GATT rules. We have signed on to the NAFTA rules and 
those  negotiations will continue. I want to make that very clear 
to the member and to everyone.
<P>
	Our officials have been meeting over the last number of weeks 
with the Americans and we are not going to roll over and play 
dead. We have been firm. We will continue to be firm and get the 
best deal for the Canadian industry and for Canadian national 
interest.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on March 24 the member of Parliament for 
Saint-Hubert and I presented a petition in Parliament with over 
200,000 signatures asking that handguns be banned for private 
use.
<P>
	This petition was sponsored by Concordia University 
following the murders with a handgun of four professors at the 
university in 1992. The murderer, who was also a professor, was 
able to acquire three handguns legally without much difficulty, 
indicating a serious weakness in the law. Later on March 24, I 
asked the Minister of Justice if he would give serious attention 
to the demands in the petitions. I asked that same question again 
today.
<P>
	Handguns are not used for hunting and have no other 
legitimate use by ordinary citizens. Some members of the House 
and some Canadians allege that the present gun laws are not 
effective because we still have crimes with guns.
<P>
	No laws are 100 per cent effective. On the other hand, there is 
no doubt that without our present laws the situation would be 
much worse. It has been proven over and over again that where 
guns are less available and more difficult to obtain, there is less 
crime with guns. That is an indisputable fact.
<P>
	The simplistic slogan spread about by the gun lobby that if 
one bans guns only criminals will have guns is total nonsense. 
The professor murderer at Concordia University was not a 
criminal until he easily and legally acquired his guns and carried 
out his killings.
<P>
	Marc Lépine, who killed 14 women at the École 
Polytechnique, had no criminal record before he easily and 
legally acquired his automatic rifle and carried out his massacre. 
When guns are easily and legally available some, perhaps the 
majority, will obtain them and use them legally. Unfortunately 
some will obtain them and use them criminally.
<P>
	The only logical action if we are truly interested in reducing 
crime with guns is to make them and ammunition more difficult 
to obtain. This means a total ban on handguns for private use.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for the 
opportunity to reply on behalf of the Minister of Justice to this 
most important question that he raised.
<P>
	Canadians are very concerned about violence and especially 
about violence involving firearms. They have  every right to be 
so concerned. As recent incidents have shown there is a need for 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3084"> 3084 </A></B>
<P>
strict gun control in Canada. I am sure hon. members of the 
House share this worry.
<P>
	After the tragic deaths of 14 young engineering students in 
1989, almost 600,000 Canadians signed a petition calling for 
stronger legislation controlling firearms. Now the House has 
been presented with another petition in response to yet another 
tragedy.
<P>
	I join with all members of the House in sorrow and sympathy. 
Our sorrow is not just for the victims of these tragic incidents 
and their families but for the victims of violence everywhere. 
We share their grief because in many ways it is our own. 
Violence in society is a tragedy not only for the victims but for 
all of us. It affects the quality of our lives and the way in which 
we live them.
<P>
	Canadians expect more than sympathy from the government 
on the matter. They expect us to take measures to address their 
legitimate concerns. It is a tall order but one which we must take 
very seriously. As hon. members already know, the Minister of 
Justice is aware of the problem and is looking at ways to address 
it.
<P>
	In addition to specific changes, the government is also 
looking at longer term crime prevention strategies. It is the view 
of the government that reacting to crime with harsher 
punishments will not serve to eliminate crime. We must try to 
address the root causes and to respond to crime as a social 
problem rather than on a case by case basis.
<P>
	Finally, the voices of those Canadians who signed the 
petitions calling for strict controls on firearms and other 
weapons will be heard. We must be willing to look at any gun 
control option if it will improve safety and help prevent the kind 
of tragedies we have seen recently.
<P>
	Every option should be carefully considered and decisions 
will be made. That is the obligation of the government and I 
want to assure the House that the government will take its 
responsibilities very seriously.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.14 p.m.)
<P>
