to present a petition on behalf of the citizens of the greater

killed and 125 Canadians seriously injured every day as a result 
of alcohol related vehicular crashes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners pray that parliament immediately amend the 
Criminal Code to streamline the judicial process and to provide

commit to formal reviews of impaired driving legislation to 
determine the efficacy of the law in reducing drinking and 
driving and the deaths, injuries and social costs that it 
generates.

All of the petitions deal with Bill C-225, an act to amend the 
Marriage Act (Prohibited Degrees) and the Interpretation Act so 
as to define in statute that a marriage can only be entered into

potential sponsors will not be unduly burdened by them.  The 
petitioners request that more than one person be allowed to 
sponsor the same individual and share the responsibility for 
financial support of the immigrant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to be able to spend a little time debating Bill C-78 and I 
have to emphasize a little time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced at first reading in the House on 
Thursday, April 22.  The following week, on April 27, it came up 
for second reading and the government immediately introduced 
closure.  Before we knew it, second reading was over and done 
with, out of the House and off to committee before we had any 
time to debate the bill in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the bill was in committee.  We had witnesses on 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  By Thursday morning, the bill was 
in committee for clause by clause.  This happens to be a 200-page 
bill, 200 pages of complex technical points.  It deals with $100 
billion.  It is the livelihood of the retirees of the civil 
service.  It is a bill that calls for the privatization of $100 
billion of government debt over a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have thought that the bill would have merited some 
serious attention by members of parliament even if only for the 
fact that the pension of members of parliament happens to be part 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we had witnesses on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and 
that was all the government members were prepared to allow to 
come before the committee.  Although I suggested other 
organizations and people who would have an interest in speaking 
to the bill, the government said that it did not want to hear 
about it, that it wanted to get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday morning, the bill was in committee for clause by 
clause.  I have not added up how many clauses there are in a 
200-page bill because they were not consecutively numbered and 
there were a large number of amendments.  However, suffice it to 
say there were several hundred clauses and we were there to deal 
with clause by clause.  If I had not been in committee last week, 
the committee would have dealt with all 200 pages of clauses in 
10 minutes or even less if it had the opportunity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to have debate in committee but, while I could raise the 
issues I wanted to, I was severely limited in my capacity to 
debate the issue because of the constraints imposed upon me by 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise it in debate this morning because they told me I could 
appeal to the Speaker of the House if I was not satisfied. 
However, members know very well that any time an incident in 
committee is appealed to the House, the Speaker rules that the 
committees are the masters of their own house and thus we cannot 
appeal to the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into talking about the motions this morning, I 
would like to put on the record that I put up a valiant attempt 
to have the whole bill debated in detail in committee rather than 
consuming a huge amount of time in the House by people who are 
not interested in the particular bill.  There are some members 
who do have a serious interest in the bill and I happen to be one 
of them.  If we could have dealt with that in committee it would 
have saved the boredom for those in the House who are not 
interested in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand it is not improbable that now that it is back in 
the House the government may decide that it does not want to talk 
about the bill for very long and debate may be closed off once 
more.  We will have to wait to see how events unfold, but I would 
not be surprised if the government feels that another two or 
three hours of debate on this 200-page bill, $100 billion in 
assets and directly affecting 700,000 Canadians, requires no 
significant debate in the House at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the transcript from the committee meeting.  I will read 
just a couple of things in order to give the House an indication 
of what actually went on in committee.   On page 13 of the 
transcript I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no limit on my time, Mr. Chairman, I'm not aware.  Can 
you tell me where I'm limited on my time? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was when it was severely curtailing what I felt was my 
privilege to speak in committee.  The chairman replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly is at the discretion of the chair to allow a 
reasonable amount of time for debate and discussion of clauses. 
And when at such time the question is called, and I will seek 
some degree of leniency from my colleagues to call a question, 
after an appropriate amount time, at which time I'll use my best 
judgment to wind up the questions and call the question. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might have been talking at that time about 20 or 30 clauses 
that had been lumped into one debate and I was limited to two 
minutes.  How could I intelligently talk about that amount of 
clauses in two minutes and do it justice, do my constituents 
justice and do justice for the people who are concerned about the 
bill.  It was an absolute impossibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now refer to some comments by the member for Humber—St. 
Barbe—Baie Verte in Newfoundland.  As he was interrupting my 
speech, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that we're getting into very...discussion here 
about...we have a very specific task at hand.  It's to pass this 
bill, with or without amendments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought we were there to discuss the bill not to pass the 
bill.  That was definitely the attitude of my colleagues on the 
government side because later on, on the same page, I am quoted 
as saying: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...Mr. Chairman, and you're again denying the right to speak to 
individual issues because of members calling the question. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as any member of the government called the question, 
meaning calling for the vote, it meant the end of debate.  As 
soon as I started to speak someone would call for the question 
and that was the end of the debate in committee.  It was an 
affront to the democratic process in the House.  No one was 
prepared to enter into serious debate or analysis, or checking 
the bill to see that it was appropriate.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention another comment that I made in committee.  I 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chairman, you know, they're rather testy around the table 
this morning, and I would have thought that since there was very 
little time to debate in the House we would have had more 
opportunity to debate in committee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On it went.  They shut me down at every opportunity.  There is 
page after page of attempts by me to raise specific issues on the 
bill, to debate amendments I had tabled regarding the bill, and 
to improve the governance of $100 billion of assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommended at one time that the auditor general be the 
auditor who would be required to do the special audits which the 
bill calls for because he has expertise in that area.  He has 
perhaps the best expertise and is the most qualified person in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought for a $100 billion pool of capital that we 
would have wanted the best in the country to do the special 
evaluations and assessments.  Unfortunately there was no 
opportunity.  Government members were not the slightest bit 
interested in hearing, debating, discussing or suggesting any 
improvements to the bill whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three minute changes were proposed by the government.  I think 
one word was changed.  The word “and” was deleted and the word 
“or” was inserted, or vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members recognized at second reading of the bill that 
they had made some mistakes in drafting it.  They were not 
interested in talking about substantive change. They were not 
even talking about analysing for minute change. They strictly 
wanted to pass the bill, and if there were mistakes in the 
complexity they would fix it up later on, a travesty that I 
wanted on the record. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a rather 
sad day today, as we are discussing Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is picking on people who already are not well 
off.  I have looked at the statistics a bit and I found that 
retired public servants are currently getting about $9,000 a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the funds have accumulated some surpluses.  Yet, 
instead of trying to improve the annual income of its retirees, 
or lowering the contributions made by today's workers, this 
government is drooling at the prospect of other surpluses and is 
dying to get its hands on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got into politics in order to do my bit for justice, and I 
feel obliged to speak to this bill because I see it as totally 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with how the government has managed public funds 
since the Liberals came into power in 1993, because of what is 
going on now.  The government is patting itself on the back for 
having succeeded in reducing the deficit, started paying down 
the debt, everything is great.  But we need to have a look at 
how this was accomplished, how the government and the Minister 
of Finance in particular handle the public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they began by cutting transfer payments to the provinces. 
The government had some responsibilities toward them. 
And what did the current government do in the first years it was 
in power?  It announced: “We are going to transfer less money”, 
which means that it kept more for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing it addressed was another surplus, the one in 
the employment insurance fund, an annual surplus of $6 billion 
to $7 billion, and an accumulated surplus of $20 billion to $25 
billion.  The government siphoned off the money in this fund at 
the expense of the workers.  It then congratulated itself “See 
how well we are running things”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the provinces and the jobless are paying for it. 
They are the ones who bore the brunt of paying down the deficit. 
They are the ones whose contributions or cuts in benefits are 
being applied to paying down Canada's debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pay equity is also involved.  During those years, the government 
unfairly paid women working in the federal public service. 
These are the women who paid off the deficit.  They are paying 
off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now take a look at the pillage in the employee pension 
fund, because that is what we can call it, we are not talking 
about peanuts here.  We are talking about $14.9 billion for the 
public service.  A lot of these people work in my riding. There 
are some 200 or 300 who work in the federal public service at 
the Saint-Jean military base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP will be sacrificing $2.4 billion and the Canadian armed 
forces, $12.9, for a total of $30.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing today with Bill C-78 amounts to pillaging this 
fund.  It recalls for me unfortunate examples from the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, as I prepared my speech, I thought of Robert 
Maxwell, the famous British media magnate, who travelled the 
oceans of the world on his huge 60 foot boat.  He was one of the 
first to take money from pensions of his own workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the President of the Treasury Board travelling about on 
his own <I>Titanic</I>.  I would remind him that the <I>Titanic</I>'s owners, 
in their arrogance and invincibility, claimed it was unsinkable. 
I remind the President of the Treasury Board and the members of 
the government, especially, of that fact and tell them that it 
is not too late to drop their arrogance and their thoughts of 
invincibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no problem if they consider the amendments the 
Bloc Quebecois is proposing today, but I know that the members 
of the government tend to say “This is the way we are going, and 
you will follow us.  We will let you have a few debates in the 
House.  When it no longer suits us, and it has gone on long 
enough, we will call for closure”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to government members and to the President of the 
Treasury Board to look at the amendments the Bloc is proposing 
and, for once, to drop their arrogance and their thoughts of 
invincibility in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider it disdain by the majority, when it goes ahead 
totally oblivious of the opposition.  We do represent the people 
of Canada and Quebec.  The government should listen to the 
opposition a little more and make certain amendments to bills 
instead of heading off, visor lowered, saying “You will follow 
us. 
If you are not happy, we will use closure”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on hon. members to look at the amendments moved by the 
Bloc Quebecois to avoid penalizing public service retirees, who 
currently have an annual income of about $9,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also not forget what the President of the Treasury Board 
did about this issue. In 1996, an advisory committee was set up 
and the minister said “Make recommendations to me and we will 
see what we can do”. In 1998, the President of the Treasury 
Board said in a press release “The consultations may lead to a 
partnership that could result in the establishment of a 
management board in the public service that would be independent 
of the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, the first group of amendments moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois seek to create a management board that would deal at 
arm's length with the government. However, we forgot to take 
into account someone who may be the future leader of the Liberal 
Party. We forgot to take into account the Minister of Finance 
who, in managing the public purse, probably said to the 
President of the Treasury Board “My dear friend, we will look at 
the $30 billion surplus and we will try to get our hands on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just as I said earlier: cuts in the transfers to the 
provinces and siphoning off of money from the employment 
insurance fund, which belongs to the unemployed. 
The Minister of Finance has a big say in all this, because he is 
the one holding the purse strings. Workers must not forget that 
he is probably behind this bill, even though it was introduced 
by his colleague, the President of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One also wonders about the signal that is being sent to private 
businesses. Earlier, I alluded to Mr. Maxwell who is travelling 
all over the world on his big boat, with his employees' pension 
fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill like this one will send signals if it is passed.  I would 
propose the most striking example from my riding, that of the 
pillage of the fund of the former employees of the Singer 
company.  For a number of years, the Bloc Quebecois has been 
trying to get through to the government and remind it of its 
fiduciary responsibility for this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer we get is “No, there is no problem.  No, we have no 
commitment in that.  We were not the watchdog, settle your own 
problems”.  We might well wonder whether these responses were 
conditioned by the government's intention to introduce the bill 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would it have looked if the government had told the Singer 
Company or if its representatives had told themselves, as those 
responsible for the fund, “That is right, we have a share in the 
responsibility.  We should not have allowed the company to 
pillage the Singer employees' pension fund”?  This however was 
not the government's intention.  It could see the surplus that 
was accumulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was beginning to realize that it had to take the surplus, 
that if it acknowledged its responsibilities toward the people 
at Singer, it would have to give up the surplus and ensure that 
it went to retired workers.  We can see all the intentions of 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of other companies as well, we have often been told 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development, who is 
responsible for the matter “There are other companies, so we 
cannot follow up on your request”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a terrible example for private employers to follow now. 
They will be able to do as the government does and let workers 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dictatorship of the majority must stop.  It is time to stop 
treating employees with disdain.  The government has an 
opportunity today to set its arrogance aside. 
It could also set aside its great superiority and invincibility 
complex aside and listen to what the opposition parties have to 
say, include it in the bill and amend the bill to give us 
something potable in the future.  This is not just for those now 
retired, but also for those who will be retiring from the public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must assume its responsibility.  If the 
government does not do that, the Bloc Quebecois will naturally 
oppose Bill C-78.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
sense this will be the last opportunity I will have to talk to 
Bill C-78 or any amendments to it.  Even though four groups of 
amendments were taken from the many that were put forward, we 
have reason to believe that some time during the day today the 
government will again move closure on debate and shut down the 
opportunity for us to talk to the 30, 40 or 50 amendments which 
really need to be debated.  It is a pattern that has developed 
right from day one of the debate on Bill C-78.  We have every 
reason to believe, given the history and the pattern, that it 
will happen again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to say a few words in the short 
period of time I have on some of the many amendments which our 
party put forward to try to clean up what we feel is a very 
flawed bill.  I am tempted to say it is a flawed bill, but it is 
not a flawed bill.  In a way it is a masterful piece of work.  It 
is a true piece of art in the way it was put together so the 
government could achieve what it set out to achieve.  It will 
take the $30 billion surplus from retirees, pensioners and 
beneficiaries of the pension plans and use it for whatever 
purposes it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to condemn the government in the strongest possible 
language I am allowed to use.  Unfortunately I am limited in what 
things I can say about the bill.  There are many things I could 
say about it.  I cannot use the word theft.  I do not intend to 
try the Speaker's patience by using the word theft, stealing, 
highway robbery or any of the other words that come to mind.  I 
will not say those things because I know I am not supposed to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I would have to ask the Chair if I could use the word 
excrement.  Is the word excrement allowed in the House of 
Commons?  That is one word which certainly comes to mind.  I do 
not believe it is in the book.  If members worked in a circus and 
it was their job to follow the elephants in a parade, the stuff 
they would be sweeping up would pretty well typify or exemplify 
what we are dealing with today. 
The word travesty was used earlier and I am not going to repeat 
it over and over again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not many Liberals here today to listen to these final 
words of debate on Bill C-78.  I do not blame them for not being 
here, although I have some admiration for the Liberals who hang 
around to listen to this kind of thing.  It must be hard not to 
get jaded about the whole political and parliamentary process 
when Liberal backbenchers are used as nothing more than a focus 
group for cabinet when it wants to ram something through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to be those members sitting here today listening to 
this who will have to go back to their ridings to justify, defend 
and explain that the senior citizens are going to have their 
pockets picked to the tune of $30 billion.  I admire those who 
have the courage to come here and face the music.  I wish them 
well when they go back to their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to this bill is building up steam as we speak.  Right 
across the country seniors are rallying.  They are getting 
together to study this bill, and it takes a long time to digest a 
bill of this size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what the government is trying to avoid because 
it saw what happened when it tried to tamper with the OAS and the 
GIS and when it tried to create the new seniors benefit.  That 
committee toured the country and seniors had a chance to look at 
it in some detail.  Seniors had a chance to mobilize, to voice 
their opinions and to tell the government that they did not want 
a new seniors benefit which actually resulted in less benefit for 
them.  They did not want the GIS and the OAS to be merged into 
one so-called seniors benefit.  That is exactly what is happening 
with this bill.  The government has to stop it in its tracks 
because there is too much opposition right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest single group of beneficiaries, the federal 
superannuates national association, had 12 hours to prepare. 
Representatives were called the night before to make a 
presentation to the committee the next morning.  They complained 
vigorously that they did not have a chance to prepare a proper 
presentation.  They did not even have a chance to read the 200 
pages of text that makes up Bill C-78.  Seniors now, because they 
pay attention to the news and read the papers, are a very well 
informed group of voters and they are catching on in large 
numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like every good son, I had brunch with my mother on Sunday.  She 
collects a pension through the public service pension plan.  It 
was a very nice brunch.  She collects the survivor's benefit 
because my father worked in the public sector all of his life and 
she survives on the meagre survivor's benefit that she gets.  She 
lives in the same little wartime house at 998 Warsaw that I grew 
up in.  Betty Martin, who is 82 years old and lives in Winnipeg, 
asked me at brunch, unprompted I might add, “Are they going to 
take away my pension?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to answer, to be fair, that nothing was going to happen to 
the pension she is currently collecting.  However, I told her 
that the $30 billion surplus would be taken out of the fund. Her 
question was “Is that not part of our pension?”  That is an 
innocent question which came right out of the blue.  An 82 year 
old woman saw immediately what was happening.  Without reading 
the text she knew that it was fundamentally wrong to take $30 
billion out of the pension fund which could have gone to improve 
the benefits of pensioners and retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole thing got off to a bad start because of one statement 
made by the chief human resources officer of the Treasury Board 
Secretariat in June 1998.  I will quote Mr. Alain Jolicoeur 
because I want to get this right.  He made one statement that 
started the ball rolling on this whole atrocity.  He said 
“Employees and retirees have no proprietary interest to the 
surplus in the superannuation plan”.  He defied all conventional 
wisdom on employee benefit plans by saying “The surplus is not 
yours.  You get your benefits, but the surplus is not yours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a basic tenet of anybody who is involved with employee 
benefit plans that any surplus is deferred wages.  It is part of 
the pay package.  It is money being held in trust to improve the 
benefits of the beneficiaries of the plan.  That is where we got 
off to a bad start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board made it worse when he came 
out publicly and said even more strongly “There is no chance in 
hell that the union can claim a $30 billion surplus”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, he is wrong.  It is not the union that is trying 
to claim the money.  None of that money would go to the union. 
The union is arguing that it should go to the beneficiaries.  His 
quote was “They do not have a chance in hell of getting their 
hands on it”.  The government had made up its mind in a cold and 
callous way.  It had targeted that money and then it set about 
taking very logical steps to take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a pattern we have seen before.  The government took $25 
billion from the EI surplus, which was taken from the most 
vulnerable people in society, the unemployed.  Now it is taking 
money away from arguably the next most vulnerable bunch of people 
in society, the retirees, senior citizens, pensioners, 
beneficiaries of the pension plan, many of whom live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not let anybody tell us that this is some kind of 
Cadillac pension we are dealing with.  A disproportionate number 
of retirees are female.  The average woman, with 20 years of 
service in the federal public service, is receiving a pension of 
approximately $9,000 a year.  This is not a Cadillac pension. 
Nobody is living in luxury as a result of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that $30 billion were divided up among the beneficiaries it 
would result in about $30,000 per beneficiary.  Spread out over 
the period of their retirement it might mean $2,000 or $3,000 a 
year per beneficiary.  Again, $9,000 to $11,000 or $12,000 is not 
a huge amount of dough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get a chance to speak to many of the motions which I 
put forward, but obviously we have put forward amendments to this 
bill that would take away the enabling language that was cleverly 
put in to allow the government to take not only this $30 billion 
surplus, but all other surpluses; all future surpluses which will 
be invested by the public sector pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, one of the amendments that we put forward 
dealt with that board and the pension investment policies that it 
might be bound to or that might be stipulated.  The legislation 
is really silent on that.  The only goal would be to produce the 
maximum profit.  Obviously that has to be the first goal of any 
trustees of a pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would argue that there should be some ethical investment 
policies as well.  For instance, the government should not invest 
in any company that might be engaged in a service that is 
contracted out which would cost public service members their 
jobs.  What if it were a janitorial company that was bidding on a 
contract to clean the House of Commons?  The people who 
traditionally do those jobs would be laid off and replaced with 
people from a company in which their pension plan is invested. 
That would be fundamentally wrong.  I think the beneficiaries 
would want to speak out against that.  They will not get a chance 
to speak out against it now.  That is just one example of how 
many things need to be discussed and we will not get a chance to 
discuss them.  It is deplorable.  It is excrement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members for 
participating in the debate.  The answer to the question the hon. 
member asked is, I would assume, based on the fact that the 
Speaker did not provide a ruling, that excrement is indeed a word 
that is applicable and usable in the House.  However, I would 
simply ask that hon. members present who are participating in 
this debate not use bathroom humour, however playful or however 
humourous it may seem at the time.  This is a very serious piece 
of legislation and I would like to elevate the debate to make 
sure that we continue to focus on the issues at hand.  Hon. 
members, I am sure, would like to engage in a bit of playful 
conversation during the course of the debate, but I think that 
our responsibility and what we are charged to do here is to stick 
to the issues at hand, the specifics of this legislation and the 
needs of our respective constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite have raised the issue that certain 
pensions should be based not on the contributions or the formula 
that the pension plan was based on, but that consideration should 
be given for lower income pensioners or lower pension levels and 
that those levels should indeed be topped up.  I understand the 
merit and general detail of that particular proposal.  I think it 
is a very kindhearted idea.  In my own personal view it has some 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, those who contribute to the pension plan are all 
public servants. 
They really want and need the pension plan to be devised and to 
be implemented on a formula based approach which is accountable 
and fair so they will know exactly where their money is going as 
they contribute.  That is the way the policyholders themselves 
would like the pension plan to be administered.  I ask hon. 
members opposite to bear that in mind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One final point is that there was some reference made by a 
member of the Reform Party, who I understand is also chairman of 
the public accounts committee, who attended the committee 
hearings on natural resources and government operations which 
reviewed this particular legislation at second reading.  A point 
has to be made.  When the committee was considering this 
particular piece of legislation what it was faced and charged 
with, in part, was to look at specific amendments; in other 
words, specific ideas that the opposition had as to how it would 
change the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were very few amendments put forward by the opposition. 
As a procedural matter the amendments were grouped in various 
sections.  We debated the amendments in those sections, which 
proved to be a very efficient and effective way of dealing with 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that has to be made is that debate in committee has to 
be based on specific ideas that have been brought forward by any 
member of the committee.  We as government House members and 
government committee members did indeed put forward specific 
proposals for change to the legislation.  We debated those and in 
some measure we got them through in committee.  Very few 
amendments were put forward by the opposition to this particular 
legislation.  Therefore, that in itself was a limitation on 
debate.  The issue at that point in time became whether the 
legislation as it was currently drafted by the government would 
indeed be passed at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a point in which I think members of the House would be 
interested.  Many of the people who spoke here this morning were 
not in attendance at committee where much of the work of the 
House is conducted from the point of view of reviewing 
legislation, reviewing different amendments and talking about the 
general issues surrounding the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that members opposite have now joined the debate at 
this stage.  It would have been very helpful if they had joined 
the debate at the committee stage, but that is their choice.  Now 
we have a chance to renew the debate.  We have to maintain a 
focus on very specific issues.  I say to members opposite that we 
should try to not get involved in too much bathroom humour.  It 
is too serious a piece of legislation to do that and I think that 
members of the pension plan and members of the general public 
expect a bit more dignity and decorum in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the House for its indulgence and I would 
like to proceed with this very useful debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam  Speaker, it 
is with a degree of sadness that I rise today to speak to Bill 
C-78.  I believe that many members of the House, including 
members on the government side, share this sense of remorse for 
the process in which we are participating.  We feel very badly 
that we are participating in what effectively, and let us be 
candid about it, is a parliamentary charade.  Canadians can watch 
this on CPAC.  Somehow, in some way, the government is trying to 
demonstrate that there is legitimate parliamentary debate on 
important public policy issues, in this case Bill C-78, which is 
a 200 page bill, a complicated piece of legislation which affects 
all Canadian public servants and entails remarkable changes, 
sweeping changes, relative to $100 billion ultimately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may, in watching this, actually believe that there has 
been legitimate debate.  I would like to inform Canadians who may 
be watching that there has not been legitimate debate.  The 
government has railroaded this through parliament, through the 
committee process, through the House and has utilized closure 
again.  The government has, at an unprecedented rate, used the 
instrument of closure to railroad legislation through parliament. 
It has not allowed the committee to effectively study this 
important piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that the main purpose of the legislation 
is to improve the financial management of the financial sector 
pension funds and the superannuate funds of the federal public 
servants, RCMP and military.  Keep in mind that the average 
annual pension for these individuals is around $9,000 per year. 
These are not fat cats we are talking about.  They are very 
average Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be sceptical whenever the government claims to have 
the interest of public servants at heart, particularly if we look 
at the record of the government on public servants. Sunday's 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> said that the Treasury Board president “has 
clobbered public servants harder than any cabinet minister in 
Canada's history”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The politics of attacking public servants is similar to the 
politics of attacking politicians.  It is very easy to attack a 
group that may not be particularly popular with the public 
because of misperceptions, or to make gratuitous attacks on the 
banking sector which the government has been willing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very cynical that the government would use in a political 
sense any tool it has to attack groups that may not be incredibly 
popular but are groups that have legitimate causes and claims. 
For the government to play a very dangerous and cynical political 
game of pitting one group of Canadians against another simply for 
political expediency and political palatability is atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has eliminated 55,000 federal jobs, has frozen 
wages, has eliminated job security from the public service and 
has appealed the pay equity ruling in opposition to Liberal Party 
policy.  I think it was a red book promise.  It is a government 
that continues to use heavy-handed back to work legislation and 
suspends binding arbitration.  This is the same Liberal Party 
that under the leadership of Lester Pearson introduced collective 
bargaining to the public service 30 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government leaders and the Prime Minister are being 
the patron saints of hypocrisy in backtracking on every major 
tenet of not just Liberal policy, but also of the fundamentals of 
fairness we value as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government that introduced back to work legislation to 
end a strike of 14,000 blue collar workers.  Again, these are not 
high income workers within the public service.  The government 
maintained the policy of regional rates of pay and a 
ghettoization of public servants.  It introduced the back to work 
legislation without proper debate and sought closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board reached a tentative 
agreement with the public servants and withheld that information 
from parliament before a crucial vote. That night he snookered 
the Reform Party. Unwittingly the Reform Party supported the back 
to work legislation because the government had pitted the 
interests of one group against another, in this case the grain 
farmers and the grain industry in the west against the interests 
of blue collar public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again that was cynical.  It was an abuse of the parliamentary 
process and an abuse of members of parliament that should not 
only offend the Reform Party members, and I am sure it does, but 
it should also offend members of parliament on the government 
side of the House who watched that night and who participated in 
the vote without the proper information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of morale in the public service is at an all-time low. 
While Canadian corporations are pursuing innovative 
labour-management and human resources management policies, the 
government is continuing to attack the public service and ignore 
the fact that the public sector represents 40% of the Canadian 
economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some hon. members present who serve on the finance 
committee with me.  We are studying the issue of productivity. 
When 40% of our economy is public sector and the government has 
created a level of morale that has never been lower within the 
public service, I would argue that we have a productivity issue 
within our public service.  This government through its continued 
gratuitous attacks on the public service has had a significant 
deleterious effect on the morale and the productivity of the 
federal public service.  It has impacted the growth and future 
prosperity of Canadians in doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only group this government has demonstrated more contempt 
for besides public servants is members of parliament in this 
House.  The government is persistent in its propensity to use 
closure and to railroad legislation through committees and 
through this House without legitimate and important public policy 
debate.  Committees are being operated as branch plants of the 
ministers' offices.  Government members are told to pass bills 
but not really discuss them.  There is no objective, constructive 
development of public policy as there should be and at a time 
when public policy and the challenges facing us are very complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a secular decline in the role of the MP which has 
occurred over a 30 year period.  This decline has occurred at a 
precipitous level under this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation the government is failing to follow its 
own guidelines set out in S-3, the pension benefits standards act 
for the private sector.  It sets out guidelines for the private 
sector and for private sector employers which the government 
itself is unwilling to use.  Why is it doing that? Because it 
wants to get its hands on that $30 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would tell Canadians that that money is being 
applied to the debt. Keep in mind, in some ways it is a 
theoretical number; it is just a paper shift.  The fact is that 
the government has not done anything to better Canadians by 
taking that from one group and putting it against the national 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done something it believes to benefit itself 
politically.  Come the next election the government will claim 
credit and say that it reduced the debt by the figure of $30 
billion when it has not.  Public servants through their pensions 
and their sacrifices, work and contributions over the years have 
provided the ability for the government to have that surplus and 
the government is taking that in a very cynical way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said cynical several times.  I feel very cynical today to 
be participating in this process where the government is again 
pitting the Canadian public against the public service, creating 
more division in a country that needs more unity. We should be 
working particularly in a post-deficit and a surplus environment 
to rebuild our relationships as parliamentarians and as 
government with the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federal Superannuates National Association, the FSNA, has 
done a very good job on this, as have other organizations.  The 
federal superannuates were effective in their lobby against the 
seniors benefit package which through clawbacks would have 
reduced pension benefits for seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is not focused on creating better prosperity for 
Canadians.  This government is focused solely on the next 
election and not on the next century.  This treatment of 
parliament and of public servants has to end. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for St. Albert has pointed out so rightly, 
the time we have had to bring to light the various issues in this 
bill before the Canadian people has been cut short again. It is a 
tragic abuse of this House. There are some very significant 
factors in this bill that need to be brought to the attention of 
Canadians. I will focus on a couple of them this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to preface my remarks to Group No. 2 amendments.  We are 
only on Group No. 1 amendments at the moment.  I do want to point 
out that I have some very serious concerns with Group No. 2 which 
I will be addressing later in the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to ask in this House when new legislation 
comes along, how is it serving the Canadian people? With this 
piece of legislation it is important to look at the before 
picture and the after picture.  What was it like before and what 
is it going to be like after? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My particular concerns revolve around the pension board itself, 
the people who administer and manage the funds on behalf of the 
employees of the Canadian government including the MPs in this 
very House.  Prior to this legislation the way the board operated 
or how the fund was managed was under the scrutiny of the auditor 
general. The House was aware of any changes that were made. 
There was public scrutiny.  That served the public interest and 
the employees covered by this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this legislation propose to do in that arena?  It 
proposes tragically to completely remove any kind of public 
scrutiny of the management of these public service pension plans. 
It proposes to set up a totally independent separate board, a 
board of people managing this fund who are appointed to their 
positions.  I have seen no reference in the act to any sort of 
qualifications or skill sets for this particular job.  They are 
appointed to the positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no option for the employees or those in the union to be 
represented on the board.  It is their own pension plan and there 
is no allowance for them to be represented on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no allowance for access to information which 
there was prior to this bill.  If someone wanted to find out some 
of the details about how the fund was being managed or some 
aspect of the ongoing management, there was the option to do that 
with the current legislation.  With the establishment of a new 
arm's length board, the access to information regulations and 
legislation will not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the before picture the auditor general had the purview to 
look at this fund, to see how it was being managed and the 
decisions that were being made.  After this legislation, guess 
what?  It is gone.  The auditor general does not have access to 
or will not critique the management of this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see a consistent number of changes with this legislation 
that move the management of this fund of so many public service 
employees of the Canadian government out of public scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thrust of the amendments by the hon. member for St. Albert 
is that they try to bring back some of the accountability to the 
members, the employees and the public in general as to how this 
fund is being managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Backbench Liberals will support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  I hear a member commenting that 
hopefully backbench members from the Liberal Party will support 
that.  I do not hold out much hope for that because we have seen 
them before, when the orders come down they fold their tents and 
line up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments we brought forward in Group No. 1 are 
specifically designed to bring the accountability in this pension 
plan back to the Canadian people and to the employees covered by 
the plan. I will cover the thrust of the amendments for those who 
are listening and for those in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 would force the board of directors of this new 
separately established pension board to maintain contact on an 
ongoing basis with the actuaries of each fund the board manages. 
In other words, this forces them to look at how the fund is 
actually being managed, to get the report from those who are 
looking at how many people are drawing from the fund, how many 
people are putting into the fund, how it is going to survive in 
the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that this appointed board with no accountability 
may not look at what is actually going on.  It may make decisions 
without full consideration of the long term implications of those 
decisions. We are trying to bring some quality control back into 
the process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for St. Albert put forward Motions Nos. 8 and 11 
which deal with reporting to the House who the appointed 
chairperson is and who are the members of the board.  At present 
there is no obligation to inform us.  Let us think about that. 
This is a public service pension plan for the employees of the 
federal government.  This House, this institution, is not advised 
who is managing the pension plan as a result of this new piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully the member for St. Albert put forward some motions 
which would at least let us know what is going on, who are the 
players and hopefully their credentials for the job.  This is the 
thrust of our amendments.  Consistent with the Reform, we are 
calling for greater accountability in the management of public 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the other Reform amendments.  I look at 
Motion No. 16 which would force an act of parliament to be passed 
in order for changes to be made to the contribution rates. Who 
would this protect?  It would protect the employees who are 
contributing to the pension plan.  Without this protection rates 
can go up or down.  If there is a surplus in the fund we know the 
legislation would allow the Liberal government to get a hold of 
it.  This is a checkpoint, a way of controlling management of the 
fund and protecting employees from potential abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before there is any increase in the rates they will be brought 
before the House and an act of parliament would be required for 
them to be adjusted.  It just makes sense.  Without that there is 
no protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Motion No. 32.  Members can see the consistent 
theme in all Reform motions: greater accountability in the 
process.  I do not have near enough time to cover all amendments 
on the the whole theme of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of amendments drive home the need for greater 
accountability, but I will not have enough time to deal with 
them.  For the 51st or 52nd time the Liberal government has 
forced closure on important pieces of legislation so we cannot 
bring to light the critical considerations the Canadian public 
needs to be aware of to see how the Liberal government is 
mismanaging public funds.  We are calling for greater 
accountability in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With great chagrin I have to stop.  I hope my colleagues in the 
House have heard my appeal.  We have to bring forth some 
accountability by supporting the Reform amendments the hon. 
member for St. Albert has put forward on behalf of Canadian 
people and employees in this plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-78, which is essentially, for 
those who do not know, a bill giving the present government the 
power to get its hands of $30 billion in surplus funds in the 
federal employees' pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking here of $30 million, but $30 billion.  This 
is a bill that gives the federal government the power to get its 
hands on that money and to use it as it sees fit. 
In other words, this gives the government a great deal of power, 
even allowing it, to a certain extent, to treat those who have 
contributed to this pension fund most unfairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What gives the federal government the power to do this is a grey 
area of the law.  There is apparently nothing in federal law at 
this time that governs the use of pension fund surpluses, 
nothing that makes sure they are used in a reasonable manner or 
in the taxpayers' interest. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This grey area allows the federal government to act in this way, 
to pass Bill C-78 and to get it hands on the $30 billion or so of 
federal employee pension fund surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is a grave injustice because, when it comes 
down to it, there appears to be absolutely no concern for the 
interests of those who contributed to this pension fund.  Nor 
does the interest of the public seem necessarily to be served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such action is precedent setting. 
If the federal government helps itself to the surplus in its own 
employees' pension fund, what is there to prevent any company 
from helping itself to the surplus in its employees' pension 
fund, as used to happen?  Several examples were given in the 
House of companies that relied on this argument to dip into the 
surpluses in their employees' pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the federal government is doing with Bill C-78 is unfair. 
It is setting a poor example for companies and decision makers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several indications that it is acting in bad faith. 
The President of the Treasury Board has not even bothered to 
appoint to the board union representatives or employees who have 
contributed to this pension fund. 
Rather than opening up the board responsible for managing this 
pension fund to people who truly represent contributors or to 
union representatives, the President of the Treasury Board has 
decided to appoint a group of people.  The reason is obvious; 
these people will defend the interests of the federal government 
rather than those of actual contributors to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in the least surprised.  What did the federal 
government do for unemployed workers?  Exactly the same thing. 
Unemployed workers contribute to employment insurance, but the 
government is making it increasingly difficult for more than 
about 36% to 39% of them to qualify for benefits.  Sixty per 
cent of workers do not qualify, although they contribute to the 
employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of course unfair. It is also a misappropriation of 
funds. The unemployed or the workers who contributed to the 
employment insurance plan expect the government to use the money 
to create jobs, particularly since, in the case of employment 
insurance, the federal government does not contribute one penny 
to the plan. It is the workers and employers who contribute to 
that plan. The money belongs to them and it should be managed 
with their best interests in mind, not those of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is trying to find oblique ways to get as much 
money as possible, whether it is fair or not, as in this case. 
This is unfair, and even immoral and dishonest. The government 
collects a lot of taxes and has a lot of debts. Taxes have 
increased considerably since it took office. Since 1993, there 
have been about 38 increases. The overall tax burden in Canada 
has gone up about 15%. 
We are paying something like $30 billion more in taxes than we 
did in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is among the countries with the highest tax rates in the 
G-7, the OECD and the industrialized world. This statement is not 
from me, but from the OECD, which says that we are one of the 
most heavily taxed nation in the industrialized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of lowering taxes and acting fairly and equitably, the 
government is using oblique ways to take money out of the 
pockets of taxpayers, including its own employees. It is 
grabbing the surplus in that pension fund to use it for its own 
purposes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said, this is dishonest.  It is a kind of piracy. 
The Minister of Finance is Captain Morgan, who has decided to 
break into the treasure chest of his own crew.  The Minister of 
Finance is Captain Hook, pillaging his own crew a second or 
third time.  I am not sure how many times, but this is not the 
first time that this piracy has taken place.  Taking $30 billion 
in surplus from one's own employees' pension fund is indeed an 
act of piracy 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are proposing some amendments because, 
basically, there are honest ways of handling a surplus, ways 
that are not hard to understand.  There are many examples, in 
Quebec and elsewhere, of handling funds in compliance with 
legislation.  The purpose of our amendments is to suggest to the 
government fair, respectable and honest ways of handling the 
surplus in the federal employees' pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are plenty of examples.  The 1985 act suggests all kinds 
of ways to apply pension benefit standards and ways to see that 
surpluses are, in some way, returned to those who contributed to 
them.  There is a whole series of measures that could be 
implemented so as to respect the interests of those who paid 
into a pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the legislation created must not only ensure that 
the money gets back, one way or the other, to those who 
contributed it, but also a committee must be struck to represent 
unionized workers.  The President of Treasury Board does not 
seem to be contemplating this possibility.  The government has 
decided instead to reject outright anyone who could speak for 
the workers, opting instead for appointing people who will speak 
for the government.  To what end?  To get their hands on the 
surplus in the public servants' pension fund, that $30 billion, 
and no doubt to use it for other purposes.  Once again, this is 
a roundabout way of taxing people.  Unfortunately, this is a 
most unfair way as well.

it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard other adjectives to describe the bill, but my 
favourite is that the legislation came from the south end of a 
northbound cow.  It does absolutely no good for the Canadian 
people.  It does absolutely no good for the regard of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of the Liberal government having 
absolutely no consideration and no respect for the hallowed place 
we call the House of Commons.  All four political parties in

to coast.  Government members disregard us, so that means they 
disregard our constituents as well and the people in their

review the aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute disgrace that current members of the plan who 
are working pay 7.5% of their salary into the plan.  After the 
$30 billion have been ripped away from their wallets, they will 
end up paying 8.9%. In essence it is another tax upon Canadians, 
especially workers in the federal public service.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I read something very interesting yesterday in the <I>National 
Post</I>.  I love this.  The government can find more ways to 
spend money and waste tax dollars than any other government in 
the history of the House of Commons.  The article stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government wants to know what creates unhappy workers.  For the 
first time the federal government is going to survey all its 
employees across Canada to find out what makes them so frustrated 
and unhappy on the job. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is to spend $1 million to do that.  If it wished, 
it could give me $100,000, which I would spend in my riding much 
more effectively than it can, and put the other $900,000 toward 
the debt, reducing taxes or into social programs.  I could tell 
the government for free why people are so unhappy and so angry at 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the pay equity concern.  It totally ignored pay 
equity.  It broke its promise on pay equity.  On the table 2 
negotiations there was another broken promise by the federal 
government.  It absolutely forced the lowest paid workers in the 
federal public service back to work against their wishes without 
even consultation in terms of consideration for fair collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about our military personnel who are in Kosovo 
right now working in our peacekeeping efforts, over 60,000 men 
and women and their families.  There is an absolute disregard for 
their future in terms of their pensions.  It will take this money 
and spend it willy-nilly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our RCMP officers are under attack all the time in the press and 
sometimes by citizens because of some misgivings of a few of 
them.  The RCMP does a fantastic job.  To treat its members this 
way when it comes to their retirement and taking their money away 
to be spent in other areas is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about many aspects of the federal public service. I 
cannot shout it loud enough.  It is a disgrace what the federal 
government is doing.  It has total disregard for its workers and 
retirees who amount to about 1.8 million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find appalling as a new MP that this kind of effort goes on 
and on and on.  The government has done it in many other aspects. 
There have been over 50 time allocation motions brought forth by 
the government since 1993.  Now it has brought forth a piece of 
legislation that is 200 pages thick and has cut off debate after 
four hours.  It never took the government four hours to write up 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Winnipeg Centre brought forth 
recommendations and amendments to the bill.  Everyone in the 
House should heed his warning.  If he says they are right then 
they are absolutely bang on.  There is not a more honourable 
member of the House than our labour critic from Winnipeg Centre. 
That was a free paid public advertisement for my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go into the various details and aspects of the bill, but 
I want to ask the government one question.  Why when all is said 
and done will the government not allow the auditor general to 
review the legislation in upcoming years?  Why is it hiding it? 
Why is it ramming the bill through so fast? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many speculations on that side that the war in 
Kosovo is a perfect opportunity to present the legislation.  It 
will not make the press.  It will not make the news.  It can be 
kept quiet and hushed.  As its own internal reports say, if the 
government wants to do something bad it should do it fast, do it 
dirty, do it quick and get it over with; forget consensus from 
the Canadian people and forget even consulting with them.  It 
will not even allow elected parliamentarians to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not the case, why does the government not hold 
committee hearings across the country to get a fair view of what 
the people are saying?  It will not do that because it is afraid 
to face the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said to many of my constituents that the government plans 
to spend the money some three to six months prior to the next 
federal election.  We will see the Minister of Finance and other 
cabinet ministers going across the country from coast to coast to 
coast and asking, for example, what Winnipeg Centre needs.  Does 
it need a new road?  Does Halifax need a new building?  Do they 
need this or that?  Do they need tax cuts?  They will have over 
$50 billion between the EI surplus and the pension surplus to 
spend at their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals keep saying that it is Canadian taxpayers money. 
However, no one was fooled when they came down with the recent 
health care budget of $11.5 billion over five years, after taking 
away $21 billion. 
This was money that was taken away from employees and employers 
through the EI fund.  That is where the money came from.  It was 
not new money.  Maybe next year it will be a green budget.  It 
could be a tax reduction budget.  However, I can assure members 
the money will be taken away from federal public servants and 
retirees.  That is where the money will come from.  It is nothing 
new.

government.  It forms on fascism and dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always said that it appears at times we live in a 
capitulated democracy.  As long as Liberal backbenchers do what 
the cabinet says, they can do whatever they want.  I would be 
ashamed to be a Liberal backbencher.  They are like sheep or 
grazing cattle.  They sit back and do whatever cabinet tells 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be a fly on the wall when federal public 
servants call their offices to hear what their explanation is, 
what they tell these people.  We know what we would tell them. We 
would offer our support and tell them that the government should 
not take this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should scrap Bill C-78, just ignore it and leave 
the money where it is.  It should reinvest in public servants, 
pensioners and widowers.  It should improve the benefits.  It 
should give better dental care, health care and eye wear.  It 
should improve pension benefits.  That is what the money was 
there for.  It was not meant for the government to take and spend 
at its pleasure, similar to what it has done with the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk all day on this subject.  Any time we get to bash 
the government on something that is right we should take the 
opportunity to do it, but it is rare that all four political 
parties on the opposition side agree on something. We have agreed 
on hepatitis C and on various aspects of EI.  Now we totally 
agree on this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to lose the next election, this is 
exactly how it should go about doing it.  It takes the money from 
taxpayers and whenever the election is held it tries to buy votes 
with their own money.  Canadian electors are too smart for that. 
They will see through this smoke and mirrors in a heartbeat. They 
will know right away.  If the federal government wants to try to 
win the next election, it should start backtracking on 
legislation like this and start listening to the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is deplorable that the treasury board minister who holds the 
key to the vault says that it is the taxpayers money and no way 
in hell are the unions to get that money. I echo the words of my 
colleague for Winnipeg Centre.  It is not union money.  The 
unions are saying that it should go to all federal public 
servants who have retired and all those who are currently 
working.  That is where the money belongs, not to the treasury 
board minister.  It is a disgrace that he would try to belittle 
the effort of the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this is the only time I will speak to the bill publicly 
in the House, we will be raising the alarm bells loud and clear 
in our ridings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this limited opportunity to debate a very 
important issue for Canadians.  They should know the abuse of 
democracy in this place.  I have always viewed democracy as being 
a very fine way of getting the consensus of the governed.  If we 
do not have the consensus of the governed in a democracy then 
government falls apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is voluntary.  Each of us voluntarily subjects 
ourselves to the authority of the government because in a true 
democracy the government is under authority to the people who 
elect it.  That is being seriously eroded by the present 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking to the fact that we are dealing today with a bill 
being rammed through parliament by a government that has gone 
totally crazy with power.  Just because it has a majority it can 
do whatever it wants and its spineless backbenchers vote on 
command.  I wish there were someone over there with some 
principles.  They were several two parliaments ago when the GST 
was being rammed through, greatly against the wishes of the 
people. 
There were several members who had the personal strength to vote 
the way they believed peopled wanted despite what their 
government was telling them.  That was democratic.  I will not 
make any individual references, but I have high respect for 
people who do things such as that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see some Liberal backbenchers finally get up in 
this place and say enough.  This is not democracy.  This is not 
the will of the people.  This is not the wish of the people. This 
is a dictatorship.  That is a strong word.  I almost do not like 
to use it, but that is what it is.  That is what is being done 
here.  It is unconscionable.  It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many reports of people losing respect for government. 
This is one way respect could be restored.  It is one way we 
could just back off and cool down the whole process.  It is time 
for us to do what is right and to do it in the right way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with public service pensions.  I will not use the 
strong words of some members to my political left and my physical 
right, but it is absolutely atrocious.  I feel very strongly 
about it as well.  It is unconscionable that the bill should be 
rammed through.  I hate to use the word arrogance because when I 
use it, it makes me sound arrogant.  However there is arrogance 
in a government which believes that it alone can come up with the 
best way of doing things and that it cannot be touched.  That is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years I taught at a technical institute.  For many of 
those years I was a supervisor and I learned that I could not 
make all the best or perfect decisions.   I consulted those I 
supervised whom I considered my peers because many of them had as 
much experience as I had.  Certainly most of them had as much 
wisdom and maybe even as much intelligence, although that would 
be debatable.  We had many good discussions and debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many times as their supervisor, even though I thought 
we should go in a certain direction, that I was persuaded by the 
collective wisdom of the others to change direction.  Sometimes 
it was dramatically; sometimes it was minor changes.  That is an 
effective way of managing not only the affairs of a small math 
department in a technical institute but the affairs of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe members on the other side are ready to invest 
in two or three people the autocratic right to dictate the way 
this should be and not to say that we think some of these 
amendments are fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at report stage on Bill C-78 which concerns the pensions 
of civil servants.  It just happens there are many amendments. I 
know I cannot use props so I will resist the temptation to use a 
copy of the bill as a prop.  Because of its weight it has sunk 
right to the bottom of the pile on my desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a large bill.  It has 200 pages.  Consequently it is 
possible that one or two of its clauses or phrases are not quite 
perfect.  What is the role of parliamentarians?  It is to listen 
to each other.  That does not mean there is a line down the 
middle of the House with all the collective wisdom on that side 
and nothing but stupidity on this side.  That cannot be.  That is 
illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we have put forward a number of amendments.  My hon. 
colleague from St. Albert said in committee that he wanted to 
have debated some of these amendments and others that he put 
forward.  Basically he was shut down by the committee. 
Government members were so intent on ramming it through that they 
would not even let him debate the issues in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is no effective give and take, negotiation and 
agreement to make changes in committee, then it has to take place 
here.  I know it is speculation at this stage but we expect the 
government to limit our ability to debate.  A number of members 
have already said that.  I regret this.  This is a big bill with 
many clauses and amendments.  This will probably be my last 
opportunity to speak on the subject.  I do not think that ought 
to be so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several groups of amendments.  It is absolutely 
shameful for this government to even think of shutting down 
debate before members have been given an opportunity to express 
themselves on these amendments.  It is even more shameful that 
even though we do that, the government on the other side and all 
of those wimpy backbenchers will probably—I will not 
presuppose—just fold and do as they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to pensions it is important to consider some basic 
thoughts.  There is an MP pension plan.  I am very proud to be 
one of the Reformers who opted out of that pension plan because 
it is unconscionable.  It exempts this group of Canadians, namely 
the 301 in this House of Commons, from parts of the Income Tax 
Act so they can have a very very rich pension which is primarily 
paid for by others.  It is true that members who participate make 
some contribution but the rate of contribution of the employer, 
namely the taxpayers, is way out of proportion. Because I do not 
believe we should be a privileged group, I opted out of it at 
great expense. It is an example of other people being expected to 
provide for the pension benefits of a person when he or she 
retires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same thing with the Canada pension plan. 
Mathematicians and actuaries did calculations and the politicians 
of the day for political reasons did not act on those 
recommendations.  They underfunded the thing and now we are 
facing a 70% increase in premiums in order to fix it because of 
political considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is this pension plan.  The question very simply is who 
should pay for it?  The principle we generally recognize as fair 
especially in government is that there be an equal payment. About 
50% of the money to fund the pension should come from the 
employee and about 50% should come from the employer, 1:1.  If we 
had an MP pension plan like that, I would probably be permitted 
by my constituents to participate in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question with regard to this pension plan is whether the 
government has the right to take the $30 billion in surplus. 
Clearly the actuaries have made a mistake and there is an 
adjustment to be made.  We need to make sure the mathematics is 
done correctly.  They have overcharged.  Whose money is it?  In 
my view close to half belongs to the taxpayer or the government 
and half belongs to the employees who have contributed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government to unilaterally take it away without giving 
them their share deserves a very strong word which I am not 
permitted to use.  It has to do with taking things that do not 
belong to you.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I find it interesting.  We are debating a bill of a lot 
of significance.  It has been through a committee process. It has 
had over one year of negotiations between the unions representing 
the workers and the government.  It is in the House for 
discussion at report stage where we would generally put forward 
and discuss amendments.  I have listened to the last three 
speakers from the opposition and I have not heard anyone discuss 
the actual amendments they want to put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead they are using the stale argument that somehow the 
government is ramming something through.  One of them made the 
statement that just because we have a majority we think we can do 
things around here.  Is that not bizarre in a democracy? 
When we get a majority it means we are responsible to do things. 
It means we are the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not that it would ever happen, but were the members opposite 
through some freak of fate on this side of the House with a 
majority government, would they turn the reins of government over 
to a minority opposition party, to a party that represents only 
one region of the country, a party that does not have the 
interests of the entire nation in its platform?  I do not think 
they would. If we wanted to see things rammed through this place, 
just let those guys get control of the reins of government for 
one minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a public pension fund.  It is particularly 
curious that members of the Reform Party, of all people, would 
not support using a surplus.  How did that surplus build up?  It 
was through contributions over the years guaranteed by the 
employer, which is the federal government.  A surplus of some $30 
billion has been identified.  Rather than leaving it in a black 
box or leaving it on the books, the government says it makes 
sense to reduce the size of the federal government's debt with 
that money. This is only one program of many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least I understand the principles behind the New Democrats 
who would purport to represent the men and women in the unions in 
this situation.  At least with their principles they say that the 
money belongs to the workers.  I do not agree with them but I 
understand the philosophy and the principles they stand behind on 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find such difficulty coming to grips with the other parties, 
notably the Reform Party.  It would purport to want to cut taxes, 
eliminate the debt, reduce spending in every aspect of the 
government, except health care of course where it is going to 
spend more except it is cutting so it will not have more to 
spend.  The math is quite mind boggling.  It comes out opposed to 
reducing the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really curious.  The member opposite said he would like to 
find a member in the Liberal backbench who would stand up and 
vote against the government so that he could respect that member. 
I would like to find a member over there who could possibly 
justify the total abdication of Reform's stated policy for fiscal 
responsibility by suggesting that a $30 billion surplus generated 
primarily through good management of the pension fund and by the 
taxpayers should be left alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand it. I am sure if their constituents back 
home in western Canada had an opportunity to question them on it, 
the constituents would wonder why Reform members are doing this. 
It goes contrary to everything they have stood for. Where is the 
public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  We do not hear about the bill.  We do not 
hear about the fact that there has been over one year of 
consultation with the public sector unions.  There are things we 
could not agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should it be such a tremendous surprise that in an 
employer-employee bargaining relationship there might be things 
that cannot be resolved at the bargaining table?  There might be 
things we would have to agree to disagree on and move on.  That 
is exactly what has happened here.  That process has taken place. 
Nobody is ramming anything through.  If the opposition members 
were doing their duty as opposition members they would be putting 
on the floor the real issues of debate in this bill that have 
been raised in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the other point.  The bill went to the natural resources 
committee.  A member stood and showed this 200 page bill. If the 
members opposite are so upset with it, we would expect out of a 
200 page bill there might be 50, 60, 100 amendments. We see it 
all the time.  We see it with other bills.  Why is it there are a 
total of 15 amendments that have been put on the floor and most 
of them are absolutely not the type of amendment that would have 
a great impact?  They are minor amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why those members will not discuss the bill. 
They continually want to talk about the so-called issue of 
closure which is not what we are doing at all. 
We are at report stage in the House which is a normal process.

A lot of Canadians would love to have a pension both as secure 
and as generous as this pension is.  A lot of my constituents 
would look at this and ask why should they, taxpayers, leave a 
$30 billion surplus for somebody to play around with in the 
future when in fact it should be used to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member opposite said that at election time somebody is going 
to be using this money to build roads or to do favours in 
someone's riding. We are talking about reducing the national 
debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I say on the backs of 
the taxpayers because it is the taxpayers who have to carry the 
burden of that debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take every opportunity in this place to identify 
surpluses in each and every plan, in each and every department.

of Canada.  I am only one of them but I speak on behalf of others

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> said “If the money had not gone into 
the pension plan, it would have been paid as wages to the 
employees”.  That is the position the opposition takes.  “It is 
an argument with merit”, the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> went on to say, 
“but it runs up against one with even more merit.  The employer, 
the federal government, must make up any shortfall in the 
plan”—in other words, the taxpayer is the guarantor of the 
pension plan—“which as a defined benefit plan guarantees the 
amount of pension received.  The 
employer”—taxpayer—“shoulders the risk and should get any 
reward”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a statement by a member of the cabinet.  That is not 
a statement made by a member of the backbench in support of the 
cabinet.  That is a statement right out of the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I>.  Members opposite who represent ridings in western 
Canada should listen to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal <I>Gazette</I> said “But fair is fair.  If 
taxpayers were willing to take a risk to keep the plan solvent, 
they should get their money back if it is no longer required”. 
The Edmonton <I>Journal</I> said “The reason is simple:  that is 
government money.  If it is not needed to provide a fair pension 
to government employees, a fair pension not a sumptuous one, it 
is urgently needed for other purposes”.  The Toronto <I>Star</I> 
asked “Whose pension surplus?” Whose surplus is it?. We know 
whose it is.  It is the taxpayers' surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is responsible.  Those members are trying to cloud the 
issue with some nonsensical statements about forcing something 
through. There has been over one year of consultations and there 
have been committee hearings.  It is now in the House at report

</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that three categories of public service of 
Canada employees are affected by this bill.  There are the 
employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian 
armed forces and the enormous public service, spread from one 
end of the country to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, naturally, will be opposing Bill C-78, unless 
the government agrees to the amendments it proposes. 
As I have few illusions, I can tell you we will be opposing this 
bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we in the Bloc have moved amendments to clauses 90, 145 
and 192 in order to establish a management board that would 
report to the House annually.  The President of the Treasury 
Board had established an advisory committee, which, in December 
1996, in fact recommended to the President of the Treasury Board 
the establishment of a management board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would not give the job of managing blood to Dracula.  One 
should not give responsibility for the $30 billion to the 
President of the Treasury Board.  This is the worst mistake the 
Parliament of Canada could make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management board could properly manage the accumulated 
surpluses.  It could establish contributions. 
And the reason there are these huge surpluses is that premiums 
are too high.  It does not take a rocket scientist to figure 
this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of directors could also manage the surpluses, and 
deficits if any.  In the event of deficits, premiums would be 
increased.  This is always part of negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The valiant Liberal member who spoke before me has never 
belonged to a union.  He has never needed to negotiate his 
salary and working conditions.  When the employer says that he 
has 10% for increases and is going to put them only toward 
salaries, this will not include holidays, benefits or pension 
contributions.  As a general rule, contributions to the pension 
fund are on a fifty-fifty basis.  The good member opposite should 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if there are surpluses of $30.1 billion, it is because 
employees and the government put in too much. However, if the 
fund is well run, $30.1 billion at 10%—and I think that just 
about any manager can easily get more than 10% interest on such 
an imposing amount—would yield annual returns of $3 billion, 
while the federal government is now paying out $3.1 billion to 
retirees and surviving spouses.  So the fund shrinks by only 
$100 million a year.  As well, the workers in the three groups I 
mentioned earlier generate $1.8 billion annually, enriching the 
fund by $1.7 billion each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find two things particularly maddening. 
The first is that the government is using its majority to gag 
the opposition, by allowing only four hours of debate on a bill 
over 200 pages thick, a bill that will allow the President of 
the Treasury Board to appropriate $30 billion. This is $30,000 
million. It is a huge amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what this government did with the unemployed and the 
poor. It took the surplus in the employment insurance fund, $21 
billion, and of course used some of it to reduce the debt, but 
also to intrude into provincial jurisdictions, including with 
the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is warped and mean, and it is about to plunder 
the surpluses in its employees pension funds.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These surpluses were largely accumulated with the employees' 
contributions, as I will illustrate in detail. There is a 
surplus of $14.9 billion in the public service pension fund; 
another of $2.4 billion in the RCMP fund—there are not as many 
participants—and another of $12.9 billion in the Canadian forces 
pension fund. When we add up these three amounts, we get a total 
surplus of $30.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers in this good Liberal government, with the complicity 
of its backbenchers, will rise this evening and say “Yes, we 
agree to gouge public service workers, RCMP employees and 
Canadian forces members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three groups currently include 275,000 participants. 
Some have retired, so that makes around 160,000.  Then there are 
52,000 surviving spouses as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With proper management, we could give workers several years' 
break from contributing.  For most of them this would be a 
considerable break, amounting to over $1,000.  The surpluses 
could finance the funds just from the revenue generated.  If 
properly managed, they could earn well over 10%.  This could go 
beyond the $3.1 billion monthly payments to retirees cost the 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the big cheese, the President of Treasury Board, the hon. 
member for Hull—Aylmer, consult the unions?  No way.  Were there 
any negotiations with anyone?  No way.  He has shown no respect 
for the committee he himself struck, by not paying attention to 
a single one of its recommendations. 
This is another disguised theft the Liberal government is 
preparing to commit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I got an e-mail from Jean Morin, a young man from my 
riding, from Thetford Mines to be exact. He asked me to speak 
out in the House against the flaw in the employment insurance 
system, which counts short weeks, when he works just a few hours 
in a week, in order to do the calculations for his last 26 
weeks.  He described this as robbery, as abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These robberies are not being committed against the rich, people 
like the Minister of Finance, but against the poor, because 
there are greater numbers of them and they are often 
defenceless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore asking the member across the way to stand up and 
vote against Bill C-78.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by thanking some people from my riding who came to 
see me last Friday to discuss this bill.  They are five retired 
gentlemen who are involved in this pension fund.  They were very 
concerned about the speed by which this was being put through 
with very little debate, and that the government was using 
closure to force it through.  They would have liked a little more 
time for input to their members of parliament and to ask the 
government to reconsider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also here today representing the people of Lethbridge, home 
to, among others, hundreds of people who will be affected by this 
legislation. 
This legislation, Bill C-78, is nothing but a bald-faced attempt 
by the Liberal government to continue its tax and spend policies 
on the backs of Canadian workers and taxpayers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act has been controversial from the day it was proposed, and 
rightfully so.  What the government is proposing to do is 
underhanded and displays a flagrant disregard for the 
hard-working men and women who have helped the federal government 
finally land back on its feet after nearly collapsing under the 
weight of years and years of unethical free spending policies of 
successive Tory and Liberal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has reached new lows using all the procedural 
tricks in the House to push the bill through the House and 
through committee, showing a blatant disrespect for the 
democratic traditions of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will affect the following three pension funds:  the 
public service pension plan; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
plan; and the Canadian Forces plan.  The gentlemen who came to 
see me last Friday are in all three of these plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will give the government authority to seize the $30 
billion surplus that exists in these plans and establish a public 
service pension investment board to invest the public sector 
pension funds in the markets.  It will increase the employees' 
premiums from 30% to 40%.  It will sweeten benefits for employees 
and retirees and will allow the Canada Post Corporation to 
establish its own pension plan by October 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in its usual way is assuring Canadians and 
pensioners that this is a much better method of safeguarding 
their money because, after all, if we cannot trust our government 
who can we trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds very sugary, but the Canadian pensioners are not 
buying this line of government propaganda.  Canadians of all 
political stripes, of all backgrounds and of all ages are banding 
together to tell the government one thing:  “Keep your hands 
where we can see them and stay away from our money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It warms my heart to see Canadians of all kinds, weary of years 
of Liberal oppression, uniting together to demand an alternative. 
I want to tell all those opposed to the government's actions that 
they have friends on the benches of the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to invite all Canadians who want a national government 
that will deliver lower taxes, better health care, greater 
democracy and a stronger federation characterized by a 
rebalancing of powers and equal treatment under the law to come 
join myself and my colleagues.  Together we will deliver 
responsible government that cares, a government that listens to 
the people instead of telling them how it will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason I oppose the bill is because it allows the 
federal government to continue its sleight of hand budgeting 
shell game.  Even the Auditor General of Canada will not sign off 
on the government's budgets because of its bookkeeping methods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three funds contain a surplus of over $30 billion, money 
that has been contributed to the funds by the workers and by the 
taxpayers.  This massive surplus has accumulated so quickly for 
several reasons.  In order to explain this I will explain the 
basics of what affects the value of a pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pension fund's value turns on three critical factors: interest 
rates, inflation and salary increases.  The key reason for the 
size of the surplus was that actuaries assumed that wages would 
grow at 2% above the rate of inflation when in fact they have 
been frozen for the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another thing.  A lot of people who worked for the 
government and who have retired in the last few years have had 
their wages frozen for six years.  The settlement that they 
reached just a few weeks ago was not any great shakes after six 
or seven years of being frozen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since salaries were frozen, inflation was no longer a concern. 
The fund also grew because of the heady interest rates from the 
1980s.  The 20 year government bonds held by the funds have been 
providing handsome returns for the last five to ten years of 
relatively low interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly this is an enviable position to be in, as $30 
billion is a huge amount of money.  However, it goes without 
saying that when there is money involved there are bound to be 
two sides of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions are telling Canadians that this money belongs to the 
civil servants who contributed to the fund.  The government is 
telling Canadians that this money does not belong to the workers 
and it does not belong to the taxpayer, that it belongs to the 
government and the government alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not feel that this money belongs to the 
workers alone because it alone was on the hook when the fund ran 
a deficit so it feels solely entitled to the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentlemen who came to see me last Friday pointed something 
out to me, and it is stated in some of their documents, that this 
indeed is a bit of a red herring that the government is trying to 
float. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what the government so easily forgets is that it does 
not have any money of its own.  This is money that belongs to the 
taxpayers.  It was the taxpayers who had to kick in when the 
government found itself $13 billion short, so it should be the 
taxpayers who benefit here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers will not benefit by having this money forfeited to the 
federal government.

not deserve any government or taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This surplus should stay right where it is, away from the 
clutches of the government, right where the taxpayers can see it 
and readily available should any shortfall occur again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason for opposing this bill.  Part of the 
sugar-coating the Liberals are using to slip this bill past the 
public is that they are sweetening the benefits for employees and 
retirees.  The bill states that survivor benefits are extended to 
an expanded class of beneficiary.  The bill will extend benefits 
to the survivors of a so-called conjugal relationship, which 
sounds fine, but it becomes a little tricky when one tries to 
define what is a relationship of a conjugal nature.  Is it a 
relationship between a man and a woman in the traditional family 
sense of the word?  Does that include common law relationships 
between a man and woman?  Does it include relationships between 
cohabiting same sex partners?  Could it include two roommates? 
This bill could cover any of these situations, but it does not 
clearly define what is a conjugal relationship.  Even if it did, 
how would a government prove whether a relationship is conjugal 
in nature? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this government, the party that is most famous for saying 
that it will stay out of the bedrooms of the nation, now going to 
hire private investigators to determine whether a relationship is 
conjugal?  This is absolutely absurd.  Without defining what 
conjugal relationships are, Bill C-78 survivor's benefits 
provisions could be subject to all kinds of litigation from 
individuals who deem their relationships to be of a conjugal 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is limited, but I would like to conclude by stressing 
one last point.  Taxpayers are the odd man out in this debate. 
When these pension funds were created the government structured 
the funds in such a way that employees paid a combined 7.5% of 
their wages for their pension plan and the government's Canada 
pension plan.  However, after years of successive CPP increases, 
with more to come, brought on by years of government 
mismanagement and neglect, the employee contribution to the 
pension fund slipped to 30%, with the government picking up the 
other 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was because of this mismanagement that taxpayers were forced 
to kick in $13 billion recently to cover shortfalls.  In addition 
to that $13 billion, the government has taken an additional $10 
billion by not making interest payments on the actuarial surplus 
of the fund.  To anybody else this amounts to highway robbery, 
but to the Liberal finance minister it is called being fiscally 
prudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is about 30 years late in breaking the linkage 
between the CPP and pension plan contributions.  It has already 
cost the taxpayer over $20 billion.  It is high time that the 
taxpayer is shown some respect.  It is because of this flagrant 
disrespect shown to the taxpayer and because of the extraordinary 
contempt that the government holds for the traditions of 
democracy that the Reform Party cannot support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we work through this we must remember that this bill has been 
rammed through the committee with very little chance for comment 
and it is being rammed through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Mississauga earlier said that there were 
only 15 amendments.  I have a list showing 51 amendments on a 
bill that has 200 clauses.  That represents one out of four 
clauses which opposition parties felt needed to be amended.  As 
well, it is a tragedy that the government has brought in closure 
over 50 times. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased indeed to speak to this bill today.  I would like to 
repeat what the motions we are debating in Group No. 1 are about. 
Several of the amendments that are proposed in this group were 
presented by Reform.  These motions deal pretty much with 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would find it hard to understand why the government would 
not support these amendments which would lead to more openness 
and more accountability on the part of government.  Some of the 
things being asked are things which one would think any 
government would find acceptable. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Motion No. 4 would force the board of directors of 
the PSPIB to establish and maintain contact on an ongoing basis 
with actuaries of each fund.  That is something that I think we 
would find to be not only acceptable, but we would expect it to 
be part of the legislation.  We have to wonder why it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 would force the government to lay before parliament 
a copy of the appointment establishing the chairperson of the 
PSPIB.  I do not think the government should vote against this 
amendment.  All we are asking for is a reasonable degree of 
openness in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11, which again is a Reform amendment, is similar to 
Motion No. 2, except that it would deal specifically with the 
investment committee of the board and not the board as a whole. 
Again it is asking for more accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Motion No. 16 all we are asking for is openness and 
accountability.  I do not believe that this government should 
oppose these amendments.  This motion would force an act of 
parliament to be passed in order for changes to be made to the 
contribution rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 currently reads that rates are determined by the 
Treasury Board on the recommendation of the minister.  Why on 
something this important, affecting this many Canadians, would it 
be done in the backrooms?  Indeed, why should this process not 
come before parliament so that it would be a very open and 
transparent process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can ask the questions, but it is up to the government to 
provide the answers.  It is not providing the answers.  Not only 
is it not providing the answers to the questions that we are 
asking on these issues, it is also going to invoke closure or 
time allocation on this legislation and it will not allow debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to talk about that and the process that 
this government has used.  I believe it has invoked time 
allocation 51 times.  It has become routine in a way that we have 
never seen with any government before, even the hated Mulroney 
government.  We know how Canadians felt about the Mulroney 
government by the time it was near the end of its second term. 
Even the Mulroney government did not abuse the use of closure and 
time allocation the way this government has.  It has set a new 
standard and it is not a standard about which it should proud. 
It is a standard about which the government should be completely 
ashamed.  I will talk more about that a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big concerns about this legislation, which has been 
expressed several times before, is that the government is 
proposing to rob the public service pension plan of $30 billion. 
It wants to take $30 billion out of the public service pension 
plan.  That is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to understand how a government which talks like it 
supports the public service can propose this kind of action.  It 
is really hard to understand.  We do not understand it, except 
when we look at the record over the past five years.  When we 
look at the record of the government we see tax increase after 
tax increase after tax increase.  It has balanced the budget, 
eliminated the deficit, on the basis of tax increases.  The 
revenue is up somewhere over $25 billion per year from the time 
the Liberals took office.  There have been incredible increases 
in the amount of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the increase is due to growth in the economy, but much 
of it is due to tax increases.  Frankly, I lost track after the 
first several dozen tax increases of just how many there have 
been, but the number is certainly substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a balanced budget due to the increase in taxes.  We 
would think that the tax grab would stop.  Not only has the tax 
grab not stopped, now the government is trying to rob the public 
service pension plan of $30 billion besides the incredible tax 
burden it has put on people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the public service pension plan and the people involved 
in it treated in this way.  What about other Canadians?  What we 
have seen from this government with regard to pensions of other 
Canadians over the five years that we have been here is a record 
about which it ought not to be proud. 
We have seen reductions in pensions to seniors that have caused 
hardship to many of the seniors involved.  Such reductions in 
pensions to seniors, one of the most vulnerable groups in our 
society, is completely unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen Canada pension plan premiums increase by 73% and 
that probably will not be the end of it.  It is a plan that can 
offer a maximum of $8,800 a year to someone upon retirement, yet 
we are looking at 10% of income which will be put into the 
premiums in this plan.  That is an unacceptable development. 
Reform has proposed an alternative to this proposal put forward 
by the government which would offer Canadians, especially young 
Canadians, but all Canadians, a much better return on their 
pension plan dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far that has been rejected by the government.  Instead it 
tries to take $30 billion out of the public service pension plan, 
and it will be successful.  I can stand here right now and say 
that it will be successful.  The reason is that we do not have a 
functioning democracy in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been spending a lot of time lately in Toronto working 
with new immigrant groups and people from new immigrant 
communities.  Several have commented that what they see in our 
government in Canada is not a properly functioning democracy but 
is more like an elected dictatorship.   These are not concepts I 
have heard first from these people.  I have heard them from 
people across the country.  However, they are comparing Canada to 
democracies in which they have lived, come from or seen.  They 
are comparing our Canadian political system to political systems 
from other countries, and ours does not compare in a positive way 
to democracies in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of what those people see that leads them to the conclusion 
that we have an elected dictatorship rather than a 
well-functioning democracy is the number of times time allocation 
and closure have been used in the House of Commons.  I believe 
they have been used 51 times.  With the government invoking time 
allocation on this bill, which, mark my words, it will, it will 
be 52.  Is that a democracy functioning as it should?  I think 
not.  Those people have recognized that and they are very 
concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the government to stop using time allocation 
and closure as a routine way of forcing legislation through the 
House of Commons.  It is forced through for two main reasons. The 
first reason is to stop a debate from developing across the 
country on these important issues.  These issues are kept within 
the confines of this House.  There is not enough debate across 
the country to really have a healthy, open debate, involving all 
Canadians.  Second, the Prime Minister and his very small group 
who run this country use time allocation so the policies and 
changes they want will pass.  Then they use their whips to whip 
their members into line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to see that again with this legislation.  Mark my 
words.  Watch the voting record on the groups of amendments we 
are debating today.  We will see that all government members will 
vote the way they are told to vote.  No matter what they believe 
is right, they will vote the way they are told to vote.  That is 
wrong.  I think they should be ashamed of themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first off remind this House and those watching that this 
bill was introduced by the President of the Treasury Board, who 
has a second job, as do all the ministers of the House.  He is 
the member for Hull—Aylmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I refer to the fact that he is the member for 
Hull—Aylmer?  Because often, when there are bills of the 
closure or bludgeon type, such as the law ordering blue collar 
workers back to work—in which my colleague, the member for 
Trois—Rivières did such a fantastic job managing the debate— 
people forget that the President of the Treasury Board, member 
for Hull—Aylmer, represents a strong proportion of public 
servants living in the Hull-Aylmer area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the people, the workers and the public servants 
living in Hull-Aylmer to remember two years hence that this 
minister most of the time treats the federal public service with 
disdain.  What distress me is that he takes them for granted. 
He says “We can pass laws of all kinds, we can hit them on the 
head with a stick, and absolutely nothing will change.  They 
will vote for us”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that people in the riding of Hull—Aylmer will remember 
this come the next general election, in two years. The last 
election was held two years ago, on June 2. I hope people in the 
riding of Hull—Aylmer will remember. We in the greater Quebec 
City region have clearly demonstrated how a President of the 
Treasury Board who shows contempt for people can be ousted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall the Mulroney years, before this government took 
office. Back then, Gilles Loiselle, the member for Québec, was 
the President of the Treasury Board. In the election held on 
October 25, 1993, Gilles Loiselle was fired by the voters in the 
riding of Québec. He has since been replaced with my colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois, who is now representing the riding of 
Québec. So, I do hope that people in the riding of Hull—Aylmer 
will teach the President of the Treasury Board—who is taking 
their vote for granted—the lesson he deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill confirms once again this government's approach to 
managing the finances of the country. The government tends to 
come barging into exclusive provincial jurisdictions and 
interfere in provincial jurisdictions in general. There are so 
many examples of such intrusions by the Liberal government that 
I simply cannot list them all in the 10 minutes that I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government interferes in provincial jurisdictions and uses 
the surpluses to finance such intrusions. Think about the 
millennium scholarship program. The government does not 
recognize Quebec's jurisdiction over education and the Quebec 
education minister, Mr. Legault, has to negotiate with Mr. 
Monty, a financier and a non-elected administrator. This shows 
once again how arrogant the Liberal government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also mention the accumulated surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund, because as far as I am concerned, 
this is not employment insurance, but unemployment insurance. 
Those on UI can be sure they will remain on UI; this program 
does not help the unemployed find a job. We should therefore 
continue to refer to this program as the unemployment insurance 
program, because that is what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government appropriated the surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund and used it to eliminate its operating deficit.

who is boasting about following procedure, should be reminded of 
a very heated discussions he was engaged in last Thursday during

lower his voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not, therefore, tempted to get into a debate with him. 
Anyway, we are getting to know the member for Bourassa.  Those 
listening to us know what he is like.  They know he is an 
agitator, so I will not get into that.

began earlier.

surplus—I am pleased to see that term did not get a rise out of 
the member for Bourassa.  I said “systematic theft from the 
employment insurance fund”.  We should just let him sleep on, or 
go on home—. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is trying to get its hands on the surplus 
that has built up in the pension funds of public service 
employees, as well as those that are yet to come.  These are 
astronomical sums, to put it mildly.  As of March 31, 1998, we 
are talking of somewhere around $30.2 billion in surplus.  That 
is $14.9 billion for the public servants, $2.4 for the RCMP, and 
$12.9 for the Canadian Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party acknowledges the necessity of ensuring the long-term 
viability of the system. 
In our opinion, it is possible to have this while respecting the 
thousands of Canadian and Quebec workers who have contributed to 
the plan.  The present plan has some 275,000 people contributing 
to it, and 160,000 pensioners plus 52,000 surviving spouses 
drawing from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice, Mr. Speaker, that you are telling me I have just about

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise today to enter into the debate on Bill 
C-78, an act to establish the public sector pension investment 
board and to amend several associated acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is just one more bill in the history of the Liberal 
government that attempts to set legislation based upon poor 
policy development.  Sixty-two per cent of the public elected 
representatives to this side of the House.  Regardless of our 
political stripes on this side of the House, we have all been in 
opposition to Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the good people of Nanaimo—Cowichan and they have 
told me loud and clear that they do not want to listen to the 
empty promises of the Liberal government any longer.  They have 
told me that when a government does not listen to the people then 
it is no longer the people's government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people I represent here today are gravely concerned about a 
government that does not act logically to protect the nation's 
children from pedophiles who seek to harm children through child 
pornography.  They do not trust a government that discriminates 
against fair family taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Nanaimo—Cowichan do not look favourably upon a 
government that turns its back on those who need our help, such 
as the hepatitis C victims.  Indeed, the people of my riding are 
incensed in the way that the B.C. government, and now this 
Liberal government, have treated them with complete disdain over 
the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government wants to have the trust of the people of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan in order to quickly and quietly push Bill C-78 
through the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few short hours that my hon. colleagues and I will have 
to debate this bill, I do not anticipate that the Liberal 
government will understand what the opposition is saying.  Some 
will hear but few will listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 32, put forward by my hon. colleague from St. Albert, 
speaks about the need for government to table in parliament 
copies of the appointments made to the public service pension 
advisory committee.  I feel it is imperative that this board be 
made up of qualified individuals.  The board cannot be made up of 
political appointees.  This is not the place for more public 
trough feeding.  This is a place for expertise and applied 
knowledge, not patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turn, the board must be accountable for its investment 
decisions.  Accountability is imperative.  Plumb political 
appointments cannot provide the expertise and transparent 
accountability that is required for a board such as this. It 
applies likewise to Motion No. 33 regarding the liquidation of 
the surplus into the government coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be perfectly clear about what the Liberal government is 
planning to do with these surplus funds.  It is planning to put 
the funds toward the balancing of the books.  During this 
parliament, the government has purportedly balanced the books. 
The real questions are:  How was this done, and where did the 
money come from to balance the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget has been balanced purely and simply on the backs of 
taxpayers, not on the reduction of the bureaucratic nightmare 
that exists all around us.  There have been more than 30 tax 
increases by the Liberal government since it came to power. 
Bracket creep and numerous other taxes are alive and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has been balanced on the backs of every taxpayer in 
Nanaimo—Cowichan and every other Canadian, not through wise 
fiscal management.  That is what the Liberal government wants to 
do with this money today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the issue of accountability is imperative, the question that 
begs to be asked is where and how will the $30 billion be put and 
used.

blank cheques. I would ask my hon. colleagues to tell us the 
plan. We have yet to see the real plan for other moneys this 
government has taken from the federal piggy bank.  I will ask the 
question anyway.  Where and what is the plan?  I would welcome 
the answer, but frankly I do not expect to hear a full answer to 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than being prudent and cost cutting, the Liberal 
government is looking for every available dollar that does not 
affect its spending habits.  I would strongly urge the government 
to leave the surpluses inside the respective pension plans.  This 
is imperative for the security and solvency of the plan members. 
Without these funds remaining within the respective pensions, the 
risk to taxpayers from potential shortfalls is enormous. There 
have been shortfalls in the past and it is conceivable there will 
be shortfalls in the future.  I say this not out of fearmongering 
but rather out of a look at demographics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is common knowledge that the baby boomers, and I am one of 
them, are rapidly approaching their retirement years.  We are not 
close to reaching the peak of potential retirees yet.  As more 
and more people begin to access their pensions, there will be a 
greater and greater effect upon the funds within the pension. 
Foolish spending today will certainly cause problems in the 
future.  The financial strain on the pension fund will continue 
to grow, not shrink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this is a recipe for disaster.  This is not being 
fiscally responsible.  Bill C-78 only adds to the fancy 
bookkeeping.  The Liberal government should not have access to 
this $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been saying they are putting this bill forward 
for the betterment and benefit of the taxpayers of Canada.  This 
is nonsense.  What Bill C-78 proposes puts the taxpayer at 
greater risk, not less.  Although the surplus in the fund is 
enormous, there is a distinct possibility that a deficit could 
develop in the future.  There is a precedent for this statement. 
This has occurred in the past.  In fact, past deficits have cost 
the very taxpayers that this Liberal government is purporting to 
protect a whopping $13 billion.  That is a very big number, one 
that should not be foisted upon the taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office has received numerous calls and letters on this bill. 
The calls and letters to my office are saying words that we 
cannot utter, like “stealing”, “theft”, “criminal”, and 
“leave my money alone”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union representatives state that it is unconscionable that 
the government would seize the surplus. They are calling this a 
unilateral decision.  They clearly make the claim that the money 
belongs to the workers and I agree wholeheartedly with them.  The 
federal Liberals balanced the books partially on the backs of the 
federal civil servants and now they want to take away the 
security of their public pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several other concerns regarding Bill C-78.  One is that 
the auditor general will not have the right to perform an annual 
audit.  In fact, the board's auditors will not even have to 
report to parliament.  This is simply wrong.  Without public 
accountability, questions regarding the transparency of the whole 
process will and should arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparison, the auditor general is currently not prepared to 
sign off on several past government budgets.  Why on earth would 
we in parliament deny him the right to assure all Canadians, 
especially those who are in the pension fund itself, that their 
funds are secure?  This is wrong.  This bill takes powers away 
from the auditor general and it causes me great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government wants to ensure that it is directly 
accountable to the people and that the process is transparent, 
people need to be assured there is not a separate set of rules 
for Bill C-78.  Why should the same rules not apply to all 
legislation?  Is there a problem with the auditor general doing 
his job in this capacity, or is there something else that is 
being hidden here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I have many concerns with Bill C-78.  I am 
concerned with the way the board is being set up.  I am concerned 
with the accountability of this government and its fiscal 
accountability, or as many would say, its lack of accountability. 
I am concerned that the government is pushing through this bill 
with its enormous fiscal implications in such a short period.

Board and to amend the Public Service Superannuation Act, the 
Canadian Forces Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is of particular interest to me since I rose several 
times in this House to defend the rights of seniors as a 
spokesperson for seniors and seniors organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to make changes to public sector 
pension plans. Contrary to what the President of the Treasury 
Board said, federal employees and retirees are concerned about 
these changes. The Bloc Quebecois is obviously against this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois are aimed 
at implementing a true joint management system for public sector 
pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 12, the President of the Treasury Board stated in this 
House that federal employees should not worry about the future. 
He said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, current and past federal public service employees 
need not worry about the future, because it is precisely to 
preserve the financial future of these pension plans that the 
government decided to act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension plans of the public service, the RCMP and the armed 
forces have, in recent years, accumulated a total surplus of 
some $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot allow the government to act 
unilaterally and make major changes to the employees' pension 
plans.  It is a rip-off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always said the same thing about pension 
plans.  They must not be changed to the detriment of seniors. 
This is certainly not the first time the government has tried to 
reduce its debt to their detriment.  Seniors have always spoken 
out strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation of government's partners over several months 
was a failure.  So there was no agreement on the necessary 
reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, there is some similarity in strategy here with the 
federal government's control over the surplus in the employment 
insurance fund, which has accumulated in recent years.  The 
federal government claims that this surplus belongs to it, as do 
the surpluses that concerns us in Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors are no fools.  I recently attended a demonstration on 
Parliament Hill.  The message was clear:  the surpluses belong 
to those who are retired, and they will never let the government 
appropriate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, seniors do not want the government to appoint their 
friends to manage the surpluses by unilaterally creating a 
public sector pension investment board according to its criteria 
on equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This board cannot be independent of the government. 
I share the opinion of my colleague from 
Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, who mentioned on April 12 that the 
government should follow the example of the Caisse du dépôt et 
placement in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the Bloc Quebecois came to ask the government to 
honour its promise to submit the management of the public 
service pension plan to a real system of joint management.  A 
management board comprising representatives of the employer, 
employees and retired employees must be set up.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 does not move in that direction. The purpose of the 
joint management council proposed by the Bloc Quebecois would be 
to set up a pension fund, to plan its financing, to manage any 
surplus or deficit, to manage the plan itself and to ensure 
adequate financing for the benefits to be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, all of the legislation concerning the federal public 
sector pension plans must be subject to the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act. Consequently, a number of judicial rules would 
control the use of any future surpluses. The regulations 
established under this piece of legislation will set out the 
criteria the employers will have to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pensioners want to be treated fairly. 
It is normal that the surplus that belongs to them be used in 
part to increase their benefits. The federal government's 
unilateral misappropriation of $30 billion is a true insult to 
seniors. The surplus should belong to both the employer and the 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that pension plans should be allowed to be invested on 
the stock market, but we do not agree with the government taking 
the $30 billion surplus. As I said earlier, it is a rip-off. The 
surpluses should be used on the one hand to improve the pension 
plan and, on the other hand, to set up the retirement fund being 
created under Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Losses can also be incurred on the stock market. That is 
something we have to think about. The federal government should 
not neglect the people who worked all their lives to be able to 
enjoy a decent and well-deserved retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall the “Goodbye Charlie Brown” episode, under the 
Mulroney government. Many seniors fight for their rights, and we 
should not forget that 1999 is the international year of the 
older person. Seniors should get everything they are entitled 
to. A commemorative stamp is not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this year's theme for international women's day was “Going 
strong”. Retired women are something of a majority among retired 
public servants, and they are sometimes among the most 
underprivileged. In the past, the Bloc Quebecois has often 
complained about continuous intrusions by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the federal government tried to put in place for 
2001 a new benefit based on family income, which would have the 
effect of depriving a number of women of their only independent 
source of income. 
We realize that Bill C-78 will have an impact on the lifestyle of 
many retired people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the federal government also tried to amend the Income 
Tax Act, through Bill C-282, to eliminate the deduction for 
taxpayers over age 65 who are entitled to the disability income 
tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in further evidence that the federal government is trying 
to pay off its debt on the backs of the underprivileged, and 
more particularly senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is against Bill C-78, because it will allow 
the government to grab the $30 billion surplus in the public 
service pension plans. The amendments the Bloc Quebecois has 
moved are needed to correct this flaw.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill goes to the heart of an issue that is very important 
to many constituents in the ridings of all members in the House. 
It concerns individuals in the military, members of the RCMP, 
approximately 300,000 retirees, and nearly one-third of a million 
people in other public service activities.

very important ground.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go back in history.  The pension plan was constructed 
a number of years ago.  It was based on interest rates, inflation 
and salary increases.  As a result of a combination of those 
factors we see now a substantial and marked surplus within the 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to take the pension surplus and put it into 
general revenues to use as it sees fit.  Does that surplus in 
that pension plan belong to the government?  No, it does not. The 
surplus belongs to the people who paid into the plan. 
Furthermore, the money that was put into it does not belong to 
the government.  It belongs to the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than taking the money away from the people who 
contributed it, a better way of dealing with it would be to lower 
the contributions they have to make without changing the amount 
of money they would get back.  Although the pension plan is 
enjoying a surplus at this point in time, that has not always 
been the case.  If we look back in history, when there has been a 
shortfall the taxpayer has been on the lam for putting $13 
billion into the plan to pay it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are enjoying a surplus at this point in time, this will 
probably not be the case in the future.  Interest rates will not 
always be as low as they are now.  Nor will inflation.  Although 
there has been a salary freeze for the last eight years at least, 
salaries will go up and have gone up.  That will translate into 
an obligation on the part of the scheme to pay out more pension 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should maintain that surplus.  It would be a buffer to ensure 
that the taxpayer will not have to put in more money at the end 
of the game to buttress the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a party would like to speak to a number of other issues 
regarding the bill.  One such issue is privatization.  Previously 
the government put the contributions of workers into low interest 
bearing but safe rates of return vehicles.  That money could also 
be put into vehicles that are safe but generate larger amounts of 
money.  The bill does that, and this is what we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only hope the government will do the same with the CPP.  All 
of us who put money into the CPP know that it goes into something 
which generates a very small amount of return.  It would be far 
better to put it into the market, into higher interest bearing 
and safe vehicles.  We applaud that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of same sex benefits, my colleague put forth a very 
eloquent solution to the thorny issue of what people may or may 
not be doing behind closed doors.  My colleague mentioned 
something called a designated partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A designated partnership could be with a brother, a sister, a 
family member or a friend.  Both parties would be engaged in a 
reciprocal relationship and have reciprocal responsibility.  For 
example, two sisters could live together for a long period of 
time and take care of each other.  If one of them were to pass 
away, why should the remaining sister not benefit from her 
deceased sister's pension? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it was a reciprocal, long term relationship, a long 
term commitment between two people.  This would be fair and would 
enable people in long term relationships to give their pensions 
to someone who has taken care of them in a reciprocal fashion. It 
would get rid of the ridiculous discussions and the thorny legal 
descriptions of what people may or may not be engaging in, in 
their personal lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take that out of the picture, the concept of a designated 
partnership would be fair to a wider variety of Canadians who 
engage in living conditions which are far more inclusive than 
what we have been discussing the last while.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>PSAC has been very adamant about not supporting the bill.  It 
has been in strong opposition to it because of the way it treats 
workers with respect to the government's plan to pocket the $30.1 
billion surplus.  It wants to use that surplus to pad its 
surpluses and tell the public it is doing a better job than it 
actually is in terms of how it is managing the country's 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do some very constructive work in terms of looking at 
what the government is trying to do with this surplus.  The 
surplus is being reorganized in a very questionable fashion. 
Accountants would call it a questionable accounting practice, 
which enables the government to take $30 billion through 
subterfuge and put it into something it should not be in.  It is 
taking it away from the workers who have earned money and put it 
into the plan.  It is taking it from the workers and putting it 
somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are thankful the military managed to get a raise.  We applaud 
the government for doing that.  However, the working and living 
conditions of many people in the military have not changed 
substantially.  In Victoria the cost of living is very high.  Men 
and women who work for the military have a very difficult problem 
making ends meet, particularly in terms of accommodation.  Three 
years ago we proposed a plan to the then minister of defence, 
General Dallaire, and the assistant deputy ministers involved 
which would enable military personnel to live more comfortably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan involved making the accommodation assistance allowance 
applicable to all people in the military.  The accommodation 
assistance allowance would be non-taxable.  The rents that were 
increased egregiously, even though salaries were frozen, would be 
rolled back to the point in time when they were frozen. Although 
they have had an increase in salary, it pales in comparison to 
the rent increases that have occurred for their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing can be done to make life a little better and more 
comfortable for hardworking men and women in uniform.  They could 
enable the base commanders to have more power and control over 
the economics of their bases.  They could find some ingenious and 
innovative ways to generate funds for people on bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the RCMP has not been the best paid police force in 
the country.  Neither does it want to be, but it wants to be paid 
fairly.  RCMP wages have plummeted to the bottom of the barrel. 
The way in which its salaries have been calculated has changed 
over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a different method of calculating the 
salaries of the RCMP officers so that they are now among the 
lowest paid police officers in the country.  I implore the 
solicitor general and the minister of finance to pay the RCMP a 
salary that is at least in the middle with respect to other 
police forces in the country.  They would find that to be fair 
and reasonable, given the economic circumstances we as a country 
are in today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the RCMP do not have the finances for the tools of 
their job.  As we saw in my province of British Columbia, they do 
not even have money to put their cars back on the road after 
having been bashed up.  They do not have the money to prosecute 
serious criminals.  As a result serious criminals, particularly 
people in organized crime, are being let out and not being 
prosecuted, convicted and put behind bars.  The reason is that 
the resources are not there for them to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many RCMP officers and other police officers across the country 
are working for free because they feel compelled or obligated to 
put criminals behind bars.  Unfortunately the government is not 
giving them the power, the resources and the tools to do their 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the government to listen to the suggestions of 
members from this party and others and to implement them for the 
benefit of people who work in the public service.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on Bill C-78, which aims at establishing a kind of 
investment board to manage the pensions of public servants, 
members of the RCMP and of the Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to accounting charts submitted by actuaries—not the 
opposition's acutaries but those of the government, the people 
in power—at present the surplus in these three pension funds 
totals $30.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I listened with great interest to members of the 
governing party who see themselves, as always, as those who have 
the absolute truth. They were telling us that they could not 
make a mistake and that they knew and understood the issue 
because of their skills as managers and that the surplus had to 
be deposited in the consolidated revenue fund, that is in the 
hands of government. There was no doubt in their mind about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government has a majority in the House, it can say 
anything false it wants, and no one can force it to do its duty, 
because it is convinced that it cannot be wrong since it has a 
majority in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in committee, I listened to the witnesses, among them 
distinguished actuaries, people who work in investments, and 
also pensioners. We had the Public Service Pensioners 
Association, which was represented, if I am not mistaken, by 
Mrs. Jeanne Smith. I asked her what amount a retired public 
servant got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are several categories of retired public 
servants. There is one apart from the others, consisting of 
generals and very high ranking members of the Canadian forces, 
who enjoy a pension equivalent to that of a cabinet minister 
having worked for 30 years and thus being entitled to the 
maximum. Those people receive a pension of $115,000, $120,000 or 
$130,000 a year. 
The day after their retirement, they are hired at a salary of 
$180,000, $200,000 and even $250,000, based on my information, 
to act as consultants for the Canadian armed forces and the 
government, to help the government make decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people—even though it is disgusting to see such cases as 
these—do not, the day after they retire, sit in the same chair, 
use the same telephone and carry out the same duties as the day 
before, while collecting an annual pension of $115,000, $120,000 
or $130,000 and getting a new salary that is sometimes just as 
exorbitant to do the same job, but as a consultant. This is 
outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not the case for the average member of the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada. I asked Mrs. Smith how much a 
retired public servant gets. She gave me a few examples. 
A public service employee who worked for 23 years and who is 
living alone collects an annual pension of $8,900 or $9,000. 
With 30 years of service, that annual pension is $15,000. These 
are gross, not net figures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead—who sits on my 
left and whom I salute—I visited military bases across Canada 
last year, with the Standing Committee on National Defence. We 
saw military personnel housed in PMQs, which are houses that 
were built in the middle of the century, immediately after World 
War II. These houses have not been maintained or renovated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now unthinkable to live in a house that would not have  a 
hood to vent cooking odours above the stove. Yet, this was 
common in all the PMQs that we visited, since they were built in 
the middle or late forties, when these hoods were a great luxury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same everywhere. When the committee tabled its 
report, it recommended a considerable improvement in how we 
house our soldiers, as well as how we pay them, so that they can 
live decently.  But all these recommendations were naturally 
shelved.  The government did not want to hear them.  It gave a 
paltry increase to soldiers to ease its conscience.  With their 
minds easy, the Liberal members opposite are busy congratulating 
themselves.  The government came up with a few million dollars 
to increase soldiers' pay, but their living conditions are 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member who just sat down, the committee chair, giving 
me a look. 
But, at the time, this member was as disgusted as I was at the 
conditions in which our soldiers lived and worked.  Naturally, 
when they are paid so little during their working lives, they 
cannot be expected to have built up a huge pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is benefiting in all sorts of ways.  When it 
underpays its employees, its contributions as an employer are 
lower, because these are a percentage of salary.  The government 
is ahead on all counts, so members opposite can sleep easy. 
They say that the government has contributed its share, that 
there are surpluses, and that, when there were deficits, the 
government naturally stepped in to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree that the government—because this is what it wants, 
and because it made up deficits in the fund in the past, 
although it has paid itself back by now—should be able to recover 
some of its past outlay, if it thought it made one, which is far 
from certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But before helping itself to the accumulated surplus in the 
pension funds, the government should try to improve the plans, 
not for the retired generals I mentioned earlier who are now 
pulling in $250,000 or $300,000 annually, but for those at the 
bottom of the totem pole.  These employees have kept their noses 
to the grindstone all their lives without asking too many 
questions.  And they certainly were not asking whether their 
pension plan was well run.  Their energy went into doing what 
they were paid to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They trusted their employer, but it failed them miserably. 
Today, there is a cumulative surplus of $30.2 billion and the 
government will grab it and put it in its pockets, leaving these 
people, most of whom are below the poverty line, to try to make 
ends meet and unable to enjoy a well deserved retirement. We 
never had cause to complain about our federal public servants. 
But once they retire, we complain about them, and say that they 
get too much. If the government had something to complain about, 
it should have said so before they left the public service. Now 
it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc condemns this approach, the same one that was used in 
regard to EI fund. The federal government long ago stopped 
contributing to the EI fund, but there is a $15 billion surplus 
in the fund. All workers pay into the fund, but very few receive 
benefits. 
We are told that only 35% of the workers are eligible to 
benefits, even though 100% of them pay premiums.

misappropriation of funds. Since this morning, all opposition 
parties agree on that. The government must stop stealing. It is 
Robin Hood in reverse: it takes from the poor to give to the 
rich. In the original scenario, Robin Hood took from the rich to 
give to the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the population, the civil servants, 
particularly the RCMP officers, who are not known as 
complainers—one must be very committed to join the RCMP—and 
proved long ago that they were ready to make many sacrifices to 
be members of the RCMP, wear the stetson and ride a horse, all 
those people do not complain, but they must have something to 
live on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have heard a lot of debate today in the House on Bill C-78. 
The opposition parties have stated some very sound arguments as 
to why the government should reconsider the bill and look at the 
amendments that are before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct the record on something that was 
mentioned earlier by the hon. member for Mississauga West.  He 
seemed to indicate that there were only 15 amendments before us 
at this stage of the bill.  I believe it is well over 50 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the amendments that have been put forward by opposition 
parties, the Reform Party and my hon. colleague from St. Albert, 
have to do with accountability and the fact that the $30 billion 
the government is raiding in this pension grab is certainly not 
set up in this piece of legislation to the degree of 
accountability that we would like to see.  I just wanted to 
mention that off the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also does not give any seats on the board to those 
individuals who this bill directly affects.  An advisory 
committee will be set up, but we all know what that means.  When 
the Liberals set up an advisory committee it means we will have a 
little meeting group where we can raise our concerns, but none of 
our concerns will be listened to.  Well, they may listen but they 
are not actually going to do anything about them.  They will just 
let us get together and have a talk and maybe that will make us 
feel better.  It is almost like giving us a pat on the head and 
sending us out the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was serious about this, it would allow these 
individuals to sit on the board.  That is quite obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members from the Tory party agreeing.  Members of the 
opposition are in agreement that the bill is a flawed piece of 
legislation and that is why we had to bring forward so many 
amendments.  Hopefully the government will listen, but alas, our 
requests often fall upon deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get to the premise of the government's argument for 
the bill.  Its premise is to say “Trust us.  We are the 
government.  We'll take care of this money, the $30 billion. 
We'll pay down the debt”.  Why in the world would we believe 
that given the record of the Liberal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to point out something which I think is obvious to 
all people.  If we are trusted to be prudent and take care of a 
small amount of money, in whatever our job or our responsibility 
is, we will then be given more responsibility to take care of a 
greater amount of dollars.  If we are able to manage that well, 
then we will be given the care of more and more dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was doing that then perhaps we could trust it 
to take care of the $30 billion in the pension surplus, the 
clawback of that hard-earned money from those individuals who 
have contributed to the fund.  However, I want to point out a 
glaring example of how the government manages dollars.  It is an 
issue that some have touched on in the House earlier today and 
one which is before us in media on the front page of one of the 
national papers today.  It has to do with how the government has 
mismanaged some $55,000 of taxpayers' dollars, a fairly 
substantial sum I would think to the average Canadian.  For most 
people that would be the amount of their salary if they had a 
well paying job.  Unfortunately it is not even that for many 
folks.  Fifty-five thousand dollars is a large sum of money. 
It is shocking to hear where the government spent this money. The 
Liberal government spent $55,000 on the funding of a pornographic 
movie production called <I>Bubbles Galore</I>.  The producers of 
this film thanked the Government of Canada on their website which 
is directly linked to the Government of Canada's webpage.  That 
is unbelievable.  How could this happen?  The Liberal government 
dedicated $55,000 of taxpayers' dollars to that expenditure.

and burn health care by $20 billion”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It behooves the House that all members participating in this 
debate stay closely to the topic at hand.  We are talking about 
Bill C-78.  We are talking about the superannuation act.  I 
simply request the hon. member, instead of divulging into 
gratuitous conversation about other matters which he knows have 
no relationship to the bill, to stick to the matter at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The parliamentary secretary is 
correct.  We are debating a series of amendments to the act. 
Members' remarks should somehow be relevant to the amendments to 
the bill.  I am not sure if the movie is relevant, but perhaps 
the hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette has some way of tying it 
in.  If so, we are all looking forward to hearing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had 
been present earlier to hear the debate he would have heard me 
talk about the different amendments.  He wants to shut me down 
now so I do not embarrass the government by bringing to light 
this wasteful spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We do not seem to be on the same wave 
length here.  There are a series of amendments before the House. 
If the parliamentary secretary has another point of order I will 
hear it but I hope it will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made 
reference to the presence or absence of a member in the House. It 
is not a point of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the point has been made.  I 
have invited the hon. member to bring his remarks within the 
ambit of the amendments before the House.  I think that is a 
relevant point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a government that 
tells us, under the premise of their whole argument on the bill 
and on these sets of amendments, to trust it with this $30 
billion and it will be applied to the debt.  That is what the 
member for Mississauga West said earlier and what other members 
of the government have said throughout the debate on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that wants people to trust it with the 
dollars they send to Ottawa but, as I have just pointed out, the 
dollars have been wasted.  If the government wants people to 
believe that it is serious about applying $30 billion which is 
indicated in Bill C-78 and the accountability measures mentioned 
in the amendments that are before us—many of them brought 
forward by my colleague for St. Albert—it would look at these 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we hear members of the government rising on points of 
order and trying to stop debate when things get a little dicey in 
terms of its record.  It must defend that record because it is 
the government.  It is our job as opposition members to point out 
the record of the government.  If government members do not want 
to hear that, they do not have to be here to listen to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from the NDP, the Reform Party, the Bloc and the 
Progressive Conservative Party will continue to point out the 
government's failure in its fiscal responsibility before the 
people of Canada and in the House.  This is a clear example of a 
waste of taxpayers' dollars. I would like to challenge any 
Liberal member from that side to stand up and defend the 
expenditure of $55,000 on the production of a pornographic film. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It has nothing to do with the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a member on the 
government side says it has nothing to do with the amendments.  I 
will say it for the third time. 
The premise of the government's argument on Bill C-78 is that it 
wants Canadians to trust it with the expenditures of these funds, 
which are Canadians' hard earned tax dollars.  That is the 
premise of the government's argument for this bill.  It is also 
the premise for rejecting the amendments that the opposition is 
bringing forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I state once again that if the government wants to seriously 
have the trust of Canadians, then it had better do a better job 
on accountability in terms of taking care of taxpayers' dollars, 
such as the $30 billion surplus in the pension fund that it says 
it is going to apply to the debt.  How can we know that to be the 
case when we see these examples popping up over and over again of 
the government wasting taxpayers' dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the government would rise on points of 
order to try to shut down this line of debate because it is 
embarrassing for it.  It is very embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  And it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The member on the opposition side says 
that it should be embarrassing.  Absolutely it should be 
embarrassing.  I know that many members of the Liberal government 
are embarrassed by this expenditure as well.  I think that as 
parliamentarians we are embarrassed by it.  How could that 
possibly have happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area of financial responsibility which falls under 
the direction of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  How can that 
minister, who says that she stands to defend women's rights, 
allow an expenditure of $55,000 of taxpayers' money for a 
pornographic video?  I cannot understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premise behind my argument is that if the government wants 
us to trust it with taxpayers' dollars, then it had better start 
showing us that it is accountable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the third reading debate of Bill C-78.  I 
understand that we are dealing with a group of motions this 
afternoon.  I want to refer specifically to Motions Nos. 2 and 3, 
as well as Motions Nos. 9 and 10.  These are motions which have 
been put forward by my colleague from Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 2 and 3 deal with the ethical investment of the 
pension fund and specifically suggest that they not include 
tobacco sales or manufacture or promotion.  They also would 
exclude pollution or environmental degradation, labour standards 
and practices which are inferior to those required by law in 
Canada, and any practice or activity which may result in the 
elimination or contracting out of the jobs of members of the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 9 and 10 simply make reference to the fact that the 
Auditor General of Canada should be the primary auditor of the 
public sector pension investment board to protect the interests 
of the retirees and those who will be retirees sometime in the 
future.  I certainly stand in full support of those valuable 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make some general comments on Bill C-78 and to 
say that this is a closely watched debate.  I know that because I 
have heard from many constituents in Saskatchewan who have spoken 
to me about this issue.  Some have met with me as recently as 
last week in the riding to talk about their concerns.  I know the 
government knows it is a closely watched debate.  That is why it 
is ramming this through as fast as it possibly can.  That is why 
it has introduced closure.  The government has refused to hold 
cross-country hearings because it does not want the people to 
come forward to vent their spleen and anger at what is happening 
with Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the approach of the government is to commandeer 
$30.1 billion and to appropriate that unto itself.  There is no 
hint that it is prepared to share this surplus with the retirees 
or the current public sector workers in any way, shape or form. 
There are basically three groups which have or are contributing 
to the plan:  the government, the pensioners who have contributed 
over the years, and the current employees who are contributing. 
As I said, the surplus stands in excess of $30 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This affects public service superannuation members, folks who 
were employed by the Canadian forces as well as the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated this at second reading a week or so ago the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board 
indicated to us that one of the reasons the government was 
commandeering the $30 billion was because the government has to 
guarantee any deficit and it has to ensure that the pensions are 
paid out.  The parliamentary secretary indicated that over the 
years the government has paid out some $13 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can just picture this, the government has paid out $13 
billion according to its figures, but it will grab $30 billion. 
Where in the world is the equity in that proposition?  It has 
refused to share this with the other two groups that have 
contributed over the years.  It is the old adage, “What's mine 
is mine and what's yours is mine as well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this movie.  The member for Dewdney—Alouette was 
talking about movies.  There was another pornographic film around 
and that was on the $26 billion grab that the government made on 
the employment insurance fund a few years ago where there was 
absolutely no money and even less justification from the 
government.  It put none of that money in.  It was all employers' 
or employees' money, but somehow it appropriated that unto itself 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government takes the $30 billion and runs with it, who 
is left in the lurch?  The people who are primarily left in the 
lurch are women.  The average pension, not the bottom end, for 
women in the public service is $9,600 per year.  Again, that is 
not the low end.  That is the average received by these folks who 
have worked over the years earning low wages, having their 
salaries frozen, not qualifying for equal pay for work of equal 
value or anything of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government wants to close this debate down as 
quickly as it can because it knows how high the feelings are 
running out in the country on this issue.  That is why it chose 
to stonewall any suggestion from the member for Winnipeg Centre, 
or others in our caucus or on this side of the House, that there 
be cross-country hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once upon a time the Liberals, when they sat on this side of the 
House, saw this issue much differently than they see it today. At 
that time, in the 1991-92 period, they proposed that any 
surpluses in pension plans should be resolved by binding 
arbitration.  That was then and this is now.  Then they were 
sitting to the left of the Speaker and now they are sitting to 
the right of the Speaker and they have a whole different approach 
to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that what is happening is not only a shame, it is also 
a sham.  Obviously, with its majority the government will get its 
way on this issue today, but I predict that there will be a day 
of reckoning because the government has not heard the last from 
the retirees on this issue.  I suggest that it will rue the day 
when it absconded with $30.1 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are debating Bill C-78, the public service pension plan raid. 
At least that is what I would suggest the title should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard from many of the people who have spoken on this 
bill, what it all boils down to is the government getting its 
sticky fingers on $30 billion of private pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money that the government insists on putting its sticky 
fingers on is being taken from the Canadian people who paid into 
this fund.  Let us look at who it is taking this money from.  It 
is taking $14.9 billion from the public service plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only weeks ago that we had to stand in the House all 
night to debate, while the government's only solution was to 
force these men and women across Canada back to work.  That was 
absolutely unacceptable.  Now, to add insult to injury, it is 
helping itself to the pension plan fund that rightly belongs to 
PSAC.  That is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking $2.4 billion from the RCMP members' 
plan.  It is ironic that I attended a community policing forum 
last week in my riding.  I spoke to an RCMP member as well as the 
mayor of the town of Sidney, Don Amos.  They are very frustrated 
with what is going.  In that city there is a fairly large 
detachment of RCMP officers.  As we know, in British Columbia we 
have 400 vacancies that are yet to be filled because there are no 
officers to fill them.  The government will not allocate the 
funds to train people.  There are four vacant positions in 
Sidney, the community in which I live.  I am told by the mayor 
that those four positions are 100% funded by the municipality, 
yet there is nobody to fill them.  They go unfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told by one of the other police officers that they have 
been advised that they should be using all the gas coupons they 
have received to fill up their police cars.  Morale is very low. 
What is the government going to do to add insult to injury?  It 
is going to raid their money.  That is absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is outrageous that the government sees this $30 billion 
surplus as its money.  Thirty per cent of the pension plan fund 
is funded by the members.  It is funded by the employees of the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada.  It is their money and the 
government is confiscating it.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government does things like this it is clearly 
embarrassed about it.  It is not putting up speakers.  The last 
speakers on this bill have been my colleague from the NDP and 
another Reform member.  The Progressive Conservatives and the 
Bloc are also speaking on this bill.  Why?  Because the 
government is embarrassed.  We fully understand that it will most 
likely bring in time allocation or closure on this bill because 
it is embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that we are fighting to get basic, core funding 
for a national institution, one of which we are very proud from 
coast to coast, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  The 
government treats those people like the musical ride and nothing 
more.  It makes them go around in circles and they do not get 
anything out.  That is unacceptable.  What is the government 
doing now?  It is confiscating money from a fund which those 
members paid into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with the PSAC members who went on strike 
for a long time.  The government's only solution to that was to 
come down with a big hammer and force them back to work.  These 
are the facts.  They are indisputable.  They are there.  Why is 
the government so silent?  Because it is absolutely embarrassed 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very simple solution to this.  The Reform Party has 
put forward numerous amendments.  We will watch when they come up 
for debate.  My colleague from Alberta put forward these 
amendments.  There are a number of them.  At the end of the day 
what we need is a pension investment board.  Let us remove it 
from the government and politics and have it at arm's length from 
the government.  It should be made up of experts in the field, in 
the private sector, who can manage these pension funds so the 
Liberals cannot get their sticky fingers on them and raid them. 
Then the Liberals will stand and say that they balanced the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who has balanced the budget?  The union members.  The RCMP 
members.  Who else is the government robbing?  It is robbing the 
Canadian forces plan of $12.9 billion.  These are the men and 
women who are in active combat in Kosovo, putting their lives on 
the line in very scary situations.  While they are on the other 
side of the world fighting for humanity, what is their government 
doing behind their backs? 
It is stealing their pension money.  That is unacceptable.  I 
will retract that.

other side of the world fighting for Canada. At the very same 
time their own government is confiscating their pension plan 
funds to the tune of $30 billion, from the public service union, 
from the RCMP and from the armed forces. That is wrong. That is 
so dead wrong.  Thirty billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope when we stand up to vote on this that some of the 
government members will actually look at what they are doing. 
They have to be held accountable.  They should be focusing their 
priorities on these very groups where the morale is so low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so real in British Columbia.  RCMP officers have come up 
to me individually to tell me how tight cash is. It is absolutely 
unacceptable that the government has cut back the budget of the 
RCMP so much that they cannot fill the vacant positions.  They 
have grounded all boats.  They have grounded the drug squads in 
Vancouver.  They have cancelled overtime.  It is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very same time, what is the government doing?  We have 
seen examples.  The one I just heard about today is a $55,000 
grant for <I>Bubbles Galore</I> a sex fantasy porn film.  Another 
one which comes to mind is the outright grant of $100,000 that 
went to some person to write a dumb blond joke book.  The list 
goes on and on.  It is outrageous that the government can even 
consider this.

Someone is going to be held accountable.  It is their money. We 
have to do the right thing and put it in the hands of a private 
investment board where there will be accountability and the 
government cannot get its sticky fingers all over it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have a turn at speaking to Bill C-78, an act to 
establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to amend 
the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act and other related acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the more pleased because I will be speaking as well as 
the labour critic, a role which has led me in recent weeks to 
examine the sometimes sorry lot of public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a few weeks ago we saw once again that the state as 
employer gave precedence to its power as a legislator over its 
power as a negotiator.  And it is holding the line on that.  Now 
we have another bill that is completely in the government's 
favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal public servants will have to remember the President of 
Treasury Board, now arriving, as the member for Hull-Aylmer, when 
it comes time for the next elections and the next referendum. 
Those on the other side of the floor will have to learn to pass 
legislation, not just in the supposedly collective interest, but 
also perhaps in a greater spirit of generosity than what is 
motivating the government at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of people and billions of dollars are involved here. 
Overall, there are some 275,000 contributors to the pension 
fund. 
We are talking about 160,000 retirees and 52,000 surviving 
spouses, people who have lived with public servants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a surplus of $30 billion that has 
accumulated since the fund was first established in 1924. 
Between 1924 and 1998, a period of 74 years, some $75 billion 
have been accumulated in surpluses, with the particular surplus 
we are looking at being $30 billion.  Believe it or not, $14.9 
billion of this come from the public service superannuation fund 
per se, $2.4 billion from the RCMP superannuation fund, and 
almost $13 billion from the Canadian forces superannuation fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $30 billion surplus directly affects government employees. 
Just as the federal government decided to use the money in the 
EI fund to bring down the deficit, to the detriment of this 
country's unemployed workers, now it has decided to lower the 
national debt, this time dipping into the accumulated money in 
its employees' pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit disconcerting from a public morale point of view to 
see a body as important to the Canadian economy as the federal 
government acting in this manner, given the moral authority it 
carries.  It is disconcerting to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this belies all the government's supposed attempts 
at proceeding with caution.  On the face of it, the government 
has made an effort.  In 1996, it established the Public Service 
Superannuation Act Advisory Committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly, the President of the Treasury Board was quite 
positive at the time in his remarks, praising the efforts of the 
workers, the union representatives and the government.  He said 
they had made a generous effort, that they were perceptive and 
that he planned to implement many of the recommendations.  He 
said the work had been productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he did not anticipate the authority of the Minister of 
Finance, who saw things quite differently than he did.  The 
Minister of Finance decided that it would go instead into the 
consolidated fund to pay off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this body known as the federal government, there is no real 
collaboration, unlike Quebec, in brackets, between unionized 
workers, government employees and the government as such. 
The government decides arbitrarily, unilaterally, in the hopes 
the unions will go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also say it is in contradiction with the advisory 
committee I spoke of earlier.  It followed none of the 
recommendations the committee made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, it would be so simple if the government complied with 
the law that applies generally to the funds in the federal 
government pension plan.  If it applied the regulations of the 
Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, the problems and disputes 
we are facing today would not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the government is acting once again unilaterally 
and arbitrarily.  This legislation currently applies to all jobs 
covered by federal regulations, except a job for Her Majesty in 
Right of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is all very well for others, but it is not a good thing 
when one works directly for the public service of Canada, 
because the government as employer prefers to issue its own 
rules to its own advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the regulations, an actuarial gain must first be used to 
reduce an outstanding debt or a solvency deficit.   This is what 
the regulations provide. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the regulations state that the balance must be used to 
increase benefits or to reduce the employer's contributions 
related to the normal costs of the plan, or must be left in the 
plan. If I understand correctly, this applies to any corporation 
under federal jurisdiction, like Canadian Pacific or Sun Life 
for example. Any corporation under federal jurisdiction must 
abide by the rules set out by the federal government, even 
though it does not abide by these rules itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations also provide that all or part of the surplus can 
be reimbursed if the surplus is in excess of twice the 
employer's contributions or 25% of the plan's liabilities, if 
the administrator has notified plan participants, in writing, of 
his or her intention to withdraw part of the surplus and of 
their right to submit to the superintendent, in writing, their 
comments on the withdrawal and if the superintendent has 
approved the reimbursement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if we applied these rules, we would not have the 
problems we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we propose, among other things, is that employees be 
present at the table, that they be an integral part of the 
committee instead of being represented by a person who is 
appointed by the President of the Treasury Board. Right now, out 
of 12 committee members, employees and unions will be 
represented by one person appointed by the President of the 
Treasury Board. This situation is not normal; it will breed 
challenges and condemnation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In compliance with the wishes of employees and pensioners, we 
want a management board to be set up with a mandate to design 
the pension plan, to provide for its financing, to manage any 
surplus or deficit, to manage the plan and to ensure adequate 
financing for the payment of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simple, but fair. This is all the opposition is asking 
for and all the public servants are asking for.

soil and the environment in general. One need only think of 
Bre-X, the use of cyanide to extract gold and mine tailings

substances that are harmful to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in Spain and before that in Guyana, two major spills 
took place involving Canadian mining companies.  Such accidents 
should not happen anywhere.  If mining is to have a place in 
Canada, its promoters should take strong measures to prevent 
spills, to adopt non-toxic processes and to decommission mines 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining industry must be made to prevent the creation of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are our taxes so high?  Even after the Liberals slashed 
health care, pillaged pension funds and gutted the EI system so 
that hardly anyone qualifies, we are still paying through the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe that when Canadians spend more money on taxes 
than they do on shelter and food, tax dollars should at least be

the money to cut taxes.

is not a coincidence as the majority of women who come into 
conflict with the law are mothers.  Most of them were sole 
supporters of families when they were incarcerated. 
When mothers are sentenced to prison, children are sentenced to 
separation.  That is why the focus this year was alternatives to 
incarceration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it with sadness that I rise to remind the House of the 
government's abandonment of a sacred public trust, the origins of 
which reach back to the justinian code in Roman times when it was 
proclaimed that the water and sea were owned by no one and were 
available to all for the purposes of fishing, navigation and 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public right was also encapsulated in the Magna Carta.  The 
right to fish belongs to the people, not to the sovereign or her 
government.  That right was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of 
Canada in the Van der Peet decision of 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty marks the first time since Confederation that 
parliament has been asked to create in British Columbia a fishery 
that excludes the public, a fishery that will not be open to all 
Canadians regardless of race.  The Nisga'a final agreement will 
create an exclusive fishery for the Nisga'a based on race in what 
has been public waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has not sought to put a dollar value on 
the right being transferred and for good reason.  The Nisga'a 
treaty will legislate an end to a right the Supreme Court of 
Canada has traced back to the Magna Carta.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in June Mr. Justice Cory will be retiring from the 
Supreme Court of Canada after 10 years of distinguished service. 
The Prime Minister will be filling this position on the advice of 
the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the supreme court is becoming increasingly active in 
rewriting the law as well as interpreting it, many Canadians feel 
that elected legislators should have a role in questioning and 
approving supreme court nominees before they are appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government prepared to consult parliament on this 
appointment and to give a parliamentary committee an opportunity 
to discuss and question the nominees? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the system we have been using over the years has 
produced an outstanding supreme court.  I do not see any reason 
to make any changes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately the public does not share the view of the 
Deputy Prime Minister. In a recent national survey, nine out of 
ten Canadians said they were opposed to the Prime Minister 
appointing the next supreme court justice.  Eighty-four per cent 
preferred a greater role in appointments by the legislative arm 
of government, that is, parliament and the legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government not respect the will of the vast 
majority of Canadians and stop defending an appointment process 
that they neither support nor respect? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Prime Minister carries out with the cabinet 
this appointment process, not only has it resulted, as it will in 
the future, in an outstanding supreme court, but the Prime 
Minister and his cabinet are accountable to this House for the 
decisions.  Through this House the Prime Minister and his cabinet 
are accountable to the Canadian people.  The Canadian people will 
have their say and I am sure they will support the decisions that 
the Prime Minister makes in this important matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister fails to consult this House on the 
most important judicial and administrative appointments.  He 
signs treaties, even commits Canada to involvement in a war with 
neither a vote nor a mandate from this House.  He does nothing to 
prevent appointed judges from short circuiting this elected 
assembly through rewriting the law rather than just interpreting 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not seize this opportunity to show some 
real confidence in the House and insist that the Prime Minister 
consult the House prior to any judicial appointment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has just called for 
political interference with the work of the judiciary. I do not 
think that this is what the House wants.  I do not think this is 
what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason to link this with the matter of the situation 
in Serbia and Kosovo.  In that situation there has been and there 
will continue to be consultations with this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is obvious the government is refusing to hear the concerns of 
Canadians on this issue. The courts across the country are 
increasingly isolated from the people they judge.  Hand picked 
ministerial appointments are eroding Canadians' faith in the 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the justice minister continue to lock Canadians out of this 
process?  Or will she take the first steps toward rebuilding 
confidence in the justice system and allow the next supreme court 
nominee to come before this parliament? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Let me say first of all, Mr. Speaker, that 
the appointment process that has been used in this country for 
the appointment of supreme court judges has led to the creation 
of the most respected final court of appeal anywhere in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say, since our hon. friends across the way are so 
busy trashing federal institutions, that in the same poll they 
referred to, Canadians overwhelmingly voiced their confidence in 
the Supreme Court of Canada as the final appellate court in this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister talks about consultation. I want to ask her, did 
Canadians have an opportunity to be consulted on child 
pornography, on aboriginal land claims, on redefining the family? 
The list goes on and on and the answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues are too important to shut out Canadians.  We should 
be able to see, learn and evaluate the supreme court candidates, 
before his or her appointment is a fait accompli.  It is a closed 
shop today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister open the door to public scrutiny and allow 
parliament to assess the nominees?  Yes or no?

Criminal Code dealing with child pornography.  This parliament 
will have the opportunity to debate and vote on the Nisga'a 
treaty.

president of Orléans Express, one of the main bus companies in 
Quebec, has said that the federal bill could deprive some 100

the one in the Gaspé, which loses up to $1 million annually,

that there are some concerns on the part of various members of

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Canadian government spent $1,775 per person for 
public health care expenses.  Here is the difference.  The United

</I></B></P><P align=left>In March we became the first parliament in the world to endorse 
the idea of a Tobin tax, a tax on international currency 
speculation.  Yesterday the Bank for International Settlements 
said that the currency transactions are now up from $1.3 trillion 
a day to $1.5 trillion a day, an increase of over 20%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most controversial issues that has come up in the New

the total eligible costs of the highway and then he broke the 
agreement.

the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to amend the Public

Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, the

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is always difficult to rise in the House after 
oral question period to make a speech, but I will take advantage 
of the fact that there are many members present right now, 
especially on the government benches, to share my thoughts on 
the infamous Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, this bill is highway robbery. The government is trying to 
put its hands on $30 billion stolen from various civil service 
pension funds, and would have us believe it is doing so after 
due consultation and negotiation. This is bogus, and I want to 
say this while everybody, or nearly everybody, is still here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government trying to do this kind of thing in today's 
economy, especially after four years of negotiations with the 
three groups involved? We are talking about the RCMP, the 
federal public service and the Canadian forces. Thirty billion 
dollars will be taken from these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations went on for four years, and the President of the 
Treasury Board even said these discussions were encouraging. He 
went as far as to say that these consultations could lead to a 
partnership that would implement, within the public service, the 
concept of a management board independent from the government. 
That statement was made in February 1998 by the President of the 
Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us today Bill C-78, which totally ignores the 
discussions that went on for four years as well as the nice 
words of the President of the Treasury Board. 
I think the government is showing us its true face. We are 
seeing the insatiable appetite of the Minister of Finance, who 
wants to put his fiscal house in order at the expense of these 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to understand. The government has taken everything 
away from fishers and from victims of the lack of jobs, those 
people who used to be eligible to some unemployment insurance 
benefits, now known as employment insurance benefits. It has 
taken $20 billion from that program. Where to go from here? 
Wherever there is a little bit of money left. It is now turn to 
its own workers and alienating them. It will steal $30 billion 
from its own employees' pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem somewhat odd that a Bloc member rise in this House 
on a principle and ask the government to come back to its 
declaration of intent of February 1998 with respect to 
developing a partnership with its employees. It may seem unusual 
because some people contend that all we want to do is to leave 
and slam the door behind us. I wish people would at least 
remember that, while the Bloc Quebecois was represented in this 
place, they were men and women of their word. We would wish 
that, when an issue arises, it be discussed openly, and not 
behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see that my comments today are waking up members 
across the way. However it is unfortunate that we have to rise 
our voices from time to time. I can do it and I will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find even more horrendous is the similarities between 
what is being done today and what was done to those who rely on 
the financial support provided through the employment insurance. 
They were robbed of $20 billion and now the same thing is going 
to happen to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, at least, the government said it was going to use that money 
for equalization purposes, or take a part of that money so that 
less money has to be taken out of the employment insurance fund. 
Public servants are fortunate enough to have a job; financial 
support should be provided to those who fall victim to the lack 
of job opportunities, or at the very least the money should be 
used to reduce workers' contributions and to create new 
catalysts to revitalize the economy in severely affected 
regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear speculation that the finance minister will use it to pay 
down the accumulated deficit. That would be nice, but can 
someone tell me what good it would do to pay $30 billion on a 
debt now reaching some $600 billion? Especially since, according 
to the documentation I have received, these payments would be 
spread over a period of 15 years. I am a bit skeptical about this 
whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question we should ask ourselves—and I am not saying 
that it should not be done—is: How will the payments be 
calculated or estimated so that they have as little impact as 
possible on the exchange rate? We know full well that when the 
finance minister turns on the tap to pay off accumulated debts 
we owe to other countries, the next morning, Canadians will 
realize that they have not only been paying toward this debt, 
but they will continue to pay, because the exchange rate is 
dropping and they will have to pay more for imported goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wants the President of the Treasury Board to 
redeem himself, to face up to the Minister of Finance, who seems 
to carry more weight than him within the Cabinet, and to come to 
an agreement with the three groups concerned. An agreement 
should be negotiated with the public service, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Otherwise, what signal would we be sending out to Canadian 
corporations? If the Canadian government sets an example by 
taking money out of the public service pension plan, what will 
prevent Canadian corporations from doing the same with the 
accumulated surpluses in the pension plans of their own 
employees? This is the example it is about to set. It could be 
hazardous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been lawsuits. 
I will let my colleague from Saint-Jean elaborate on that. But we 
will recall that that is precisely what the Singer Company did. 
The case is still before the courts, but I have yet to see the 
Minister of Human Resources Development put pressure on the 
company and tell it “You were caught helping yourself to your 
employees' pension fund”. Apparently, the case has not yet been 
settled. With Bill C-78, the President of Treasury Board is 
legitimizing a $30 billion robbery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was knee-high to a grasshopper, whenever a kid from the 
neighbourhood was caught stealing candy from the pot at the 
convenience store—sometimes the general merchant would keep in a 
corner the extra candies he could not find place for on the 
shelves—that kid was called thief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, a man who may have done the same thing as a kid—because we 
were all kids at one point—is stealing $30 billion and we call 
him Mister Minister. Furthermore, we are expected to say “Thank 
you very much”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians should do now is pay very close attention to what 
the President of the Treasury Board is doing. They should 
monitor the adoption process of this bill. Of course we cannot 
put pressure on a government between elections. I hope however 
that people will remember who turned the tap off, who stole 
$30 billion, who gave such a bad example to Canadian businesses, 
which will no doubt feel free to help themselves to the private 
pension funds of their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should keep an eye on that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
I am quite prepared to respect everybody's ideas, but there is 
no thief here. Nobody has stolen from anybody. We can exchange

I appreciate why my hon. colleague who spoke just prior to me 
became so upset.  I will not use the same words unless I get as 
upset as him, but what we see today is a government embarking 
upon the taking of money that belongs to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask some fundamental questions about Bill C-78 at 
second reading.  What does the bill do and to whom in the 
Canadian community?  Let us talk about what it does.  It takes 
the proceeds of pensionable earnings and reinvests them in the 
way the government wants instead of returning the money to 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for people to understand that the government can 
take the money, invest it or do with it whatever it wants.  That 
means investing that surplus in multinational corporations or in 
whatever way the government would choose, not necessarily in the 
way the people who have paid into the fund would like to see the 
investment take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ask who is affected.  It includes everyone who has ever 
worked for the public service.  Military personnel, the people 
who are currently fighting in Kosovo, the peacekeepers who have 
done the country proud and have ennobled the nation, are 
affected.  The RCMP is affected.  People who keep our streets 
safe and keep peace, order and good government are affected.  The 
widows of our public servants are affected. There is an old 
saying in the Bible about taking the widow's mite.  Those women 
are affected and women who have worked in the public service 
whose average annual pension income is about $9,600 are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about multimillionaires who are affected by 
the legislation.  We are talking about average workers who have 
worked hard for their country in public service.  They are the 
ones who are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the legislation do to them?  It certainly will not pay 
back to them the surplus from the funds invested by their hard 
work.  We are opposing it because there is no provision to give 
this money back to the workers.  The women earning $9,600 
annually from her pension will not benefit from the government 
bill.  In fact she will suffer directly because of it.  Money 
that could go to improve her standard of living will instead go 
to whom?  Perhaps the government could answer that question for 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill say about priorities?  What does it say about 
the government's commitment to community economic development?  I 
will speak from my own riding's perspective because the vast 
majority of people in my riding are seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of government policy many young people in the Atlantic 
region and in northern regions of the country leave for areas of 
high employment because of the high unemployment in those areas. 
That leaves retirees in those communities.  That leaves in those 
communities people like the individuals I have already mentioned: 
people in the RCMP, military personnel who retire in the Atlantic 
region, widows of those who have worked for the public service or 
other retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of changes to the employment insurance act in my own 
riding over the last seven or eight years over $30 million has 
been taken out of the economy in the form of employment insurance 
because of cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now has an opportunity to say to the retirees in 
my community and in like communities across the country that is 
has a huge surplus in the pension fund and will make sure those 
people who paid for it reap some of the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those people reap the benefits, then so do the small business 
owners on main street of every city in the country where there 
are retirees in the population.  Those retirees will take the 
additional funds, to which we in the NDP believe they are 
entitled, and will invest them in their communities through 
purchasing power.  This will create jobs in small communities and 
ensure the survival of small communities to some measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a small step the government could take to establish its 
commitment to economic survival of small communities. 
Unfortunately the government lacks either the courage or the 
foresight to take that step, or it is simply not a priority for 
it to ensure the survival of small communities by making sure 
that people who have lived in those communities all their lives 
or retire to those communities reinvest a part of the surplus to 
which they are entitled in those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things could be said about the legislation.  The government 
will say that the opposition is being unduly harsh and critical 
of the bill, is nit-picking at the bill, and perhaps not giving 
as clear an indication as it might.  There is an opportunity for 
the government to rebut, but the government has chosen to invoke 
closure yet again on a most important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the opposition are somehow distorting the facts, 
if we are somehow incorrect, I challenge the government to put 
the bill forward and allow proper time for debate so that it can 
rebut the arguments we put forward.  The government does not want 
to do that and we have to ask why.  I think it is because the 
arguments put forward by members like me, by members of my party 
who oppose the bill, and by other members of the opposition 
cannot be rebutted by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why else would it shut down debate on an incredibly complex 
piece of legislation after four hours?  This is the Kraft Dinner 
way of making law: put it in the microwave, turn it on for 30 
seconds and hope it is done.  We are not making a Kraft Dinner. 
We are making fundamental changes to legislation which affects 
individuals in every part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are incorrect in our analysis of it, I dare the government 
to come forward with its own facts and figures to rebut us. 
Rather than do that, it closes down debate.  This is the second 
time I have had to address and bring the government to its heels 
on the issue of closure.  The last time had to do with 
fundamental complex legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if parliament does not have time to debate it.  We 
spend hours in the House on many different pieces of legislation. 
When it comes to investing and taking money from a fund, the 
government does not want to talk about it.  It invokes closure. I 
have not used the other word, but I am simply saying that the 
government is taking funds from something into which Canadian 
taxpayers have paid and to which we believe they are entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament was designed so that representatives of communities 
across the country could debate serious issues.  This is among 
the most serious.  When the government is playing with the 
financial gain of the workers of the country and we limit it to 
four hours debate, it is disrespectful of members of the Canadian 
public because it is their money, future and investment upon 
which we are limiting debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks to three issues.  First, it talks about whom the 
government sets as a priority in its thinking.  It is not the men 
and women of the public service, the surplus of whose pension 
funds is being taken away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it speaks to the priorities of the government in terms 
of community economic development.  Clearly that is not a 
priority because we could reinvest those funds back into smaller 
communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it speaks to the government's commitment to democratic 
debate in an open forum.  Sadly the government's record on that 
issue is a failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On each of those counts I am afraid we have to give the 
government a failing grade.  We are not alone in this regard.  If 
we look at newspaper articles or happen to walk around Ottawa 
these days, we see normally mild mannered Canadians who respect 
the law and parliament carrying placards.  They would just as 
soon be at work or at home getting their gardens ready. I am sure 
this is happening in other cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know something is fundamentally wrong.  They know the 
government is taking their money.  They know they are entitled to 
the benefits.  They are just making enough money to survive. 
They want to reinvest that money in their own families and their 
communities.  It is a shame the government will not let them, and 
it is a shame it will close debate on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I feel duty 
bound to speak to Bill C-78. For the benefit of those who are 
watching the debate, it should be pointed out that this is a 
bill enabling the federal government to take the surplus in the 
superannuation funds of public service employees, the Canadian 
forces and the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, it is aimed at changing the rules and preventing 
employee representatives from sitting on the board that will be 
setting the terms of their future retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially offensive that unionized public service 
employees and other employees who have their associations should 
not have their say in the management of their pension plan. It 
is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been a public sector union representative in the past, I 
was involved in negotiations on the management of pension plans. 
The Quebec government agreed to share the management of these 
plans with the employee representatives. In the private sector, 
unionized companies are doing the same thing, by and large. It 
is perfectly natural that employees who contribute to the plan 
should have their say in the management of the fund and of 
surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the present situation, actuaries tell us there is a $30 
billion surplus, which is definitely not a small amount. 
If we take into account all participants in these plans, present 
employees and retirees included, we have over 340,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amount of $30 billion is enormous, when one thinks about the 
surplus that has accumulated in the EI fund at the rate of $5 or 
$6 billion a year. Since the EI reform, all working Canadians 
contribute to the fund. But members should view the surplus in 
the public service funds in light of the fact that it took only 
four years, at a rate of $6 billion a year, to accumulate the 
current surplus in the EI fund. This means that the $30 billion 
amount is truly enormous. And it is a surplus.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to use the surplus as it sees fit in spite 
of the fact that workers contributed to it. The government says 
“Should the fund run a deficit, the government would be on the 
hook”. However what the government fails to say is that 
historically—and this is an important fact—between 1924 and 1998, 
government contributions represented only 48% of all 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that the government has no right to take this $30 
billion surplus, even though there is nothing in the law that 
supports the employees' position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more. 
Given that a large proportion of this surplus comes from 
interests paid on these huge amounts of money, it becomes even 
harder to understand the government's decision to use this $30 
billion as it sees fit. To what use could this $30 billion have 
been put if the fund had been jointly managed, if the government 
had recognized it had no right to use this money for its own 
purposes? What could have happened? For one thing we could have 
improved benefits for a particular class of present or future 
retirees, or we could have decided to put the money to some 
other use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that when Quebec was facing budget problems—as 
other provinces did—public service unions agreed to negotiate 
with the government the use of pension surpluses to help reduce 
the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore unconscionable, because the government has no 
right to take this money. It must be said. 
Some of my colleagues say it differently, but I say the 
government has no right to take all this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I want to make is that this bill shows how the 
government is incapable of coming to an agreement with its 
employees, of recognizing that its employees are represented by 
unions or associations and that these unions or associations 
speak on behalf of employees and defend their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is incapable of providing for a pension plan 
where the interests of employees will be taken into account. It 
is rather offensive—and this is the second time I use the word—that 
the government is planning on appointing the members of the 
committee that will defend the interests of employees. Will 
employees have adequate representation on this committee? Will a 
third of the members represent employees? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the eight members of this committee will be selected by 
the minister from among federal pensioners. Employees will not 
even have the opportunity to select their own representative. 
There is something wrong with the fact that this government is 
incapable of recognizing that employees should have a say with 
regard to the contributions they pay into their own pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should they have a say? Because, in this bill, the 
government is forcing the funds to invest in the financial 
market. This argument was not used very often. The government is 
saying that, from now on, the money from these pension plans 
will be invested in the market, with, of course, a percentage 
that the committee will have to be set aside to buy government 
bonds.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states further that this is required for the sole purpose of 
maximizing returns. In today's world, if pension funds must be 
invested in the financial market, there could very well be 
transactions that the employees would not approve of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Return on investments is not the only aspect to consider. More 
and more, in the face of disturbances caused by the financial 
markets in several countries, people are realizing that they 
cannot invest their money any which way, with maximum return as 
their only criterion. If employees are not involved in the 
management, they do not have any say in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I summarize. 
The government cannot legitimately use the $30 billion as it sees 
fit because employees did pay their contributions. At least half 
the surplus should be given back to them, and they should be 
consulted on how the money should be used and be involved in the 
decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is not normal that, unable to reach an agreement with 
its employees, the federal government would then decide that the 
pension funds, including the surpluses, will not be managed 
jointly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it does not make sense that the government would decide 
to invest these funds on the financial market without consulting 
the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this hardly surprising, given that the government is 
unable to deal with anyone in a fashion other than authoritarian. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak on Bill C-78, an act to establish the 
Public Sector Pension Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to share with my colleagues the views my constituents 
of Berthier—Montcalm have expressed about this bill. They had 
some very serious comments to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that this bill is another indication that the Liberal 
government is having trouble understanding that the working men 
and women are sick and tired of paying for the policies of this 
government, which prefers to take the easy way out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of them told me “You do not need to be a rocket 
scientist to come up with such bills or to balance the budget 
the way the Liberals did it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they needed money, what did they do? They helped themselves 
to the workers' contributions. 
When they needed more money, they cut transfer payments to the 
provinces, which means that the provinces are also paying part 
of it. Then they needed even more money and increased indirect 
taxes. They hid these increases in the budget. Now, they still 
need more money, so they are getting ready to take it from their 
workers' pension plans. This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers are tired of seeing the government brag, especially with 
all its usual arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is just one more bill in the long line of government 
measures that could be called “systematic pillage”. For several 
years now, the government has misappropriated funds belonging 
not only to Canadian workers, but also to Quebec workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a simple strategy: spend in provincial 
jurisdictions by using surpluses from large funds established by 
workers. If the government at least abided by the Canadian 
Constitution—which Quebeckers have not even signed—there would less 
spending than there is now. The government would not be forced 
to take $30 billion from the pockets of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After misappropriating the surplus in the employment insurance 
fund, the Liberal government is now going even further and 
grabbing the accumulated surpluses in the public service 
employees' pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on Bill C-78, like the debate on the employment 
insurance fund, should be an opportunity to condemn the 
government's arrogance. 
It is a matter of respect for the thousands of workers who have 
worked all their life to secure the financial future to which 
they and their family are entitled. More than 487,000 retired 
contributors or their surviving spouses will be affected by the 
bill, without their opinion having really been taken into 
account.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people will be subjected to measures which, according to 
the President of the Treasury Board himself, should have been 
negotiated and on which workers should have been consulted. I 
remind members that not so long ago, in February 1998, the 
President of the Treasury Board had proposed consultations on 
the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations could lead to a partnership which would introduce 
in the public service the concept of a management board acting 
at arm's length from the government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress the expression at arm's length, because it is extremely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us makes no provision for partnership.  I do not 
see how the government can claim that the bill establishes some 
sort of partnership with the members of the public service. 
Bill C-78 is a unilateral act that permits the government to 
dictate the rules of the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Public Service Alliance and the Professional 
Institute of the Public Service are right to protest the way in 
which the government is preparing to appropriate their assets. 
I agree with the remarks of the alliance, which said, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can certainly not sit back and watch this government 
unilaterally take money out of the pockets of the contributors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the Liberal government appropriating accumulated 
surpluses, but Bill C-78 prepares the way for future surpluses. 
In fact, in addition to taking the some $30 billion accumulated 
in the various public service pension plans, clause 96 of Bill 
C-78 will allow the government to take the surpluses of future 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the advisory committee on the Public 
Service Superannuation Act noted, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee's view is that the allocation of surplus should be 
in accordance with recommendations of the pension management 
board. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same committee stipulated that all special negotiations on 
the subject had to recognize pensioners' interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government blithely helping itself to something 
that does not belong to it, but Bill C-78 also proves that it is 
completely ignoring the recommendations made by the advisory 
committee in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of the Liberal government.  It examines issues, 
keeps its backbenchers busy, produces wonderful reports, pens 
lovely letters, and comes up with great discussion topics, but 
it takes none of this into account when it comes time to deliver 
the goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's arrogance can also been seen in the provisions 
concerning the establishment of the public sector pension 
investment board.  The provisions of Bill C-78 must be completely 
overhauled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government shows that it is incapable of taking 
workers' interests into consideration. 
Its bill does not guarantee sufficient worker representation on 
the board's board of directors.  Let it be noted that the 
advisory board clearly recommended that six of the board's 
directors represent employers and six represent workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 has a number of other shortcomings.  As my time is 
running out, I will only mention some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the bill does not allow the board to establish 
independently the percentage of funds that must be held 
available for investment in Government of Canada bonds.  Clause 
50 provides that the governor in council may make regulations 
respecting the limitations to which the board is subject when it 
makes investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By setting too high a percentage of funds to buy government 
bonds, the government could significantly reduce the board's 
ability to achieve rates comparable to those of other pension 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I hope the government will support the very 
legitimate amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, which 
reflect what we heard from our constituents, in our ridings 
across Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would be well advised to take a serious look at 
these amendments. It should leave aside its tendency to indulge 
in petty politics and see the serious nature of our proposed 
amendments.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, these amendments did not come out of the blue, but from 
workers in Quebec—because, as Bloc Quebecois members, we work 
hard to protect the interests of Quebeckers—who came to meet us, 
and who want to see these amendments included in the bill. We 
cannot sit idly and let the government misappropriate $30 
billion without saying anything. No way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of my constituents said, “Tell the minister, if you see 
him”—and I do now—“that he should keep his hands in his own 
pockets. That way, we will be sure he is not going to take money 
out of our pockets”. This says it all. People in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada are fed up with this government, which takes 
money out of their pockets whenever it feels like it, for its 
own purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting our proposed amendments, the government would make 
honourable amends for its lack of respect toward public service 
employees. In fact, the least this government could do is to 
take into consideration the advice and opinion of those who are 
entitled to the content of the funds that it is about to steal 
from. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate on Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this bill was to improve the financial management 
of the three major public sector pension plans as well as to make 
technical changes. I am convinced that if the intent of the bill 
was strictly to improve those pension plans, the government would 
have the undivided support of all members of this House rather 
than just its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will affect the RCMP, the armed forces and federal 
public servants.  It will also establish a new plan for Canada 
Post employees at a future time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill the government has failed to truly take part in 
improving the benefits for all persons involved.  As far as the 
discussion on the surplus is concerned, the government will argue 
that the surplus is strictly its own.  It has come to be 
acknowledged in Canada and in a good many countries that when 
workers and employers invest into plans for the workers, if there 
is a surplus it is a shared surplus.  In private business within 
Canada that is the acceptable road to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has once again failed to truly support the 
workers who in many cases give their lives for this country. The 
government has failed to commit to the pay equity process over 
the last 14 or 15 years.  There has been a lot of rhetoric about 
how it believes in pay equity and a whole spiel of things.  The 
government comes out with wonderful sayings but when it gets down 
to the brass tacks of things, it does not come through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government has said to public sector workers in 
Canada and to all the others who are affected that they really 
are not valued and the government is not going to put anything 
extra into that plan, even though women will retire from the 
public service with a wonderful pension plan of $9,600 a year. 
This does not seem to be the infrequent case. It affects too 
many members. Those persons will have no opportunity to have 
further benefits from that pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality this bill will increase premiums at some point but 
the government will still be responsible for deficits in the 
plan.  The Government of Canada did not want to have this deficit 
hanging over its head.  The government is using the deficit of 
the public service pension plan as a ploy to get the deficit 
down, get rid of the pension plan and have it looked after by 
another medium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government wants to use the surplus to offset the 
government deficit.  Meanwhile it is using the money to offset 
the deficit saying there is a surplus within the government.  The 
government has been playing a shell game with the book figure on 
the public service pension plan surplus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area within this bill that certainly could have used an 
improvement was in regard to the board.  My hon. colleague from 
the Bloc has just mentioned that it will not ensure 
representation by the workers or the members involved in the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly on the advisory board different groups will have an 
opportunity to be represented.  The advisory board can make 
recommendations of names, but the minister does not necessarily 
have to accept those names.  I have seen situations where names 
have been put forward and the minister says, “No, I do not want 
that person”.  Another name goes forth and another name goes 
forth until the minister possibly will have the board that he or 
she so chooses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly in a good many situations what ends up happening and what 
has led to a lack of credibility and no longer a show of support 
for a number of good organizations, is there are political 
appointments.  The minister may not end up on the board or maybe 
not his cousin right now, or a former minister but there is the 
opportunity for other political appointments from political 
parties, somebody's wife, a minister's wife ending up on the 
board.  There is nothing to restrict those kinds of things from 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those types of issues have made Canadians leery of politicians 
and the whole process.  As a result we all suffer from the lack 
of credibility the Canadian public will show for government and 
for all politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area that has been of concern, and I am glad we have put 
forth an amendment to address that issue, is that the funds will 
be invested through the normal investment process, the market. 
There is a real situation arising and the workers, or individual 
Canadians who are part of these plans, may see their dollars 
being invested in companies such as Imperial Tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fighting so hard to decrease the number of kids who are 
addicted to tobacco.  We are fighting the dollars that go into 
the tobacco industry as best we can.  This is not because we do 
not believe there can be some kind of an industry with tobacco 
products.  It is because we do not believe companies should be 
selling the product as healthy and that it is okay to smoke. Suck 
it in, end up sick, die, and the health care system is going to 
pick up the tab. As we fight that in parliament, the pension 
dollars will be at risk of being invested in those same companies 
as they sell their products in countries that maybe will not 
succeed in putting in some of the laws and regulations that I 
hope we are able to do to protect our citizens and certainly our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco is an issue but there are others, to say nothing of 
companies that make arms or land mines, for that matter.  Is 
there some way we can ensure that no dollars within these pension 
funds are going to support companies that are producing land 
mines?  We are fighting the battle to have land mines banned 
throughout the world.  We cannot get the U.S. to come on board. 
Can we ensure that these pension dollars will not be invested in 
those companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we can ensure that happens, I think we are failing 
Canadians and the people in these pension funds who do not want 
their pension dollars to go to those companies.  That is a major 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people do not think that ethical funds can survive or have 
an extra dollar put in their pockets.  I would suggest that the 
people who strongly support ethical funds, if it were a 
difference of a dollar or so, quite frankly if it were a 
difference of a whole lot of dollars, they would still stand 
behind the investment in ethical funds.  They should be given the 
opportunity to ensure that dollars coming out of their pension plan can be 
invested in ethical funds.  That is an absolute must within this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mutualization of funds is taking place in some companies. 
The investor I deal with actually was shocked when I asked what 
was going to happen with the dollars that we had in our funds and 
whether he was going to ensure that they were invested in ethical 
funds.  The question had not come up.  He was taxed with the 
process of finally having to check to see what exactly could be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say quite frankly, if it were my dollar, I would not want 
it being invested in tobacco companies, land mine companies, or 
any kind of company that is not doing what is best for people 
worldwide.  If we want to talk about globalization, then let us 
show a real interest and support for globalization in expecting 
the same things for Canadians and people all over the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's move for closure on this bill is really 
disappointing.  It is not allowing a thorough and proper debate 
on an issue that affects so many Canadians.  It was brought about 
quickly, it was slammed through committee quickly.  Closure 
having been brought in did not allow Canadians overall and those 
affected to hear about this.  Some have heard but others are just 
realizing now that their pension dollars are going to be 
affected.  The government needs a little slap on the wrist again 
for invoking closure and for not allowing proper debate on an 
issue so important to the people investing in these pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage all members of this House to support the 
amendments which will at least give this act some credibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to take part in the debate on this bill to 
establish the public sector pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another measure designed to allow the Liberal government 
to take money from taxpayers. This government is very 
consistent. It always has a scheme to appropriate funds, and the 
one who designs these schemes is the Minister of Finance. 
Members will recall that, in recent months and recent years, it 
was the Minister of Human Resources Development who designed a 
scheme to take money from the unemployed. This resulted in a 
surplus of some $26 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what the federal government did with these $26 billion. 
It created programs to interfere, once again, in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, the Minister of Finance has called on another one of 
his accomplices to help him, and that person is none other than 
the President of the Treasury Board. 
He has asked him to find another way to grab funds. This scheme 
will allow the Liberal government to get its hands on $30 
billion, and that money will not come just from anywhere: $14.9 
billion will come from the public service pension plan, $2.4 
billion from the RCMP pension plan and $12.9 billion from the 
Canadian forces pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most frightening thing about this scheme is that, once 
again, the Minister of Finance and the President of the Treasury 
Board did not hold any consultations regarding Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see in this bill? We see that the President of the 
Treasury Board has ignored his commitments, just as the Liberal 
government has been doing since it came to power in September 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is the board going to be managed? Members should listen to 
this: the Liberal government, through its ministers, will 
appoint board members. First the chairperson will be appointed 
by the President of the Treasury Board in consultation with the 
other departments concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation will not take long, all they will have to do is 
check whether the nominee is a card carrying Liberal, how much 
he or she contributes to the Liberal Party coffers, and whether 
he or she approves the Liberals' mistreatment of the poorest of 
the poor. This is the main criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two members will be appointed by the President of the Treasury 
Board on the recommendation of the advisory committee. One will 
represent public service employees. Again, very partisan 
appointments, which will not represent the interests of the 
parties concerned by Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there will be a member chosen by the minister among 
pensioners. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, they will check whether the nominee belongs or 
contributes to the Liberal Party. This is how the government 
goes about making appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this means the government is once again poised to 
create a new Liberal commando that will take all necessary steps 
to attack the surpluses in three pensions funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad to see how the government has been operating 
lately. 
Furthermore, it is giving a bad example because, if it is going 
to unilaterally take money from pension funds of the three plans 
I have mentioned, there will be people in the private sector who 
will be encouraged to do the same, which could put at risk the 
surpluses in the pension funds of several dozens of employees. 
The federal government's action could have bad consequences for 
workers in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing much positive in this bill. We see once again 
the government using its old methods to take money from the 
poorest. Federal Liberals were very successful at this with the 
employment insurance fund, and they are ready to do the same 
with this bill to establish the public sector pension investment 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we get federal Liberals to listen to reason? How can we 
make the people opposite understand common sense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more we move into this arrogant system, this authoritarian 
system that does not respect anything and that develops a more 
and more centralizing government, the more we see it ignores all 
jurisdictions, all institutions and all things that were 
established in the last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take the money it wishes to have at its disposal to implement 
more partisan programs, the government is prepared to do 
anything. It is prepared to invade all areas of provincial 
jurisdiction and private sector areas to raid billions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the President of the Treasury Board does not support the 
amendments put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, then my party will 
certainly reject out of hand the establishment of this public 
sector pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote against this bill, unless the government takes the 
time to go over our amendments. Given the way the Liberal 
government is behaving, the way it respects democracy and 
listens to the people, I fear that Bill C-78 will give them even 
more power to take money out of the pockets of taxpayers, of 
people who have worked hard and have served the government for 
many, many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reward them, the government is taking money they have earned 
through their hard work and using it for some unprecedented 
propaganda, probably some programs to demonstrate once again how 
generous the government is, when its generosity is only about 
appointing its friends to manage this new board and extending a 
helping hand to Liberal supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no consultation. Board directors will be appointed by 
ministers. Bill C-78 has me very concerned and I will definitely 
vote against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
shall continue in exactly the same vein as my colleague, who 
gave a most informative speech, which I hope will strike a 
responsive chord on the government side, because I believe the 
hon. member for Lotbinière has really pointed out what is at 
stake.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to vote in favour of the legislation. It 
contains an important provision which is close to my heart and 
which is something I have been fighting for over the past few 
years, that is the recognition of same sex spouses. I cannot, 
however, vote in favour of this bill. There is not one member of 
the Bloc who can vote in favour of the bill because it is 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe if there is one thing that characterizes the 
government's actions, it is the total disrespect it has for its 
public servants. What we are asked to vote for is not 
insignificant. We are asked to pass legislation that will create 
the public sector pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we would have expected that such a bill would have 
been arrived at as a result of the broadest possible consensus. 
If there is something sacred in democracy, it is the way we 
treat public servants who, as members know, are at the service 
of their fellow citizens. Often, public servants earn $28,000, 
$30,000, $32,000 or $35,000 a year. I am not talking about the 
mandarins. The majority of public servants I am talking about 
here are honest employees who work hard for their money. The 
government says their pension funds are none of their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had been serious about establishing good 
public relations and harmonious labour relations, we would have 
before us a bill establishing a joint management board where 
Treasury Board and union representatives would work together, 
discussing the best ways to spend the money in the pension 
funds,  particularly the surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of the bill is to approve a mandate that would 
give the government authority to unilaterally appropriate the 
surpluses in the three plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a total surplus of close to $30 billion. I 
will be more specific. There is the public service pension fund, 
with $14,9 billion; the RCMP pension fund, with $2,4 billion; 
and the Canadian forces pension fund, with $12,9 billion. 
Workers have contributed to these pension plans. That kind of 
money does not grow in trees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If workers have contributed to these pension plans, how is it 
that they are not consulted when the time comes to use these 
funds, especially when there are surpluses, since this is what 
we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that ultimately it is a matter of respect for 
Canadian workers. There are now 275,000 contributors in these 
plans. That is a lot of people. There are certainly a few of 
those workers in your riding, Madam Speaker,. There are some in 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, in Lotbiniere, in Saint-Jean and in 
Châteauguay. 
They are honest workers who have contributed to their pension 
plan and who, under the provisions of this bill, will not be 
consulted about the use of the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, a member took offence at the fact that some of my 
colleagues used the word “stealing”. It is true that the word 
“stealing” is very significant. It is true that we should use it 
most sparingly. Members know how careful the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois are with words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Madam Speaker, I wonder if you could suggest another 
word because I cannot find any other to describe an action by 
which someone pinches, appropriates, uses or grabs funds that 
belong to someone else.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, if you think that this is not stealing, then I 
think the issue will have to be referred to the French Academy 
or the French Canadian Academy. From our point of view, when 
someone uses something that does not belong to him, I believe 
that we as an opposition party, have no other choice but to talk 
about stealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing here with pilferage, or shoplifting. This 
type of action is comparable to what highwaymen did when they 
robbed people of all their hard earned possessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced the word used by my colleague—and I say this 
with all due respect—was the proper term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saddest thing about this bill—and I think I am right but 
the member for Saint-Jean can correct me if I am mistaken—is 
that I believe there were negotiations that went on for three 
years. Three years of negotiations cannot be simply brushed away 
and completely ignored in the balance that must be achieved in 
managing the public service in a responsible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I ask all the government members in the House is 
this: why not follow the model that exists in many other areas 
where everything associated with labour relations is done 
jointly? It is the Quebec model: the various parties sit own at 
the same table, employers, public servants, union 
representatives and, of course, the workers themselves. They try 
to find solutions and they succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what we can see in the structure proposed by the President 
of the Treasury Board—and we have no reason to question his 
personal integrity at this time, that is not what this is all 
about—why is he letting himself be sucked in by his government 
when he should be the staunchest defender of public servants in 
parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this minister, who, I repeat, should be the defender of 
public servants' rights, letting himself be completely blinded 
by his government and why is he accepting to sponsor a bill that 
will steal from these workers part of the surpluses that 
rightfully belong to them? I will remind members once again that 
this money comes from contributions paid by the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Longueuil, who knows this issue well and who will 
certainly rise to take part in this debate in a few minutes, 
tells me to remind you that clause 10 is quite important. This 
is no time to be reading the newspaper. I see some members doing 
that, but I would ask them through you, Madam Speaker, to listen 
to what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 says the President of the Treasury Board shall 
establish a committee of eight members to make a list of 
candidates from which the 12 directors of the board will be 
selected. This means that no union representative will be 
appointed directly under this bill. This is the tragedy of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know full well that the government will appoint people 
who embrace its philosophy and who share its views. There is a 
term to describe this kind of practice: it is called patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time has expired, Madam Speaker, so I ask you to 
recall the bill and to ask the pages to take up all the copies.

member for Cumberland—Colchester, Air Safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the thoroughness with which you have gone through the 
motions for us today on this section of the bill and the Group 
No. 2 amendments.  This is an important group of amendments and I 
would like to take a minute to detail why they are important and 
to point out some of the grievous shortcomings in this section of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments I put forward and ones other members have put 
forward, but particularly mine, are designed to return the act to 
where it was prior to this current piece of legislation.  There 
is a very good reason to bring it back to where it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government bill before us affects the pension plans of 
public service employees.  Bill C-78 makes a significant change 
in the determination of who will be eligible for survivor 
benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill changes the test.  Prior to this bill the test was 
fairly clear.  With this bill if the contributor is married and 
the contributor dies, the surviving spouse, a party to the 
marriage, is eligible for the benefits.  There are a few other 
minor tests such as living together at the time of death and that 
kind of thing.  Basically a person who is married to a 
contributor who has died is eligible for the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another group that is eligible.  The sole test for this 
other group for the benefits from the contributor is cohabitation 
for a year and having a relationship of a conjugal nature.  This 
terminology is new to law.  We have had the phrase “having a 
conjugal relationship” but in this bill it is “having a 
relationship of a conjugal nature”.  It may seem like a small 
point but it is not. Let me explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word conjugal usually applies to some sort of physical 
intimacy or sexual activity within the confines of a marriage 
type of relationship. Bill C-78 is basically saying that the 
private intimacies between two people will be the determining 
factor as to whether or not one is going to receive a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about that for a minute. The private intimacies between 
two people will determine whether or not they receive benefits. 
How will anybody know about these private intimacies?  And whose 
business is it anyway?  That is where this bill is taking us. 
Prior to this bill, in the legislation that is being amended, 
that was not a required test for the extension of benefits, nor 
should it be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is being proposed by a government that once had a 
prime minister who said the government has no place in the 
bedrooms of the nation.  Now it is putting forward legislation 
which says that someone who has physical intimacies with a person 
will receive survivor benefits.  It seems unworkable to me. How 
will anyone know? What are we going to set it up?  Will we have 
some sort of inquisition of people's personal intimacies?  That 
is a scary thought but it seems that is where this bill is taking 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, the bill does not in any way define what a 
relationship of a conjugal nature is.  What is that doing?  It is 
leaving it to the courts.  People will be in the courts arguing 
whether or not they had a relationship of a conjugal nature. 
This is after the contributor has died. Who knows what was going 
on and again, what business is it of the government anyway to 
make that the key factor for determining benefits?  It does not 
make sense.  Where could this take us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not say a relationship of a conjugal nature with 
one person.  What about three people living together? Does that 
mean that both of those people have a relationship of a conjugal 
nature with the contributor? Are they both eligible? Nowhere in 
this legislation is it defined or addressed. It is wide open. 
This is a significant cause for concern. It makes the legislation 
unworkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side of the coin, why is this test of a conjugal 
nature the key?  If we want to extend benefits under Bill C-78 to 
people who had some sort of relationship, does that mean we are 
going to exclude certain people?  If two people have a close 
relationship, share expenses, have lived together for years, are 
more than just average friends but they do not have any intimate 
physical relations, are they out or are they in?  Who is going to 
decide that?  The courts again?  Certainly not this legislation 
because it gives absolutely no direction in that area.  It is a 
recipe for confusion and litigation.  It is very poorly drafted 
and very poorly thought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an opportunity in committee to ask the minister about 
this very issue. 
I thought surely the minister would have thought this out and 
would have an answer for me.  Here is the answer I got and I am 
paraphrasing but it can be seen in the committee <I>Hansard</I>. 
He basically told me that the lawyers made them do it.  I could 
not believe it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts had made some decisions and I think he was referring 
to the Rosenberg case where the courts ruled a redefinition of 
the term “spouse”. The justice minister said she was going to 
appeal that decision and defend the current Canadian law and 
never did.  Now the courts have redefined a section in one act in 
government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board said that the courts made 
them do this and the lawyers told them to write it this way.  Is 
this how the Liberal government governs? The courts made them do 
it.  The lawyers told them to do it.  What are they doing?  They 
are setting this up for a test of physical intimacy for the 
determination of benefits.  It just does not make sense.  It is a 
poor approach to the serving of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a bureaucracy are we going to have to establish to 
assess who qualifies and who does not?  I hesitate to use the 
term as I do not want to offend anyone, but we can envision some 
sort of sex police or something like that who would determine the 
regulations on this, who is included and who is excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am attempting to point out to the House and to those who are 
listening today that if we are going to go down this road, surely 
we have to keep it independent from the government invading in 
the physical intimacies between two people. I concur with the 
statement of the Liberal prime minister of some years back.  Mr. 
Trudeau said the government has no business in the bedrooms of 
the nation, yet this very piece of legislation is driving it 
right in there.  For that reason we proposed the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping my talk today and talks I have given on this before 
will cause us to rethink this.  I believe the hon. member from 
Scarborough has some points to make on this as well.  I hope that 
we can look at these amendments to bring the act back to where it 
was before, where the government was not intruding in the private 
affairs of people.  If the government wants to go down this road, 
rethink it and come up with something that works a lot better 
than this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we are told that this change is not going to impact on 
costs at all.  It is going to be a very minor cost.  How can we 
know that when we do not know who qualifies and who does not 
qualify?  I do not buy the argument that this change is going to 
be very minor cost because we do not know who is in or out. That 
just does not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the amendments I have proposed today were only some of 
the amendments that were needed.  There are 249 times in the 200 
pages of this bill where any mention of wife or spouse or widow 
or any of those kinds of terms has been replaced with one word, 
the word survivor.  Of course, survivor is subject to the 
conjugality test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to the legislative counsel for assistance in bringing 
this act back to where it was before.  Because of the rush and 
the way the government has pushed Bill C-78 through the House 
without a good airing of all the issues, the government has made 
it impossible for the legislative counsel to make the appropriate 
amendments to all sections of the bill.  Many sections of the 
bill need amending to bring it back to where it was before.  I 
have not had an opportunity to bring them to the House because of 
time constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all that, I think I have shed some light on this. 
There is a very serious concern to which we all need to pay 
attention.  I hope that when the vote comes we see some reason 
and accept these amendments and have another look at the bill and 
come forward with more appropriate legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have four amendments in this grouping.  I appreciate 
the opportunity to have 10 minutes to explain to the House some 
of the concerns I have with respect to the sections I wish to 
speak on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to echo a number of the comments of the speaker before 
me.  I commend him for some of the motions he brought forward, in 
particular Motion No. 23. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 23 will bring clause 25 at page 51 back to the way it 
was.  In other words it will be a return to status quo.  That 
being the case I say outright that I will be supporting the 
motion.  I agree that the matter has proceeded in undue haste and 
I think the motion is appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion, as I will explain in a moment, is a compromise to the 
motion put forward by the member for Calgary Centre on the chance 
that the House chooses to reject that motion and perhaps chooses 
to consider in some way my compromise.  I will explain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about clause 75 found at page 51 of the bill.  I 
want to read it into the record.  It refers to section 25 of the 
act to be amended.  I pity the people watching on television who 
are trying to follow the clauses.  However I hope to explain to 
the House my main concern.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) For the purposes of this Part, when a person establishes that 
he or she was cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature 
with the contributor for at least one year immediately before the 
death of the contributor, the person is considered to be the 
survivor of the contributor. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer I know that lawyers do not use language 
indiscriminately.  They use language very carefully.  I disagree 
with the hon. member for Calgary Centre who thinks that this 
section was drafted in haste and drafted poorly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that it was drafted very carefully and very 
insidiously by the justice department to continue its objective, 
that is its drive eventually down the road to force Canadians to 
accept same sex marriages and to change the law to require same 
sex marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very significant step down the road.  Why? Let us look 
at the word conjugal.  It has an ordinary English dictionary 
meaning.  If we are speaking the English language as we do as one 
of the official languages in the House, we have to look at the 
ordinary meaning of the word conjugal. It is very simple.  By the 
way I have checked it in French.  It has the same meaning in 
French as it has in English: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conjugal, of marriage; the right of sexual intercourse with a 
spouse; of the mutual relation of husband and wife. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is its definition in the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the section used by the government to provide for same 
sex benefits.  Yet the word conjugal is known in the English 
language as pertaining to marriage and pertaining to the right of 
sexual intercourse with a spouse.  Therefore it is an oxymoron to 
say that it deals with same sex couples because that is not a 
husband and a wife and it is not the sexual intercourse between 
spouses.  Yet the word is used.  It can only be used as the first 
step toward trying to ensure that the federal law is changed to 
permit same sex people to marry, which is federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the legal definition?  Is there a difference?  As it 
happens there is no difference, but I went to a very well known 
source, <I>Black's Law Dictionary</I> which deals with definitions 
of the terms and phrases of American and English jurisprudence, 
ancient and modern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of the word conjugal in <I>Black's Law 
Dictionary</I> reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of or belonging to marriage or the married state; suitable or 
appropriate to the married state or to married persons; 
matrimonial; connubial. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it provides legal citations for that definition. 
What does that mean?  It means that both the ordinary <I>English 
Oxford Dictionary</I> definition and the legal definition of 
conjugal mean of marriage.  It means relations between a husband 
and wife.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the lawyers in the justice department using a word with 
such a clear English and legal meaning to justify the extension 
of same sex benefits to homosexual couples?  There can be only 
one reason.  That is to further the agenda and to push us down 
the road to the recognition of same sex marriages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegation made by my own party is that we are simply 
keeping federal pensions in line with court decisions.  I have 
three things to say to that.  That is bunk.  That is baloney. 
That is balderdash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have to do is look at the Supreme Court of Canada 
decision in Egan and Nesbit which the government has ignored 
purposefully and which the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rosenberg 
grossly ignored and in my opinion improperly ignored since it was 
a higher court.  Egan and Nesbit was a case in which the court 
was called upon to decide whether or not same sex partners could 
get old age security benefits.  That is right on point with same 
sex survivors benefits here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the decision of that court?  It could not have been 
closer, which is rather interesting.  It was a 5:4 split 
decision.  Five of the nine judges were of the view that the 
definition of spouse in the Old Age Security Act contravened 
section 15(1).  Four of the judges felt that it was perfectly 
acceptable.  One of the five who felt that it contravened was 
prepared to use section 1 to permit the contravention.  Why? 
Because, he said, the “government must be accorded some 
flexibility in extending social benefits and does not have to be 
proactive in recognizing new social relationships”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Couple that with the majority decision, that is to say the 
decision of four of the nine judges.  There were no other 
groupings of judges in the Supreme Court of Canada in that case 
where four of the nine were agreed.  They said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marriage has from time immemorial been firmly grounded in our 
legal tradition, one that is itself a reflection of longstanding 
philosophical and religious traditions.  But its ultimate raison 
d'être transcends all of these and is firmly anchored in the 
biological and social realities that heterosexual couples have 
the unique ability to procreate, that most children are the 
product of these relationships, and that they are generally cared 
for and nurtured by those who live in that relationship.  In this 
sense, marriage is by nature heterosexual.  It would be possible 
to legally define marriage to include homosexual couples, but 
this would not change the biological and social realities that 
underlie the traditional marriage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The singling out of legally married and common law couples as the 
recipients of benefits necessarily excludes all sorts of other 
couples living together, whatever reasons these other couples may 
have for doing so and whatever their sexual orientation.  What 
Parliament clearly had in mind was to accord support to married 
couples who were aged and elderly, for the advancement of public 
policy central to society— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advancement of public policy central to society is to 
sustain the traditional definition of marriage, and this will 
erode it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Egan and Nesbit the Supreme Court of Canada has spoken. 
Activist judges in lower courts did not like the decision so 
Rosenberg in Ontario chose to ignore it and went right ahead and 
decided their own way, ignoring a higher court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government examined the Rosenberg decision, realized that it 
was more in thinking with what it wanted to do with its agenda 
and with the agenda of the justice department and chose not to 
appeal it, thereby legitimizing what I would argue is a 
questionable decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House to consider rejecting the paragraph 
as it now is for no other reason than the legally improper use of 
the word conjugal.  It will open up a Pandora's box of 
nightmares.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is rather 
odd that in debating a bill regarding the public service pension 
fund surplus we have to address the issue of same sex partners. 
Sometimes things are hard to explain, but this being said, we 
are going to have to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government should have settled the issue in a 
different way. 
It should have introduced a separate piece of legislation to 
settle the issue once and for all; otherwise there will always 
be a risk. No matter what kind of bills will be introduced in 
the House of Commons, someone could always introduce an 
amendment to clarify the same sex couple issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind it would have been a lot simpler for the government 
to settle this issue once and for all, and to proceed with the 
necessary changes following debate and discussions in the House. 
But instead it chose to take a piecemeal approach, which creates 
some distortions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give you another example I am more familiar with 
as Indian affairs critic. It was found that in the area of 
matrimonial property division in case of divorce there is no 
protection whatsoever for women living on reserve. So we 
wondered what to do about it. 
What happened is that we started seeing bills regarding native 
people being introduced in the House of Commons; Bill C-49 is a 
case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native women lobbied hard and managed to convince us, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, as well as other members who supported us, to 
add to Bill C-49 a new chapter dealing with the division of 
matrimonial property. We told the government “You would be well 
advised to introduce a specific bill to settle this problem 
regarding native women once and for all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a risk for the House. No matter what kind of bill 
concerning native people will come before the House, native 
women will want to add a section dealing with the problem they 
want to solve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to the bill before us today. 
It does not matter what bill is introduced in the House, there 
will always be someone who will want to debate indirectly the 
issue of same sex spouses and manage to introduce amendments to 
rectify the situation. So there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a great deal of debate would be saved if, once in a 
while, the government took the bull by the horns and resolved 
these problems once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are beginning to hear legalistic talk about the supreme court 
having ruled this, that or the other way. This shows some lack 
of courage on the part of governments. Instead of settling 
important issues through legislation, and through elected 
representatives, they often dictate our conduct by giving us 
lessons in common law or referring to the superior court, the 
provincial appeal courts or the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows a lack of courage on the part of the government, 
which avoids dealing openly with important issues, which drag on 
and will continue to drag on, despite all the debates we will 
have in this House. Yet, a specific bill would have allowed us 
to settle the issue once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate on a specific bill would probably have lasted quite a 
while, until the government decided to gag us. However, I 
believe that in the future it should be an option. If we want to 
bring a substantive solution to the issue of same sex spouses, 
the government should introduce a bill and amend the whole 
legislation in a way that would allow the House to apply a final 
solution instead of taking a piecemeal approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, what is the situation today? As I said earlier, there are 
distortions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who openly 
admitted he is gay, will probably be forced to vote against the 
bill. I cannot speak in his place, but when he spoke earlier on 
the motions in Group No. 1, he said this legislation was 
unacceptable. He tried to find a word to describe it that could 
be used in the House. All day long, words were used in debate 
like “abduction”, “piracy”, “raiding”, “misappropriation”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to avoid unparliamentary language. Still, 
this bill is unacceptable to the Bloc Quebecois, and I think it 
is unacceptable to all opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve intends to vote 
against this bill. The hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas said he 
would have voted against it too, if he had been here, but he is 
away on a mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the opposite situation. There are government 
members who find this bill acceptable and will vote for it, but 
they do not necessarily like the new definition of spouse and 
their only way out is to move amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the outcome of our discussion on the second 
group of motions will be, and I do not know how the vote will 
turn out. However, after listening to the previous speaker, I 
get the impression that this issue will more or less be 
considered a moral issue, and that we will have free votes. In 
our party, we are thinking about having a free vote on Group 
No. 2, so that members can express their own views, because this 
is a moral issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I did not choose homosexuality, but heterosexuality. 
Yet I am open-minded enough to understand there are other things 
that are important besides my own feelings. It is part of 
politics that our ideals and ideas may not prevail. In the end, 
we must sometimes recognize that certain things that are 
different from our own lifestyle can be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of the people who accept this.  Some of my good friends 
are homosexuals.  I have, in fact, made an effort to invite them 
over for a meal so that we could discuss these matters in depth. 
I am now perfectly capable of understanding that someone can 
have a life partner for 10, 15, 20, even 30 years.  There have 
been recent court decisions on a couple who had been together 25 
years, two people who loved each other deeply.  I feel that the 
surviving partner of a person who has worked in the public 
service is entitled to survivor benefits, even if he or she is a 
same sex partner.  That is, however, a completely personal 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have liked to see—and I shall close on this point—the 
federal government follow Quebec's example.  As recently as last 
week, Quebec announced that it would be introducing a bill to 
amend all of its legislation as far as this very issue of same 
sex partners is concerned.  That would avoid a great deal of 
debate, as I said at the start of my speech.  Then there would 
not have to be debate on each piece of legislation, as to 
whether to introduce a new definition of spouse or to stick to 
the traditional one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the Government of Quebec for having had the courage to 
do this.  The courts are not going to be the ones to decide 
whether the definition, as it stands, is legal or not.  The 
government will be undertaking a major change and a major 
cleanup of all its laws and regulations.  It will be holding a 
debate on whether we, as a society, are in favour of recognizing 
same sex spouses. 
It will adjust the whole parliamentary mechanism, regulations 
and laws, after the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, people will be able to have their say, and I hope 
that in Quebec City, as in Ottawa, if such a bill is ever 
introduced, the debate will go on as long as possible.  I think 
this is the sort of discussion where people should speak up, and 
the definition may be decided once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is such a debate, I would be pleased to rise and say 
something of what I have said today and we would thus avoid 
having to rise with each bill and say “The definition in the 
bill is not traditional, I object and move an amendment”.  That 
would save us a lot of discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the federal government to follow the example of 
Quebec and to settle once and for all the question on the 
merits, not only for same sex couples but, as I mentioned 
earlier, for native women who are living on reserves, and for 
the division of property.  We would do well to resolve this 
matter once and for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have another opportunity to speak to Bill C-78.  We 
have had precious few opportunities, given that the debate was 
shut down at second reading after only four hours and the 
committee hearings were stifled and curtailed to the point where 
we entertained very few witnesses, even though all of the 
opposition parties advocated hearing 40 to 50 witnesses and even 
taking the show on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this bill is so important we should be touring 
the country with it so that seniors would have an opportunity to 
make representation and to research it, as happened when the 
government tried to make changes to the seniors benefit when the 
guaranteed income supplement and the old age security were to be 
merged into one seniors benefit.  That was a huge, fundamental 
change in the way we deal with retirees and senior citizens in 
this country.  To its credit, the government went on the road. 
There was a huge touring task force which heard from people from 
all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction and the very predictable consequence was that 
seniors mobilized.  They got active and they mobilized their 
opposition to a huge degree and the government had to back off. 
Presumably the reason the government is closing debate on this 
bill is because it does not want the same thing to happen again. 
The Liberals know they are on shaky ground and they know that the 
public outrage is only starting to build momentum.  In the last 
few weeks the public has had time to start to research the bill 
and to send newsletters to the memberships of their organizations 
to get seniors motivated and active in opposition to this bill. 
I predict that had they let democracy take its course, we would 
have seen a huge backlash, a huge outcry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think any government should be very cautious about taking on 
senior citizens.  A government would have to be crazy to mobilize 
a fair fight against the seniors' movement because seniors are 
well informed, they are well read and they are well organized. 
We cross them at our peril if we are fighting a fair fight. 
However, the government clearly is not because it has taken away 
any opportunity for seniors or their elected representatives to 
raise all of the issues that are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From day one I have maintained— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
know that the CLC convention was very important, but the 
committee was available and hearing witnesses while the member— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is not a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That certainly is 
not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for that ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said from day one that Bill C-78 is an extremely 
complicated bill that has profound and precedent setting public 
policy implications.  The debate we have heard in the last hour 
and the amendments we have been debating point out that this bill 
is not only about the pension plan or the new public sector 
pension investment board, it goes far beyond that.  The 
government, in a cynical way I would argue, has tried to 
introduce the concept of same sex spousal benefits.  That is 
something I am personally in favour of and have lobbied long and 
hard for, but the government slipped it in with another package 
which makes it very difficult for people who are interested in 
both issues.  They are finding a bit of a contradiction in terms 
of being able to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member of our caucus has dedicated half of his life to fight 
for same sex benefits and all of those rights and he is being put 
in the uncomfortable position of having to vote against this bill 
because he is so obviously against the financial aspects of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the debate we have heard dealing with the group 2 
amendments mystifies me because we are hearing from a group of 
people who seem to feel somehow that by giving rights to one 
group of people that will diminish their rights, as if rights 
were a finite pie and if one group has too many they are going to 
have to take less.  I disagree with that point of view.  It has 
always been my position that if we give full rights to everyone, 
all of our rights are enhanced, not diminished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that many of the amendments in group 2 find 
their origins in some not too thinly veiled homophobia.  I am not 
comfortable at all with some of the things that we have heard in 
this room today.  I wish people would take a more generous point 
of view.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some of the issues that were raised are quite 
legitimate.  Using the word conjugal as the test for 
cohabitation, or whether one will be able to give survivor's 
benefits to another person, has to be looked at a lot more 
seriously.  We will not have time to do that.  I will have three 
or four minutes to speak about it and then I presume the House 
leader on the other side will come rushing in to move closure on 
the debate and the whole thing will be put to bed, if you will 
excuse the pun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think conjugal is any kind of a test.  There are other 
living arrangements that come up from time to time when people 
cohabit and do not have a conjugal relationship and we should be 
able to assign survivor's benefits to that partner as well, 
whether it is to a brother or a sister who might share the same 
home and so on.  There are many aspects to it that we need to 
investigate.  Again it is sad that we will not have time to 
debate properly this important, precedent setting public policy 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government come in through the front door, honestly, 
with a bill dealing with the thorny issue which has been 
surfacing year after year of same sex benefits, we could have had 
an honest debate and really dealt with it in the way that it 
deserves to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about seniors groups.  One of the groups that was most 
disappointed about closure and not having an opportunity to deal 
with this at committee properly was the largest group of retirees 
and senior citizens involved with the public sector, the federal 
superannuates national association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That group was notified the night before the committee hearing. 
It represents hundreds of thousands of superannuates.  The night 
before it was to appear it was given the 200 page tome.  Even the 
clerk of the committee, when he gave me my copy of Bill C-78, 
said it was weighty tome.  Those were the terms he used.  We 
could hardly lift it.  It is the size of the Manhattan phone 
book.  Those people had 12 hours to prepare their remarks on 
behalf of all of the people they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary thinks there was adequate time.  The 
whole committee, on the Liberal side at least, made it clear that 
they did not really need to hear a lot of witnesses; two or three 
unions maybe, two or three actuaries and a couple of people 
involved in public sector pension plans would be adequate for 
this huge, precedent setting piece of legislation.  I cannot say 
strongly enough how much I disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not get a chance to go into some of the jurisprudence 
involved with public sector pension plans which are silent on the 
issue of what to do with a surplus.  We never got a chance to 
wrestle with that issue or even to look at recent cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example comes to mind, that being when Ontario Hydro wanted 
to take a contribution holiday because it had a surplus and CUPE, 
the union representing the workers, to its credit, took Ontario 
Hydro to court.  The courts backed up the union's position that 
the employer did not have an exclusive right to the surplus of 
the plan, even it is a defined benefit plan.  The money, in this 
case, was split evenly.  The employer received some money and 
some of the money went to increase benefits.  That kind of an 
equitable settlement, whether by arbitration or by some court 
ruling, is something that would have satisfied the people 
involved in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments that has been put forward argues quite 
capably that the government should live up to its own 
legislation, which would be the federal Pension Benefits 
Standards Act.  Under that act any plans operating under federal 
jurisdiction would require two-thirds of the members of the plan 
to vote in favour of using any of the pension surplus for 
anything at all.  The government's own bill, which recently 
received royal assent in 1998, calls for the beneficiaries of the 
plan to have a say in the allocation of any surplus.  I would 
hope that at least that amendment would carry when this comes to 
a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not have enough time to adequately go through the many, 
many issues in this complex piece of legislation because the 
government will move closure again.  It is a disservice to all 
the people who are involved in the plan and all the survivors who 
collect benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
regret that we again do not have enough time allocated to debate 
a very important piece of public policy, Bill C-78, which deals 
with several issues that are of great importance to Canadians, 
including the ones we are dealing with in this group of 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of same sex benefits, whether it is in the public 
service or the private sector, has been an issue that has 
developed over a period of years.  I would remind members of the 
House that the supreme court has been consistent in its 
interpretation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
which protects the rights of all Canadians.  That is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to remind ourselves as members of the House 
that we were elected to represent and defend the rights of all 
our constituent and to protect the rights of all Canadians.  That 
is not simply the groups of Canadians that we tend to agree with 
or the groups of Canadians that we feel live in a lifestyle that 
we happen to support.  We were elected to support and represent 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some suggest, this is not an issue of the redefinition of the 
family.  This is not about the redefinition of marriage.  This is 
simply an issue of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some people who use the phraseology “family values”. 
Family values should be an intrinsically positive phrase. I think 
every member of the House believes very strongly in the benefits 
of a supportive, close-knit family, a nurturing family that 
provides support and encouragement throughout one's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about defending the family, defending family 
values, defending the principles of support and that type of 
important nuclear relationship that can exist within a family, we 
should be encouraging all Canadians to live in the types of 
unions that provide them with that level of support throughout 
their lives.  If we are serious about it, we should be 
encouraging not discouraging Canadians to live in those types of 
relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, family values is used by some members of the 
House as a euphemism for discriminatory policy against one group 
or another.  Although some would argue that when we extend rights 
or protect the rights of some we diminish the rights of others, 
there is absolutely no precedent in history to that effect.  A 
significant number of precendents have been set throughout 
history showing that when we fail to protect the rights of one 
group we imperil the rights of all groups collectively.  It is 
very important for all of us in the House to defend the rights of 
all the people we represent and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-five per cent of Canadians support human rights 
legislation to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination 
based on sexual orientation.  The supreme court has been 
consistent in its interpretation of the charter of rights.  There 
is currently a federal legal challenge that was initiated in 
January 1999 to force the federal government to recognize same 
sex benefits within the public service. The PSAC union has 
represented the interests of its members in this case in support 
of the extension of same sex benefits, particularly relative to 
survivors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is not dissimilar to the debate that I believe 
existed at some point relative to common law spouses and an 
extension of survivor benefits to common law spouses that has 
taken place in the House.  We have seen how that has evolved. The 
family has evolved and there is a more flexible definition of the 
family in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can have two individuals working for the public service who 
perhaps work in the same job category or even in the same office 
with desks next to each other. 
One person is in a heterosexual marriage, works for the 
government for 10 years and then dies.  The survivor benefits, 
based on what he or she has paid into the pension plan, will be 
there for his or her survivor. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the other case, the second individual could be gay or lesbian 
and living in a long term supportive relationship with 
dependants.  He or she may also have worked in the same job over 
a period of 10 years.  However, if something happens to this 
person, the spouse will be denied benefits despite the fact that 
both the first individual and the second individual paid taxes 
and both paid identically into the public service pension plan. 
This is a clear case of where the government needs to ensure that 
this discriminatory policy is not permitted. Canadians do not 
want a discriminatory policy to be part of our public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations, not just government, have been proactive in terms 
of providing these types of benefits.  I will list a few of the 
corporations, universities and provincial governments that have 
moved in this direction:  3M; A & W Canada; Air Canada; Air 
Ontario; BC Telecom; Bank of Nova Scotia; Bank of Montreal; IBM 
Canada; Chrysler Canada; General Electric; Levis Strauss; London 
Life; McMillan Bloedel; Sears; Stentor Resources; and 
Toronto-Dominion Bank.  I think part of the reason for this move 
is from the legal perspective that there is no choice. We do have 
a charter of rights and freedoms in Canada that was put in place 
to protect the rights of all Canadians.  The supreme court has 
been consistent in its interpretation of that charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do resent the fact that the government has not allowed proper 
debate and discussion on this very important issue and has 
slipped this into another piece of legislation.  The government 
has pitted members of parliament, whose views on these issues 
have been very clear for some time, against something they 
believe in.  It is unfortunate because this is a fundamental 
issue of fairness.  Fairness is a tenet of Canadian policy, not 
just Canadian social policy but of what it means to be a 
Canadian, our determination as Canadians to stand up and defend 
the rights of minorities and of those who are being persecuted, 
not just within Canada, but anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are known around the world through our peacekeepers and 
through our foreign policy initiatives as a country that stands 
up to defend the rights of all peoples.  Yet within our own 
country we still have intrinsically discriminatory policy within 
the legislative framework.  The government has moved to address 
this, but I do not believe that it has acted appropriately in 
terms of providing this as part of a very comprehensive piece of 
legislation that will effectively pit members of parliament, who 
may agree with some elements, against the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polling is supportive of the extension of same sex benefits. 
However, I would never argue that we should use polls to 
determine policies on minority rights.  Populism is not the 
proper means through which to develop minority rights.  If in the 
U.S. polling had dictated what the leaders were going to do 
during the civil rights movement, the civil rights movement would 
not have moved forward.  Black Americans probably would not have 
been given the vote if polling had determined what the government 
was going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What defines the difference between politicians and political 
leaders is that politicians do what the polls tell them to do and 
political leaders do what is right.

the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation

<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to begin my speech today and I suppose 
I will be able to continue it the next time we resume. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly echo the sentiments that have been expressed by many 
members here today.  It is regrettable that we do not have an 
opportunity both to debate the issues that are before us in the 
House, but also to enter into a full debate with Canadians across 
the country, the people in our ridings.  We should be asking them 
how they feel about the pension plan, the allocation of the funds 
and the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we know the funds are there as a joint venture of 
contributions by the members who are in the pension plan and by 
the taxpayer as their employer, it is regrettable that the 
government chooses to simply take all of the money and not give 
back a part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting, for example, that we had a bill not long 
ago sponsored by the Minister of Finance in which the question of 
pension fund surpluses for the private sector came up.  In that 
legislation, an agreement had to be reached before the pension 
money could be divided up.  Clearly neither side would get 100% 
in that because the other side would not agree to it.  Why can we 
not have something like that here?  It is because the government 
is so stubborn that it will not consider that we need to debate 
and amend the bill so that it is consistent with the wishes of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the wishes of Canadians, I want to get to the topic 
of this particular group.  The amendments in Group No. 2 
primarily have to do with the definition of the surviving spouse. 
This is being changed in all of the acts which are affected by 
the superannuation procedures of the employees of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change in the definition of spouse just sweeps across a 
whole bunch of different acts in a very pervasive way.  I know 
there are some who will say that this is not what is being done 
here.  They will say that they are not changing spouse, they are 
just adding a definition of a survivor to it.  The fact of the 
matter is that it is effectively being changed.  This is quite 
contrary to the wishes of Canadians.  It is certainly contrary to 
the wishes of the people in my riding.  It is contrary to the 
wishes of people in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember shortly after the election in 1993 we had a debate in 
the House on a private members' motion.  The motion dealt 
specifically with benefits for partners in a same sex 
relationship.  The motion was soundly turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I see you are giving me a signal because it is 
5.30 p.m.  I presume I will be able to finish my speech when this

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 16 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on this motion.  I know the 
member for Yukon has worked very hard on raising the profile of 
this issue and adding to the very important debate in the House. 
She has also worked on talking to members across party lines 
about the need to get at the reality in a modern context in terms 
of a section of our current Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back in history is relevant to a discussion of this 
section of our code, which in essence had its history hundreds of 
years ago.  It was based on a concept of honour at a time when 
men could treat women as property, at a time when men could 
defend the honour of their children having been molested, 
specifically sons being sexually assaulted.  It has a historical 
context which in reality is not as relevant in today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a modernization.  When our Criminal Code was codified 
in 1892 this section was included.  There has been discussion 
over the years.  I believe this section should be looked at when 
we talk about the defences of provocation and self-defence. These 
two issues are linked in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 1998 the Minister of Justice had the Department of 
Justice start consultations across the land on this area of the 
law, this specific section.  They are still ongoing.  I believe 
that discussion is necessary.  When I originally looked at this 
section I thought it was fairly black and white and tended to 
agree with the hon. member who presented the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what I am hearing in my investigation is that some of 
the consultations are still ongoing and different groups are not 
reaching a consensus of opinion.  In other words, a process is 
under way that will address some of these issues.  I think that 
process has already shown—and I believe the Department of 
Justice and the Minister of Justice would agree—that some of the 
criticisms enunciated in the House and levelled at this section 
would be valid criticisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of <I>Hansard</I> and the previous hour of debate on the 
motion would also find that there are other views that raise 
different arguments in relation to this section.  The courts have 
been more likely to use this in a situation where instead of a 
man's ability for action, as in the argument of the hon. member, 
there is the passing of violence against an individual out of 
anger or frustration or a sense of honour that has been hurt in 
some way.  It is now the opposite.  It could be used more as a 
defence realistically when there is continuous provocation to 
such an extent that somebody loses actual control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complex area.  It is not simple.  It is certainly not 
black and white.  At the end of the day this is an area in which 
I welcome constant and continuing vigilance.  I would like to see 
some reform on this section.  I would also like to see that 
reform come at a time when the consultation process has been 
completed and all various options have been put on the table for 
us to evaluate together.  I would be supportive after hearing 
especially from the equality seeking groups across the land who 
are coming to the table and discussing this as the consultations 
go forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary that Canadians realize that just because 
something is old it is not automatically wrong. Something that 
has a lot of history can be looked at with an understanding that 
when we move to eradicate it, it could have repercussions or 
different ramifications in areas which have not yet been thought 
of.  Some of the self-defence now is more likely for instances 
where women are responding in a loss of control to a situation 
where over a long period of time there has been assault by men 
against women in a household and someone loses control for a 
moment and acts out of anger.  I could see that happening if 
anyone came across someone attacking a child of ours or a child 
of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not excuse violence.  We should never excuse violence, 
but I think there has to remain some flexibility of an 
understanding that human beings are fallible.  I would certainly 
want a very high test level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our review of the cases in this section that in some cases 
the judge felt this defence was not available.  It really is case 
dependent, factual dependent.  It provides for a level of 
flexibility in our criminal law, but it is one of those areas 
where there is no excuse for violence.  If we go from that 
position, I think there is a lot of value in laying this issue 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for her work on the motion.  I would 
look forward to a time where I could stand in the House and 
support a bill that would modernize this situation.  Before I do 
so, as I say, in fairness to all potential situations I would 
want to have all options laid before me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge those conducting the consultation process inside the 
Department of Justice that if it is being done at a pace which 
has not been as rapid as it could be, this motion gives some 
emphasis to pushing the process along so that we can come to a 
point within parliament where we can be looking at modernization 
of the particular section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to prolong this debate by repeating myself.  I 
think I have laid where I stand clearly on the table.  It is from 
a viewpoint of not trying to sit on the fence but just saying at 
this point in time I will not support the motion because I do not 
feel that the consultation process has been finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at this stage glad that there is one in place. I would like 
to hurry that process along so that at a future date within this 
session of parliament I would hope we could be looking at the 
issue and seeing at that stage where informed decision making 
should stand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Motion No. 265 
which calls for a legislative committee to be established to 
prepare and bring in a bill in accordance with Standing Order 
68(4)(b) to abolish the legal defence of provocation contained in 
section 232 of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yukon has been forthright in stating the genesis 
of this motion.  I can understand how she may be motivated by the 
tragic case of Susan Klassen who died at the hands of her 
husband. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface it seems easy to remedy a situation of this 
nature.  It is quite human to perhaps strike out and fix it in 
one fell swoop.  I regret I cannot subscribe to one fell swoop. I 
cannot support the outright abolition of section 232 of the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, section 232 has remained virtually unchanged 
since 1892 which to some may say it is time for a change.  On the 
other hand everything old is not necessarily out of date.  Also 
as I understand it, in criminal justice judges and the courts 
apply certain flexibilities and interpretation which help to keep 
the Criminal Code a fluid document.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Yorkton—Melville has so cogently pointed 
out during earlier debate, the application of the defence of 
provocation has not remained static.  He went on to say that many 
cases before the courts set legal precedents to determine the 
sufficiency of evidence to raise the defence, the nature of the 
object of test of the term ordinary person, the instructions or 
charges of the jury, the applications of this defence to 
attempted murder, the definition of self-induced provocation, and 
constitutional considerations.  In short, section 232 has been in 
constant scrutiny, interpretation and change.  This is good.  It 
says the law is not static. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers to the bill have spoken about the complexity 
and controversial nature of section 232, but that in itself 
should not lead to abolition.  As the section reads, culpable 
homicide may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who 
committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden 
provocation.  For the provocation defence to be successful, there 
must be a wrongful act or insult.  The act must be sufficient to 
deprive an ordinary person of self-control.  The accused had to 
act in the heat of passion.  There had to be no time for the 
accused to cool down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be quite a comprehensive set of guidelines and 
despite the complexity there seems to be enough caveats to ensure 
it passes some sort of litmus test for its use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that if the defence is successful it does not 
mean the accused walks.  In fact he or she can still be convicted 
of manslaughter and face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
Nevertheless certain cases have given rise to concerns regarding 
this section and it is currently under review by the justice 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998 a discussion paper on provocation was released by 
justice.  It was to form the basis of a public consultation.  At 
this point submissions by groups and individuals are still being 
reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discussion paper asks the public for input on nine options 
with respect to the defence of provocation.  Allow me to identify 
these options:  to abolish the defence of provocation, to reform 
the defence of provocation by removing the phrase in the heat of 
passion, to replace the term wrongful act with unlawful act, to 
remove the ordinary person test to reflect the mix 
subjective-objective test, to reform the defence of expanding the 
suddenness requirement, to reform the defence so that it is not 
available in a case of a spousal homicide, to reform the defence 
so that it is not available in a case where the victim asserts 
his or her charter rights, to reform the defence to limit it to 
situations where excessive force was used in self-defence, and to 
leave the Criminal Code provisions on the provocation defence 
exactly as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask whether these options as a result of input gathered by the 
department have been reviewed sufficiently as the causes to 
abolish section 232.  I think not and I think the abolition 
option is a bit premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the issue of provocation defence has taken on a 
singular gender oriented, one dimensional focus.  As was stated 
in the government's discussion paper, the defence of provocation 
might be useful for women in situations of domestic violence who 
kill in self-defence but with excessive force in response to 
physical or verbal abuse.  It seems to me it would be dangerously 
presumptuous to expunge section 232 before we at least review the 
options in a lot more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must agree with the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, formerly a crown prosecutor, who 
cautioned against taking a single case in isolation and using it 
as a motivation to entirely change the law.  If this were the 
only mitigating factor to amend a section of the Criminal Code, 
we could find one case for each section of the Criminal Code and 
have a Criminal Code in perpetual motion and change.  This seems 
a bit frivolous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice is now reviewing the options which in 
the final analysis we hope will lead to a consensus of the view 
of interested parties.  Perhaps we should conclude that review 
and see what the justice department has to say before we go 
headlong into a complex area of law with interconnecting elements 
in other sections of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not fighting a change by opposing Motion No. 265.  I am 
opposing precipitous change, premature change, and change to suit 
just one case.  This is not how our Criminal Code evolved.  I do 
not support incomplete review.  Let us face it.  Too often 
politicians are accused of acting before we think.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not diminishing the passion and legitimate concern that the 
member for Yukon brings to this issue.  It is a commendable 
initiative, but I am sensitive to quantum change before the 
department review is complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of evidence that section 232 continues to serve 
the criminal justice system with merit in rendering justice.  I 
suspect we could all pick one case where we feel some section of 
the code has been negligent or deficient.  There is a process in 
our criminal justice system, by way of the courts, to deal with 
these situations.  I do not feel that we are at a point where we 
should abandon section 232.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak to Motion M-265 introduced by 
the NDP member for Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the motion because it is important to know what it 
is all about when listening to a speech. It says this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a legislative committee be established to prepare and bring 
in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 68(4)(b), to 
abolish the legal defence of provocation contained in Section 
232 of the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the motion calls for the establishment of a legislative 
committee, one must ask a fundamental question right from the 
start: should we maintain or abolish the defence of provocation 
contained in section 232 of the Criminal Code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yukon already had the opportunity to give her 
point of view on this question. The wording of her motion leaves 
no doubt as to her goal, namely to strike down section 232. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first hour of the debate she clearly explained why 
she is seeking to have it struck down. No matter how legitimate 
her reasons are, the question remains: should we or should we 
not abolish section 232? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer this question properly, one must understand what the 
defence of provocation is all about, carefully choose one's 
arguments, and not get carried away. 
It is really well defined in Quebec and Canada's jurisprudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote Mr. Justice Irénée Lagarde, the author of several 
criminal law papers, who gave the following definition of the 
defence of provocation. I will read it because it contains all 
the significant elements: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provocation consists of one or several unfair acts by the victim 
against the accused, or one or several insults hurled by the 
victim at the accused, these acts or insults being of such a 
nature as to deprive an ordinary person of his or her 
self-control and push the accused to act in anger, in the heat of 
the moment, and before being able to calm down. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a lengthy definition, but it is extremely clear and it 
contains all the elements the accused must prove to be able to 
use the defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria are very strict. In fact, it must be said that in 
the majority of cases that went to trial, the criteria set out 
in section 232 were not met and, therefore, the judge did not 
allow the accused to use the defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, it must be said also that, contrary to 
self-defence, the defence of provocation cannot lead to an 
acquittal. It can only reduce the charge. It is only after the 
crown has proven all the elements of the offence that the 
accused can present such a defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have widely interpreted the terms of section 232 to 
establish a series of objective tests that are easy to apply. 
These tests determine if indeed, under the circumstances, an 
individual acted under the impulse of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accused must prove, among other things, that his or her 
behaviour was caused by sudden provocation that would deprive an 
ordinary person of the power of self-control. The supreme court 
has stated that the reasonable criteria required under section 
232 calls for a test that takes into account not only the 
characteristics of the provocation, but also the characteristics 
of the person who was the object of such provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court has determined that jealousy and admission of 
adultery are not sudden provocation under section 232. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, drunkenness was not considered a relevant element 
to determine if the criterion of “reasonable person” is met 
under the objective test of section 232. Indeed, someone who 
easily loses his temper or is intoxicated with alcohol could not 
invoke provocation as a defence. Those who are said to have a 
short fuse when provoked cannot use the defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it appears clearly from section 232 that the accused 
must not have taken time to think before committing the fatal 
act. Case law confirms that if the accused has had the time to 
cool off, he will not be allowed to use defence of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, for the accused to be allowed to benefit from section 
232, the victim must not only have tried to provoke the accused 
but the latter must also actually have been provoked. In other 
words, the accused must have totally lost self-control. This is 
even one of the arguments that judges use in similar cases. If 
the accused has taken time to think, he will not be accused of 
manslaughter but of murder and the defence of provocation will 
not be allowed by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislator also deemed it appropriate to indicate that there 
is no provocation if the victim is only exercising a legal right 
in reaction to the behaviour of the accused. For instance, a 
person accused of sexual abuse cannot invoke the defence of 
provocation because the victim hit him to defend herself. The 
victim has a legitimate right to defend herself. She can plead 
self-defence. 
The victim has defended herself and the accused cannot plead 
that the death of the victim, if there is a death, is the direct 
result of provocation on her part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the defence of provocation is not easily 
used. It cannot be used easily and one has a very objective test 
to meet before a judge accepts or refuses it. However, the hon. 
member has every right to condemn what appears prima facie to be 
unjust, that is allowing a guilty person to benefit from a 
reduced sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, we can easily understand why section 232 of the Criminal 
Code raises concerns among people. It is absolutely normal for 
people to ask why favours should be granted to individuals who 
have been found guilty of murder, because this is where the 
defence would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 232 of the Criminal Code must not be seen as a sop to 
criminals.  Criminal law condemns antisocial behaviour.  The 
Criminal Code identify actions that do not meet with the 
community's approval.  It must not be forgotten that these 
actions are committed by men and women, human beings with 
changing moods who are subject to intense emotions and who 
sometimes act instinctively and in the heat of the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it would be far too easy to argue that people who commit 
crimes of passion should be completely exonerated because it is 
sometimes normal to react without thinking.  That is why section 
232 of the Criminal Code provides for a reduced sentence rather 
than acquittal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, while it is important to consider the relevance of 
section 232, I do not think we should abolish it as Motion M-265 
proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence of provocation is an extremely complex process, 
which may be justified in the context of a free and democratic 
society.  This does not exclude, however, the fact that we must 
be sensitive to its overuse.  At the moment, however, as I have 
said, the judges are making very limited use of it.  An 
objective test is applied rigorously by all the courts.  I think 
our judges are sufficiently on the watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is enough jurisprudence and doctrine in this regard to 
make good use of this defence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Yukon concerning the legal defence of provocation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that as we move into the 21st century and we progress 
as a race we need to constantly question and be willing to change 
the rules that we use to govern and create order within our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As times change, we too need to change to reflect upon the 
current needs in our society.  Refusal to change outdated ideas 
and practices will only result in societal stagnation that will 
be of benefit to no one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code is a document that is not immune to such push 
for change.  Certain sections of the Criminal Code are quite old. 
Thus, it could be argued that they are in need of change. 
However, the PC party's position concerning Motion No. 265 is 
that there is no justification for throwing out the entire law 
simply because of a few unpopular sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code, in all of its sections, however old they may 
be, is written in such a way as to allow for judicial 
interpretation.  At first glance sections of the Criminal Code 
may seem to be outdated, yet when subjected to judicial 
interpretation they are brought up to speed in any number of ways 
that will allow the judge to ensure that justice prevails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Detractors may argue that problems arise in judicial 
interpretation that allow for decisions such as the B.C. court 
ruling which allowed the possession of child pornography.  This 
of course was an issue which our party opposed.  However, I am a 
firm believer in the system and, thus, I am confident that the 
judges of the supreme court will correct this ruling and protect 
the rights of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code is the written reference by which we as 
Canadians conduct ourselves.  It is the guideline for our 
society, for a safe and orderly environment.  It is true that the 
Criminal Code is not perfect, as it was made by man, yet to allow 
the dissolution of an entire law simply to appease the demands of 
special interest groups would set a dangerous precedent that 
could lead to constant band-aid solutions to very specific 
problems.  The overspecification of this law would limit judicial 
interpretation of the code when dealing with future cases. 
Constant change could lead to the eventual dismantling of the 
Criminal Code, placing public protection in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has asked for commentary on the issue 
of the defence of provocation, self-defence and defence of 
property.  Concern over this issue of the defence of provocation 
stems from societal progress.  In the 1990s critics feel that 
this section of the Criminal Code promotes outdated values and is 
used to defeat modern egalitarian principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the Criminal Code allows for the defence of 
provocation, but in recent years the nature and even the 
existence of the law has been the object of more and more 
criticism.  Moreover, the successful use of the defence in a 
number of well publicized cases has raised public concern, 
especially about whether the law is in fact condoning violence. 
I am referring to the Department of Justice report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe for a moment that the law is condoning 
violence.  In fact the law is protecting those who find 
themselves in a condition of mental anguish.  This horrible 
condition would stem from such unspeakable situations as mental, 
physical and emotional abuse.  These people will sometimes reach 
a point of distress where they cannot be held responsible for 
their actions when defending themselves from an abusive attack. 
The Criminal Code can protect these people if it remains in its 
current form, where non-partisan judges can interpret the code 
and hand down a decision that will address the needs and concerns 
of modern day society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues of self-defence and defence of property have also been 
singled out for change.  Even critics believe that judicial 
interpretations of the law of self-defence have evolved 
considerably to reflect the modern values in our society, yet 
they feel the Criminal Code provisions remain complex and 
confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this law the hon. member would like to make 
individual rights paramount because anyone who mentions the 
charter of rights and freedoms is seen as a champion of the 
people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has expressed that when dealing with 
proposed changes to the Criminal Code section on the legal 
defence of provocation it must be remembered that any proposals 
for law reform must be consistent with the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.  However, if one gets bogged down with the 
issue of individual rights it is easy to forget the rights of the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, if Canadian society allows itself to make 
sweeping changes to the Criminal Code to appease the concerns 
arising from individual cases then the Criminal Code will 
constantly be at the mercy of popular will of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The popular will of the day does not take into account the 
rights of minorities.  The popular will of the day does not allow 
for unpopular individual judicial decisions, even if these 
decisions will have a positive effect on the greater good of 
society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps such foresight requires the years of training and 
non-partisan conduct that we see in the judicial system.  Judges 
have the wisdom from years of service.  They have the knowledge 
of legal precedence.  They have non-partisan opinions to allow 
for the proper interpretation of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with the defence of provocation the Department of 
Justice report states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—defence of provocation is made available to excuse outbursts of 
violence in response to non-violent as well as violent acts is 
considered by many to be a fundamental shortcoming in the law of 
provocation.  Many critics claim that this assumption is based on 
a model of male aggression that is no longer 
appropriate...provocation provides an example of the law's 
failure to grapple with the problem of male anger and violence 
against women in the domestic sphere...The law of provocation 
focuses on the behaviour of the victim, whose behaviour does not 
have to be unlawful or even deliberately insulting so long as it 
is characterized as wrongful in the prevailing cultural climate. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues dealing with the legality involved in the interaction 
between men and women is in a constant state of flux as society 
works toward the creation of a level playing field.  Thus we can 
either change the law as frequently as society changes or we can 
rely on our capable male and female judges to interpret the 
current law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the justice department states that the purpose of 
our criminal justice system is to protect and ensure the safety 
and security of all members of Canadian society.  The Criminal 
Code sets out legal limits on behaviour by describing criminal 
offences such as assault and murder.  No less important, the code 
also sets out certain defence that may be used by accused persons 
to excuse or justify their behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the law of the land.  It is an effective law because it 
allows for our honourable judicial system to interpret the code 
and make decisions which effectively apply in varying and 
multifaceted cases that the courts would see in a such diverse 
multicultural country.  Allowing for changes in the Criminal Code 
is a simplistic and potentially dangerous solution to a very 
complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have faith in the judicial system and not throw out 
the law simply because of individual cases that may gain popular 
support at a given time.  In the case of unpopular judicial 
decisions which the public may feel are unjust the principals 
always have the opportunity for appeal.  Therefore the PC Party 
does not support the abolition of the Criminal Code section 
allowing for the legal defence of provocation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read some paragraphs regarding two cases.  These 
will illustrate the reasons the hon. member for Yukon brought the 
motion forward.  Listeners may want to turn off their television 
sets because it is not very pretty: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion came on the heels of the Klassen trial's outcome. It 
involves a murder that took place in Yukon and had outraged 
Yukoners and Canadians nationwide.  The main cause of this public 
outcry in the Klassen case was the injustice of the sentencing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what the hon. member for West Nova said was 
there to protect us.  It continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ralph Klassen who openly admitted to having strangled his wife 
(Susan) to death when she tried to end the marriage, was 
sentenced to only five years in prison.  He was charged with 
manslaughter.  This lowered his sentence to five years, or less 
if he gets parole.  Unfortunately there is no lack of examples 
which resemble the Klassen case where a person kills another 
human being and receives minimal punishment.  One may recall the 
B.C. case involving Bert Stone, a man who had stabbed his wife 47 
times, put her body in a toolbox and then went to Mexico for a 
month.  For this he received a sentence of four years in jail. He 
had been able to successfully prove that his wife had provoked 
this violent behaviour by verbal insults delivered over a four 
hour drive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a one sided debate.  The fact is this woman is dead.  She 
cannot rise from the dead and present her case to the courts. The 
courts have only one person's view on the evidence. The courts 
took it and gave the man four years in jail, which means with 
good behaviour he is out in a third. What kind of signal are the 
courts sending to women, to the defenceless, to seniors, and to 
young people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious by the tone of the other three opposition 
parties that the motion will not go very far.  The member for 
Yukon has raised the issue in the House exactly where it should 
be.  Laws in the country should be made through the legislative 
process, through parliament, for judges to interpret.  It is most 
unfortunate that the judges in these two particular cases, and 
there are other examples, have literally given people their 
walking papers after committing such violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Beaver Bank in my riding a gentleman has received numerous 
drunk driving charges.  I believe on his eighth one he was 
finally successful in killing someone, a young 18 year old woman 
who had her whole life in front of her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did he get?  It was the largest sentence ever handed out 
for a drunk driving charge: 8.5 years.  After only 18 months he 
was given three days of parole on the condition that if he were a 
good boy he would be allowed out.  This man received eight 
charges for drunk driving.  He received an 8.5 year sentence, the 
most ever in Nova Scotia, and after 18 months he got three days 
of parole.  Can we imagine what the parents of that child are 
going through?  Where is the justice in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to read a couple of other paragraphs to illustrate the 
point that my hon. colleague from Yukon is trying to get through. 
The first one reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major distinctions that can be seen for our society is 
the quest to preserve human life.  The defence of provocation 
came into being at a time when a life came second to an insult of 
honour.  This way of thinking may seem barbaric but this defence 
has been repeatedly used, even by recent killers to “get away 
with murder”.  In essence it is a licence for violence.  By 
abolishing this defence we would be sending out a clear message 
regarding murder.  Namely, that excusing murder has no place in 
our society and that violence cannot be used as a response to a 
non-violent act, a legal act or an insult. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the defence can be used in the interests of the 
killer to have a secure murder charge.  In this manner the murder 
charge can be lowered to manslaughter which carries no minimal 
sentencing time.  This leaves the sentencing of these crimes to 
the discretion of the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the matter of the definition of provocation as set 
out in section 232, which can be seen as forming the core of the 
defence of provocation.  It reads as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a wrongful act or an insult that is of a nature to be 
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of 
self-control.  This does not mean that the wrongful act or insult 
has to be illegal, simply that it was enough to cause someone's 
rage to explode and to strike out. It is arguable that no 
definition of insult or wrongful act can justify someone killing 
another even at the point of human weakness. 
Revisiting the Klassen case discussed at the beginning, the 
provocation of the husband was his wife was trying to leave the 
relationship.

probably a very valid one.  The paragraph continues:

she wanted to end the marriage and to move on with her life. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may point out that a person who is killed is not a special 
interest group.  A woman who is abused by her husband or by the 
system is not a special interest group.  The special interest 
group in this particular case, as my colleague from the 
Conservatives was mentioning in this case, is the murderers. They 
are the special interest group.  They are the ones who put 
forward their defence to the judges because the woman or the 
person they murdered is not there to defend themselves.  It 
continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how she phrased this, did she deserve to be strangled 
to death by her spouse?  Couples end relationships every day. 
This decision has become a common occurrence but killing a 
partner is not a natural outcome of this decision.  Killing due 
to racial slurs, homophobic tendencies or any other prejudice, 
however mean spirited, should not be enforced or supported in our 
criminal system.  By abolishing the defence of provocation there 
would be a concrete reinforcement of the notion that killing in 
retaliation is an illegal act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is there are too many objective elements in this 
defence, each of which is at the mercy of countless 
interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the case only brings forth the 
stories of the killers.  The courts only hear their version of 
what happened and how they were the victims of insults and 
wrongful acts and therefore forced to kill.  Imagine that.  They 
manage to turn it around and say they are the victims when in 
actuality the dead woman in this case is the real victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another side of the story remains silent as judges and juries 
decide if the killer will be forgiven for the murder and given a 
token prison sentence.  Let us vote to eliminate this unjust 
defence which promotes violence and inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to make a personal note and speak as the father of 
two young girls, a husband of a loving wife and a brother of four 
sisters.  The fact is that violence against women continues today 
as much as it always has.  Imagine standing in the House of 
Commons and honestly saying that he was a little ticked off, a 
little angry, but that was okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if the Littleton, Colorado, event happened in Canada as 
it did in Taber and the excuse used by the young killer was that 
they teased him and upset him?  Imagine if the judges said that 
was a valid defence and he received a minimal charge?  What would 
the parents of the victims say?  What message is being sent out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is correct when it says that defence issues and 
legal issues are very complex and cannot be based on emotional 
rhetoric.  I agree.  This is why the hon. member for Yukon has 
asked for a legislative committee to be established. Although her 
purpose is to get rid of the legal defence of provocation, she is 
a very reasonable, understanding and intelligent woman.  If the 
legislative committee agrees with certain changes to the act, she 
would support it because it would be an all party committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think how great it is that the hon. member for 
Yukon has raised this very serious issue in the House for debate 
so that it can be further debated within committee and within the 
justice department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Yukon for bringing Motion No. 265 to 
the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is fully aware of the criticisms of the 
law and the controversial cases that tend to promote public 
outrage.  My colleague across the way from Sackville—Eastern 
Shore gave us a few examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister accepts the merit of many of the criticisms and is 
committed to reforming the law of provocation.  Indeed the 
Department of Justice has been expending a lot of energy and 
resources reviewing the law, as was noted earlier, and exploring 
different options for addressing the concerns raised through 
consulting with very important groups such as the Law Reform 
Commission of Canada, individuals, and provincial and territorial 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice released a discussion paper on the law 
of provocation in the summer of 1998 which formed the basis of 
public consultations.  Abolition of the defence of provocation is 
one of the three options being considered by the department. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the consultation paper also focused 
on the law of self-defence which is integrally related to 
provocation as well as the defence of property. This consultation 
process is still under way and for this reason the minister 
cannot support this motion as it is worded at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Department of Justice has determined and as it has heard 
from many groups, this matter is very complex.  We see that in 
the comments made here in the House today.  Any change could 
clearly have a significant impact. As a result, the consequences 
of reform must be carefully considered before the best possible 
option is brought before the House for consideration in the form 
of a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the original defence of provocation was developed hundreds 
of years ago in England, it was founded on the social reality of 
the time that men could be partially excused for killing if in so 
doing, they were defending their honour either in the context of 
a spontaneous fight or upon discovery of their wives in the act 
of committing adultery, or discovery of someone in the act of 
sodomizing their son. The original defence was based on the 
concept of honour and in part on what is now clearly the 
discriminatory and offensive idea of male proprietary rights over 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provocation was actually relatively limited at that time.  It 
was only in the very precise circumstances I have just noted that 
the partial excuse could be raised because it was felt that 
although a provoked killer deserved to be convicted and punished, 
he did not deserve to be put to death, which was the penalty for 
murder at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada codified the criminal law in 1892, including the law 
of provocation, the partial excuse was expanded to allow for 
partial mitigation for a killing provoked by a wrongful act or 
insult which allowed for a vastly broader array of circumstances 
to amount to provocation that had been considered under the 
common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modern law is based on the rationale that the law should 
make some allowance for human frailty where a person is provoked 
beyond the ability to exercise self-control by an act or an 
insult that would have caused an ordinary person to also lose 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence is meant to provide a measure of compassion and 
flexibility where a person has killed while under extreme 
psychological or emotional stress or anguish.  It has built-in 
protections, such as the objective ordinary person test designed 
to ensure that a person is only excused for reacting to something 
that an ordinary person would also have reacted to.  The 
provocation must be something of such a nature as to be 
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of 
self-control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This assessment has to be made on the facts of each case. For 
instance, witnessing an attack on a person's child could be 
something sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power 
of self-control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The defence is no longer explicitly based on offensive and 
discriminatory notions of honour, or men's proprietary rights 
over women.  However, despite its modern rationale and built-in 
safeguards, it can certainly be argued that the modern defence 
has retained in part its profoundly inappropriate historical 
foundation, as seen by the way in which the defence has been 
applied and accepted by some courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the criticism of the hon. member for Yukon and 
others is that provocation gives a credit for angry violence, in 
particular violence by men against women and devalues human life 
by minimizing the seriousness of homicidal violence in response 
to common everyday and lawful acts such as leaving a 
relationship, insulting someone, or expressing a difference of 
opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This criticism is understandable. 
We have to question how effectively and fairly the law protects 
Canadians and what values the law is upholding when it discounts 
a killing simply because the killer was angered by the victim's 
words or gestures, or departure from a relationship, or even 
repeated nagging.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Yukon pointed out, killing in the 
domestic context should receive a stiffer penalty, not a more 
lenient one.  On this point, I would like to add that the 
government agrees and has enacted section 718.2 of the Criminal 
Code which specifically requires the judge to consider the abuse 
of a spouse as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Yukon was eloquent and indeed passionate in 
her criticisms of provocation in her speech introducing the 
motion. Again I congratulate her.  She focused our attention on 
the cases which cause the most trouble with the defence.  These 
problems cannot be ignored or overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the speeches of other hon. members reveal other sides 
to this debate.  We must also be clear that provocation is not 
accepted in every case in which it is alleged.  In many cases it 
is rejected by the judge and not even given to the jury to 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another hon. member who spoke to this motion mentioned, the 
defence has been virtually unchanged since 1892. A law of such 
long standing must be carefully studied before the House decides 
to abolish it since such a change could have many consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member pointed out that while some cases clearly 
illustrate a need to reform provocation, the defence of 
provocation provides a concession to human frailty that may be 
warranted or appropriate in certain other types of circumstances. 
The member also referred to the fact that provocation, like other 
laws, is subject to constant interpretation by judges who are in 
a very good position to shape the law based on actual cases and 
their perception of justice and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for open debate and caution cannot be overstated. While 
it may appear clear to some that the defence must be abolished, 
this view is not shared by everyone.  Some groups take the 
opposite position, recommending further expansion of the defence 
on the basis that human frailties should be recognized by the 
criminal law.  Others still would prefer to reform the defence in 
some way that it is not available in some types of cases, but it 
is still available in other circumstances where there was 
widespread agreement that a killing was partially excusable given 
some extreme provocation by the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even equality-seeking women's groups have changed their views 
about what to do with the defence of provocation in recent years. 
It is simply not the case that there is consensus as to the best 
course for reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, reasonable people disagree about the best possible 
solution and that is why the Department of Justice determined the 
best course of action was to proceed in the prudent manner which 
I have outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this is premature. I note the passion with 
which the member has presented her case but I think we should let 
the course of action as outlined continue.  Then appropriate 
amendments which would reflect the comments made in the public 
consultations can be brought forth to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I had 
the opportunity to listen to the debate from all the different 
parties this evening.  I have to admit it was one of those times 
when it seemed that there was a fair amount of thought and 
conscious effort made to consider the reasoning behind the motion 
put forth by my colleague from the Yukon.  That often does not 
happen in the House.  I am sure among ourselves we recognize that 
and I am sure Canadians recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my perspective on this, it was interesting to note that 
this was one time when I heard the Reform member talk about a 
need to be reasonable in the approach to justice issues and not 
jump on one incident. Often that is not the case with the Reform 
Party.  I was very conscious of the fact that there seemed to 
have been a little more in-depth feeling going into the remarks 
and consideration of the whole process of a justice bill or a 
justice motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned, it is very complicated.  We do not always 
see the whole picture as we discuss things in parliament, and 
Canadians do not get the whole picture with each case when they 
hear what the media has to say about it.  The sad reality of that 
is that Canadians have lost faith in the justice system. They 
have lost faith in the laws.  They see situations such as the 
Klassen case and hear what has happened. There seems to be no 
reasoning behind how someone can get away with that kind of an 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the hon. member from the Reform Party whose son 
was killed.  I understand his passion. How can he not want to see 
change so that kind of incident will never happen again? And 
rightfully so.  However, we need to be very conscience of all the 
ramifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that there is no faith in the Canadian 
justice system.  The delays with the justice department on a 
number of issues have resulted in that lack of faith when 
instances like the Klassen case come up.  Too often it becomes 
the case that offenders get out of jail ahead of time or are 
released and then they kill someone.  People are losing faith. 
When it takes time for a process to go through the justice 
department, the committees and everything else, it seems like 
these issues are always on the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had my colleague not brought this issue up, how many of us would 
have had any thought or discussion about it? How many Canadians 
would even hear about it?  It would sit in some committee or at 
some back door.  It would get a little bit of advertising that 
there was going to be a hearing here or there, but it would never 
ever get discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all the concerns that everybody has, it is extremely 
important that more emphasis be put on the issue.  The defence of 
provocation has been used in situations which are unconscionable 
to accept.  I was not going to mention the recent shootings but 
my colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore 
mentioned it.  It should not be perceived as being a crass 
portrayal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Littleton shootings were first mentioned I was 
conscious and very aware of the fact that so many of the students 
from that school stated their caring for the victims but also for 
the two young people who had committed the crime.  They stated 
their concern over the attack that had taken place, the name 
calling, the verbal things and that they were not a part of it. 
They were sorry they felt that way.  What my colleague mentioned 
is true. Are we accepting that as a defence of provocation?  It 
cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are faults within the system which have to be addressed. I 
want to thank my colleague.  I encourage the justice minister to 
ensure that more effort takes place and that there is speed in 
reviewing the defence and the whole issue. Canadians need to have 
faith in the justice system and the laws.  We are failing to give 
them that with the way things are happening now.

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to bring to the attention of the Minister of 
Transport again the Kelowna air traffic control tower which was 
deemed unsafe in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the Department of Transport report: 
“Due to the location and/or the height of the control tower, 
portions of the runway and taxiways are not visible.  Air traffic 
controllers are supposed to control the traffic on the runways 
that they cannot see”.  The inspector went on to say: “A runway 
encouraging going unnoticed is now a major safety concern.  The 
margin of safety has been jeopardized and restricted line of 
sight visibility is a major safety concern”. His manager said 
“The line of sight difficulties have been recognized as a 
problem at Kelowna and the problem must be addressed”.  This is 
dated November 4, 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we move to another Department of Transport report dated 
October 4, 1989. 
The Department of Transport then notified the manager of the 
Kelowna air traffic control tower that they were only allowed to 
operate on a temporary permit and that the waiver was conditional 
on tower replacement documentation being formulated. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, on September 21, 1989, another report was sent from the 
Department of Transport in Ottawa to the regional office in 
Vancouver, which brought up again the line of sight waiver at 
Kelowna airport and stated that it must be emphasized that clear 
lines of sight are of prime importance to the provision of safe 
air traffic control services and that this decision was being 
taken with much reluctance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Transport was saying that it was allowing the 
airport to continue operation with much reluctance.  It was 
saying that the waiver was conditional upon immediate action 
being taken to produce approval documentation for an appropriate 
tower replacement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was 11 years ago and still the tower has not been upgraded, 
addressed, repaired or replaced.  Since then new buildings have 
been built.  New hangars have been built surrounding it, blocking 
the runways even more, and traffic has increased dramatically. 
Not only has air traffic increased, but the planes are larger, 
creating more difficulties.  If it was not safe 11 years ago and 
nothing has changed, it cannot possibly be safe now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has proposed a video system such as that used by 
the Los Angeles airport.  This is the second time they will try 
this.  The first time they tried a video camera they put it in 
and it failed, so they took it out.  Now, because of the 
initiative of bringing up this old report, they are going to try 
it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect the effort to try to resolve the issue, but part of 
the reasoning they used in justifying the video cameras was that 
they are used at the Los Angeles international airport.  They 
have said this over and over again.  However, I talked to the air 
traffic controllers in Los Angeles and they do not use video 
cameras to see the runways.  They do have them, but they are for 
reference only.  At all times air traffic controllers at the Los 
Angeles airport can see the runways.  They cannot in Kelowna. 
They are two completely different situations.  The video cameras 
are for reference only and for parking on aprons in Los Angeles. 
In Kelowna they propose to use them for actual traffic control on 
the runways.  It is not the same thing and it is not safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the fact that video cameras have failed before, and 
considering that they are not used in Los Angeles for air traffic 
control, will the minister now commit that if the experiment with 
the video cameras does not work and the situation is not safe, as 
it has been deemed in these three reports, that a new tower will 
be constructed and the minister will take action to tell Nav 
Canada to stop the delays and to stop fooling around?  This is a 
safety issue.  Will he tell Nav Canada to put safety first and 
instruct it to build a new tower?

the air traffic control tower at the Kelowna airport.  I speak on 
behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, who is unavoidably absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize that Transport Canada no longer has an 
operational role with respect to the provision of air traffic 
control services in Canada.  Nav Canada is now responsible for 
those services, including the operation, location and 
construction of air traffic control towers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the House that Nav Canada applies air 
traffic control procedures to address visibility limitations such 
as those at Kelowna and Transport Canada is satisfied with the 
corporation's action to mitigate any potential safety risk until 
a more permanent solution is available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the airport operator is expanding 
the apron parking area.  Construction has begun and this will 
contribute to alleviating the obstruction of views caused by the 
parking of large aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the longer term, Nav Canada is continuing its efforts to 
install an effective video system and is commencing feasibility 
studies for the location of a new tower.

oversight and the hon. member may be assured that Transport
