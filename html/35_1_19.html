<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the Government to strike a Special Committee of the 
House, composed of representatives of all the official parties, with a mandate to 
examine public expenditures by the federal government, in light of the Report of 
the Auditor General of Canada, concerning overlap between federal and 
provincial government programs and in accordance with the following 
guidelines:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the Committee's deliberations would be an open and transparent process 
allowing for the public examination of official matters;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the Committee would have the power to subpoena any witnesses whose 
testimony would be considered helpful;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the Committee would be required to report to the House by June 23, 1994;</BLOCKQUOTE>

this Committee's Report by tabling in the House its response to the 
recommendations on the first sitting day after September 1, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie 
on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>Mr. Speaker, in accordance with Standing 
Order 43(2), I wish to bring to your attention that the Official 
Opposition members will share their time and make ten-minute 
speeches followed by five-minute periods for comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête: </B>Mr. Speaker, the Official Opposition is using the 
first business day of which it is controlling the agenda to deal 
with the issue of federal government expenditures. In doing so, 
we are responding to an expectation that was repeatedly 
expressed by the people during the election campaign. The 
urgency of the situation speaks for itself. The deficit is reaching 
a record high and is out of control to such an extent that, as a 
percentage of the gross national product, it is 63 per cent higher 
in Canada than the average in the G-7 countries.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Half of this deficit is due to structural problems. Canada's 
structural problems are legion and most of them are related to 
the very structure of our federalism. For instance, interference 
of the federal government in the areas of provincial jurisdiction 
as well as a loose definition of the jurisdictions of each of those 
levels of government lead to numerous duplications, a waste of 
energy and conflicting policies. Other structural problems 
simply reflect bad government managemnent or policies.
<P>
	For instance, Canada invests very little in research and 
development which is a major sector if we are going to try and 
meet the challenges of foreign competition. Furthermore, at the 
international level, Canada has a poor record on public debt 
management. In fact, since 1989, government expenditures in 
Canada have increased more rapidly than those of all G-7 
countries.
<P>
	According to the review of The Report of the Auditor General 
of Canada made by Mr. Yves Séguin, bad public expenditures 
management has resulted in a $5 billion loss each year for the 
past three years.
<P>
	Add to that the cost of overlappings. Sixty-seven per cent of 
the federal programs overlap provincial programs to a certain 
extent. They account for 65 per cent of all government 
expenditures, besides payments made for the public debt and 
unemployment insurance. For example, if Quebec took over the 
present federal programs and offered the same services, the 
savings would amount to $233 million for transportation and 
communication, $289 million for expenses related to collection 
of custom duties, income taxes and other taxes, and $250 
million in salaries, all that for one year and for Quebec alone.
<P>
	It can be reasonably estimated that just by eliminating 
duplication of services we would save two to three billion 
dollars. These figures are the financial result of duplications in 
the services provided by both governments, plus the increased 
need for co-ordination created by the claims of each 
government. The overlaps reduce the efficiency of government 
measures due to the competitive, if not conflicting, nature of 
federal-provincial relations. Witness the flag wars that have 
been waged by the two sides for the last 20 years.
<P>
	In June 1988, Quebec and Ottawa signed an agreement on 
regional economic development which was to result in an 
investment of $820 million over five years, divided as follows: 
Ottawa, $440 million, and Quebec, $380 million. Now, believe 
it or not, it took a little over two years for Ottawa and Quebec to 
agree on the programs and on their respective roles. Five years 
after this agreement was signed, the two governments had spent 
only $281 million, that is to say a mere 34 per cent of the $820 
million agreed to. This is a far cry from what was expected as the 
result of this allocation of funds.
<P>
	The overlapping of services also increases the burden on 
individuals and companies seeking access to the programs and 
services offered. A lot of energy is wasted just to find one's way 
through this regulatory and administrative maze. I think that 
since we have been elected, everybody realized that, because it 
took us a few months just to learn to know all the existing 
programs. As I said, we are wasting a lot of energy just to make 
our way through this administrative maze.
<P>
	When a firm wants to make a plan for the development of its 
human resources, for example, it has to convince both the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1153"> 1153 </A></B>
<P>
professional employees from the federal government and the 
people from the Société québécoise de la main-d'oeuvre in 
order for its employee  placement plan or employment 
assistance committees to be implemented. Small businesses 
often have to pass on to consumers the costs of the redundant 
representations they make to both governments. Without 
realizing it, consumers end up paying for the cost of federalism 
through an intermediary.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Keeping up with programs and services is in itself an 
important additional cost for individual businesses. 
Furthermore, the few sessions held by the industry committee 
allowed me to realize that it was a problem felt throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	An ENAP study found that out of a sample of 221 federal 
programs and 244 Quebec programs, 197 overlapped to various 
degrees and were seriously jeopardizing the efforts to enhance 
the management of government policies.
<P>
	For example, the following sectors, among the most 
depressed in the Canadian economy, accounted for more than 75 
p. 100 of all the program overlaps between the federal 
government and the Quebec government: fisheries, housing, 
education, secondary industries, financial markets, territorial 
management, labour and employment, and of course regional 
development.
<P>
	These overlappings also reduce the control citizens have on 
their government. As a result of this competition between 
governments, no government alone has the ability to carry out 
projects that have been undertaken, while allowing each 
governement to throw the ball back into the other's court.
<P>
	Citizens do not directly pay for the programs available to 
them and cannot avoid paying for a program which they feel is 
less satisfactory. What is ultimately questioned is the principle 
that a person who pays taxes has the right to be represented. 
Under the Canadian system, taxes paid to one government are 
often spent by another government, whose criteria do not 
necessarily coincide with the other's criteria. This may explain 
the lack of confidence voters have shown in the Canadian 
electoral system and their elected representatives.
<P>
	Competition between governments seldom improves the 
quality of the services they offer, because governments do not 
operate in the same way as the private sector. The constraints are 
not the same.
<P>
	The government's other objective is to deal with the poor 
management practices observed and criticized annually by the 
Auditor General of Canada. Horror stories aside, we should pay 
particular attention to the substantive recommendations made 
by the Auditor General. To ensure that the situation is corrected, 
we suggest a careful follow-up of these recommendations in 
order to return control over the budgetary process to Parliament. 
Members can then be heard before decisions are finalized and 
can influence those decisions, with the help of adequate 
information on the use of public funds by departments and 
Crown corporations.
<P>
	This year again, the Auditor General's report criticized 
departments for their lack of emphasis on program evaluation. 
In 1991-92, expenditures for 16 programs totalled $124.5 
billion, and only two of these programs were given a thorough 
evaluation.
<P>
	We cannot tolerate taxpayers' money being spent without an 
evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities 
involved. It is necessary to do the right thing and to do it right. 
One must be able to evaluate what is being done. On the basis of 
the information for 1991-92, the Auditor General observed that 
over a seven-year period, only 18 per cent of the programs had 
been evaluated.
<P>
	Considering the urgency and seriousness of the situation, the 
Bloc Quebecois is asking the government to strike a multiparty 
committee of the House of Commons with a mandate to examine 
all the government's operating budgets. The government must 
guarantee this review of government spending will be an open 
and transparent process.
<P>
	To ensure that the instruments required to provide for sound 
management of public spending are put in place, the government 
should undertake to react officially and promptly to the 
committee's recommendations.
<P>
	There are many avenues to explore, but for this exercise to be 
successful, parliamentarians must lead the way. Ministers, 
members, senior officials and all other players in the 
administrative apparatus must realize there is an urgent need for 
a change in attitude, from ``it does not matter, the government is 
paying'' to ``this is everybody's money and I must ensure it is 
used effectively''.
<P>
	By carefully examining operating budgets, we should be able 
to eliminate a number of obsolete programs that have continued 
to exist by sheer force of habit.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The most striking example is military expenditures. We 
approved the cancellation of the helicopter contract, but we 
believe the government is engaging in the same kind of 
non-productive expenditures by not transferring the 
high-technology jobs involved into a really comprehensive 
project and by letting them go instead, thereby increasing 
unemployment insurance costs.
<P>
	We think it would be possible to reduce defence expenditures 
by 25 per cent, that is an amount of $3 billion.
<P>
	Another example we should look at is the natural tendency to 
self-justification within the bureaucratic machine. The first 
thing that comes to mind is the considerable amount of energy 
and resources spent for the preparation of perfect forms and 
detailed instructions, even before anyone knows who the users 
will be. Please let us not put the blame on those who already 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1154"> 1154 </A></B>
<P>
have trouble enough surviving the financial crisis; they are only 
the victims.
<P>
	On that point, tax expert Yves Séguin said that the fat in social 
programs was much leaner than the fat on the other side; that 
there were more savings to be made by curbing waste than by 
cutting social programs because, except in cases of gross abuse, 
these are not overly generous in the first place.
<P>
	Why is the Bloc Quebecois putting so much energy in this 
fight against waste if it wants Quebec to redefine its relationship 
with Canada? Simply because it is the wish of everybody in this 
country and particularly of taxpayers who pay their income tax 
regularly and keep the system going. But also because Canada 
and Quebec cannot look ahead to any kind of future if they do 
not succeed in curbing that monster the federal system helped 
create.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on his topic for today. 
However I would like to remind him as well that we all have 
great concern and have campaigned on the elimination of waste 
to save Canada for us all.
<P>
	It was this government that campaigned on the elimination of 
the helicopter project. I wonder if the member's remarks are 
geared to the government of today or the government of 
yesterday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply, I will say that the 
elimination of waste was part of our platform too. Where we 
differ is in the sources of such waste, as was demonstrated by the 
way Quebecers voted. A federalist party is of course bent on 
trying to improve the system to make it better.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have reached the conclusion that the solution 
was no longer to improve the system but rather to significantly 
alter it. In Quebec, we have lived the overlapping problem in a 
very different manner, because of our specific characteristics. 
This aspect was never dealt with in a realistic or concrete 
manner in this House, leaving the problem unsolved. We believe 
that it is because there has never been in this House members 
whose sole interests were those of Quebec; often, people were 
held back by their federalist vision, and their commitment to 
federalist principles.
<P>
	As far as the helicopters are concerned, as we said all along 
during the election campaign, we were ready to cancel the 
contract, but, contrary to the Liberals, we wanted to avoid the 
loss of research and development funding, and the elimination 
of the high tech jobs it was providing. What was needed then was 
new projects to utilise this highly skilled labour force. During 
the weeks immediately following the election, we suggested a 
high speed train project. In my view, to have highly skilled and 
well trained people on unemployment insurance is not a sound 
investment for the long term. We have to put them back to work 
as soon as possible.
<P>
	I might add that the infrastructure program, for example, will 
meet certain needs in that area and create jobs for a certain kind 
of workers. But for those to whom that really matters, who make 
good wages and who put money back into the economy and into 
the area where they live, the vision of members on this side is 
more forward looking than that of the government, regarding the 
proposed course of action.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the hon. member's motion he suggests that the 
government strike a special committee of the House to examine 
public expenditures in light of the report of the Auditor General. 
He goes on to say that the deliberations should be open and 
transparent and that the committee should have the power to 
subpoena any witness.
<P>
	Is not the hon. member aware that we already have and have 
had for many years the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
which does that very thing? As a matter of fact that committee is 
chaired by an opposition member to assure that the 
examinations carried out are thorough and far reaching and to do 
all the things already in his motion.
<P>
	If I understand correctly the hon. member is concerned with 
overlapping. It seems to me if the government set up this 
committee we would have much more overlapping and 
duplication than we already have. I do not really understand 
what this committee would be doing that the public accounts 
committee under an opposition chairman is not already doing or 
will do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
remarks but what I remember from suggestions made by my 
constituents during the election campaign is that they would 
certainly agree to see the House consider that problem in 
particular. As you said, the committee has been there for a long 
time but has settled nothing. The present situation is due to that 
committee's actions.
<P>
	I think we have an obligation to take concrete action and that 
would be a way to prove our openness to the electorate. I would 
be very happy if they could see on television the efforts of 
members to control expenditures. We can be assured that that 
would seriously change the way people see politicians, at least 
in my own riding and I believe that would serve the interests of 
the whole country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1155"> 1155 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as overlap is concerned, by the way the committee has 
been presented to us, I do not believe its purpose is to duplicate 
the other one. We would be ready to give this committee the 
main role and we hope that the government would do the same 
and recognize the importance of controlling expenditures, in 
order to regain room to manoeuvre and revitalize the economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, during the last 
campaign, the Bloc Quebecois said that, considering the 
circumstances and the massive debt, it would make sure that the 
new government struck a special committee responsible for the 
review of the federal government's public expenditures.
<P>
	In the motion, we added ``in light of the report of the Auditor 
General of Canada''. There is also a mention of the overlap 
between federal and provincial government programs. 
Definitely, there are a lot of questions to be asked if we are to cut 
expenditures equitably and efficiently, in order to come up 
eventually with a balanced budget.
<P>
	We all know that each time the federal government goes into 
debt, it is forcing Quebec into debt also. Quebecers are really 
concerned about the way the federal government is spending. 
We are aware of the fact that we are getting poorer and poorer 
since our debt keeps on growing.
<P>
	If Quebec ever gains sovereignty, which I truly hope will 
happen, we will have to take over our share of that debt. That is 
why we are anxious to see the federal government lower its 
expenditures, so as not to keep on growing poorer every day. 
Canada's debt now exceeds $500 billion. If we divide this 
amount by the number of Canadian citizens, we come up with a 
frightening figure, but when we divide it by the number of 
families, the figure is even more alarming.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Once again, for these reasons we need to sit down and take a 
serious look at the situation and come up with real answers to 
this terrible debt problem.
<P>
	During the 1970s we listened to Mr. Trudeau tell us that we 
could afford to borrow. These years were considered to be 
somewhat less prosperous ones. We were told that once the 
country grew more quickly, once economic growth was stronger, 
then we could pay the money back.
<P>
	Not only did we take out loans, we also incurred long-term 
debts which we are still reimbursing. How are we supposed to 
reduce an annual deficit when we have 30-year commitments? 
The federal government has incurred all sorts of 30-year debts.
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau and his government made a blatant error at the 
time as far as long-term obligations were concerned, one that 
has proven extremely difficult to correct today.
<P>
	Throughout these years, from 1970 to 1992 or 1993, we 
always heard that Canada was a wealthy country and that it 
ranked first among all industrialized countries in terms of its 
standard of living. During the referendum, we also heard that 
Canada ranked first among the industrialized nations of the 
world. However we would be deluding ourselves if we believed 
this.
<P>
	I will give you an example that I have often used to illustrate 
this point. Take a 20-year old who owns his own house free and 
clear. The home is valued at $200 billion. He also owns a car free 
and clear. Year after year for a period of 20 years, this person has 
had to take out a mortgage on his house to survive.
<P>
	Twenty years later, in 1993, his house is mortgaged at 95 per 
cent, because that is the maximum amount he can borrow. He 
has a loan for the full value of his automobile because it is 
rented, and he has reached the spending limit on his credit cards. 
All the while, he has maintained the same standard of living. 
That person is inclined to say: My standard of living is very 
good and I have maintained it for the past 20 years. However that 
person is in debt up to his neck and is on the verge of tumbling 
into the dark hole of poverty.
<P>
	This example describes exactly what is happening in Canada 
today. This is the situation in which we find ourselves. We say 
we are wealthy, but it is only artificial wealth. We have lived on 
credit for the past 20 years. That is the legacy left to us by the 
Liberals and we are still being taken in today.
<P>
	In 1984, I was elected along with the Conservative 
government and I said exactly the same thing to my constituents 
at the time.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	In 1984, economic growth was good, around three per cent. In 
our caucuses we would say: ``We must cut expenses. This is 
insane; the public debt is close to $180 billion''. Ministers 
agreed that cuts had to be made, as long as their department was 
not affected. So, we kept spending more and more.
<P>
	In 1985, 1986 and 1987, when economic growth was quite 
good, we could have cut expenses even at the cost of creating a 
little unemployment. When cuts are made, the government 
pumps less money into the economy and this results in slower 
growth. With a 3 or 4 per cent growth at the time, we could have 
sacrificed one per cent by cutting spending. But we did not. Why 
not? Because we did not have the kind of all-party independent 
committee that we are proposing this morning.
<P>
	We propose that an independent committee, a committee with 
no political ties or partisanship, be set up. It is imperative that 
such a committee, made up of representatives of all official 
parties, be struck to made recommendations so that the 
government can act without fearing blame, since it would 
automatical-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1156"> 1156 </A></B>
<P>
ly have the support of the three or four parties. That is the great 
advantage of our proposal.
<P>
	That is why it is so important. If you are the least bit familiar 
with how things work in politics, how politicians react, you 
know that there comes a time when we must set our political 
interests aside and take steps to help the government act without 
being criticized.
<P>
	Basically, what we are proposing today is a way to provide 
support to the government so that it can make some headway and 
bring the debt down. We must all set partisanship aside and deal 
immediately with this monstrous debt that is bankrupting this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Paul):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it rather ironic that the hon. member for 
Longueuil, who sat for years with the Conservatives who 
increased the debt by $340 billion, is now advocating, after all 
his years in Parliament, the creation of a special commission or 
committee to review spending, when there already is such a 
committee.
<P>
	The party opposite favours eliminating overlap and 
repatriating all powers to Quebec, so I find it ironic that they are 
advocating the creation of a special committee to review 
Canadian government finances and support this government. 
Yet, we are giving our support to the governments of Quebec and 
of the other provinces.
<P>
	I find it difficult to understand how the hon. member for 
Longueuil can defend the committee he wants to set up to study 
government expenditures when these expenditures were not 
made by us. We already have a committee. If, in four years, the 
hon. member for Longueuil wants to create a special committee 
to study government spending because of extra or excessive 
expenditures, we will then be able to establish a special 
committee. But I do not see how we can set up this committee to 
review government spending when our government is not even 
responsible for all this spending.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member for Longueuil to tell me what 
this special committee could do that the existing committee 
cannot?
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see, thanks to the 
Liberal member, that the government's intent is not to cut 
spending. Indeed, we heard the finance minister say earlier this 
week that he would probably increase corporate and other taxes 
when we know very well that Canadians and Quebecers are 
already overtaxed.
<P>
	I find such statements from the government quite troubling 
and I am pessimistic and concerned as it is well known that we 
are in debt up to our necks, and I am unhappy to see that my 
children will probably have trouble keeping their heads above 
water in the coming years. This government is taking things far 
too lightly.
<P>
	We are proposing a common review to give this government 
some political freedom of expression and allow it to take 
concrete action with the support of the Official Opposition. That 
is why we are proposing today the creation of a special 
committee. We are not talking about the existing standing 
committee but about a special committee with a mandate to turn 
around the country's economic situation. I wonder why the party 
in office, the government, is against us giving it a hand.
<P>
	The hon. member was talking about my political experience. 
Indeed, I have been sitting in this House for nine years and, 
during these nine years, I have learned that government 
decisions are often made for electoral reasons, to win or rather 
not to lose votes. The government always makes short-term 
decisions in order to stay in power; it is a power play. What we 
are now proposing is this: We will give you a hand to help you 
make an apolitical decision. It is something new.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois do not want to come to power here 
in Ottawa. So take advantage of this situation! We are not the 
usual opposition, like the Liberals were under the Conservative 
government I was a member of. So take advantage of the fact 
that we are neutral because we do not want to come to power 
here in Ottawa, far from it. We want to give you a hand and help 
Canada to reduce its debt, because every time Canada increases 
its debt it also increases Quebec's and we do not like it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address the House on issues arising from the Auditor 
General's report and to respond to comments made by hon. 
members opposite on Mr. Desautels' report highlighting many 
of the significant matters that require our attention. Of course 
these are matters that are relevant to the last Parliament and the 
last government. They require immediate attention by all of us 
to ensure the most efficient and effective use of the taxpayers' 
dollar.
<P>
	I am pleased that we have already acted on a number of the 
points raised by the Auditor General. We have opened up the 
budget process. We cancelled a flawed airport deal relevant to 
Pearson International Airport; we put the airbus up for sale; we 
tightened up the regulations on the use of government aircraft; 
we have streamlined the decision making process of cabinet; 
and we restructured departments to make sure they can work 
together more effectively.
<P>
	The new decision making structure of cabinet consists of full 
cabinet and only four cabinet committees: economic 
development policy, social development policy, Treasury Board 
and a special committee of council. This is in marked contrast to 
the very expensive, cumbersome structure that existed 
previously with 11 cabinet committees in operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1157"> 1157 </A></B>
<P>
	Moreover, we have reduced the privileges of members of 
Parliament in terms of the costs we can save there. We have cut 
the political staff of ministers; we have reduced the budgets for 
ministers by some $10 million a year. As will be heard later 
today from my colleague the minister responsible for 
federal-provincial relations we are moving in the areas of 
cutting the waste, the duplication and the overlap between the 
federal and provincial governments. This is a strong start but 
more has to be done to address the issues raised by the Auditor 
General.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	At this point I would like to acknowledge the contribution Mr. 
Desautels and his staff have made to a better understanding of 
many of the important and complex issues faced by government. 
Many of his concerns parallel our own. When we met to discuss 
his report I learned that we shared a belief in the importance of 
improving information to Parliament and in reviewing existing 
programs and policies to ensure they continue to meet the needs 
of Canadians.
<P>
	The Auditor General has outlined his view that 
parliamentarians need to be more involved in the budget 
process. That has been raised here this morning. We agree and 
my colleague the hon. Minister of Finance has been making 
great strides in opening the budget process through various 
pre-budget consultations in the cities of Halifax, Montreal, 
Toronto and Calgary. He has met hundreds of Canadians and has 
heard directly from them what they feel must be done to turn the 
economy around, to create jobs and restore the faith of 
Canadians in the future. In many of the debates we have had in 
this House hon. members have had the opportunity to address 
issues relevant to the upcoming budget.
<P>
	I remind hon. members that we believe the efforts to bring the 
federal debt and deficit under control are most important and are 
going to be addressed in the budget of the Minister of Finance. It 
is important that we bring them under control, but it is also 
important that the measures taken are compatible with getting 
Canadians back to work.
<P>
	The federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure program is a 
key to stimulating economic activity. Bearing in mind what hon. 
members opposite have raised this morning, it is a good example 
of attempting to cut down on duplication, overlap and 
competition among the different levels of government. This 
program is unique in bringing three orders of government 
together to ensure the most efficient and effective spending of 
taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	As we have said in ``Creating Opportunity'' and as the Prime 
Minister has confirmed, we will allow individual members of 
Parliament more involvement in these consultations. 
Committees of the House will be given greater influence over 
government expenditures than previously. This government has 
announced that changes will be proposed to the rules of the 
House of Commons to provide members of Parliament with a  
greater opportunity to contribute to the development of public 
policy and to contribute to the development of legislation.
<P>
	The Official Opposition motion mentions that a special 
committee be struck to examine public expenditures by the 
federal government in light of the Auditor General's report. 
However there already is such a committee. As was raised this 
morning by the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce that is 
the public accounts committee.
<P>
	We look forward to working with members of the public 
accounts committee as they study the Auditor General's report 
in detail. The public accounts committee is chaired by a member 
of the Official Opposition. That gives them enormous 
opportunity to raise these issues and to have them dealt with by 
the public accounts committee. I look forward to those 
deliberations.
<P>
	I do not see the need for creating still another committee. I 
said a few moments ago that we have streamlined the process of 
cabinet, going from 11 committees down to 4 committees. We 
do not see the necessity in adding still further committees.
<P>
	The committee on public accounts will want to examine how 
government departments and agencies are responding to the 
need for improved administration and management. It will want 
to call senior officials before it and when its work is complete 
the government will have the benefit of its findings.
<P>
	The Auditor General has consistently advocated the need for 
better reporting of financial information for Parliament. This 
year was no exception in his report. This year Mr. Desautels 
devoted an entire chapter of his report to his view that better 
information is required on the deficit and the debt. Once again I 
am pleased to report the government is acting to address this 
need.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Recently the finance department issued two publications that 
will help increase understanding of the debt and the deficit. A 
short booklet entitled ``Basic Facts on Federal Spending'' will 
help Canadians better understand the federal government's 
budgetary spending. It summarizes spending as it is presented in 
the federal budget and in the public accounts. In addition, a 
longer background document called ``Federal Spending'' 
provides even more detail.
<P>
	Members will be happy to see that the public accounts 
recently tabled in the House were accepted without reservation 
by the Auditor General. The fundamental purpose of the public 
accounts is to provide information to Parliament and through 
Parliament to all Canadians. Their purpose is to facilitate 
understanding of the full nature and extent of the financial 
affairs and resources for which this government is responsible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1158"> 1158 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year the Auditor General said that in his view: ``The 
government's financial statements would be more 
understandable if they were presented in a comprehensive but 
succinct annual financial report''. What Mr. Desautels was 
calling for was a financial report similar to the annual reports 
published by corporations in the private sector. We have done 
just that.
<P>
	To make the financial statements of the Government of 
Canada more understandable to the public we have added a new 
section to the 1993 public accounts. For the first time we have 
presented a summary of economic developments during the 
year, a financial review and a set of condensed financial 
statements. New graphs and charts portray complex financial 
data in an understandable format for the first time. This clear 
and concise overview of the state of the government's financial 
affairs was added at the suggestion of the Auditor General.
<P>
	Another ongoing concern of his has been the need for more 
information on the results of government programs. We agree. 
To have a country that works we need to measure whether 
specific government programs actually deliver results over 
time. We recognize the need for strengthened audits, 
strengthened internal audits, strengthened evaluation. In fact 
that was a cornerstone of the recommendations in the red book.
<P>
	This year the Auditor General looked at several aspects of 
regulations. Regulations can help improve the quality of life of 
Canadians by setting standards for things which affect their 
daily lives. Canadians should be able to put their children in car 
seats knowing they meet certain safety standards. They should 
know how much fat the ground beef they buy contains. Yet 
regulations can also place an undue cost or administrative 
burden on businesses and individuals.
<P>
	This government is committed to reducing the regulatory 
burden on Canada's economy. One example of the innovative 
ways we are finding to do this is the new business impact test 
which was jointly developed with the Canadian Manufacturers 
Association. I had the pleasure of unveiling it with that 
association just a week ago.
<P>
	This new software package is designed to help governments 
understand and evaluate the potential impact of proposed 
regulations on the private sector. It looks at the direct costs of 
proposed regulations as well as the effect the proposals may 
have on the way firms operate, organize and innovate. It allows 
companies to give their views early in the process, as a 
regulation is being developed. It can even help business and 
government determine other ways to serve the public interest 
that may not involve regulation at all. Therefore we are trying to 
streamline regulations to help Canadian businesses compete in 
this current economy.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to stress the importance of the 
contribution of the Auditor General's report. The Auditor 
General has made an important contribution to the better 
understanding of the issues faced by governments. At the same 
time there is no doubt the Auditor General's work is an 
important stimulus to constructive action.
<P>
	We look forward to consulting with the Auditor General. We 
look forward to hearing the deliberations of the public accounts 
committee, chaired by a member of the Official Opposition. 
Together we can pursue the goals of restoring the confidence of 
Canadians in their government and the efficient and effective 
spending of tax dollars.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
committee that is being suggested certainly falls under the terms 
of reference of the public accounts committee. I too do not see 
the need for an additional committee in the House for that 
reason.
<P>
	The hon. member has suggested some improvements which 
have already been made with the Auditor General's report. 
However no mention was made under the aboriginal economic 
development strategy. I would like his comments on this point.
<P>
	The throne speech addressed three major programs with the 
aboriginal affairs department that would be undertaken. I noted 
in chapter 11 of the Auditor General's report there were 
significant observations made on previous programs by the 
previous government. I would not like the hon. member to 
respond by saying it was the previous government's fault. It is 
actually the administrative problems within those programs 
which are of concern to me.
<P>
	I want to make one reference. For instance, the administration 
and the government could not demonstrate that after spending at 
least $900 million from the beginning of its implementation in 
1989 to early 1993 the strategy's objectives were being met.
<P>
	The essence of the Auditor General's report on aboriginal 
programs, in particular the aboriginal economic development 
strategy, is that a lot of money is put into these programs but we 
really do not know what the outcomes of these programs are. 
They are poorly co-ordinated. In fact many Canadians think we 
are throwing out too much money without outcomes.
<P>
	What is this government going to do when it introduces these 
new programs as announced in the throne speech? How are we 
going to have outcomes to these programs unlike the problem 
the Auditor General came up with in a previous report?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. It does relate to something of considerable importance 
to me and the government. That is to understand what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1159"> 1159 </A></B>
<P>
outcomes are of our programs  and what we have gained for the 
taxpayers' dollar that has been spent and what the results are.
<P>
	Internal audit and evaluation processes become a very key 
part of trying to determine that. A greater emphasis has to be 
placed on that than has been done in the past. That is certainly 
the case on the infrastructure program for which I have some 
immediate responsibility for implementing. That is one of the 
areas where I have made it quite clear we have to be able to get a 
handle on it so we will understand what those outcomes are. I 
think my colleagues share that.
<P>
	Whether it is in native affairs, native economic development 
strategies or whatever other area, we will attempt to apply that 
general principle of getting an understanding of the outcomes 
and providing the appropriate internal audit and evaluation 
processes to do that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
almost amused by what the previous speaker said. One would 
think that he is a Conservative defending the Conservatives' 
record. Basically, he is defending the status quo, when it has 
been proven that the status quo does not work. They tell us about 
the Public Accounts Committee. The proof that it does not work 
is the situation we are in.
<P>
	How can one claim that this committee, which does indeed 
exist, will be effective, when it was not effective in the past?
<P>
	Furthermore, according to the Auditor General of Canada, 
only 18 per cent of programs are evaluated, as the hon. member 
for Rivière-du-Loup reminded us just now. So how can you 
defend the status quo if you do not even take the trouble to 
evaluate what is being done?
<P>
	I have the impression that the Auditor General's report and 
role may have more to do with discovering mismanagement and 
horrors and not so much to do with the effectiveness of 
programs; the proof is that they are not evaluated.
<P>
	I am very surprised and I would like the previous speaker to 
explain to me why, at the very beginning of a new mandate and a 
new government, they are defending the previous government's 
policies so much.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amused by that because it 
was exactly the opposite of what my remarks were all about. My 
remarks were about the changes that are being made. I am 
certainly not going to stand here and defend what the previous 
government has done which is now being talked about in the 
Auditor General's report.
<P>
	I find it amazing that they overlook the value of the existing 
public accounts committee as a means of dealing with a great 
many of these issues. Hon. members opposite get the 
opportunity to chair that committee. That gives them a much 
greater opportunity than perhaps many other committees. They 
talk today about cutting down and overlapping, yet they want to 
establish another committee that is clearly going to overlap 
what an existing committee is already empowered to do.
<P>
	Let us stop wasting our time and the taxpayers' money by 
setting up alternative overlapping committees when one exists, 
one they have an opportunity to chair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
understand why the President of the Treasury Board is refusing 
to set up a special committee. This would not be the first time we 
have special committees. We have had them for finance and in 
various other areas.
<P>
	We know very well that the President of the Treasury Board 
does not manage the treasury, because there is no more money in 
it; rather, he manages the debt and the deficit. He should be a 
little more serious and accept the support we are offering. We 
want a neutral position to be taken so that the government can 
make the right decision.
<P>
	Since I am the critic for Foreign Affairs and I am speaking to 
the President of the Treasury Board, I would like to know if he 
intends to consider cutting the spending of our embassies and 
representatives abroad, but especially of our embassies.
<P>
	Every time I went abroad, with my friend the member for 
Beauséjour, who is here, the ambassador always told us: ``You 
know, this embassy did not cost very much. We paid very little 
for it 20 years ago''. I tell him: ``Twenty years ago, I too bought 
a house that is worth $200,000 today, but I paid $20,000 for it''. 
They are always trying to justify themselves, because in my 
opinion and that of many others, our embassies are probably 
more in keeping with the standards of a country like the United 
States, France or England, whose population is two, three or ten 
times as much as ours.
<P>
	I think that we should seriously consider having embassies 
more in keeping with our standard of living and our spending 
power. That is why I ask the President of the Treasury Board the 
question. It is up to him to do it and I hope that he will do it 
because we just learned again that we spent $75 million to build 
the embassy in China. I think that is huge for a country like 
Canada. We also spent $95 million to build the embassy in the 
United States, in Washington. I think that is huge too.
<P>
	I do not know if the President of the Treasury Board, who 
manages a debt rather than a treasury, will be able to stop and 
think, even if he does not have a committee because he does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1160"> 1160 </A></B>
<P>
want one, and will be prepared to cut the spending of our 
embassies which is much too high, without being given a hand.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows 
cutting government expenditure is under consideration by the 
Minister of Finance and will be addressed in the budget.
<P>
	As to some of the past expenditures at various embassies 
which he is talking about, perhaps that has been referred to in 
this and previous reports of the Auditor General. I am sure he 
knows that all too well, since he was a member of the House and 
a member of the supporting party of the last government when 
many of these matters were carried out.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	I must come back to the matter of a new committee. I use the 
words that hon. members opposite used when they talked about 
overlapping, when they talked about waste, and when they 
talked about duplication. That is what they are proposing when 
speaking of this committee.
<P>
	It is not required. We have a committee where all these issues 
that have been talked about can be raised. It is a committee that 
they chair. Perhaps they are indicating they do not have 
confidence in one of their members to chair the committee. 
Maybe somebody else should chair it. It seems to me they have 
every opportunity without overlap, without duplication, without 
waste to raise these issues in the public accounts committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the whip of the Reform Party I would like to advise the House 
that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) our speakers on the 
motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
	First my congratulations to the Bloc for introducing a motion 
that deals with trying to come to terms with the problems of 
money and lack of money in the country. We are $500 billion in 
debt. It is nice to see the opposition and the government taking 
these things seriously.
<P>
	It reminds me a bit of the parable of the prodigal son who left 
home and wanted to take a share of his wealth with him. Here we 
have the Bloc wanting to ensure that the fiscal House of Canada 
is in order so there is sufficient wealth for them to take with 
them. I would remind the Bloc that the end of the parable was 
that he did have to come home, unfortunately without his 
wealth.
<P>
	I do not think anybody has spoken louder on managing the 
government's money than the Reform Party. During the last 
election we produced a four-page flyer that showed how we 
were going to reduce the deficit to zero. If anybody was 
eliminating waste it was the Reform Party because, as I say, it 
was a four-page flyer. My hon. friends across the aisle with a 
120-page red book could only get the deficit down to about 3 per 
cent of gross domestic product or $25 billion. When it comes to 
the elimination of waste, duplication and extra effort the  
Reform Party is the party to which one should be looking.
<P>
	The problem does not lie in the elimination of duplication of 
government expenditures. The President of the Treasury Board 
has already said, and other speakers have said so this morning, 
that we have a public accounts committee that is chaired by a 
member of the opposition. They have every opportunity to look 
at the expenditures examined by the Auditor General. He has 
pointed out that we are losing money here, that we are wasting 
money there: $10 billion is being thrown down the drain by this 
department; $100 million is not being collected by the 
Department of National Revenue through loss of taxation on the 
GST as half a million people have not been filing their returns. 
These things have been pointed out to us.
<P>
	The thing to remember is that the deficit is $43 billion or $45 
billion according to the Minister of Finance. The total spending 
by the federal government on its administration, on its salaries, 
on its rent, on its desks, telephones, computers and whatever 
else it needs to manage the country is only $17 billion. If we 
eliminated the entire civil service and everything that goes with 
it our deficit would still be around $25 billion.
<P>
	Therefore if the members of the Bloc Quebecois think they 
can resolve the waste and deficit problems of the government by 
narrowly defining the idea they can find enough money in waste 
and duplication, they only have to look at the numbers and that 
will tell them that unfortunately they will not find the answer in 
another committee that looks at the same problem again.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	In chapter 5 of his report the Auditor General talks about the 
debt and the deficit and concern about where this country is 
going. If we want to find out where we are going, it is always 
best to look at where we have been. He produced some 
interesting graphs and charts in chapter 5 showing it was in 1975 
that our deficit really started to balloon. It was our colleagues on 
the other side of the House who decided it was time to start 
spending money on social programs by the billions. It was then 
they introduced what they called the just society.
<P>
	I talked about this earlier in the pre-budget debate. At that 
time I said that if taxpayers had been given the bill to pay for the 
just society rather than borrowing the money to pay for it, we 
would have told them we could not afford it and we would not 
have the problems we have today.
<P>
	Between 1974 and 1976 spending on programs mushroomed 
to about 130 per cent of the money collected in tax revenues. By 
the time we added the interest on the debt being created our 
spending exceeded 155 per cent of government revenues. That is 
where the problems started and why we have these problems 
today. Unfortunately we have to squeeze the social spending we 
have created in order to be able to afford government in the 
country. Not only do we have to eliminate the fat  from the waste 
and duplication in services but we have to take a look at how we

<P>
spend our money on social programs in order that we can afford 
to balance our budget.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has decided 
to strike a committee to look at how we are going to revamp 
social programs and unemployment insurance. Last year we 
spent $19 billion on unemployment insurance. That is almost 50 
per cent of the current deficit.
<P>
	I do not suggest for a moment that we should get rid of 
unemployment insurance but we have systemic unemployment 
in this country of around 7 per cent. That is now to be considered 
full employment; 7 per cent of workers do not have jobs because 
of the problems with the social programs that say we do not have 
enough incentives built into them for people to go to work.
<P>
	Our neighbours to the south have a systemic unemployment 
rate of about 3 per cent lower than ours. Their cost of 
unemployment insurance as a percentage of their gross domestic 
product is significantly lower than ours. That is the way we are 
going to balance the budget. It is not going to be through trying 
to save a nickel here or find a dime there by creating another 
committee to find out how on earth we are going to balance the 
budget. The answer is not there; the answer lies in social 
programs.
<P>
	When we produced our zero in three flyer last fall we said that 
about $3 billion to $4 billion could be saved by providing 
incentives for people to get back to work. By reducing the 
unemployment rate, we reduce the cost of unemployment 
insurance and create additional tax revenues from people who 
are now working. That is where we are going to find the answers 
to our problems.
<P>
	We said last fall that we should talk about eliminating old age 
security to families that earn more than $54,000 a year. It would 
save another $3 billion. We could save between $4 billion in UI 
and $3 billion on old age security, which comes to $7 billion. 
That is 40 per cent of total government expenditures we can save 
by looking at these two programs without having to go through 
every nickel and dime and line by line of the entire government 
expenditures. We identified $7 billion with these two programs 
alone.
<P>
	Last fall when I was knocking on doors and talking to senior 
citizens in my riding they were concerned about our policy on 
old age security. For those families which make more than 
$54,000 a year, we are going to cut it off. Why should young 
families which are trying to get ahead have to pay taxes so that 
the rich can use their old age security to go to places in the sun in 
the winter? Many of the seniors I talked to said: ``I wish we had 
seen $54,000 in our lives. My goodness, cut that off. By all 
means cut that off. We support you 100 per cent if we are going 
to balance the budget''. Those are the types of things that my 
colleagues from the Bloc should be proposing in the motion.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The motion they have proposed today is far too narrow. The 
budget cannot be balanced if we focus on one thing. I know they 
have their own political agenda that says: ``Put the blame on the 
federal government and that way we do not have to worry about 
what happens in the province of Quebec''.
<P>
	I am concerned about all of Canada not just the province of 
Alberta. I am concerned about Canadians who live in the 
province of Quebec. Everybody who lives in the province of 
Quebec as far as I am concerned is a Canadian and participates 
fully in this great nation of ours.
<P>
	As I mentioned we laid out a full program on how to balance a 
budget last fall. We did it as volunteers. We did it as Canadians 
who wanted to make a contribution to the country. That is where 
we should be looking to resolve our problems rather than this 
narrowly defined motion as proposed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested at the beginning of the member's presentation to learn 
that the Reform Party has a whip. It seems to me that it is 
something they would not have in their type of organization. 
Looking at the attendance it seems to me that he or she needs 
some practice.
<P>
	The motion before us today actually deals with confederation 
and we have heard a good deal of criticism-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
believe it is inappropriate to make any comment about 
attendance in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member makes a 
very valid point. Hon. members should not take issue with the 
absence of any member of any party from the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I make my apologies to you and to 
members present.
<P>
	The motion today deals with confederation and we have heard 
a good deal of criticism about that form of government. 
Confederation it seems to me is a form of government which has 
developed particularly in North America, here and in the United 
States, as a very effective and powerful way of dealing with 
large and diverse countries. Overall, and I think members 
opposite will agree with this point, the method has been very 
effective in North America. We have produced two nations that 
have been among the most productive, however you define 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1162"> 1162 </A></B>
<P>
productive, economically or in some other terms, socially for 
example, that have ever existed on the face of the earth.
<P>
	In a debate like this, one could tend to forget the strengths of 
confederation. If I could give one example, one strength of the 
confederate approach to government is the fact that a process of 
trial and error can go on in different parts of the confederation 
and that process is a very creative and, I would suggest in the 
light of the comments this morning, also a very economical way 
of testing new ideas. Sometimes those ideas will work and they 
can be taken on by the confederation or sometimes they will not 
work and we will have saved the expense of a trial which would 
have failed across the nation as a whole.
<P>
	A famous example is medicare being developed in 
Saskatchewan. Their system of medical health support was 
developed, it was tried, a substantial trial and error process, and 
then we were able to spread it to the rest of the country.
<P>
	Another example is the work that is going on in New 
Brunswick in the area of our social support systems which were 
discussed this morning. In New Brunswick as we speak 
experiments are going on which look as though they will show 
that there are better ways to deliver the social services which are 
so important to our nation. In a debate like this the strengths of 
Confederation must be stressed as well as some of the 
weaknesses.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that in a form of government like this there are 
inevitably overlaps. Some of them for a while are necessary and 
many of them are unnecessary. To that extent I agree with 
members opposite.
<P>
	Wherever there is unnecessary duplication we must eliminate 
it and, as the President of the Treasury Board said, I hope the 
government is doing so.
<P>
	Simply to recite things like fisheries, agriculture or 
environment and then point to the fact that those things are dealt 
with by two jurisdictions is not to show unnecessary 
duplication. It seems to me fisheries would be a good example. 
The fishery in Quebec would be very different from the fishery 
in British Columbia. It therefore seems appropriate that people 
who understand those fisheries deal with them in those regions. 
But it is equally appropriate that national and international 
aspects of the fishery be dealt with economically and without 
unnecessary duplication by a central government.
<P>
	What has been lacking has been national leadership, proper 
leadership from this Chamber. The duplication which has arisen 
has been a result of that, not the result of a weakness in 
confederation but a weakness of previous governments to 
address the truly national issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I missed the question in 
that little discourse but I do agree with the hon. member that 
there is more than one way to solve a problem.
<P>
	The way that Confederation has been designed has worked 
great for Canada for the last 125 years. There is absolutely no 
reason whatsoever that it cannot continue to make sure that 
problems, programs, assistance and government overlap from 
one jurisdiction to another shall remain in the federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	We see that in fisheries, for example, the flow-over from one 
province to another. We see it in other areas. The hon. member 
mentioned agriculture.
<P>
	We also see other opportunities where governments of 
different provinces might address the problems of budget 
deficits and management of their own tax revenues. I believe 
New Brunswick was mentioned. In my home province of 
Alberta we have seen the government take a real hard firm 
stance to address these problems to ensure that it can live within 
its means. This is an example for us here in the capital to follow 
and perhaps other provinces that have the same problem.
<P>
	I think the hon. member has a good point and it should be 
noted today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to speak against the first part of the Bloc's motion 
and in support of the second part.
<P>
	Surely the Bloc must see the obvious contradiction in its 
motion. It is calling for a formation of a special committee of 
Parliament and proposes to examine the public expenses of the 
federal government. The second part of the motion focuses on 
the elimination of duplication between federal and provincial 
programs.
<P>
	Does it not see the special committee of Parliament as a 
duplication of administration? Is this not why we already have a 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts?
<P>
	If the Bloc is sincere about eliminating duplication and wants 
the review of the public accounts to be open and transparent to 
the public then I would suggest that it amend its motion and that 
the House direct the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to 
undertake the review of the Auditor General's report and the 
elimination of duplication between federal and provincial 
programs. As it stands I cannot support the motion.
<P>
	My constituents in Yorkton-Melville voted for me because I 
promised to oppose the waste of taxpayers' money. The way I 
see it, the special committee proposed by the Bloc and the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts would be doing the 
same job.
<P>
	When a farmer wants to spray his crop in order to kill weeds 
he does not first of all buy a spray that will kill thistles, spray his 
crop for thistles and then buy another spray to kill the wild oats 
and then buy a spray to kill the mustard, and another spray to kill 
the chickweed and go over his crop half a dozen times. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1163"> 1163 </A></B>
<P>
would be foolish.  That would be inefficient; it would not work. 
A farmer who would do that would not be in farming very long. 
It is no different when it comes to government. We cannot have 
the same thing being done over and over again. It will not work.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I would like to comment on the three themes that are proposed 
by the Bloc in its motion: first, the need for a review of the 
Auditor General's report; second, the need for a review of 
federal-provincial programs with a view to eliminating 
duplication of effort and saving the taxpayers' money; and, 
third, the need for an open and transparent process permitting 
public input and scrutiny of our public accounts.
<P>
	There is a need to review the Auditor General's report while it 
is in progress, not to wait until his report is released. When the 
Auditor General encounters waste, mismanagement or 
corruption, these matters should be brought before the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts immediately. If this were done, 
we might be able to stop the bleeding before the patient becomes 
terminally ill.
<P>
	The Auditor General should have access to any and all public 
accounts, including cabinet ministers' travel expenses.
<P>
	The Auditor General should have the authority to make public 
the decisions and waste that he uncovers in the Board of Internal 
Economy if he feels it is necessary and in the public's best 
interest.
<P>
	I agree with the Bloc Quebecois that there is too much 
duplication of administration between the federal and provincial 
governments. For example, there is the duplication between 
unemployment insurance and social assistance. Both programs 
provide protection for the unemployed. Many people who 
exhaust their UI benefits go to welfare. In Saskatchewan almost 
half of the people on social assistance are considered fully 
employable. Here we have two programs serving much the same 
purpose and many of the same clients.
<P>
	There are two sets of bureaucracies, one in the federal 
government and one at the provincial level. The duplication 
continues.
<P>
	Unemployment insurance collects its own special payroll tax 
from both workers and employers in the form of the so-called 
insurance premiums. When the UI account goes into the hole, 
like it has for the past three years, the taxpayers, mainly workers 
and employers, are asked to pay again, only this time through 
income tax and corporate tax.
<P>
	Social assistance is paid for on a 50:50 basis by the federal 
and provincial governments. Again there is only one taxpayer 
footing the bill.
<P>
	I do not want to belabour the point. I think anybody with any 
common sense can see that there is duplication and where there 
is duplication there is waste of taxpayers' hard earned income.
<P>
	In my former life I was a school teacher. This reminds me of a 
time when the school board was trying to provide the same level 
of service but on a fixed budget. It was running buses along the 
same road, twice in the morning and twice at night; once to pick 
up the elementary school children and the second time to pick up 
the high school students. When that fixed budget could be 
stretched no more, when the crunch came, it had to come up with 
new ideas. It found a way to make the run once and to pick up 
both groups of students.
<P>
	If there has ever been a budget crisis it is now, and we have to 
come up with a better and cheaper way of doing things. The 
programs should be delivered by the level of government which 
can best provide the service for the best and the lowest possible 
cost. It has been my experience that the closer the government is 
to the people, the better the program that can be delivered and 
the lower the costs.
<P>
	I have the honour of serving on the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development. I will make sure that the issue 
of duplication between federal programs administered by the 
department of human resources and provincial governments are 
addressed in our review of the social programs. I believe it is the 
duty of each member on each standing committee to ensure that 
they do the same. I would, therefore, not recommend the need 
for a special committee to look into duplication.
<P>
	I strongly support the Bloc's recommendation for a more open 
and transparent process permitting public scrutiny.
<P>
	The more I work in Ottawa the more I realize that the process 
is a big part of the problem. We found during the referendum on 
the Charlottetown accord that people want to get directly 
involved in the decision making process.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	We also found that Canadians could understand complex 
issues such as the Constitution. There was a desire among the 
vast majority to know more and more about issues that affect the 
future of our children. They correctly analysed the situation, 
ignored the cries of the so-called elites and made the right 
decision.
<P>
	We need to put more trust into the common sense of the 
common people. Nowhere is this common sense needed more 
than in the review of public accounts.
<P>
	While the Minister of Finance is proud of the four conferences 
he organized as a part of his pre-budget process, I do not know 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1164"> 1164 </A></B>
<P>
of one person from my  constituency who was invited to attend 
or make a submission. So much for an open process.
<P>
	Any consultative process should be open to all Canadians. 
Using today's technologies, it is possible for all Canadians to 
register their votes on issues of public spending and public 
borrowing.
<P>
	Annual tax returns could be used by taxpayers to register 
where and on what programs they want their money spent. We 
need to put Canadians back in control of government. Once 
every four or five years we have democracy but in between we 
are run by decree of the governing party. Ask the people in 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville if they feel they live in a 
true democracy.
<P>
	When families are in a financial crisis and can no longer 
borrow money to support their standard of living, they sit around 
the kitchen table and talk about how everyone is going to pull 
together to make ends meet.
<P>
	Canada is just like a family. Our government meetings should 
be held at kitchen tables instead of conference tables. We need to 
sit around and discuss these things. All three levels of 
government have their hands in the same taxpayers' pockets and 
there is less and less room for the taxpayer to get his own money 
out of his own pocket. There are three levels of government but 
only one taxpayer. We all have to work together to get out of this 
financial mess.
<P>
	In closing, I commend the Bloc for bringing forward this 
motion and drawing attention to the need for reform. I would 
like to again register my objection to duplicating the efforts of 
the Standing Committee on Public Accounts by forming another 
special committee as proposed in the Bloc's motion.
<P>
	While I cannot support the first part of its motion, I would be 
able to support the second part of the motion calling for a review 
of the Auditor General's report, the elimination of duplication 
between federal and provincial programs and a call for more 
public scrutiny of our budgeting and spending processes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to comment on the speech just delivered by the Reform member, 
who objects to the striking of a special committee to examine 
federal government expenditures. During the last election 
campaign, his party strongly advocated that the government 
clean up its act as far as spending is concerned. That is why, I 
think, they were elected in western Canada with such a majority. 
When you go hunting, you arm yourself appropriately, just as 
when you go fishing, you use the right gear. You cannot change 
equipment, even if you decide to do something else.
<P>
	The Reform Party campaigned to defend the interest of its 
electorate, as we did during the campaign, as we always do in the 
<P>
House, and as the Bloc Quebecois will continue to do throughout 
its mandate. Hence the  importance of striking such a 
committee. The Bloc Quebecois said during the last election 
campaign, and I am very proud of it, that it would defend the 
interests of Quebecers and, in its capacity as the Official 
Opposition, the interests of all Canadians, of course, as far as 
government expenditures are concerned. Today, in Quebec as 
well as in Canada, there is a feeling of social insecurity, because 
Canada's debt level is very high, as is the interest on this debt 
which is in the order of $110 million per day.
<P>
	I think there must be, here in Parliament, a committee to study 
government expenditures, item by item, and also to verify all 
departmental expenditures, item by item. An hon. member said 
earlier that such a committee has always existed in Parliament, 
which brings me to the following question: Did such a 
committee exist in 1980? Did that committee exist from 1980 to 
1993? If it did, either it was ineffective, did not do its job 
properly, or else did a very good job but was not listened to. The 
previous governments did not listen to suggestions made by that 
committee because, from 1980 to 1984, the Liberals were in 
office and the debt stood at $30 billion in 1980, whereas by the 
time the Conservatives took over, it had already climbed to $187 
billion.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Similarly, if the committee was in place after 1984 and until 
1993, what did the government do with the recommendations of 
that committee? The $187 billion debt inherited from the 
Liberals kept increasing under the Conservatives. What 
prevented the government from taking appropriate action? Did 
it follow the recommendations of that committee? Is there any 
point in having a committee if the government does not follow 
its recommendations?
<P>
	I suppose that the committee does a very good job and makes 
some useful recommendations to reduce expenditures, or at 
least to flash a yellow light warning ministers and some 
departments of imminent danger, by telling them that they are 
about to go over their budget, or to flash a red light telling them 
that they have indeed used up their budget and must be careful 
with their spending.
<P>
	I also want to say that there would be no overlapping in this 
case because, within the government finance sector there is a 
Department of Finance as well another department called 
Revenue Canada. I guess you could call that overlapping. 
Likewise there is a finance committee, of which I am a member, 
and there is also a public accounts committee.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois motion is to ensure that government 
expenditures are thoroughly reviewed and that a report is then 
tabled in the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1165"> 1165 </A></B>
<P>
	Earlier we referred briefly to infrastructures. I think that the 
$2 billion infrastructure program of the Liberal government is 
insufficient, since the Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
suggested a $15 billion investment.
<P>
	My question is: Is it the politicians who spend too much, not 
knowing where they are headed, or is it the civil servants who 
mismanage programs?
<P>
	I will conclude by saying to the Reform Party that the 
situation is much worse than that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I apologize for 
interrupting the hon. member for Charlevoix, but I have to 
remind all members that, as their representative, I must ensure 
that they comply with the Standing Orders of this House.
<P>
	I am aware that five minutes for questions and comments is a 
very short period. However, comments must be brief in order to 
allow the member who makes a speech to provide a reply or an 
answer to a question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In that spirit I would ask the member for Yorkton-Melville if 
he would like to make a concluding remark or comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
taken to heart what has been said. I will try to be brief.
<P>
	I feel it is very important that we sit down together and 
discuss these things, as my colleague from the Bloc has said. We 
need to do this in an atmosphere that our standing committees 
are conducive toward. We have these committees in place. They 
have a mandate to review the programs. I am on the Standing 
Committee for Human Resources Development and we are 
looking at a budget of $68 billion. Right there, if we are going to 
restructure that, there is a tremendous opportunity to do the 
things suggested here and those are to review social programs 
and look at ways in which spending can be reduced.
<P>
	We have all these standing committees in place already. I do 
not think we are going to solve our problems in government by 
bringing in more government. That contributes to the problem 
we already have. We need to reward people for finding ways to 
do with less, to downsize government and consequently spend 
less. That is the aim that we must have. We must never lose sight 
of that as we work on our individual standing committees.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate today. I hope that our 
arguments will help enlighten hon. members about the merits of 
our motion. What we are proposing is a simple and realistic 
process that no member in this House can off-handedly reject 
simply because it was not put forward by his or her party.
<P>
	Our constituents expect such action from us. I do not see how I 
could go back to my riding this weekend and try to explain why 
we refused to examine public finances. Such a refusal would 
show a lack of respect for our voters and an attempt to shirk our 
responsibilities. We as members of the Bloc Quebecois have 
received an additional mandate, and a significant one at that.
<P>
	Quebecers have especially asked us to protect their interests 
and to focus our energy and efforts to help Quebec attain its 
sovereignty. Soon Quebecers will democratically determine 
their own future.
<P>
	For more than three months now, each and everyone of us has 
noticed, day in and day out, that our federal system has some 
major flaws on several levels, especially from an administrative 
and a political point of view. On the one hand, the Auditor 
General has always loudly complained about the 
mismanagement of government funds.
<P>
	On the other hand, provinces claim that they have been treated 
unfairly, because of unjust decisions based on so-called 
national standards, which obviously are not making provincial 
authorities very happy. Add to this the willingness of hon. 
members to play a bigger part in the decision and legislative 
system, and you can say without a doubt that our system is not 
efficient and needs some major changes.
<P>
	Take, for instance, the Auditor General of Canada who 
publishes every year horror stories like some of Stephen King 
bestsellers on the way our government manages this country. 
The Auditor General cannot all by himself go through 
everything. He focuses on some very well defined areas. He 
examines only some of the elements of public administration. 
He is asked to perform a monumental task requiring detailed 
knowledge of the situation. Recently we heard some horror 
stories about senators, but let us not dwell on that.
<P>
	The evaluation process used by the Auditor clearly shows the 
scope and the complexity of the federal administration. It is 
becoming more and more difficult, if not utterly impossible, to 
control this monster and the vast number of programs involving 
extraordinary public spending.
<P>
	Our approach or proposal is a symbolical and responsible 
attempt to democratize and open the whole issue of public 
finances. The people will better understand public expenditures 
and will be in a better position to evaluate the government's 
decisions.
<P>
	Year after year, successive ministers of Finance pledge to 
apply stricter controls, to eliminate waste and to reduce 
spending. Alas, results are always disappointing. Governments 
are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1166"> 1166 </A></B>
<P>
much more apt to raise revenues through taxes than to reduce 
their extravagant expenditures and waste.
<P>
	We, the Bloc, will allow, with this motion, every member to 
keep this promise. It is up to you to decide.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance prefers to travel throughout the 
country at the taxpayer's expense to hold other consultations. I 
do not think these little trips will solve anything.
<P>
	The minister should sit down with us and all the other parties 
in this House and look carefully at the true financial mess our 
great country is now in. I am sure that everybody here would 
agree to such a serious and open process. Nobody in this House 
can support ridiculous or useless spending.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Nobody can condone waste and deadwood. In the end, this 
process aims at ensuring that every tax dollar is spent 
efficiently.
<P>
	As social housing critic, I have to look at the activities and 
programs of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
Note that Quebec also has its own housing corporation, that is, 
the Société d'habitation du Québec. The work of these two 
similar corporations is similar and sometimes complementary. 
Both organizations deal with housing.
<P>
	There is certainly some duplication of services that is very 
costly in terms of the number of employees doing similar tasks 
at both levels of government. These sums are possibly included 
in the operating budgets of the various programs under their 
authority. And let us not forget the incredible number of 
interdepartmental meetings required in order to harmonize the 
programs and all the co-ordination meetings between officials 
working on various projects.
<P>
	Since there are federal-provincial agreements in each of the 
provinces, we can multiply by ten, plus two for the territories, 
this type of duplication of services that is very costly for the 
taxpayers and very confusing for the general public. Each level 
of government has its standards, its inspectors, its codes and its 
regulations. There is a cost attached to all that. We must 
simplify the system and concentrate all these activities at the 
same administrative level in order to meet needs more 
efficiently and to maximize the use of the money allocated for 
these programs.
<P>
	Obviously, in Quebec, the Société d'habitation du Québec 
must be the only administrative authority in this area. The other 
provinces should do the same. That is up to them.
<P>
	Right now, in Canada, in this rich and developed country, 1.2 
million people are in desperate need of housing. The total 
withdrawal of the federal government as of January 1, 1994 is 
indecent and unacceptable. Moreover, the general agreements 
with the provinces are melting away like the snow because of 
deep cuts in federal funding. So, all of a sudden, the provinces/ 
find themselves without funding and it is the poorest in our 
society who suffer the terrible consequences.
<P>
	Liberals do not seem to be doing anything to rectify the 
situation. They say that there is not enough money. Here is a 
golden opportunity for the government opposite to find 
considerable amounts of money in order to meet the housing 
needs of disadvantaged Canadians. But, a word of caution, the 
money taken from the various departments will have to be 
redistributed under new criteria. Federal standards must meet 
the particular needs of individual provinces and reflect their 
reality.
<P>
	Quebec wants its fair share of funding for social housing, 
which has not been the case in the past few years.
<P>
	Finally, let us administer our country intelligently and openly 
so that we have the means to meet the needs of the people, some 
of which are urgent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
bit hard to believe some of the things we are hearing in the 
House today in this debate. We heard the member for 
Yorkton-Melville earlier complain that his constituents were 
not invited to comment on the budgetary process, the most open 
one ever held in the country.
<P>
	I would remind all members of the House that we are members 
of Parliament and we have an opportunity and a responsibility to 
consult with our constituents. We did that in my riding of 
London-Middlesex in collaboration with my other two 
colleagues in London. We held a pre-budget meeting and heard 
the concerns of our constituents. I would remind members of 
Parliament that as talented as he is the finance minister cannot 
be all places at the same time.
<P>
	The member for Laurentides castigated the past government 
for its financial excesses and I would certainly agree with her. I 
would note that the leader of her party was a cabinet minister in 
that past government. Perhaps he could rationalize that past 
performance for her.
<P>
	I quite frankly doubt very much that I could support the Bloc 
motion. Where specifically do the terms of reference for the 
public accounts committee, of which I am a member and which 
meets for the first time today, fall short in what the Bloc seeks to 
achieve by its motion?
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	If I can have explained some of the shortcoming in these terms 
of reference then perhaps I might be persuaded to support the 
motion.
<P>
	As has already been noted, it will be interesting whether the 
Bloc takes up its opportunity today to have the chair of that 
committee be one of its own members. I am unconvinced at this 
moment. I am flabbergasted by some of the remarks I have heard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1167"> 1167 </A></B>
<P>
by members of Parliament in the House. It is an abdication of 
their responsibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, to answer the question asked by the 
hon. member, I would like to say that we will all work in 
committees, but it is federal expenditures as a whole that need to 
be examined. At the moment, I think this task is divided among 
various committees, but our motion goes way beyond the study 
of a particular area of expenditure by a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member's comments 
and I agree with her that overlap and duplication are two 
different concepts. We talk about overlap as if it was the same 
thing as duplication. The latter can imply waste of money, but 
the former is not unusual in a federation like Canada.
<P>
	According to our Constitution, there are only two areas that I 
can think of where there is no duplication and they are postal 
services and defence. In all other areas, duplication is a fact of 
life in a federation. We will try to eliminate waste as much as 
possible, waste being the unjustifiable spending of public 
money. I agree with the hon. member that we should try to 
eliminate duplication.
<P>
	However, I would remind her that it is not easy to get rid of 
overlaps. As chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for 
three years, I had tried to convince the previous government, 
and maybe members of this House, that it was worth letting the 
Auditor General table reports on specific issues as he saw fit to 
draw the attention of members of Parliament to administrative 
problems.
<P>
	Maybe the hon. member did not know it, but I submitted a bill 
to this House, Bill C-207, I think, which would have allowed the 
Auditor General to table reports on selected issues whenever he 
wanted. Right now, he can only table one annual report. The hon. 
member is right when she says that it is quite thick and 
sometimes difficult to read, and that even the committee finds it 
difficult to act on its recommendations. Would the hon. member 
and her party support a measure like the one I advocated to 
authorize the Auditor General to table reports on selected issues 
whenever he wants?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not against the principle but 
we must study the question further. As for duplication, the hon. 
member is right, some duplication is unavoidable. We try to 
eliminate duplication in order to reduce costs, to save money, to 
become more efficient.
<P>
	This is not the case now in several areas and I think that you 
are well aware that that situation has been with us for many 
years. It is high time to empower a special committee to study 
all those questions, all forms of waste. Such a committee could, 
for the first time, I think, be very effective and it could produce 
fresh new solutions and maybe an alternative to the system we 
use presently to manage public funds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
occasion of the first substantial speech I have the opportunity to 
make in this House, I would like first of all to greet all the 
constituents of the riding of Châteauguay. Nestled by the 
borders of Quebec, Ontario and the United States, this part of the 
area called Montérégie is located southwest of Montreal. 
Previously made up of rural towns and villages, this riding has 
become over the years one of the suburbs of the largest French 
metropolis in North America.
<P>
	In the west of the riding lies the city of Châteauguay with a 
population of about 40,000 people who for the most part work on 
the island of Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In the east, there is a group of towns that have become 
industrial centres. In the south, some other towns were able to 
save farmlands from urban development. The northern part of 
the riding is taken up by the Mohawk reserve.
<P>
	In the riding of Châteauguay, we know what federal presence 
means. It means the St. Lawrence Seaway and, through it, the 
demise of the port of Montreal; it means the development of 
Sarnia, in Ontario, through the transfer of the petrochemical 
industry from the east end of Montreal; it means the Kahnawake 
reserve and the closing of the Mercier bridge during the Indian 
crisis in the summer of 1990. It also meant war measures in 1970 
and conscription for the two world wars, and I could go on.
<P>
	For many years, the federal presence has meant only trouble, 
worry, indecisiveness, lack of determination and, most of all, 
poor management of public funds. That is why so many 
Quebecers are increasingly looking at sovereignty for Quebec.
<P>
	At a time when the deficit is reaching proportions beyond the 
comprehension of most people, all of us here in this House are 
challenged to resolve this monstrous problem. Citizens have 
lost confidence in the capacity of governments to control 
expenditures. We do not have any grace period to regain that 
confidence. We must act now and act effectively. From now on 
we will have to live within our means and our capacity to pay.
<P>
	Yesterday the Bloc Quebecois caucus had the opportunity to 
meet the Conseil du patronat du Québec. Established in 1969, 
this group of employers has 547 members, 430 of which are 
corporations or associations actively involved in developing 
Quebec economy. That most influential organization told us 
about its concerns with regard to public spending, among other 
things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1168"> 1168 </A></B>
<P>
	Where does the Bloc Quebecois stand? Despite the heavier tax 
burden we experienced in the last few years, it seems that 
federal expenditures always exceed revenues by over $35 billion 
each year. It does not seem possible to increase the tax burden 
any further.
<P>
	We should therefore have a look at expenditures and tax 
loopholes. In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois will support every 
proposal to better manage our public expenditures and lower the 
annual deficit. The Bloc Quebecois appeals once more to this 
government to scrutinize all budgetary items.
<P>
	First of all, we should eliminate duplication, consolidate 
administrative units and bring about the decentralization of 
powers. Second, we should implement the corrective measures 
recommended each year by the Auditor General, whose reports 
always point out situations where billions of dollars of public 
money are wasted both in program spending and tax 
expenditures. Take for example foreign investments by 
corporations which are always mentioned since 1986.
<P>
	We should then reexamine and eventually abolish special 
privileges granted to the wealthy through family trusts, on 
which the Department of Finance will not give any information 
whatsoever. Fourth, we should hand over to Quebec jurisdiction 
over manpower and training. We should also cut 25 per cent of 
the defence budget. That could save nearly $3 billion without 
putting the security of Canada or Quebec in jeopardy.
<P>
	The Conseil du patronat du Québec supports the Bloc 
Quebecois position that duplication should be eliminated. The 
Conseil also agrees with the Bloc Quebecois that the whole field 
of manpower training should be transferred to Quebec.
<P>
	In my capacity as the official opposition critic for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, I will endorse the Bloc 
Quebecois position concerning that department and its mandate. 
The total estimated budget of that department for the fiscal year 
1993-94 alone stands at $2.1 billion. Of this amount, close to 
$700 million is earmarked for health care, a third of all 
spending.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	According to the 1993-94 estimates for Veterans Affairs 
Canada, health care claims have been on an unprecedented rise 
in the last few years. The reason for this is that veterans are 
getting much older, triggering higher administrative and 
financial costs.
<P>
	These trends confirm that this department is taking more and 
more hospital space. In the last four years, health care costs went 
up in excess of 59 per cent. A third of the budget is spent on 
services already provided by Health and Welfare Canada and the 
Quebec department of health and social services. Hospital care 
is one of the areas where overlapping of government services is 
most frequent. We must ask ourselves if this duplication is 
really necessary or if the provinces could not simply take over 
hospitals which are now managed by the federal government.
<P>
	What makes these services so different from those provided 
by provincial hospitals? What sets veterans apart from the rest 
of the population? We are proposing a solution to reduce public 
spending without diminishing the quality and the amount of 
services. It is the kind of solution that must be looked at, and that 
the Bloc strongly advocates because the situation calls for it.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the government cannot increase 
taxes, directly or indirectly. It must, however, do everything it 
can to reduce the annual deficit. Consequently, there is no other 
choice. It must cut public spending, but in an intelligent way so 
as to not hit the needy, the poor, and even all those in the middle 
class who work so hard to earn a living in this country.
<P>
	I repeat that the government has to eliminate duplication of 
services and waste public funds. This is why so many Quebecers 
see in Quebec's sovereignty the only solution which will help 
save Canada from bankruptcy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just heard some the remarks of the opposite 
member. He was talking about the veterans and the few 
institutions established to help them. Do I understand that he 
advocates the closing of the institution in 
Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue? Did I hear him right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comments. No, it is certainly not our intention to close the 
institution in Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue. In fact, we simply want 
to thoroughly review the whole system for the veterans at 
federal level and see if it would be possible to put an end to 
duplication of services in order to provide the same services to 
the veterans or to the general population in the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but I still did not quite 
understand the member's comments. Earlier, he was calling 
these kinds of things a duplication. If I understood him 
correctly, and I will check <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow, he said that there 
was no reason why veterans deserved to have a different service 
than others. Does he not believe that veterans deserve at least 
some special consideration? If this is not his position, I would 
ask him to take this opportunity to correct what he said a little 
earlier today.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but that is not what I 
said. Indeed, I said-and you can verify that when you read the 
<I>Hansard</I>-we should maintain the same services and the same 
volumes. What I am simply saying is that we have identical 
organizations and systems, both on the federal and the 
provincial side, that are providing the same services. The same 
goes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1169"> 1169 </A></B>
<P>
for hospitals. We could give the same services to veterans 
without requiring two organizations to head the hospitals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Châteauguay for his first speech in 
the House. When he was first describing his riding, I thought he 
was talking about mine.
<P>
	We do have many standing committees in the House. Maybe 
the standing committees did not work like they should have in 
the past. My lesson in life is not to look too far back but try to go 
forward. There are over 200 new members in the House. 
Coincidentally it is almost half and half on either side of the 
House. Although some members might have been affiliated with 
the previous government they are not here in great numbers any 
more.
<P>
	I think the hon. member used the words ``if we act 
intelligently''. I would ask the member if we all act intelligently 
on all our standing committees and are very cognizant of the fact 
that we have a mandate and a budget in each of the committees, 
would that not enable us to take a better look at how we are 
spending our moneys?
<P>
	Also, with respect to the public accounts committee the 
chairman is a member of the opposition as has been mentioned 
over and over again. The committee's effectiveness and whether 
or not things are done properly over the next 12 months will be 
recorded in the next Auditor General's report. Is that not the 
challenge we have now with the public accounts committee as 
chaired by the opposition, to perform better than in the past 
especially since we have 200 new members in the House?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague, it is 
often said that the past guarantees the future. But if I look back 
in the past, I see that we are now facing a $500 billion deficit. 
And the existing system does not correct the present situation. 
What we want, what we are proposing is not another standing 
committee, but the striking of a special committee that could 
perhaps allow the existing committee to straighten up, so that 
we could really take the corrective measures that the Auditor 
General has been recommending for several years and that have 
still not been taken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak on this motion today.
<P>
	As members in the House have heard, the President of the 
Treasury Board has already commented on the benefit we are 
already taking of the advice and analysis of the Auditor General 
to improve the way we do things as a government. At the same 
time we welcome the scrutiny that the public accounts 
committee will bring to the report of the Auditor General and to 
other operations of government. We look forward to its advice 
on how we can make even further progress.
<P>
	To this point in the debate we have talked about money. There 
is no doubt that the preoccupation of many of us in the House 
and of many Canadians is how we can move toward a balanced 
budget and how we can better control our spending and ensure 
value for those dollars that we do spend in terms of service to 
Canadians and the programs our country counts on.
<P>
	I want to depart on a somewhat different track to simply say 
that while we deliver programs and services with money 
mandated by this Parliament, they are delivered by the people 
who work for the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to have this opportunity to set out today plans of 
the government to renew the Government of Canada. My 
colleague, the President of the Queen's Privy Council and 
minister responsible for federal-provincial relations, has set out 
a plan which he aptly calls ``Getting Government Right''.
<P>
	Unlike the previous government which felt it could use the 
public service as the brunt of all its problems, without affecting 
the services Canadians have come to depend on, we are working 
closely with our employees to develop new and innovative ways 
of cutting costs. I intend to talk particularly about our plans to 
give them the tools to do their jobs in a more efficient and 
effective way.
<P>
	Unlike the previous government we believe government can 
be a force for good in society. By working together with federal 
public servants and by establishing a harmonious working 
relationship with our employees we can produce the solid results 
the previous government found so elusive. We can reduce waste. 
We can eliminate obsolete functions. We can improve services 
to taxpayers and create a more productive government.
<P>
	We have one of the most respected public services in the 
world. Federal public service employees are ready to rise to the 
challenge of the coming years.
<P>
	Under the previous government, Canadians became 
increasingly alienated from their government. The sense of 
cynicism and distrust was reaching crisis proportions that were 
beginning to threaten the health of our democracy and our future 
prosperity. How can we manage our country's affairs or bring 
people together to face tough issues when Canadians have so 
little confidence in the country's decision makers and the 
decision making process?
<P>
	The problems we face today, the heavy debt load left behind 
by the previous government, the dropout rate in our schools, the 
need to get Canadians back to work, the need to improve our 
competitiveness in the global economy, all are crying for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1170"> 1170 </A></B>
<P>
innovative approaches and fresh solutions. We have to change 
the way we have done business in the past.
<P>
	Let me set out some of the recent innovations the federal 
public service has developed to provide affordable, accessible 
and responsive services and programs to Canadian citizens. It 
truly is an impressive list and members will be as impressed as I 
am with the quality of the public service we have working for us.
<P>
	First we are harnessing the computing and networking power 
of new technologies to improve services to Canadians. There are 
enormous opportunities for the government to improve its 
services and program delivery through innovative use of 
information technologies and we are tapping them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By its very nature, the government is focused on services and 
uses large quantities of data whether for the payment of family 
allowances, pensions and UI benefits or for the delivery of 
health and safety services. Income tax, scientific research and 
statistic programs, for example, need very complex information 
systems. At the same time, substantial improvements in 
government efficiency, in the quality of services and in the 
reduction of related administration cost can be achieved by 
using the new technologies to manage information and design 
systems.
<P>
	Recent technological developments in information 
management systems have considerably reduced the cost of 
applications while increasing their effectiveness and efficiency. 
With the new technologies it is now possible to collect, store, 
manage and distribute data with a high degree of efficiency. The 
ability to obtain accurate data in a very short period of time 
provides us with tools to improve service and decision-making.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are managing this unprecedented rate of change in a way 
that taps the creative and organizational skills of federal public 
service employees. They play a vital role in shaping the human 
face of government and in making government a force for good 
in the economy of the country. Public service employees are 
rising to the challenge.
<P>
	To give an example of the kinds of changes taking place in the 
public service, one just has to look at the typical work station of 
a government employee. Today microcomputers are used by one 
out of every three government employees and networks linking 
them are expanding rapidly. Program operations and service 
delivery are becoming increasingly dependent on information 
technology.
<P>
	The challenge now is to bring our present systems up to date 
and adapt them to the new applications which are emerging. We 
have developed a plan for doing so. It is a comprehensive, 
integrated approach to modernizing government services and 
program delivery mechanisms through the use of enabling 
technology.
<P>
	In the next few weeks the Treasury Board secretariat will be 
sending out for consultation a draft blueprint for government 
service renewal. We are asking government employees and 
private sector suppliers to government to comment on the plan. 
That is a very important step in our transition from paper driven 
bureaucratic processes to modern, efficient, electronically 
linked business transactions. It is people who can turn ambitious 
plans into reality.
<P>
	We are building partnerships with our employees. We are 
building partnerships between government departments, 
between the federal government and its clients and between the 
federal government and the Canadian public.
<P>
	Employees want to know how they can fit into a new and more 
efficient way of delivering services. They want to know how 
they can contribute to this important goal. The plan sets out a 
vision for a new way of doing business and lets employees 
contribute where their skills are most needed.
<P>
	A key principle in the plan is the recognition that the role of 
government must be dramatically reassessed to live within 
shrinking budgets.
<P>
	Another is that we can improve the way services are 
delivered. To do this we are creating a learning culture in the 
public service that supports employees in their transition to new 
ways of doing business. We are committed to enhancing the 
knowledge, skills and active participation of employees. We 
believe in partnerships. The advent of computer based 
networking means that we are becoming increasingly 
interdependent and so it is only logical that partnerships 
between the various players must be the starting point of any 
initiative. The blueprint for government service renewal reflects 
this.
<P>
	Program renewal projects are already under way in agencies 
such as Revenue Canada, Health Canada, and Human Resources 
Development Canada. These will serve as models. Revenue 
Canada , for instance, is introducing a single business 
registration number for corporations paying taxes, duties and 
GST. This number will make it possible to have a single window 
access to Revenue Canada and to file and submit a consolidated 
net payment. In a number of areas in a number of departments 
single window access has the potential to be a major 
improvement for people dealing with the federal government.
<P>
	A government-wide telecommunications network 
infrastructure will mean that federal public service employees 
will be able 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1171"> 1171 </A></B>
<P>
to contact colleagues anywhere in Canada by electronic mail. 
The infrastructure will set the stage for delivering public 
services electronically and it  will trigger significant efficiency 
gains and reduce duplication of networking facilities.
<P>
	The real payoff from these innovations comes through the 
synthesis of organizational innovation with technological 
innovation. Viewing information as a strategic resource that 
infuses every dimension of government operations and 
employing information technology in government to achieve the 
public sector equivalent of competitive advantage provides a 
framework for this synthesis.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Everyone in the House today will agree when I say that the 
remaining years of this century will be a period of significant 
challenge for Canada. A growing and increasingly diverse 
population, continuing global economic transition and rapidly 
changing public priorities will require that the government 
adapt existing programs and create new ones that are more 
productive, require fewer public resources and increase the 
timeliness and convenience of public services. Thoughtful 
strategic uses of information technology will mean the 
difference between well managed effective programs and 
programs that are a public encumbrance.
<P>
	Let me give the House a look at what it will be like to do 
business with the government in a few years. What will work be 
like from the perspective of a federal government employee?
<P>
	First, the information people need to do their jobs will be 
available at their fingertips. The public will have direct access 
to government information from its homes. Electronic libraries 
will be available from libraries and stores. The government will 
publish a catalogue of software that will be available free or for 
licensing to the private sector and the public. Service providers 
will be able to make rapid, on the spot decisions supported by 
information systems which provide immediate access to all 
required information and expertise.
<P>
	Far fetched? Not at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians will be able to access personalized services, 7 days 
a week and 24 hours a day, through terminals-similar to 
automatic teller machines-installed in convenient locations or 
through personal computers. Regular communication between 
government and the private sector as well as within government 
itself will soon be electronic. This will be reality very shortly. 
Consider, for example, how quickly Canadians got used to 
automatic tellers once they realized how convenient they were.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The computer will become just another household appliance, 
as commonplace as a refrigerator or a stove. It will be able to 
recognize voice messages, handwriting, be able to communicate 
with pictures. We will take it for granted. Employees will use 
computers even more widely in their work. They will routinely 
create spread sheets,  retrieve information from data bases and 
produce charts and diagrams. Computer assisted translation will 
support and enhance employees' language abilities, thus 
improving service to the Canadian public. This is not science 
fiction.
<P>
	The government's strategy for moving forward aims to take 
advantage of five key trends. Employee's attitudes to 
technology are rapidly changing. Their knowledge, proficiency 
and confidence are improving at a rapid rate. Employees no 
longer resist technology. They want more of it and want to be 
better trained to apply it. The public is getting used to electronic 
service and is asking to be served in this way. New entrants to 
the workforce who have grown up with technology expect to use 
it in their jobs.
<P>
	It will be much easier to obtain information. Knowledge will 
be available via expert systems to answer queries as a specialist 
might. New applications will be less costly and more timely due 
to the use of packaged systems or modern system development 
products and it is getting easier all the time. The ability to 
manage text, graphics, data, sound, video and pictures in the 
same data base will change the way information is used. The 
ability to access multiple data bases easily will contribute to this 
change as well.
<P>
	Why is it so important to move in this direction? It means 
improved delivery of service to the public, significantly 
improved productivity in the public service and increased 
international competitiveness in a global economy. Partnership 
with other levels of government, with business, with labour is 
how it will be achieved. The government's vision for 
information management is the orderly transition to a seamless 
technological environment in the home or in the workplace at 
the service of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	I add as well that the Auditor General in his report placed 
great emphasis on the importance of information for 
parliamentarians. In our decision making we rely increasingly 
on rapidly available and accurate, well analysed information. 
The technological revolution that we see in the way government 
services will be delivered will also be a technological revolution 
in the kind of information that will be available to us as 
parliamentarians to make decisions as we move into a new 
world.
<P>
	In closing I would like to quote Peter Drucker: ``Every few 
hundred years throughout western history a sharp 
transformation has occurred. In a matter of decades society 
altogether rearranges itself: its world view, its basic values, its 
social and political structures, its arts, its key institutions. Fifty 
years later a new world exists. And the people born into that 
world cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1172"> 1172 </A></B>
<P>
even imagine the world in which their grandparents lived and 
into which their own parents were born''.
<P>
	We are going to be ready for that new world because in the 
words of all my colleagues in our cabinet, we are getting 
government right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to the hon. member's comments and to other 
comments in the House this morning on the motion by the Bloc 
Quebecois to appoint a special committee that would carry out 
an exhaustive and expeditious review of all public spending by 
the federal government.
<P>
	I do not think hon. members opposite understood the Bloc's 
motion. I think they are acting irresponsibly by rejecting out of 
hand a very responsible request, a request made repeatedly by 
the Bloc Quebecois since the morning of October 26, and I think 
the people who elected the members opposite are starting to 
regret their decision.
<P>
	We do not want the special committee to look at everything 
through the magnifying glass of the Public Accounts 
Committee, consider every spending item and make a summary 
analysis. The Auditor General pointed out in his second report 
that year after year, the Public Accounts Committee's report was 
limited and fragmented in scope, because Parliament did not 
receive all the information it needed from the departments. That 
is what the Auditor General said in his report.
<P>
	In fact there has never been a special committee to conduct an 
exhaustive study of the overlap between federal and provincial 
activities.
<P>
	What we want is for a special committee to take an in-depth 
and responsible look at the very structure of public spending. If 
the Public Accounts Committee had been so good at 
streamlining and restructuring public spending, we would not be 
where we are today, with a cumulative debt of $507 billion and a 
deficit that may reach $46 billion this year.
<P>
	Yesterday, I put the same request to the Minister of Finance in 
the finance committee, when I asked for an exhaustive review of 
the Canadian tax system. Incidentally, the minister answered 
that their priority was to examine the problems connected with 
the GST and the alternatives to the GST. The committee was 
looking at a specific and current problem-whether or not to 
replace the GST-instead of conducting an exhaustive review of 
the Canadian tax system, something we want the committee to 
do in addition to having a special committee on public spending.
<P>
	We must realize that the public accounts committee is not able 
to carry out this kind of exhaustive review, especially with 
respect to program overlap, as the Auditor General pointed out. 
Take our request seriously and stop dismissing it as if this were a 
very prosperous and efficiently run country that did not need 
thorough structural change. If it was a private company, it would 
have gone broke long ago.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, if members on this side of the 
House do not understand the motion, perhaps members on the 
other side of the House failed to explain it properly, but it is 
quite clear when you read it.
<P>
	The mandate the motion wants to give this new committee 
happens to be the mandate of the public accounts committee. In 
fact, the committee can do exactly what the motion requests. If 
the committee needs more resources, that is an issue the new 
chairperson, a member of the Bloc Quebecois, will be able to 
discuss with committee members.
<P>
	And I am sure that committee members are listening carefully 
to the proceedings in the House today. I understand perfectly 
what the hon. member means. There is a need for a thorough 
review of our present systems for providing information to 
members and for evaluating our programs. In fact, in line with 
the mandate of the President of the Treasury Board, new efforts 
are being made in this respect, and the same minister is 
responsible for the Privy Council Office.
<P>
	I am sure the public accounts committee will be delighted 
with this opportunity to consider its agenda for the coming 
months. I may add that the committee is the master of its own 
affairs, decides what it wants to consider and reports to 
Parliament when it wishes to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the member's speech. She gave us a impressive 
image of the training within public service, she listed all the 
services, and let me use her own word, the affordable services 
she can offer to the population with this new technology.
<P>
	But the hon. member never said a word about the Bloc's 
motion proposing the review of an existing committee or the 
creation of a new one to examine public expenditures. In answer 
to my colleague's question, the hon. member finally addressed 
the motion for the first time a while ago but she spoke about 
everything else but that.
<P>
	This morning, I took part in a preliminary meeting, the first 
meeting of the transport committee. Let us look at the 
committees' expenditures. There are 20 House committees and 
out of total expenditures of approximately $2 million, about 
$592,000 are spent on public consultations of experts, friends of 
the government, et cetera. The committee we want to create 
would prevent such useless spending.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1173"> 1173 </A></B>
<P>
	Are we not, as members of this House, the most suitable and 
accessible group if committees want to consult anyone? That 
makes all the difference. As for the public accounts committee, 
its actual mandate is simply to check on certain elements. It does 
not analyze thoroughly the Auditor General's report or 
recommendations. We would only have to determine the exact 
difference between that committee and the new one which would 
look especially at expenditures. I would like to know the 
member's opinion on the motion of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would certainly like to make a 
comment.
<P>
	I hope the member opposite recognizes that the motion deals 
directly with the importance of information, efficiency and 
effectiveness. The information I provided this House today in 
my speech deals exactly with those issues. The government is 
already implementing measures to improve information, 
efficiency and effectiveness so that the very point of the motion 
is taken care of and so that we may improve the ability of this 
House, its members and committees to make better decisions in 
the best interests of the public, the financial situation and the 
future of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
you know, as a political Party, the Bloc Quebecois, has 
committed itself to defend the interests of Quebec and, as the 
Official Opposition, it has committed itself to responsibly and 
effectively assume this role.
<P>
	In this context, I want you to be assured, Mr. Speaker, that we 
are going to make constant, accurate and regular efforts to see 
that this government abides by the commitments made in its 
famous red book.
<P>
	With regard to this debate on the creation of a special 
committee with a mandate to evaluate the various programs, I 
would like to highlight some deficiencies of the Canadian 
federal system which are at the root of the poor management of 
this country and of its financial crisis. I refer in particular to the 
shortcomings of the evaluation process as applied to 
government programs.
<P>
	Given the weakness of this mecanism which allows to 
systematically verify in each department the efficiency and the 
viability of government programs-the legacy of the Trudeau 
and the Mulroney eras-the Bloc Quebecois wants to proceed to 
a detailed evaluation of the government spending programs.
<P>
	In our view, program evaluation must meet three basic needs 
of any administration which has self-respect and knows how to 
efficiently defend itself. First, the information collected 
through such evaluation measures is used for clarifying the 
decision making process regarding the allocation of ressources, 
making it more efficient. Second, these measures help 
Quebecers and Canadians to decide on the return from tax 
revenues. Finally, such measures make civil servants 
responsible  not only for the implementation of the procedures, 
but also for the results achieved.
<P>
	At present, the Treasury Board policy on evaluation consists 
of two elements. A self-evaluation made by the departments and 
a process directed by a central authority which has the mandate 
to establish priorities, provide technical assistance and monitor 
the evaluations made by departments. Therefore, evaluations 
are already being made by some departments but the monitoring 
part is far from brilliant.
<P>
	There are two main problems related to program evaluation in 
Canada. First, the resources allotted to a department to make 
such evaluations and thus increase the return on public 
investments are clearly insufficient.
<P>
	Let me give some examples which speak for themselves. 
Between 1989-90 and 1991-92, the expenditures related to 
program evaluations went down 28 per cent which, as a result, 
has led to a reduction in the number of program evaluations 
since 1987-88. Indeed, 99 program evaluation reports were 
produced in 1987-88 compared to only 80 in 1991-92. Most 
importantly, during the latter period, government expenditures 
for 16 programs totalled $124.5 billion. Only two of those 
programs were examined thoroughly. By the way, the Trudeau 
and Mulroney administrations never gave any special attention 
to major programs. Evaluations do not focus on programs with 
the greatest expenditures. It is estimated that programs with 
expenditures of less than $250 million were evaluated twice as 
much compared to those spending more than that amount.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I must underline that according to 1991-92 figures, 
evaluations done on a seven-year period focused on 24 per cent 
of program spending. If we take into account the cost of debt 
service, evaluations were on only 18 per cent of expenditures 
over a seven-year period. Also, starting with 1991-92 figures, 
evaluations done over that period focused on only 24 per cent of 
program spending.
<P>
	A second problem with governmental program evaluation has 
to do with the quality of controls regarding the evolution of 
those programs. By placing evaluation services within 
departments, we have given the immediate needs of managers 
precedence over those of the government and the public. How? 
They neglect the basic role of program evaluation which is to 
ascertain program effectiveness and question them if necessary, 
for the sole purpose of allowing for optimal allocation of 
resources.
<P>
	In fact, the evaluations cover operational aspects only and in 
no way determine the programs' relevance or 
cost-effectiveness. The Canadian public service, as well as any 
Western bureaucracy, is rather self-sufficient and very resistant 
political interference in its methods of operation. There is no 
systematic evaluation of programs involving more than one 
department. The House of Commons could establish a system to 
that effect as a  symbol of the involvement of the population in 
the political 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1174"> 1174 </A></B>
<P>
life of the state of Quebec and of Canada, at least if one believes 
in democratic representation.
<P>
	With such a huge deficit and a rather anemic economic 
recovery, it is essential that the existing resources be allocated 
and used as efficiently as possible. I am sure you will agree, Mr. 
Speaker, that in such a context, program evaluation becomes 
essential. Without effective program evaluation, the 
government is just not able to best allocate its resources. In fact, 
parliamentarians are asked to work in the dark, and to allocate 
resources without knowing what the situation really is.
<P>
	The Auditor General said in his report that ``In the 1990s, 
program evaluation should be seen as crucial to the management 
of government expenditures, because it can help to arrive at 
informed decisions aimed at controlling growth of the public 
debt''. Therein lies our problem.
<P>
	By comparison, the United Kingdom, Australia and the 
United States have adopted an external evaluation system for 
government programs. For example, in the United States all 
evaluation reports are made public and they are often presented 
directly to Congress. In addition, Congress can request 
evaluation reports on programs that it wishes to review. Which 
means that the legislature has control over the evaluation 
process.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Again in the United States the general accounting office 
handles requests for and submits evaluation reports to Congress.
<P>
	In the United Kingdom managers are responsible for meeting 
performance objectives, while in Australia, evaluations are used 
in the budget-making process.
<P>
	In 1978 the public accounts committee recommended that 
evaluation results be tabled in the House within 60 days after the 
evaluations were completed. In 1983-listen to this, Mr. 
Speaker-only one single study was tabled.
<P>
	Is this the mark of a conscientious, efficient government 
administration? Is it not, rather, the trademark of the Liberal 
Party of Canada? Will the newly announced national 
infrastructure program, which is being touted as the saviour of 
the Canadian economy, be subject to an evaluation? Will it be 
based on effective management criteria? I doubt it. The Auditor 
General's report has already been forgotten and evaluation 
criteria will be defined later, or so we are told.
<P>
	To stop this waste of public funds, the Bloc Quebecois is 
calling for strong action. It wants the House to press the 
government to strike a special parliamentary committee made 
up of all official parties. The committee would have a mandate 
to review federal government expenditures in light of the report 
of the Auditor General of Canada, as well as overlap between 
provincial and federal programs.
<P>
	The opposition is making this proposal in a spirit of 
transparency and openness, as it would provide for the public 
scrutiny of official matters. The committee would have the 
power to call witnesses if it felt their testimony would be useful.
<P>
	We are proposing that this committee, which could be called 
the standing committee on program evaluation, report before 
June 23, 1994, and that the government undertake to give a 
formal response to this report by tabling its response to the 
committee's recommendations on the first sitting day of the 
1994 fall session of this House.
<P>
	The Official Opposition is presenting a constructive proposal 
aimed at achieving the objectives put forward by the Liberal 
government in its red book, namely ensuring transparency, 
restoring the image of politicians and allowing for greater 
involvement of members of Parliament in the affairs of 
government and of the House.
<P>
	This proposal constitutes a formal invitation from the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Official Opposition, to the Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would have a question for the hon. member. I greatly 
appreciated his remarks and his idea of setting up another House 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Another one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I think we have all the committees we need. We 
have the public accounts committee, the chairperson of which 
will be appointed by the Official Opposition. It could examine 
all these matters the hon. member raised, matters which are 
really important to all Canadians. This committee is responsible 
for dealing with the Report of the Auditor General. I wonder 
why the hon. member could not start examining that report as 
well as the programs he mentioned in his speech when this 
committee is convened.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response 
to this question, considering the long experience of the hon. 
member, I will say this: we must improve transparency. The 
Auditor General himself indicated in his report that he had been 
unable to obtain some information. So, what we are proposing is 
not ``committeeitis'' so to speak, but one committee with the 
power to obtain all the information. That is what our proposal is 
about. If you want transparency, set up a committee that will 
have access to all the information.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1175"> 1175 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I acknowledge the member's passion with which he 
speaks in this debate this morning. He refers to the 
infrastructure program and is highly critical of the fact that we 
will not be monitoring and watching it as carefully as we might.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not have confidence that the 
municipalities in the province of Quebec can administer these 
programs and deliver what is best for the citizens of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for her comment and question. We have every 
confidence that the municipalities in the province of Quebec 
will administer their share of the third of this program.
<P>
	If, as the hon. member pointed out, there is so much passion in 
my speech, it is because we are dealing with initiatives that eat 
up billions of dollars and must be examined against the 
background of an enormous deficit and the absence of any real 
audit and evaluation programs. A mere 25 per cent of 
expenditures have been submitted to program evaluation in 
seven years. This is an indication that we must act and set up a 
special committee which will be able to examine all 
expenditures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House sit until 1:05 
p.m. so that hon. members can ask me questions after my 
speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request of the hon. member for Jonquière. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion put 
forward by the Official Opposition calls for the creation of a 
special parliamentary committee with a mandate to examine 
public expenditures by the federal government. These are the 
expenditures related to the various programs implemented by 
departments and Crown corporations with billions of taxpayers' 
dollars.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of Parliament to determine whether 
taxpayers' money is being spent wisely. During the last election 
campaign, the Bloc Quebecois argued that a review of public 
spending was urgently needed. The idea of a special 
parliamentary committee responsible for this task was 
extremely well received in my constituency. People want to 
know. They see around them examples of misspent public funds. 
They read in the newspapers horror stories on public spending.
<P>
	Like other Canadians and Quebecers, the people in my 
constituency are aware that the government does not have much 
leeway in financial matters and they know that we must 
contemplate drastic cuts in spending.
<P>
	While taxpayers want the federal government to cut spending, 
they are opposed to hasty, systematic, arbitrary cuts that may 
have disastrous consequences, especially for the poorest in our 
society.
<P>
	Parliament, being responsible for the public purse, must 
screen public expenditures. Some are essential, others 
necessary, many undoubtedly useful, but some are unnecessary 
in today's context and must be eliminated.
<P>
	The proposed committee could be responsible for this 
analysis of expenditures and report to Parliament, who would 
then be able to set objectives to reduce spending and justify 
these objectives to the people affected by the cuts.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	This is an emergency measure because the situation requires 
it. The present procedures and control methods have been shown 
to be ineffective. Those who claim that this duplicates the Public 
Accounts Committee are mistaken. The mandate of the 
proposed committee is broader and, given the situation, it is 
almost a public salvation committee which could force 
managers to open their books and even go so far as to suggest a 
restructuring of public spending in Canada.
<P>
	The mandate of the committee which we propose would be to 
review all spending related to government programs. The 
Auditor General's latest report gives us many examples of 
programs that could be examined.
<P>
	As an illustration, see what the auditor concluded after 
examining the Canadian aboriginal economic development 
strategy program, for which the government has spent not less 
than $900 million since 1989. I am interested in this program 
because I am a member of the Standing Committee on Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	This program was run by three departments: Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, Employment and Immigration, and 
Industry, Science and Technology. The overall purpose of the 
program was to reduce economic disparities between native 
people and other Canadians and Quebecers, a laudable goal 
which no one can criticize. The aim was to help native 
communities become economically self-sufficient. If you know 
the social and economic situation of native people, you will 
agree that it is urgent. We must act so that there are no more 
Davis Inlets in Canada.
<P>
	Was this highly laudable goal reached? No one can say, 
according to the Auditor General. The three departments could 
not show that the funding methods used and the amounts 
allocated were appropriate. The departments concerned could 
not prove that they met the goals of the strategy.
<P>
	In short, after spending $900 million, Parliament does not 
know if the employment rate and income have increased among 
native people, if a reasonable number of new businesses were 
started, if the native people are less dependent on welfare. Nor 
does Parliament know if  native communities are better able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1176"> 1176 </A></B>
<P>
manage their affairs. In other words, we spent $900 million and 
we have to say, ``Let us hope that it was effective''. But in 
practice we cannot say that it was.
<P>
	Let us be clear on this. The program may have been a great 
success, but Parliament, Canadians and Quebecers have no idea 
that it was. Should we eliminate programs of this kind in the 
native community? We do not know; we are not in a position to 
make a decision. Or, on the contrary, should we increase the 
amounts allocated to reach the goal of economic equality among 
native people, Canadians and Quebecers? No one knows.
<P>
	Much more important, were the native people sufficiently 
involved in the process? No one knows because in the days when 
Parliament could be satisfied just to send money to the reserves 
and say that we did what we had to do are long gone. The 
government announced that native self-government would take 
effect in the coming months. Thus, we must ensure that the 
people who will have self-government can look after 
themselves, by giving them training, experience and programs 
to help them prepare for it.
<P>
	A special committee like the one we propose could help 
Parliament answer all the questions for which I just said we had 
no answer.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Parliament must be informed, it is only just. Just for the 
taxpayers whom we represent, and just for the program 
recipients whom we also represent.
<P>
	The people for whom these programs were designed do not 
have to suffer the shame of being accused of illegally receiving 
the taxpayers' money. We often blame the recipient, the welfare 
recipient, the unemployed, the health care consumer for abusing 
the system.
<P>
	As usual, someone is being made the scapegoat. We see the 
horrifying practice whereby victims even start feeling guilty. 
Blaming recipients for spending public funds is easy, whereas 
the onus is in fact on Parliament and managers to act so that the 
taxpayers' money is spent wisely.
<P>
	Those who were in charge of ensuring that public funds were 
well spent in Canada did not do their job. The result of their 
carelessness is a catastrophic public debt and stronger biases 
against government program recipients, for example, health 
care consumers and welfare recipients and unemployed 
Canadians.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that, to continue performing 
their duty, taxpayers must be sure that their money is well spent. 
They must be convinced that public funds are not being wasted, 
that cuts will be made where they should be. A committee such 
as the one proposed must be able to do the proper analysis, 
thereby allowing Parliament to implement the necessary budget 
measures, to put the public finances in order and to restore the 
confidence of Canadians in their representatives.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been listening 
for several hours to the members of the Official Opposition, and 
I do not understand what is going on. I will explain what I mean 
and then I would like to get some answers from the hon. member 
for Jonquière.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposes the setting up of a new special 
committee to address issues which are already being looked at 
by standing committees of the House. Is this an indication that, 
even though the existing standing committees of the House have 
not yet started their work, the members of the Official 
Opposition do not trust them?
<P>
	I also want to refer to a motion tabled in the House earlier this 
week by the Minister of Human Resources Development, which 
said: ``That the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development be directed to consult broadly, to analyse, and to 
make recommendations regarding the modernization and 
restructuring of Canada's social security system-''
<P>
	This motion to modernize programs was approved by 216 
members, while 52 were against it. Who objected to a 
comprehensive review of social programs which are just as 
necessary to Quebecers as they are to the rest of Canada? I look 
forward to the answers of the hon. member for Jonquière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will provide two examples of 
issues which this committee could examine and which are not 
currently being looked at. There is the matter of overlapping, for 
instance. As someone involved in the movement for Quebec's 
sovereignty for more than 20 years, I have seen every day 
examples of overlapping of federal and provincial services. I 
have yet to see a comprehensive study, whether by the public 
accounts committee or another committee of the federal 
government, on this issue. I have never seen any such study.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	There is also another type of issue which this special 
committee could look at. As you know, Quebec and Ontario have 
their own police force, while the other provinces rely on the 
RCMP. To what extent do Ontario and Quebec taxpayers 
subsidize the police force elsewhere in the country? We would 
like an answer to that question and to the fact that some 
expenditures paid by certain segments of the population do not 
directly benefit them.
<P>
	Essentially, what we want is not a technical or technocratic 
committee but, rather, a political committee which, on behalf of 
the public, would examine government spending and say to a 
minister that his department spent so many dollars on such and 
such a program, then ask him to justify that spending. And if the 
spending is justified we, politicians, will tell the public that it 
was indeed justified. However, if managers cannot justify some 
expenditures, we will say, on behalf of the public that this 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1177"> 1177 </A></B>
<P>
spending is unjustified and ask that  appropriate action be taken 
so that it is not incurred again by the federal government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 1.05 p.m., I do 
now leave the chair until 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(2).

	The home buyers plan is a federal program which allows

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Yesterday, according to the daily newspaper <I>La Presse</I>, the 
Minister of Finance told the Conseil du patronat du Québec 
about the government's budgetary about-face in favour of a tax 
increase. This means the minister has given up on the need to 
reduce government spending.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, instead of showing it had the guts 
to reduce government spending and plug tax loopholes for the 
wealthy, the government has decided to reduce the deficit at the 
expense of the middle class already infuriated by successive tax 
increases in recent years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I told the Conseil du patronat yesterday 
that we intended to review and abolish a number of tax loop-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1181"> 1181 </A></B>
<P>
holes. That was our position  yesterday, that is our position 
today, and it will be our position in the upcoming budget.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister and the Prime Minister have made it clear 
that this year they will not make the spending cuts required to 
broaden the tax base, which means a net tax increase for 
everyone.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell the House whether, considering 
the anemic state of our economic recovery, he can still claim his 
government is acting responsibly by increasing the tax burden 
on consumers and reducing their purchasing power?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are some very obvious 
inconsistencies in the position taken by the Leader of the 
Opposition. Does he or does he not support abolishing some of 
these tax loopholes, as his finance critic has said repeatedly?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is too bad a normally serious man like the Minister of 
Finance should want to confuse the issue. There is a basic 
difference between eliminating unfair and inappropriate tax 
shelters and broadening the tax base to hit the middle-class. He 
of all people should know that!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Does the Prime Minister realize that getting 
government spending under control would increase the 
confidence of consumers, investors and the financial 
community? Why is he postponing public spending cuts for 
another year, in other words, putting off indefinitely a measure 
that is badly needed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is to be 
commended because after three months, he has finally 
understood our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	There are increasingly clear signs that the government will 
increase the tax burden of the middle class in its forthcoming 
budget. Experts already set the value of the underground 
economy at about 15 per cent of gross domestic product.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not agree that any further 
increase in the tax burden of the middle class will only lead more 
people to the underground economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>I repeat, Mr. Speaker, our position is 
very clear. First, we know full well that at one point we will have 
to lower taxes, especially for the middle class.
<P>
	Second, we do not intend to really increase the tax burden 
that, unfortunately, Canadians already carry, but we will be 
widening the tax base. Right now, I do not understand the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois: Should we close the loopholes? 
Yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Finance not believe that the middle class deserves a 
break and that he should prove to our citizens that high income 
earners will be paying their fair share, by eliminating tax 
shelters like family trusts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this is I think the fifth time in a 
row this afternoon that I have had the question I will answer in 
English.
<P>
	Let me be very clear. There are built into the Income Tax Act a 
number of inequities. It is our clear intention in order to confirm 
the support of the Canadian people for the system of taxation 
that we have in this country to eliminate those inequities. We 
intend to do that and we intend to do that in this budget.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my questions are for the Prime Minister concerning the 
problems that threaten the success of the government's action 
plan on smuggling.
<P>
	First, how does the federal government propose to get the 
co-operation of the eight provincial governments which 
currently oppose the tax reduction aspects of the program?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have a national program to make sure that the smuggling of 
cigarettes no longer exists in Canada.
<P>
	Under this program we have made exactly the same offer to all 
provincial governments. They will decide if they want to 
participate, yes or no.
<P>
	I said in the House that we have to proceed with a reduction in 
taxation at the request of the head of the RCMP. I took that 
advice very seriously and I hope that the premiers will look at it 
very seriously as well.
<P>
	As everybody knows, cigarettes are smuggled everywhere 
into Canada, mainly in Quebec and Ontario, certainly more than 
in the west. There were, for example, some arrests this week in 
Edmonton and in B.C. and they are spreading. We want to kill 
the disease. We want the law to be respected by everybody in the 
land. I hope that the provincial governments will realize that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1182"> 1182 </A></B>
<P>
goal of the government is to have the law respected and to ensure 
that all citizens are treated equally.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Did the federal government secure, perhaps through the 
meetings yesterday, the active support of the leaders and people 
of the Mohawk communities of Akwesasne, Kanesatake and 
Kahnawake for its action plan on smuggling?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
they met yesterday with the Solicitor General and they had a 
very good meeting. They are preoccupied, like everyone in the 
House, with making sure that the law is respected. They want us 
to work with them in order to make sure that the law will be 
respected by everyone without causing too much of a problem 
on the reserves. It is complicated for them because they are there 
and it is happening in front of their eyes. They just want to make 
sure that the results are good for us and for them.
<P>
	I think that the meeting they had yesterday with the minister 
was very good. This afternoon the minister will meet with Ovide 
Mercredi. I know that many leaders have been in touch with the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. We are 
consulting with them. We have to make sure that smuggling is 
eliminated in every part of Canada. They know and understand 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question for the Prime Minister. I 
thank him for the straightforward answers.
<P>
	The third question is on the health dimension. Does the 
government acknowledge that the credibility of the minister and 
the ministry of health has been damaged by the acquiescence to 
the reduction of taxes on cigarettes and how does the 
government propose to restore the credibility of that 
department, particularly with the provincial governments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no need to restore the credibility of a minister who is not 
afraid to tell the truth to other ministers and to the people of 
Canada.

the Liberal government is presently contemplating, as the

medium-sized businesses, especially in Quebec where they are 
more labour intensive than their Canadian counterparts.

members of his government are serious about job creation and 
economic growth, if the members opposite are serious about the 
red book they keep brandishing, in other words if they are not 
putting on an act, can the minister assure all small and 
medium-sized businesses once and for all, especially the 
Quebec small business sector, that he will allow them to claim 
the payroll tax when calculating their income tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, that is not the 
problem. The problem facing small business is really linked to 
the taxes levied by governments, be they federal or provincial, 
on total payroll because this kills jobs. That is why we are so 
intent on having discussions with the Government of Quebec as 
well as other provincial governments to reduce, if not eliminate, 
these taxes which are real job killers. That is our answer and I 
must say that I think it is far better than the one Mr. Wilson gave 
back then.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> We have reduced the level of 
taxation according to a plan that is available to all governments 
in Canada. The plan is a national one to cure a national problem. 
I did not go into hiding. I said that it was not an easy decision. 
But smuggling will stop in Canada. If the provinces feel that 
they do not have a problem, they will have to live with the 
consequences of their actions. Every government was aware of 
what we wanted to do. We were all losing billions of dollars as a 
result of that. Therefore this government decided to act.
<P>
	If other governments want to avoid the problem, fine, they 
will have to accept the consequences. They were elected and 
they have to do their job. It will be up to the people of Ontario to 
ask the question of the Ontario government, not me.

that this decision was largely reversed.

these ill-conceived plans were just as abruptly cancelled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am somewhat troubled by the question because there 
was no cancellation of any great plan. In fact all information has 
been provided to members of Parliament and through a press 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1184"> 1184 </A></B>
<P>
conference attended by myself, the Solicitor General and the 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	We have I think been very open in questions in the House as 
the leader of the Reform Party, given the information on 
finances for example, will agree with.
<P>
	As far as the particulars of these 24-hour openings at border 
points, we have a system in Canada, which I will have to explain 
to the member, whereby some border crossing points are kept 
open for 8 hours, some for 16 hours and some are kept open 
around the clock, 24 hours. We are doubling the numbers in 
certain areas of the country. We are increasing the hours of 
certain border crossing points from 16 hours to 24 hours and 
some from 8 hours to 24 hours. There is no question of this plan 
having been put in place and then suddenly reversed or 
interrupted.
<P>
	Naturally we are targeting certain areas on the basis of 
intelligence we received from the RCMP, the Quebec provincial 
police, the Ontario provincial police and municipal police 
forces. We are also using the American police forces 
information nets. There will be times when we will divert 
resources from one particular area to the other.

to assist the smuggling groups, he is wrong.

demand a little more time to answer, but I would ask, if at all 
possible, that the answer be as brief as the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it seems that some customs houses are also not aware of the 
plans of the revenue minister. As I understand it, the American 
customs are not co-operating in this action plan and are closing 
at their regular hours.
<P>
	Could the minister explain the rationale of how opening up 
the Canadian side of customs was supposed to end smuggling in 
the first place?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have very close, friendly and useful relations with 
the American customs service and the other forces in the United 
States, as I have indicated. Certainly it is true that they are not 
following the considerable increase in personnel and hours of 
service that we are instituting on the Canadian side.
<P>
	We know full well that there will be some border crossing 
points where the American post is closed and ours remains open. 
We know full well that in certain of these border crossing places 
normally they are left completely without any personnel at all in 
the off hours, the hours when the posts are not open.
<P>
	We expect there will be occasions where there will be a 
Canadian post staffed and there will be an American post which 
is not staffed. It is nothing surprising to myself or to the customs 
officers. They are disciplined uniformed people who do an 
excellent job. I am surprised the hon. member suggests they are 
wasting their time.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> On a supplementary,

Canadian beer, something they stubbornly refuse to do?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the jargon of the trade world, the member 
opposite has raised ``beer one'' and now he raises ``beer two''. 
Beer two is a problem with the United States. The GATT has 
ruled in Canada's favour in that instance. The United States has 
responded by saying this is largely a matter for states to 
implement. However the states have been tardy in so doing. In 
fact only one of a total of 39 has so far taken any action.
<P>
	There are also, however, some actions that the U.S. federal 
government itself should be taking. We have been pressing the 
United States hard and consistently to implement the GATT 
panel ruling.

<P>
	As a physician I am appalled at the reduction of taxes on 
tobacco. It is going to create a quarter of a million new smokers 
among children. One-half of those children are going to die of 
smoking related illnesses and each of those children is going to 
have up to 20 years knocked off his or her lifespan.

smokers, does she support her government's decision to reduce 
tobacco taxes?

<P>
	The Minister of Health has refused to stand up for the health 
of Canadians by supporting the lowering of taxes on cigarettes. 
Today in newspapers across the country we see ads by the 
Distillers Association of Canada to lower the taxes on alcohol. 
The minister is aware of the costs and health care risks of 
alcoholism in our society.
<P>
	Will the minister stand up today in this House and say that she 
is against the lowering of taxes on alcohol, as she did not do on 
cigarettes, clearly another health care risk?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some very tough actions had to be taken. We are pleased at

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last year, this government campaigned in favour of 
greater control of public expenditures. That is to say that we 
deeply share the concerns before the House today. Too many 
people, across the country, believe that our present fiscal woes 
are caused only by indiscriminate spending on the part of too 
many civil servants who have nothing better to do than to waste 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	It is indeed the underlying feeling which prompted the present 
debate. This debate is aimed at striking a special committee of 
the House with a mandate to examine public expenditures, in 
light of the report of the Auditor General of Canada, and overlap 
between federal and provincial government programs. Such a 
committee is already in existence. It is called the House 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	Moreover, I will remind the members that each standing 
committee of the House has the right to examine the 
expenditures of the department it reviews. To establish a new 
committee to assess this government's management would 
duplicate the work already done through other mechanisms at 
our disposal for our job as public fund watchdogs.
<P>
	On this side of the House, we think that what Canadians need 
instead is fundamental reforms that would go much further. This 
government promised it would keep its promises. If, today, we 
were to eliminate all the civil service positions across the 
country, and at the same time their operating budgets and all of 
their benefits, the government would only save $19 billion this 
year. The deficit for this year would still be around $25 billion.
<P>
	Therefore, those who tell people that this is the way to get rid 
of the deficit are not telling the whole truth. The only way to 
solve this problem is to conduct an in-depth review of the roles 
and responsibilities of the federal machinery with a view to 
giving this country a government able to meet the challenges of 
the next century. That is what we committed ourselves to doing 
during the election campaign and in the red book, and that is I 
took the jump into politics.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians have high expectations of the House. They are 
demanding that all their levels of government work together to 
better serve the interests of citizens and taxpayers.
<P>
	Over the years governments in Canada have lost this client 
centred focus. Collectively they have promised more than they 
could deliver and delivered more than they could afford. 
Programs and services have often been poorly co-ordinated and 
public services have been used inefficiently. Inefficiency is a 
luxury that no government can afford any more.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	Too often in the past intergovernmental debate has been 
characterized by acrimony, entrenched positions and 
grandstanding. Relations between Canadians and their 
governments have become cumbersome and confusing.
<P>
	We were elected to effect change. We will respond to the 
demands of Canadians for client centred government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In future, reforms will mean that a person coming to a federal 
civil servant will be evaluated, and served according to his or 
her needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the speech from the throne we committed ourselves to work 
vigorously to ensure that federalism meets the needs of 
Canadians by clarifying the federal government's 
responsibilities in relation to other orders of government. This 
is the way to eliminate overlap and duplication and to find better 
ways of providing services that represent the best value for 
taxpayers' dollars and respond to the real needs of Canadians.
<P>
	We intend to work in partnership with the provinces to refocus 
government programs and services. We want to provide public 
services that do not work at cross purposes. We want to get 
beyond the kind of relationship that is built on obstinacy and 
narrow mindedness. We want to find a new equilibrium in which 
the roles and responsibilities of each level of government are 
more sensibly and reasonably aligned with their competence and 
financial and human resources.
<P>
	Our first ministers at their December 21 meeting made a 
commitment to co-operatively eliminate overlap and 
duplication. The Prime Minister has given me the responsibility 
of working with other orders of government to help improve the 
climate of  federal-provincial relations. Our goal is to build a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1191"> 1191 </A></B>
<P>
strong, united country. I have had exchanges with premiers and 
territorial leaders to start that process.
<P>
	To move ahead we will develop a framework within which the 
process of discussions and negotiations with the provinces can 
take place. We will identify the essential functions of the federal 
government of the future, taking into account changing 
circumstances and priorities.
<P>
	We want to identify those responsibilities which need to be 
maintained at the federal level in order to protect the overall 
national interest and the integrity of the state, as well as those 
which can best be performed by other levels of government.
<P>
	We will look for a process to move federal-provincial 
discussions away from the recrimination and bickering which 
has too often been seen in the past. Our goal is to reinvent the 
process of negotiation with the provinces so that it is more 
productive, so that there is less arguing over turf and more 
emphasis on solving problems in the interests of citizens.
<P>
	We want to develop a citizen centred approach to 
federal-provincial relations. We also want government that is 
accessible and responsive to citizens' interests and needs. This 
government recognizes that debt passed from one level of 
government to another simply winds up on the same shoulders, 
those of the taxpayers.
<P>
	In the past there has been a tendency to lose sight of the 
interests of the public which both governments are elected to 
serve. Our guiding objective will not be simply disentanglement 
which suggests the reordering and sorting out of what exists 
now, but service enhancement which suggests collaborative 
citizen focused initiatives in which the interests of taxpayers 
and service recipients are the priority.
<P>
	In so doing, the federal government is prepared to be flexible, 
to accommodate different priorities and circumstances, to 
experiment and innovate and to build on best practices which 
have been used in different provinces.
<P>
	Our process will be transparent and open and we welcome 
ideas and suggestions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The members of this House have the heavy responsibility, 
during this last decade of the 20th century, to ensure that the 
bold wager taken up by the Fathers of Confederation is not lost. 
This responsibility is ours not only with respect to future 
generations in our own country but also, and probably even more 
importantly, toward the have nots of the planet who envy our 
political and social stability, as well as our prosperity, in spite of 
our present economic and budget difficulties.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although serious, these difficulties are not insurmountable. If 
we in this blessed land cannot resolve our differences and 
overcome problems which to the majority of the world's people 
seem at worst manageable then there is not much hope for 
humanity.
<P>
	We have been elected by the people of Canada to address our 
common problems and, above all, to make the very best of our 
tremendous economic and human resources. We will not shrink 
from that challenge. We will keep our commitment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to the President of the Treasury Board and I am filled 
with dismay. This is the President of the Treasury Board 
speaking, the man in charge of preparing the government's 
expenditure budget. That is incredible. I can see that a minister 
would consider that $200,000 or so is not too much to pay to go 
and deliver a speech, that there is no fat to cut in the federal 
administration, that nobody here is spending too much.
<P>
	While you are at it, why produce government brochures in 
only fourteen colours? That is not enough. Why not 
twenty-two? That is incredible. I suppose that the President of 
the Treasury Board also considers that there is nothing wrong 
with building an embassy in Japan on a lot worth over $1 billion. 
That is normal I suppose. To have three embassies in Brussels, 
one for NATO, one for Belgium and one for the European 
Economic Community, with three ambassador's residences and 
three reception halls, one each, that is normal too, I suppose.
<P>
	Now, he is telling us that, to solve the problem, we will 
refocus the activity of the federal and provincial governments. 
What has the government done in that area these past few years? 
Quite simply, the federal government has been pulling out. In 
that area as in health and post-secondary education, it is pulling 
out but keeping the tax money. That is incredible. Now the buzz 
word is refocussing, before that it was harmonizing.
<P>
	Apparently the federal government will pull out from a 
number of areas, but it will continue to raise taxes, of course. 
That is how the federal deficit first got enormous. Then we saw 
the public finance crisis gradually spread to all the provinces. It 
is obvious that the federal government has been passing the buck 
to the provinces for years. As the minister just announced, 
instead of dealing with the problem from this end, by 
streamlining and restructuring the federal administration, he 
will keep passing the buck without making tax transfers. Is that 
what we are to understand?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1192"> 1192 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of humility 
that I accept the representations made by the opposition 
member, especially since he referred to me as the President of 
the Treasury Board when I am in fact the President of the Privy 
Council. But then again, such mistakes are to be expected from 
a new member of the House.
<P>
	I would like to say that a member of the opposition should 
certainly be a lot more responsible. It is possible for some, 
including the media, to quote exaggerated figures, but when the 
Auditor General himself indicates in a press release that the 
figures used are erroneous and exaggerated, I would hope that 
opposition members would themselves be responsible enough to 
use the data correctly.
<P>
	Also, if the member feels that giving a presentation to more 
than 400 Canadian studies professors from American 
universities is not making good use of public money, that I 
suggest that he take a look at what has been going on in recent 
years. He will realize that, in fact, this is a very useful initiative 
for the Canadian government. I also want to point out that a 
number of staunch separatists were at that conference and tried 
to influence the audience.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Such personal remarks should not be part of the debate. The 
important thing is to look at the evolution of governments' 
roles. The reality is that the federal and provincial governments 
have less money available to them. It must also be noted that, in 
recent years, management and information technologies have 
evolved sufficiently to warrant a readjustment of governments' 
roles.
<P>
	In order to solve our current budget and tax problems we will 
have to redefine federal and provincial responsibilities. 
Similarly, our economic problems will persist unless the federal 
government makes the effort of redefining the roles and 
responsibilities which are incumbent upon it and which it can 
assume. And we will not succeed either if the provinces do not 
undertake the same exercise.
<P>
	The problem is no longer one of jurisdiction. It is more a 
matter of redefining the responsibilities of the state. By this I 
mean not only the things which the state can do better than the 
private sector, but also the fiscal responsibilities which it can 
delegate.
<P>
	Consequently, the important thing is not to see if jurisdictions 
can be improved but to fundamentally review the roles which 
governments must fulfil with the money they have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for 
mistaking the President of the Privy Council for the President of 
the Treasury Board. I can understand why the Prime Minister did 
not give the responsibility of Treasury Board to the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> You should apologize for making those 
remarks-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, as this is my first 
opportunity to speak in the House I would like to begin by 
congratulating you on your election to the Chair. I would also 
like to thank my constituents for giving me the opportunity to 
represent them. I pledge to them I will do the best I can to take 
that responsibility seriously for the next term.
<P>
	The motion the Bloc Quebecois has placed on the Order Paper 
is an issue which the Reform Party has been talking about for 
many years. We are very much aware of the heavy cost to 
Canadian taxpayers caused by duplication and overlap among 
various federal departments as well as between Ottawa and the 
provinces. We do however have some concerns with the Bloc's 
proposed solutions.
<P>
	The Reform Party's deficit elimination strategy, known as the 
zero in three plan, outlines a saving of approximately $500 
million to the federal government by eliminating these 
redundancies, particularly in natural resource sectors such as 
agriculture, forestry, mining and energy. We have calculated 
these savings by examining government accounts available to 
the public. We therefore question what is the intent of the Bloc 
in proposing this special committee to do the same thing.
<P>
	Is this motion designed to revisit the constitutional 
relationship between the federal government and the provinces? 
We are somewhat confused as to where the Bloc is headed with 
this motion and are concerned that it is heading toward a new 
round of federal-provincial power bargaining.
<P>
	I would like to speak for a few moments on this subject. The 
Reform Party has been on record for many years supporting a 
clearer division of powers between the federal government and 
the provinces.
<P>
	Indeed our blue sheet, which outlines the complete platform 
we campaigned on last fall, expressly calls for the elimination, 
duplication and overlap between the two levels of government. 
Specifically our blue sheet states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports a re-examination and re-establishment of a clear 
division of powers between the constitutional levels of government. Legislative 
authority should rest with the level most able to effectively govern in each area,

<P>
	Furthermore we are convinced that for future constitutional 
negotiations to be successful we must move away from first 
ministers' constitutional conferences of the type that produced 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown and endorse a bottom up process 
of public consensus building.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1193"> 1193 </A></B>
<P>
	We must seek to develop democratic, populist based 
mechanisms which would allow rank and file Canadians to 
participate in the process. In light of the fact that any 
fundamental change in federal-provincial relationships would 
by definition require constitutional amendments, and 
recognizing that a vast majority of Canadians have no desire for 
this at this time, I question why our friends in the Bloc are 
raising the issue. Canadians are in no mood for another round of 
constitutional deal making, particularly when government 
deficits and debt are seriously undermining the ability of our 
economy to perform.
<P>
	While we agree with the general thrust of the motion before 
us, we do not see how the issue of federal-provincial 
jurisdictions can be effectively dealt with without revisiting the 
Constitution for which there is currently little or no consensus.
<P>
	I would like to remind members of the Bloc that we have a 
very constructive set of specific proposals for constitutional 
reform which incorporate proposals to restructure 
federal-provincial jurisdictions in a manner we think will be 
attractive to all provinces, including Quebec.
<P>
	I extend a sincere invitation to members of the Bloc and all 
members of the House to carefully examine Reform's written 
policy position on constitutional reform. The concerns which 
have led to the introduction of this motion before us today are 
specifically addressed in that position paper.
<P>
	We believe that the entrenchment of private property rights 
and reform of the Senate are also very important to Canadians, 
as important as redefining federal-provincial relationships. 
This is because these elements define basic relationships 
between individuals and governments and underline regional 
fairness within Confederation.
<P>
	The right to own private property without fear of being 
deprived thereof is a fundamental cornerstone of a free market 
economy and is ultimately the true test of a real democracy. Yet 
we have not embraced this principle to date.
<P>
	An effective Senate, democratically elected on the basis of 
representation by region rather than population, would ensure 
the interests of all Canadians were protected from the tyranny of 
the majority, a way to ensure that Canadians would not have to 
endure another national energy program.
<P>
	These issues are very important to many Canadians, and we 
think they deserve equal standing in future constitutional 
negotiations. However, Canadians have little desire to revisit 
the Constitution at this time. Until there is a clear consensus to 
proceed with constitutional renewal, Reformers are committed 
to advocate and support constructive change outside 
constitutional discussions. That is what Canadians want and 
need and that is what they have told us to do.
<P>
	I understand the frustration of the Bloc Quebecois at the waste 
of taxpayers' money due to duplication and overlap of 
government services. I further believe that the turf wars fought 
by competing bureaucracies are in large part responsible for 
much of the tension between Quebec and the federal 
government. I can assure the House that Quebec is not alone in 
its resentment. The solution in the long run is a decentralization 
of powers.
<P>
	Meanwhile we should all be aware of the cost of duplication 
and overlap. We urge the government to move to eliminate it in a 
manner consistent with my earlier statement within the 
framework of an existing Constitution. It is my understanding 
that the public accounts committee has the ability to scrutinize 
all spending programs.
<P>
	Once again I say that although I generally agree with the Bloc 
Quebecois' intent with this motion I question why we need to 
create a special committee to cover ground which an existing 
committee has the ability to cover.
<P>
	In concluding my remarks, I would like to say that I agree 
with the Bloc Quebecois' concern over the waste of taxpayers' 
money, but I believe that this motion comes close to striking at 
the heart of our Constitution. The Reform Party supports the 
position that our Constitution should be reformed and that 
Confederation should be maintained. It can only be maintained 
by a clear commitment to Canada as one nation in which the 
demands and aspirations of all the regions are entitled to equal 
status in constitutional negotiations and political debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I want to congratulate my colleague on his initial 
address in the House. I have just a few brief questions. They are 
very serious ones on which I would like his reaction.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The suggestion was made that the Bloc Quebecois wanted to 
further its own personal agenda which is in a sense the 
separation, not in the real sense of separation, of Quebec from 
Canada through constitutional wrangling and that may be one 
option it is pursuing. One never knows. Obviously the kind of 
dedication Bloc members show toward that objective is 
sometimes rather obsessive.
<P>
	Is there not another possibility that it was their intent to 
attempt to embarrass the government by suggesting it is not 
being done and there is no mechanism for doing it? I would like 
my hon. colleague to consider that possibility and give me his 
reaction to it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1194"> 1194 </A></B>
<P>
	Does my colleague and his party make a distinction between 
the concepts of overlap and duplication? I do. To me overlap is 
simply some overlapping of something similar, but duplication 
is completely the same.
<P>
	Finally, I have not heard anyone talk about the possible 
overlap and duplication among the different levels of 
governments, federal, provincial and municipal. In Manitoba 
we have a real problem in the social assistance field within the 
levels of government. Within the federal government I am told 
there may be as many as a dozen or more departments involved 
in education and related things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for his question. First of all I cannot comment on the 
motivations for the Bloc Quebecois to bring this motion 
forward. I really do not know what the intent was. All I can say is 
that was my reaction in reviewing it and that is what prompted 
my engagement in the debate today.
<P>
	As far as the difference between duplication and overlap, they 
both cost taxpayers money. We are concerned about getting at 
the issue of the economics of it as opposed to defining what the 
difference is between duplication and overlap. They both are 
inefficient and they both cost taxpayers money. That is the angle 
we want to attack it from. There does need to be discussions 
among various levels of government concerning duplication and 
overlap and there clearly is a good case for that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
explain something to the hon. member from the Reform Party. 
Our party is asking for a special committee to examine public 
expenditures while the minister is worried about duplication 
since there already is a public accounts committee. I understand 
his question, but the committee on public accounts is 
responsible for assessing the legality of public expenditures. 
Did the government respect this or that enabling act in incurring 
expenditures? A committee or commission, whatever we want 
to call it, as proposed by my party, would look at the morality of 
certain public expenditures.
<P>
	Some embassies have paid $490 for waste containers; it is 
certainly not illegal to buy waste containers but the $490 price 
tag is questionable. That is why we want to strike this 
committee, to get the Canadian budget in better shape.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
statement and his question.
<P>
	Certainly the issue of government spending in total is very 
important to the Reform Party and we intend to examine all 
government spending. We have been doing that and we advocate 
that in the future to see how we can reduce spending and create 
efficiency.
<P>
	When the member talks about an embassy buying a trash can 
for $490 he is right on the mark. However, I do not see what that 
has to do with duplication and overlap of government services. 
Quite honestly that is a separate issue. It is one that is very 
important to us as well and we intend to pursue it.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to the motion brought forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois dealing with the same subject the Reform Party of 
Canada has been talking about for some time now.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the Bloc is in accord with us in 
suggesting we take a closer look at government expenditures. I 
think we laud their motive, if not their specifics in proposing 
this all-party special committee to examine government 
finances.
<P>
	The nation knows how concerned the Reform Party is about 
government spending in general. In saying a few words to the 
House today I want to touch upon one of the most important 
aspects of the control of government spending. I am sure most of 
the members here today are frugal people who want to save all 
they can for the taxpayer and would gladly make sacrifices to 
make sure that it is done.
<P>
	There is a story told that President Lyndon Johnson used to 
walk around the White House turning off the lights at night in an 
effort to save a few dollars for the treasury. It is almost comical 
when we think of the size of the U.S. government and such a 
small measure he was taking. The President experienced 
frustration because he had little direct control over government 
expenditures.
<P>
	In exactly the same way the expenditures which are directly 
controlled by any individual member here in the House are very 
small indeed in comparison with the vast amount of money 
expended daily by the federal government.
<P>
	Who then actually spends this money? I want to speak today 
about the role of the civil service in government spending. The 
civil servant is the gatekeeper of the federal treasury. The money 
government spends is disbursed by civil servants who make 
hundreds of thousands of decisions every day about the smallest 
details of government spending. Whether it is a public servant 
deciding upon a loan to the private business sector or a UI agent 
deciding a question of entitlement, the billions that pour forth 
from our taxpayers must all pour through this plethora of civil 
servants.
<P>
	Although a great percentage of government payments are 
statutory obligations, even these obligatory payments involve 
an element of discretion over which the public service exercises 
a large amount of control. I just cited the example of the UI 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1195"> 1195 </A></B>
<P>
agent who must pay what the client is entitled to, yet that agent 
also has some latitude to decide exactly what amount of 
entitlement will be offered.
<P>
	I want to make a very important statement. If the public 
service does not change its discretionary behaviour members of 
Parliament will be almost powerless to effect real substantial 
change in government spending. It will be as frustrating as 
trying to trim our budget by walking around the House of 
Commons turning out the lights.
<P>
	How can the House of Commons affect this discretionary 
behaviour of the civil servant? There is a way. The Auditor 
General did touch on it in his report and I want to expand on it 
for a moment today.
<P>
	Public Service 2000 was an initiative begun by the former 
government in 1989. Its goals were noble: to streamline the 
public service; to make it more service oriented and responsive 
to the needs of the public; to combine certain functions of 
departments to improve efficiency; and to foster a better attitude 
among civil servants.
<P>
	Five years later what do we find? We do not really know for 
sure. Annual progress reports were supposed to be submitted to 
the Prime Minister, but that has just not happened. In fact there 
has been only one report submitted since 1989 and this shows 
two really big problems. One is a lack of political will to force 
these reports and a lack of motivation on the part of the civil 
service to submit them. Perhaps we are not surprised at the lack 
of political will, especially in times past, but it is unfortunate 
that we cannot expect the civil servants to submit these reports 
as the government initially required.
<P>
	When I look at the origins of the PS 2000 initiative I am not at 
all surprised to see reform proceeding at a snail's pace. Ten task 
forces made up of high ranking civil servants together plotted 
the major objectives of the PS 2000 program and presented the 
plan to the politicians of the day.
<P>
	I am not in any way attempting to cast any kind of bad light 
upon our good civil servants. They are dedicated, well qualified 
and well intentioned. However one can hardly expect those who 
have spent their entire careers in the service to effect serious 
change that would cause real disruptions to that service. Each 
civil servant on those committees had an unconscious vested 
interest in maintaining the status quo even though everyone 
agreed we urgently needed change. What is missing from the 
Public Service 2000 is a check and balance mechanism that 
would guarantee results.
<P>
	What concrete results have we achieved to date? Not having 
many of the required reports in place we are not really sure but 
the Auditor General does give us some ideas. Mostly the Auditor 
General talks about an improved attitude in the public service. 
Good feelings are all very nice but when we look at the cruel 
hard numbers what do we see?
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada we see that we still employ a 
total of 413,000 civil servants. We paid $19 billion last year in 
wages and salaries, up from $17 billion in 1992. When we come 
to the line that affects every taxpayer in the country daily, the 
bottom line is that PS 2000 has had virtually no effect on the 
civil service.
<P>
	According to the Auditor General, many top level bureaucrats 
are disillusioned with PS 2000. I will quote a few excerpts from 
his report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some of the executives we met wonder whether PS 2000 was dead, and we 
detected an atmosphere of scepticism and cynicism surrounding the renewal 
initiative-Several witnesses emphasized that the changes-would be difficult 
and time-consuming to implement-Inconsistency is perceived between some 
of the principles of PS 2000 and other initiatives, including downsizing and 
operating budget cuts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is exactly what the system needs. Why then has PS 2000 
been ineffective? It is because the organizational structure in 
charge of it, the civil service, automatically protects its own 
position. It is called the survival instinct. I guess we are all 
guilty of it. There is nothing wrong with it, but in this case the 
instinct does not serve the public interest.
<P>
	As leaders in the House of Commons we are charged with the 
responsibility of leading the civil service, not the other way 
around. The civil service is not a democratic institution. It is a 
group of people hired by us to do the work we have mandated it 
to do. The civil service has no implicit desire to change itself. 
That mandate for change is the awesome responsibility of every 
member of Parliament today. Members in past Houses have 
abdicated that responsibility for over a decade now. That is why 
we are suffering some of these problems today.
<P>
	It is time for the House of Commons to take charge of 
spending in this country. It is time for elected members to begin 
to control the public service. Let me list a few broad general 
principles that will guide this. I take my lead from the positive 
changes which have been made in other Commonwealth 
countries, especially in New Zealand.
<P>
	First, the mandate for change in the service must emanate 
from this House of Commons. The idea of the civil service 
reforming itself will never work and I do not think we should be 
under any illusion that it will.
<P>
	Second, civil servants must have incentives to make the 
necessary changes. Put deputy ministers and other senior 
executives on contract like they did in New Zealand. Give them 
authority to make changes and things will happen because the 
incentive will be there.
<P>
	Third, we need to require concrete results. If departments do 
not achieve measurable performance objectives laid out by the 
House of Commons, contracts should not be renewed. If incen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1196"> 1196 </A></B>
<P>
tives do not hasten change then something even tougher may 
have to be required.
<P>
	Something needs to be done. We appreciate the general 
direction of the Bloc Quebecois, but that direction needs to 
become even more specific. If we give the direction to the public 
accounts committee as was mentioned earlier, it is within its 
means to check on this and to make sure it comes to fruition. I 
honestly believe that civil servants acting frugally can effect 
many of the changes all of us in this House are looking forward 
to.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to set aside their party 
politics when it comes to this sort of thing and ensure that 
changes to the civil service come mandated from the House and 
not the other way around.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree 
with some of what the hon. member for Fraser Valley East said.
<P>
	I think he is quite right that we in this country and this 
Parliament lack political will. I also think that he is right when 
he says that public servants may not be sensitive enough to the 
need for a new attitude to public spending.
<P>
	I will give an example to illustrate what I am saying. 
Recently, in answer to a question raised in this House, the 
Minister of Transport said that his department was 
re-evaluating air traffic control. In my riding, they are 
preparing to close a radar control room that employs some 
fifteen people. When these employees are moved to the regional 
centre, they will each be entitled to a $10,000 increase simply 
because their employment classification changes.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Second, the department recognizes that this move will cost 
between $4 and $5 million. This is all being done in a time of 
extreme economic hardship. We make speeches, but when the 
time comes to act, it is as if we could not apply the brakes. If the 
existing mechanisms like the Public Accounts Committee were 
considered to be effective, the Bloc would be satisfied. But be 
assured that the Bloc does not want to get into constitutional 
discussions; that is not its purpose at all, but rather to try to find 
a new way, because all the others have proven to be ineffective.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is good we have a few points we 
agree on. I appreciate that.
<P>
	Since the public accounts committee is generally chaired by a 
member of the opposition party and especially since it holds that 
chair it can set the direction and the tone of the public accounts 
committee. The direction and the agenda given to that 
committee could well effect the changes I was looking for, 
changes that have measurable results that are reportable to the 
House. I believe that is the way to do it.
<P>
	Since the Bloc Quebecois holds that chair it has a perfect 
opportunity to make sure that is made as public as possible. 
Changes could be initiated if it takes that and demands results, 
demands accountability and demands measurable performance. 
I think it could be done through the public accounts committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to the member for Fraser Valley East I say I do not 
disagree with a lot of things that were said. However I do have 
some areas I would like clarified. The member talked about 
improved attitude and changes of direction.
<P>
	When we investigate why the attitudes are not good, if we take 
that premise, it is fair enough to say that sometimes our public 
servants have portrayed that attitude. There has been a past 
history from the House that has really fostered that and I get 
fairly concerned when the member talks about contracts not 
being renewed. I would hope that would not be the sledge 
hammer he would be attempting to use in this new government. 
That is really a wrong direction. It goes back to when the 
Conservatives talked about issuing all of our public servants 
running shoes if they did not like the way things were done. That 
is really wrong.
<P>
	It is very important that we in some way start to change 
direction, change attitudes, talk about a monitoring program. 
That would be a good thing; also putting a strong strategic plan 
in place. I believe that we are part of that process.
<P>
	I wonder if I could have a bit of clarification on the contract 
renewal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was fairly specific. I am talking 
now about the deputy minister level. By and large our civil 
servants are good, dedicated people even at the deputy minister 
level.
<P>
	The problem is that the people at the low end of the scale who 
deliver the services are generally the whipping boys for lack of 
action at the top, and I include the House of Commons in that.
<P>
	Where I would like to see this contract idea is at the deputy 
minister level at which it is said: ``You in essence are the CEO of 
this department and we need to see some measurable results and 
if you cannot deliver them to us then you are part of the problem, 
not part of the solution''.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Kitchener.
<P>
	I rise to speak on the motion put before the House today by the 
hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, a motion that 
seeks to create a special committee of the House to examine the 
expenditures of the government, to consult extensively and 
openly with the people of Canada and to recommend decisive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1197"> 1197 </A></B>
<P>
action to reduce the cost of overlap between federal and 
provincial programs.
<P>
	Through this motion the hon. member has touched upon 
issues which this government supports.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	They are: first, ensuring that this House has the means and 
opportunity to examine and debate those matters that are a 
priority to all Canadians; second, that government be open and 
accessible to everyone; third, that government spend as 
efficiently and effectively as possible in the service of the 
nation's interests.
<P>
	These issues are not in contention. However, the 
disagreement and contention with this motion lies with the 
creation of a new committee of the House to duplicate the role of 
the public accounts committee at an added cost to taxpayers.
<P>
	To support my opposition to this motion my remarks today 
will focus on the nature of the government's expenditures, what 
we spend now and the vital importance of spending this money 
more effectively to ensure a more stable and brighter economic 
future.
<P>
	The government stated in the speech from the throne that it 
will pursue the fiscal discipline necessary for sustained 
economic growth. As well, the government attaches the highest 
priority on job creation and economic growth in the short term 
and the long term. These two objectives work hand in hand. 
Growth and jobs will enhance government revenues and reduce 
spending on unemployment insurance and welfare. Fiscal 
discipline to contain the deficit will create confidence and 
growth.
<P>
	At the same time, it is known that a number of government 
programs and tax expenditures, some of which have been 
identified by the Auditor General, are inefficient, poorly 
managed or driven for purely political reasons.
<P>
	Just as we as a government are proposing new measures to 
grow the economy, programs will be examined extensively with 
the objective of reducing waste and inefficiency and promoting 
economic growth.
<P>
	So far the government has acted decisively on both fronts. The 
$5.8 billion helicopter program was an initiative that was too 
expensive given the government's fiscal situation and was 
cancelled.
<P>
	To stimulate the economic activity and create jobs, an 
agreement has been reached with provincial and territorial 
governments for a $6 billion joint federal-provincial-municipal 
infrastructure program. These are important steps that send a 
real message to members of this House that this government 
means to keep its commitments to Canadians.
<P>
	Most of us have wondered from time to time where all the 
money goes that government spends. It should be known that the 
Government of Canada's budgetary expenditures from April 1, 
1992 to March 31, 1993 were $161.9 billion. Of this, $41.9 
billion, 26 per cent, was spent on direct income support 
payments for individual Canadians. Almost half, $19.1 billion, 
went to supporting  our elderly, and $19 billion of the remainder 
went to support the unemployed through the unemployment 
insurance program.
<P>
	Public debt charges totalled $39.4 billion. Transfers to other 
levels of government through such programs as equalization, 
the Canada Assistance Plan and established programs financing 
amounted to $28.8 billion.
<P>
	Defence spending was $11 billion. The operations of 
government providing services such as law enforcement, air 
traffic control, weather forecasting and health services to Indian 
and Inuit peoples cost $19.8 billion.
<P>
	Crown corporations required expenditures of $6.2 billion. 
Direct federal government support for international aid was $2.8 
billion.
<P>
	For those members not keeping track of these numbers on 
their pocket calculators, it should be noted that the total of all 
these expenditures subtracted from the total budget leaves a 
remainder of $12 billion. This spending supports programs for 
industrial and regional development, job creation and training, 
support for our farmers and fishermen, science and technology 
and assistance to our students.
<P>
	This 7 per cent of federal government spending should be 
viewed as Canada's investment fund. Used wisely it can 
stimulate growth, create jobs, develop knowledge and new 
technologies, and invest in the enterprising potential of our 
country and its people.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Most important, effective and efficient programs can help 
prepare Canadians for the economic environment of the future.
<P>
	During this time of economic globalization, the days when 
Canada's wealth was measured only by its natural resources, 
capital and a protected domestic market are now gone.
<P>
	Globalization is the growing trend in the international 
economy. It is a reality. Globalization refers to the ability to 
make the components of products wherever in the world their 
production is cheapest and transport them efficiently.
<P>
	It means that with cheaper transportation and computer based 
information and communications, the world is becoming 
smaller and competition is fiercer than ever before.
<P>
	High productivity will be the only route to high incomes in 
such an economy. Canadians must prepare to be successful in 
the modern economy in which success will be determined by the 
knowledge, education and skills of our Canadian people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1198"> 1198 </A></B>
<P>
	Governments have a responsibility to help in the transition to 
the new economy or to be left to cope with intractable 
unemployment and the needs of citizens with declining 
incomes.
<P>
	As outlined in the speech from the throne, this government 
intends to pursue an active program for the growing economy, 
focusing on small and medium sized businesses as the engine for 
longer term job creation.
<P>
	The government will work with financial institutions to 
improve access to capital for small business. A Canada 
investment fund will be created to help innovative leading edge 
technology firms to obtain the long term capital they need. A 
Canadian technology network will be created to improve the 
diffusion of technology and innovation.
<P>
	The government will encourage technology partnerships 
between Canadian universities, research institutions and the 
private sector. The government will also implement a Canadian 
strategy for an information highway. The government will 
promote better training for the managers of small businesses and 
greater access to strategic information on new marketing 
opportunities. The government will work with the provinces to 
reduce the regulatory and paper burden on small businesses and 
to streamline the delivery of these programs.
<P>
	Competing successfully in the emerging global economy will 
also require an investment in our own people. The government 
will work in partnership with the provinces and the private 
sector to help young people better prepare for the transition 
from school to the work place.
<P>
	It will propose measures to improve job training as well as the 
literacy skills of Canadians with funding for the national 
literacy program restored to its original level.
<P>
	I acknowledge that many of the initiatives aforementioned 
will require the government to act in partnership with provinces 
to be fully successful. This can be an advantage for these 
initiatives rather than a hindrance.
<P>
	The government has shown through the infrastructure 
program that governments acting together can make advances 
that would be beyond the capacity of any one level of 
government working alone.
<P>
	The challenges facing us as we adapt to economic 
globalization will require co-operation among governments in 
designing and delivering programs. Our task is to ensure that 
they are the right programs, effective and efficient, and that the 
government's spending is effective and efficient. Anything less 
jeopardizes our future as Canadians and our future as a country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion we are 
discussing today reflects the fact that  many Canadians are 
concerned that governments are inefficient, unresponsive and 
too costly.
<P>
	It is not simply Canadians who are concerned. Australians, 
Britons, Americans and Germans are now looking at 
government and those same kinds of complaints.
<P>
	This government has decided in light of these concerns that 
the time has come for decisive action. In the speech from the 
throne it was said it will be the policy of the government to seek 
to clarify the federal government's responsibilities in relation to 
other orders of government, to eliminate overlap and 
duplication and to find better ways to provide services so that 
they represent the best value for taxpayers' dollars and respond 
to the real needs of people.
<P>
	At the first minister's meeting on December 21, 1993 the first 
ministers agreed to give priority to efforts to improve the 
efficiency of the federation. In this regard, in responding to 
comments made earlier by the member for Fraser Valley East, 
PS 2000 to which he referred has in fact one progress report and 
another progress report is being prepared. The responsibility for 
renewal of the public service, as he indicated, is the 
responsibility of the government and of course the members of 
the House. I welcome his remark that he does believe that civil 
servants acting effectively can carry out the mandate under PS 
2000 with the direction of course being given by the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The shared commitment to change which emerged from the 
first ministers meeting is evidence of a flexible adaptable 
federal system, one that is based on sound principles and offers 
both long-term stability and the capacity to evolve. That 
evolution can come through reasoned discussion as needs and 
priorities change.
<P>
	To meet these ends the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
has written to the premiers and to territorial government leaders 
to launch the process of eliminating overlap and duplication as 
is suggested in the motion today. The overlap, duplication and 
delivery of federal and provincial government programs and 
services is of major importance to this government.
<P>
	The process being undertaken aims to, first, clarify 
federal-provincial roles and responsibilities to ensure that 
limited public resources are used to provide necessary services 
in an efficient way; second, to ensure public service activities 
facilitate economic investment and growth; and, third, to 
redesign programs and services to achieve more efficient 
delivery and greater client orientation. This morning the 
member for Ottawa West talked in a very fascinating way about 
changes that are coming in the area of telecommunications that 
offers such prospects as 24-hour service.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1199"> 1199 </A></B>
<P>
	In implementing this process the government will, one, 
establish constructive partnerships with provincial 
governments; two, use federal-provincial administrative 
agreements to provide Canadians with efficient responsive 
programs and services; and, three, utilize both bilateral and 
multilateral negotiations to obtain timely results and ensure 
maximum flexibility. Those negotiations are going on 
constantly. Finally, we work to ensure that the negotiation 
process is transparent to all participants; that is, based on 
equality of treatment and sound public policy objectives.
<P>
	The government then is entering this process with an open 
mind and is prepared to be flexible in accommodating provincial 
needs and priorities.
<P>
	We recognize that in many areas provinces have developed 
the best practices and that the federal government has much to 
learn from them and we are following in our negotiations with 
the provinces a path where we are looking at their programs to 
consider which are most effective in that regard.
<P>
	Therefore we are prepared to consider, one, what level of 
government is best suited to delivering a certain service or 
program. As I said before, we are open-minded in this regard. 
We are furthermore considering how to make policies and 
programs more effective and affordable and more accessible to 
clients. As the minister said earlier today, the goal is service 
enhancement above all else.
<P>
	In terms of the flexibility about which I spoke earlier we want 
to be flexible in developing common objectives and in choosing 
issues for negotiations. These will be done item by item, 
province by province, department by department. We will 
conduct negotiations bilaterally if necessary and multilaterally 
if it is possible, again depending upon particular needs.
<P>
	We will where possible use pilot projects such as the New 
Brunswick works project which was referred to earlier by the 
member for Peterborough. That project offers real hope we 
believe in the area of employment training and social services 
reform.
<P>
	All of these initiatives we believe demonstrate important 
features of our federation, ones that are the envy of many other 
nations. It is especially gratifying in an age where disputes 
between governments are an every day occurrence that our 
leaders, provincial and federal, have agreed to set aside 
differences and search together for solutions that are in the best 
interest of the public.
<P>
	In that regard, Mr. Bruce Doern, a student of governmental 
reform in England, Australia, New Zealand and most recently 
Canada, has written about the experience over the last two 
decades and I would like to bring attention to his comments:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What the full experience of the last two decades perhaps shows most of all is the 
need to reduce ideological blinkers and be much more selective about which 
functional and organizational aspects of government are efficiency and 
democracy enhancing-and which are reducing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A thinking view of the State is far more important to Canadians than an 
ideological one that simply bashes bureaucracy and government or attacks 
market-based approaches as a form of ritual sport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	It is not a time for ritual sports of that type, it is a time to work 
together in service enhancement and making government work.
<P>
	In terms of the PS 2000 report, a progress report as I have said 
is being produced. We are comparing what is being done here as 
the Auditor General did in his report. We find that in many ways 
we have not kept up. It is true the previous government did not. 
However in comparing our progress with that of the United 
States, in fact in the terms of the re-invent government agenda 
of Vice President Gore, one finds in that agenda that we have 
done many of the things he is calling for in the United States.
<P>
	The federal government views the reduction of overlap and 
duplication as called for in this motion as a win-win situation 
for governments and for taxpayers. It will render programs more 
affordable and thus sustainable over time while providing 
Canadians with the best service possible within the limits of 
available resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciated the comments, especially when the member was 
specific about relating some of the things I was concerned about 
in my presentation.
<P>
	I wonder if the member has any more details as to when the PS 
2000 report will be tabled in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. English:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is one progress report 
already which the member has probably seen. It was given to 
some members of your party a couple of days ago. Two members 
of your party asked for that report.
<P>
	The second report is being prepared now. It has been slowed 
down by the election and the events in between. It is in almost 
final draft form, but I can check that. It is one that compares 
what we are doing with what is being done in other countries. I 
refer the member of course to the Auditor General's comments 
which make those comparisons as well.
<P>
	In terms of the whole business of renewing the public service 
and looking at these questions, it is being given active 
consideration.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I might make the point here that we all 
make this mistake, and I do too, of not addressing remarks 
through the Chair. I think the parliamentary secretary used the 
expression your or you twice in two sentences. Once per 
paragraph at least, please.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every year, the report of the Auditor General of Canada 
is tabled in the House of Commons. The report is in the news for 
the first few weeks, but then interest wanes, so that for all 
practical purposes, the Auditor General's report sits gathering 
dust on the shelves in government departments.
<P>
	However, I see many items in this report that could be 
followed up and would help the government improve its policies 
in a number of areas.
<P>
	Instead of engaging in pre-budgetary window dressing, the 
Liberal government would do well to examine and memorize the 
annual horror stories in the Auditor General's reports and rectify 
these situations immediately.
<P>
	As you know, in Quebec and Canada, whether the Liberals or 
the Conservatives are in power, we are facing a financial 
situation that is very bleak. I think we should realize this when 
we look at Canada's finances.
<P>
	Especially in a federation or a confederation, and I think some 
time my hon. friends opposite, my Canadian friends, will have 
to explain the difference between these two terms, because some 
Liberals have been asking Bloc members about the difference 
between separation and sovereignty for Quebec. I think they 
ought to realize that what Quebec wants is sovereignty and 
decide what the terms federation and Confederation mean, 
because it is rather confusing. Canadians, and especially 
Quebecers, tend to confuse these terms.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	In any case, I was saying that the government should act on 
the recommendations of the Auditor General if it really wants to 
put its financial house in order. However, that may be wishful 
thinking. There are aspects to this nice, shiny, federal system on 
the verge of bankruptcy which are faintly ridiculous, and I mean 
ridiculous, and I will explain why.
<P>
	Goodies have to be handed out to support our precious and 
costly Canadian unity. I found one of these ridiculous aspects 
when I looked at the Auditor General's reports for the past few 
years. My example only concerns the portfolio for which I was 
appointed official critic, the Department of the Solicitor 
General of Canada.
<P>
	In Canada, national generosity as an approach to RCMP 
expenditures is costing the federal Treasury millions of dollars. 
First of all, the hon. member should realize that through 
contractual arrangements, the RCMP provides police services in 
eight provinces, the two territories and 191 municipalities, 
except for Quebec and Ontario which do not benefit directly 
from all this largesse.
<P>
	This means that in addition to its federal police function, the 
RCMP provides provincial policing for about 40 per cent of the 
Canadian population and municipal policing for about 20 per 
cent of the same population. For some Canadians, the RCMP is 
the only police they know. Theoretically there is nothing wrong 
with this, but it costs millions, and if this generous system, 
introduced by the Liberals and the Conservatives, contributes to 
the deficit, there is a problem.
<P>
	Upon reading the Auditor General's report for 1992, we soon 
realize there is a problem with this system. The RCMP provides 
provincial and municipal policing at below cost as calculated by 
the Auditor General in his 1992 report.
<P>
	Ever since the government entered into contract policing, it 
has been charging provinces and municipalities for RCMP 
services. However, as the Auditor General pointed out in his 
report: ``The federal government has never attempted to recover 
the full cost of providing these services''. We read this on page 
532.
<P>
	The federal government does not compute the real cost of 
these services but negotiates a cost base with the provinces. 
Actually, the provinces and municipalities pay only a 
percentage of the negotiated cost base. Usually, it is between 70 
and 90 per cent of the real cost. The government uses the 
theoretical cost base negotiated by the parties to charge the 
provinces and the municipalities that benefit under the system.
<P>
	The federal government is losing a lot of money with this 
approach. The contract signed in April 1992 is a 20-year 
agreement, and there is a faintly ridiculous aspect to this 
contract as well, because it can only be reviewed every five 
years and the adjustments require unanimous agreement by the 
parties.
<P>
	The new cost base works out to about $800 million annually, 
while the real cost, according to the Auditor General, is between 
$900 million and $950 million. The real cost, which represents a 
difference of $100 million to $150 million was calculated by the 
Auditor General according to the guidelines outlined in the 
Treasury Board's guide to the costing of outputs.
<P>
	Still according to the Auditor General, it appears that the 
federal government, in this case the Department of the Solicitor 
General, does not include some major cost items such as 
departmental administration at headquarters, EDP services, 
office rental and certain employee benefits paid by the federal 
government. The list is much longer on page 533 of the Auditor 
General's report, which I think the government would do well to 
read in preparation for its upcoming budget.
<P>
	As I said before, for the duration of the 20 year contract, the 
agreement, which is reviewed every five years, cannot be 
adjusted without the mutual consent of the federal government 
and the provinces. Generally speaking, the provinces agree to 
pay only those new expenses they believe are appropriate.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1201"> 1201 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The federal government receives only $600 million or so 
annually for the provision by the RCMP of provincial and 
municipal polices services which cost between $900 and $950 
million per year. So, the balance sheet looks like this: real cost 
of services: $900 to $950 million; revenues: $600 million; the 
federal government's share: between $300 and $350 million. 
Quebec' share-and I think it is important for my hon. friends 
opposite to hear it-is 24 per cent of the total, or between $70 
and $90 million. That is what Quebec pays for services which it 
does not get, or worse still, for a service that it already pays the 
provincial government and the municipalities to provide. This is 
one blatant example of how federalism is costly to Quebec.
<P>
	The federal shortfall, as I mentioned earlier, totals $300 
million annually. If we calculate on a twenty-year basis, 
because the agreement covers a span of twenty years, the 
shortfall amounts to roughly $6 billion. In other words, Quebec 
taxpayers subsidize provincial and municipal police services in 
the other provinces, excluding Ontario of course, as I said 
earlier, to the tune of between $70 and $90 million per year, or 
between $1.4 and $1.8 billion over the term of the agreement. 
More than 40 per cent of Canadians receive police services that 
are subsidized by Quebec and Ontario residents. Some 
provinces benefit more than others. For instance, a large portion 
of British Columbia has no police force other than the national 
force which provides service at both the municipal and 
provincial levels.
<P>
	In conclusion, what the Official Opposition is calling for is a 
committee which would examine this area and determine if 
overlap exists and whether a province is paying for a service it is 
not receiving. I think the government, if it is truly realistic and 
honest about what it wants to do, should go along with the 
Official Opposition's proposal to review, item by item, the cost 
of national police services. And this is only one area, one under 
the responsibility of the Solicitor General of Canada. If we were 
to look at all departments, we would see how much money the 
provinces, and Quebec in particular, pay out for services they do 
not receive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the opposition for addressing the matter of whether 
or not we should set up a separate committee for finances.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that he said he was trying to 
eliminate duplication. The very nature of what he is proposing 
actually is duplication.
<P>
	There is no question that the Auditor General's report is a 
significant document. I hope every department will use it as a 
tool to try to get rid of those deficiencies as alluded to by the 
hon. member.
<P>
	Canada is a Confederation, not a unitary state. As the member 
put it Canada is not a country of states that do not care for one 
another. Those provinces that are doing quite well assist the 
other provinces through equalization payments and so on. This 
is unique. We enjoy a good status in the world. We are respected. 
We enjoy a high standard of living. Our kind of democracy and 
our kind of government are examples for many countries.
<P>
	To separate or to tear the country apart is the subliminal 
message coming from the members of the opposition. It is 
probably not a very good way. I can say that quite firmly coming 
from a country where independence was achieved. After 
independence our standard of living went down and was not as 
good as we thought it would be. We ended up with a great deal of 
enemies. We thought they were not our enemies but 
economically they were bigger and forced more kinds of 
restraints on us.
<P>
	To get back to the question we are debating today, we do need 
to look very seriously at government records and the way it 
spends its money, but the mechanism is already there. We have 
government and opposition members to do this. That is the 
mechanism we should be using in order to achieve those goals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his four questions or observations. I will start with the first one.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	What the Official Opposition is asking for is a committee 
which would look at where taxpayers' money goes. Quebec pays 
billions of dollars every year, the pretext being that it is truly 
getting value for its money. We have heard that tune many times 
from the members opposite.
<P>
	I gave one very specific example of an area where Quebec 
pays without getting value for its money. We could look at other 
cases as well. If the hon. member is truly sincere about what he 
wants to do, he should agree to our proposal and we will get the 
final word. We want to know who pays and how much, where the 
money goes and why.
<P>
	Second, the ideal thing would be for each department to 
examine the Auditor General's report and make it bedtime 
reading. Then, every night, the horror stories uncovered by the 
Auditor General would be recalled and efforts would be made to 
correct them. Of course, this is just wishful thinking. Every 
year, the same thing happens. If we did not talk about the 
Auditor General's report, no one would. The government wants 
it to be swept under the rug.
<P>
	Third, I do not think that Canada should be held up as an 
example for other countries to follow, considering that in just 
the one small area that I mentioned, namely the national police 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1202"> 1202 </A></B>
<P>
force, the annual deficit is between $300 and $350 million. 
There is not a manager in the world  who would be around long if 
he ran his business or his country in this manner.
<P>
	Fourth, I do not think we should compare Canada to some of 
the other countries that we do. We have a clearly established 
democracy and clearly established social values, in Quebec as 
well as in Canada. We are a people, at least in so far as Quebec is 
concerned, who are looking not just for our fair share, but 
looking to become masters in our own home. Quebec has been 
repeating the same thing for years. Eventually, English Canada 
will get the message and the comparisons which you were 
making earlier will stop.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question and comment period is 
over.
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe-National Defence; the hon. member for 
Laval-Est-Human Rights; the hon. member for 
Waterloo-Privatization; the hon. member for 
Frontenac-Environment; the hon. member for 
Roberval-Cigarette smuggling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Here we are just days 
before the new Liberal government produces its first budget. 
Nothing further having come out of the proposed review of 
federal government expenditure, the Official Opposition has 
decided to make it the subject of this allotted day.
<P>
	The Liberal Party said in the red book, and let me quote from 
their dear book: ``. . .cynicism about public institutions, 
governments, politicians, and the political process is at an 
all-time high. If government is to play a positive role in society, 
as it must, honesty and integrity in our political institutions 
must be restored''. I hope they remember what is written in the 
red book.
<P>
	Did the Liberal Party think that the people would not demand 
transparency in government expenditure in order to regain 
confidence? Apparently not. The same red book states: ``. . .give 
MPs a greater role in drafting legislation through House of 
Commons committees'' and if I read correctly ``these 
committees will also be given greater influence over 
government expenditures''. That is what we are debating today.
<P>
	Once in office, how can the Liberal Party honour this promise 
made in the red book other than by supporting the motion put 
forward by the Official Opposition? This is the first action the 
Liberal government could take to regain the confidence of the 
people.
<P>
	Parliamentarians are accountable to the people, not obscure 
bureaucrats who develop behind closed doors measures that will 
apply to everybody.
<P>
	We ask that the Liberal Party grasp the tools to honour their 
own promises, not ours but their own, and that parliamentarians 
devote themselves again to their primary function, which is to 
represent the interests of their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	In tabling his report, the Auditor General tells us implicitly 
that parliamentary action is needed to solve the federal 
government's problems. In making an annual list of horrors in 
the federal government, the Auditor General is telling 
Canadians that the federal government cannot manage its affairs 
responsibly as long as parliamentarians do not throw open the 
doors of departments and turn on the lights in the offices where 
decision-makers meet. The hope for budget discipline is pretty 
slim.
<P>
	In his 1990 report, the Auditor General points out the 
complexity of federal-provincial relations in environmental 
matters. The constitution acts of 1867 and 1982 are inoperative. 
This is one of the most difficult sectors for dividing 
responsibilities among the various stakeholders.
<P>
	This constitutional confusion encourages duplication such as 
parallel assessments, similar inspections by each level of 
government, and endless disputes on issues vital to our 
societies' development. We must accept the fact that Canadian 
federalism is unable to meet tomorrow's challenges.
<P>
	We now know that this federalism is impossible to reform, as 
we tried to do with the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. 
These accords showed Quebecers that they could not, within this 
framework, hope to participate in building a society meeting 
their expectations. The environment is a perfect example of a 
major problem caught in jurisdictional battles that can only be 
resolved by a sweeping reform of our institutions, namely 
Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	If environmental mismanagement was only a problem at the 
federal-provincial relations level, we could expect Quebec's 
sovereignty to be a done deal, so let us gather up our belongings 
and head back home to get organized.
<P>
	But the federal government's involvement is so confusing that 
it is hard to find the department accountable to the public. This 
confusion is in no one's interest and the Official Opposition 
must act to eliminate it.
<P>
	The Auditor General said that these ``divisions in 
responsibility for environmental matters is a patchwork that 
makes it almost impossible to assign public accountability for 
safeguarding Canada's environment''. In 1990, 24 federal 
departments had responsibilities under over 50 pieces of 
legislation impacting on the environment. The environment 
department alone had responsibilities under 36 pieces of 
legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1203"> 1203 </A></B>
<P>
	The St. Lawrence action plan is one example of the 
interdepartmental co-ordination problem at the federal level 
alone and not at the federal-provincial level. While Quebec and 
the federal government agreed on the St. Lawrence action plan, 
some federal departments got all tangled up in their respective 
areas of jurisdiction. Responsibility for financing and 
implementation was shared by three federal departments, 
namely Environment Canada, Industry, Science and 
Technology, and Fisheries and Oceans, with total contributions 
of $84 million, $20 million and $6 million respectively.
<P>
	The St. Lawrence action plan called for these departments to 
co-ordinate their activities to meet common objectives, a 
difficult undertaking in the federal government. The problem 
was that the first two departments had different objectives.
<P>
	The environment department focussed on the demonstration 
and application of technologies meeting the immediate needs of 
the 50 industries involved in the action plan, while the industry 
department focussed on the development and application of new 
and improved technologies that can be marketed nationally and 
internationally and be eventually applicable to industries along 
the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	The Auditor General explained that ``this difference in 
departmental objectives and program funding mechanisms led 
to co-ordination problems. Although an agreement was 
concluded between the two departments to provide for a 
management structure to co-ordinate their respective programs, 
it proved to be ineffective''. I am talking about two federal 
departments and not about federal-provincial agreements.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We know that it is difficult to combine the objectives of the 
governments of Quebec and of Canada, we live with that, but 
when the confusion is within the federal government itself, the 
situation is downright unacceptable.
<P>
	If only the federal government were satisfied to solve 
problems just on its turf, among its departments. But no, it feels 
the need to intervene and create problems on all sorts of issues 
with as much right as Quebec.
<P>
	Environment Canada acts in almost all the 18 fields in which 
the Quebec Department of the Environment operates. Thus, two 
levels of government are acting towards the same goal of 
limiting industrial pollution. Because of this duplication, 
Quebec and Ottawa each have regulations on industrial waste 
from pulp and paper mills.
<P>
	Pulp and paper mills are thus subject to two sets of 
regulations. For each company, the expenses incurred to apply 
these regulations are about $100,000 a year.
<P>
	I conclude by telling you that the Official Opposition has 
given its word to Quebecers that it would defend their interests 
in Ottawa until they decide on the question of sovereignty for 
Quebec.
<P>
	Our proposal is meant to get the federal government to clean 
up its finances and its programs, if necessary. I repeat: its 
finances and its programs.
<P>
	The interests of Quebecers, as well as those of Canadians, are 
badly served by the way the apparatus of government now 
operates, and a thorough study is therefore necessary.
<P>
	The federal government should respect its commitments to 
the people as written in its famous red book, it should seize the 
opportunity which we in the Official Opposition are giving them 
and it should let parliamentarians study government operations 
thoroughly, and in that way we can perhaps act in the best 
interest of the people of Quebec and Canada and get our 
respective societies back on a less chaotic road.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I cannot say I disagree with the thrust of the opposition motion 
or with much of the member's intervention.
<P>
	I cannot help but note that the substance of the motion refers 
to a desire for a process that would review the public accounts 
with reference to overlap and duplication between federal and 
provincial governments.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could advise the House whether he or 
his colleagues intend to propose such a motion as this to the 
public accounts committee which will be chaired, as I 
understand it, by a member of the Official Opposition. This 
committee, which is charged with the very subject matter that is 
the substance of this motion, is free to deliberate in an open and 
transparent process, as all of the committees of the House do. 
They have the power to subpoena, if not subpoena to call for 
attendance and production of papers and persons and they can 
report to the House whenever they wish.
<P>
	The entire ambit of the motion can be put to and pursued by 
the public accounts committee if the members of that committee 
so wish and I wonder if the hon. member's party is prepared to 
proceed in that direction.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I wish to thank the 
member, who does not disapprove of our motion, if I understood 
the interpreters correctly. If he does not disapprove, then I think 
he approves. I thank him.
<P>
	I also think that he must make a distinction between the public 
accounts committee and a special committee studying all 
federal spending and overlap.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1204"> 1204 </A></B>
<P>
	In talking about the public accounts committee, we must look 
at what it is and what it does. The committee's mandate is not to 
study all the spending of all departments, nor all programs or the 
overlap between federal and provincial programs. We want to 
keep the role of the public accounts committee as it is. Since this 
morning, we have heard that answer or that statement from the 
other side of the House. Before thinking of broadening the 
public accounts committee, they should have looked at what it is 
and what it does. They would have clearly seen that it is not on 
the public accounts committee that we have to examine federal 
government spending item by item or to consider overlapping 
programs. Let us keep the public accounts committee as it is and 
set up a special committee.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I will again quote the red book or remind hon. members 
opposite that they promised it in their red book and we are 
giving them a chance to keep their promise. Instead of being 
recalcitrant to our requests, they should thank us. That is what I 
wanted to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be very brief.
<P>
	First of all I appreciate the fact that the hon. member read the 
red book. I do not know why he says that he is giving us the 
opportunity to defend the book. He needs the opportunity to 
defend his presence in this room.
<P>
	I am puzzled and hurt when the issue is addressed and they say 
Quebec and Canada. One has to be straightforward as a 
Canadian. Either one is for Quebec or one is for Canada. One is 
most welcome to be in Canada and we want you to be in 
Canada-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt. Please put your 
remarks through the Chair. That diffuses things a little bit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assadourian:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has to be fair and 
tell us whether he is for the separation of Quebec. Is he for 
sovereignty? Or is he for independence?
<P>
	I have been here for the last three months. I am confused 
where the opposition stands on this issue. Those members keep 
mentioning the same issue over and over again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I have only two 
minutes left. I could meet with the member to explain the 
position of Quebec sovereigntists to him; unfortunately, unless 
and until Quebec is a sovereign country, we are part of Canada. 
Again, unfortunately, I am disappointed to see a Canadian 
sitting in Parliament who does not know Quebec's position. 
Personally I am very disappointed and sorry too about the 
position of my colleague on the other side of the House.
<P>
	I would also have liked him to speak on the subject of today's 
debate, namely an item-by-item committee. We are also 
showing our good will, in that as long as we are in this House, we 
would like it to work as well as possible. I invite him to discuss it 
with me after, because in two minutes, I cannot explain 
Quebec's position to him, but I will be pleased to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of the Environment will speak for 20 minutes. 
Am I right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Environment and Deputy Prime Minister):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be speaking 20 minutes and so will each of the 
members from this side who will speak after me.
<P>
	I would like to start with a brief comment on the remarks 
made by the hon. member for Terrebonne who wanted to explain 
to my colleague, if he had more time, what the position of 
Quebec is. How arrogant of him to think that he owns Quebec's 
position, that the Bloc Quebecois owns Quebec's position. As 
far as I know-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker, about 
the speech of the hon. member opposite. The question and 
comment period is over. He should be making his own speech 
instead of commenting mine. Is that not so?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members are allowed to refer to a 
speech that was just made. He can make a comment, and you can 
ask questions after his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had not been 
sitting in this place for such a short time, he would know that I 
am allowed to say whatever I want in my speech. I am sorry if 
that bothers him, but I will say it anyway.
<P>
	What I wanted to tell the hon. member is that neither he nor 
his party represent the position of Quebec. As far as I know, they 
are not the Government of Quebec. Quebec has, as far as I know, 
a government which still has the right, a right that it exercises 
very freely, to remain in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	As far as I know, Quebecers will have to make a choice, but 
there are some, including myself and my colleague here, who 
hold views on Canadian federalism which are necessarily those 
of the member opposite. For example, it is certainly not right to 
assume that everyone in Quebec is an indépendantiste. That is 
defeinitely not what the outcome of the referendum held in 1980 
leads us to conclude, and it is certainly not what Quebec will say 
if there is another referendum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1205"> 1205 </A></B>
<P>
	To take for granted that all Quebecers want to leave the 
Canadian federation is to fool oneself, as some did in 1980.
<P>
	Those of us on this side of the House also like to think that we 
represent Quebec. I spent nine years as a member of Quebec's 
national assembly and I have always worked hard to help my 
fellow citizens from Quebec, regardless of where they live, of 
their religion, or of their language, and I refuse to accept this 
notion that Bloc Quebecois members are the only ones who 
speak for Quebecers.
<P>
	I am aware that federalism, and especially the Canadian 
federal system, is responsible for everything that is wrong in 
this world, at least according to the Bloc Quebecois members. It 
is always the federal government's fault. I have heard this old 
tune time and again. Of course we can look at the Auditor 
General's reports and find things which we would all like to see 
changed.
<P>
	I remember those Auditor General's reports when I was a 
member of the opposition in Quebec. I remember the investment 
of several hundred millions in asbestos mines. Asbestos was a 
mineral which nobody in the world wanted and the United States 
were going to ban its use. I remember that. I also remember that 
millions of dollars were invested in Quebecair. I remember as 
well the investments made in that sugar refinery on the south 
shore. I could give you all kinds of examples where the Auditor 
General said to the government: ``Look, a lot of bad decisions 
were made''. This happened under Conservative and Liberal 
governments in Ottawa, as well as under the Parti Québécois and 
the Liberal governments in Quebec.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that such things happen. However, we want to 
look forward and try to correct these mistakes. We accept 
criticisms, and in fact the ministers who answered questions the 
other day said to the Auditor General: ``We accept those 
criticisms. We know that these things happened but we are not 
going to blame our government because another government 
was in office then. However, we recognize that things must 
change''.
<P>
	In our red book, we undertook to change things and to ensure 
that government administration would be a tighter and more 
efficient management exercise. I know that the federal system is 
complex. In fact, any government structure is complex. We 
recognize that but, at the same time, it is a system whose value 
has been proven. After all, our country has so far enjoyed 126 
years of peace, freedom and kinship, this because French and 
English speaking Canadians understand each other. The 
problem is a political one. It is a problem which we created 
ourselves.
<P>
	The Canadian federation is, in many ways, a model. I know 
that we are going through a recession. I also know that a lot of 
stupid decisions were made over the years, both at the federal 
and provincial levels. Today, all the provinces, including 
Ontario, which was formerly the engine of our economy, 
Alberta, Quebec, and all the  others, are experiencing very 
serious economic difficulties.
<P>
	We want to try to make things more practical. In fact, we want 
to use this recession as an opportunity to think about what we are 
and what we have to do to be more effective.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what we want to do. We do not want to look back and 
say it is the fault of the federal government, it is the fault of the 
Alberta government, or the Quebec government, or the 
Newfoundland government. We want to say: Is there a way of 
making this federation work better?
<P>
	The whole principle and thrust of the red book is: Let us put 
the parochial quarrels of the past aside and behind. Let us look 
above and beyond. Let us find a way to work together to solve 
these problems rather than fighting these silly quarrels.
<P>
	This hon. gentleman cites the mounted police as an example 
of Quebec paying more than it receives. In turn we could say in 
the milk industry Quebec has 48 per cent of the share of all milk 
distribution in Canada, much more than the share of its 
population. We could say in unemployment insurance Quebec 
receives $1.5 billion more than its proportional share because of 
course its unemployment rate is proportionately higher than that 
of comparable provinces. We could say Quebec receives three 
times more from the federal treasury through the manpower 
training program than it invests itself: $900 million versus $300 
million.
<P>
	We can quote these figures to prove our points one way or the 
other. What does it prove in the end? That in a federation there 
has to be a system of checks and balances. Sometimes a province 
pays a little more here, sometimes it gains a little more there.
<P>
	What would Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario say, the 
provinces which contribute the total share of the transfer of 
moneys to provinces that are in a less favourable state? What 
should they say?
<P>
	What Canadians in general say, and in Canadians I include 
Quebecers because they are also Canadians and would prove 
that they want to be. I know they will stay in Canada. However, 
all Canadians say that the system is not perfect. It was not 
invented to be perfect. Surely we can make it more responsible, 
make it fairer, make it work better.
<P>
	For nine years I served at the provincial level. For nine years I 
know there were a lot of frustrations among us because of 
overlap, because of duplication, because of federal legislation 
or rules that impeded our work. I concede this. One can say: 
``Fine, there is duplication, there is overlap. I am going to turn 
my back on it. I am going to make sure the federation works 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1206"> 1206 </A></B>
<P>
worse. I am going to walk out and destroy what we have created 
together''. But there is another solution. Address it.
<P>
	I was environment minister for three years. I had all kinds of 
discussions and debates with my federal counterpart and other 
provincial counterparts. Within the council of environment 
ministers of Canada we tried to look for solutions to delete the 
overlaps, to address the duplications. Duplications are still 
there, but it is possible to find examples in Canada where we can 
work together.
<P>
	Recently we created an infrastructure program. Somehow all 
provinces without exception have joined in voluntarily. 
Agreements have been signed. It is an example of the three 
levels of government working not only efficiently but in 
harmony to create a system that works.
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Finance met with Quebec and the 
other provinces regarding transfers from the federal government 
to the provinces. Again they worked in harmony to arrive at a 
common solution.
<P>
	It is not always going to be harmonious. The other day the 
ministers of health met and certain of them had objections 
regarding the latest move on tobacco taxes.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time we have to look into the overall pattern and 
make sure that within our system we meet, we talk and we 
dialogue.
<P>
	The minister for whom I work is sitting next to me. In May she 
is going to meet for the second time with other environment 
ministers. I know my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois was 
citing the environment ministry and the 18 problems. Sure, there 
might be 18 problems. There might be 28. But the idea is that 
when we sit together we can harmonize our laws, our regulations 
and our objectives. Today we are in a recession together and we 
either sink or swim together. That realization is coming to pass 
more and more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have all come to the realization-be it the Government of 
Quebec, of Alberta, of British Columbia or the Liberal federal 
government-that unless we work together to reduce 
duplication and overlap, unless we get together and act like 
people who have a common goal of resolving problems, we will 
never get anywhere. This realization seems to have sunk in 
today.
<P>
	Let me give at little example to my friends from the Bloc 
Quebecois who think that nothing is working in Canada. In my 
region, back in the days when I was sitting at the National 
Assembly-14 years ago already-we had instituted quarterly 
meetings where all the provincial and federal members of 
Parliament and all the mayors of the region regularly got 
together to address the common problem of duplication and 
overlap. There were no distinctions based on political 
affiliation. Well, these people have been sitting together for 14 
years. We have looked into public transportation, public health 
and environmental problems. We look for solutions together.
<P>
	Today, in that region and Sault-au-Saint-Louis, the 
neighbouring region, instead of waiting for a quick fix 
concerning manpower training programs, they have decided to 
work together: the federal government, the provincial 
government, the municipalities and the target communities.
<P>
	In fact, by assuming responsibility for ourselves and coming 
up with practical solutions that work in the real world, we will 
demonstrate to our fellow citizens, wherever they live, that the 
federal system can work. But if anyone creates difficulties along 
the way or tries to throw a monkey wrench into the works, as you 
are trying to do, it will not work.
<P>
	You are saying that the public accounts committee's mandate 
is not broad enough to examine all that you want to examine. 
The public accounts committee is under your control. The 
chairmanship will be yours. Just the other day, the Solicitor 
General stated in this House that the autonomy of House 
committees will be significantly enhanced. You have here a 
committee that you will chair, where you can examine all the 
public accounts of the federal government and you are arguing 
that it will not deal with separate departmental accounts. Look, 
the standard practice is that all departments are represented to 
defend their account statements.
<P>
	I was in the opposition for four years, so I know what I am 
talking about. I have examined the accounts of the ministries of 
International Affairs, the Environment and many others in 
Quebec. You have full latitude to ask questions. In fact, by 
making all the figures available to you, the Auditor General is 
helping you. And your work will be transparent because we all 
want to be transparent. You have control over this committee. 
You will be quite free to examine all cases of overlap. You say 
that we must cut spending but you now want to create a kind of 
ceremonial committee in addition to the one that already exists. 
Use the committee you already have. Make it work. Find 
constructive solutions to its problems. Do not use it to make 
your little speeches on Canadian federalism that never lies, but 
rather to help make it more effective, more real, more equitable 
if you think it is not equitable enough.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Our respective positions do meet in the end. What we are all 
pursuing is a better quality of life for ourselves and for our 
children. We want to become full-time citizens who can enjoy 
their complete freedom. My philosophy is different from yours 
because I think I can attain these objectives within the Canadian 
federation, while you think that it must be destroyed so that 
something new can be built. All the tools are in your hands. You 
have all the House committees. You have the public accounts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1207"> 1207 </A></B>
<P>
committee to prove, while waiting for tomorrow's dream, that 
your ideas count.
<P>
	In conclusion, as I was saying the other day during the throne 
speech debate, I know that we are talking about expenditures, 
about public efficiency. The government I am a member of today 
is committed to changing things for the better. And if it does not 
do so, it is your job to show us the right way. At the same time, I 
think there is a fundamental issue underlying all this. What you 
are trying to do is emphasize what my colleague from Ontario 
pointed out earlier; you are trying to prove that Quebecers and 
Canadians are completely different, and never the twain shall 
meet.
<P>
	On this side of the House, we will work honestly and most 
vigorously but without enmity. We may be opponents but we 
will never be unfriendly. The greatest tribute that you can pay to 
Canada is, as I stated the other day, your mere presence in this 
House, which all parties have graciously accepted, including the 
representatives of British Columbia and Alberta. However, if 
the situation were reversed, I wonder whether you would have 
been as obliging. In my view, your presence here is the best 
possible proof we could have of the fundamental freedoms we 
enjoy in Canada, of the spirit of warmth and generosity 
embodied in the Canadian federation.
<P>
	I hope that as you go about your work, scrutinize the public 
accounts, examine the work of the Auditor General and take a 
close look at everything that does not work in the federation, you 
will be able to work with us to improve things, not merely for the 
sake of some ideology, but for the welfare of citizens who, far 
from worrying about ideology, want a better standard of living, a 
job, opportunities for young people who today are looking for 
work. That is the message I am getting, in both francophone and 
anglophone areas of my riding. Constituents are not concerned 
about Quebec's independence. They are worried more by the 
fact that if Quebec independence soon becomes the focus of 
discussions in a referendum, the issue will divide us, just as it 
divided us in 1980. It will divide families and create economic 
instability, something that you yourselves wanted to avoid. It 
will create instability-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member's time 
is up. The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has the 
floor.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will be brief. In any case, I have often heard the hon. member 
for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis make this kind of speech before, 
in the distant and not so distant past. All I can say that the Bloc 
Quebecois is here in force with 54 members, not because people 
were doing us a favour but thanks to our democratic system. If 
the hon. member has no respect for democracy or for the choice 
of Quebecers, then he is the problem. We feel quite comfortable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, order. As far as I know, there 
were no interruptions during the speech by the parliamentary 
secretary. On behalf of all members, I would ask that the same 
courtesy be extended to other speakers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said there is not a single member 
of the Bloc Quebecois who feels uncomfortable in this House, 
and I will tell you why: because Quebecers gave us a very clear 
mandate. And if you ask your constituents, you will find that 
Canadians are satisfied with our role as the Official Opposition. 
It is just as well we are there to monitor this government, not 
only on behalf of the Quebecers who elected us but also on 
behalf of Canadians, because otherwise you would do what you 
felt like doing and cause as much harm, socially and 
economically, as the Conservatives did before.
<P>
	That being said, we may not get it right all the time, but I think 
that since 1980, the federalists have got it all wrong. In 1980 
during the election campaign, they told Quebecers: ``Vote no for 
renewed federalism''. In 1981 we had the night of the long 
knives. In 1982, unilateral patriation of the Constitution. At the 
time, the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis was a 
member of the Quebec National Assembly, and he voted against 
patriation of the Canadian Constitution, against the majority in 
the National Assembly. He was there, or rather his government, 
the government to which he belonged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. What the 
hon. member said is entirely incorrect. I voted for patriation of 
the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis may respond in a few minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I made a minor historical mistake. 
Not many members voted in favour, did they?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Five.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> The National Assembly voted almost 
unanimously against unilateral patriation of the Constitution.
<P>
	In 1984, the sovereigntists decided to take the ``beau risque'' 
and give the federalists another chance, like the hon. member 
opposite. Meech failed. Bélanger-Campeau resulted in a 
consensus unheard of in Quebec. The federalists responded with 
two years of nonsense which led us to the moment of truth. I will 
explain
<P>
	In 1992, Quebecers voted massively against the 
Charlottetown nonsense. That was the moment of truth for 
Quebec and Quebecers. And again on October 25 last year, they 
gave us a clear mandate. Why did they not vote for you? Why did 
they not vote massively for the Liberals? Quebecers who vote 
want to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1208"> 1208 </A></B>
<P>
choose their option for the future, and I am sure they will chose 
the option of sovereignty.
<P>
	I have one more important item. The Leader of the Official 
Opposition extended his hand in friendship when he arrived 
here. We intend to work very hard to improve public finances 
and the state of the economy in Quebec and Canada. Do you 
know why? Because when Quebecers choose the sovereignty 
option, we do not want to be stuck with an even bigger share of 
Canada's debt than would be the case today, and second, we 
certainly don't want Canadians, our friends and trading 
partners, to suffer as the consequences of an economic situation 
created by this government and its poor economic decisions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would invite the hon. members, and 
especially very senior members, to direct their remarks to the 
Chair.
<P>
	Does the parliamentary secretary wish to respond?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said what I had to say. I think we 
should let the people be the judge.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I do want to repeat that I think it is very sad to hear this 
distinction made between Canadians and Quebecers, as though 
we were two separate nations, two foreign nations that do not 
talk to each other.
<P>
	As far as I know, Quebecers are Canadians. If they decide 
otherwise, then we will see, but so far they have decided to be 
Canadians. Again, I think making these distinctions between 
Canadians and Quebecers is a sad reflection on the current 
situation, where people are trying to divide a country which 
should be united in hard times, when we all have to work 
together to solve our problems. Solving problems is a joint 
endeavour. We must be united and work together, and I don't 
think the kind of distinction they are purposely making is 
conducive to Canadian unity.
<P>
	I intend to work very hard, and I hope to be able to convince 
the Bloc Quebecois that working together is better than working 
divided.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel a bit 
concerned and sad when I listen to the comments of the hon. 
member who just spoke. Unfortunately I forget which riding he 
is from because I met him here and there, in Chambly during the 
byelection of 1991, and I do not know which riding he belongs to 
now.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member in what way he represents 
Quebecers in a more legitimate manner with 16 members from 
Québec sitting on the other side of the House when we are 54 on 
our side but we are not allowed to get our point of view across in 
this House.
<P>
	In the 1991 byelection, he got about 7 per cent of the vote in 
the Chambly county. Who wins elections, the minorities or the 
majority? We are 54 elected members in this House to defend 
our point of view. Do we still have to get on our knees before the 
hon. member from God knows where to ask permission to stand?
<P>
	We made a proposal and submitted it to the House. If he wants 
to rise against it, I do not have a problem with that, but, 
nevertheless, he has to respect the democratic dimension of 
Quebecers's vote on October 25.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not respond directly to what 
the member said. I think he is showing a lack of class and 
courtesy. I am not the member from God knows where, I am the 
member representing a Quebec riding of 73,000 constituents. I 
was elected in the same capacity as he was. I was sometimes 
defeated in my lifetime, these things happen, but I have accepted 
defeat with great magnanimity. I did not say that I always win, 
but I work according to my beliefs.
<P>
	I would say to the member that I never said that he does not 
represent the majority of Quebec electors in the Canadian 
federation. That is obvious, his party has got 54 seats. I had said 
that very clearly to the member for Terrebonne, who was saying 
that we were talking about Quebec's position. I said the same 
thing as the minister of Foreign Affairs did the other day, that is 
that the Bloc members do not have a monopoly on talking for 
Quebec, that we too, even if we did not get as many votes, are 
also Quebecers and have a say in the matter. The present Quebec 
government represents a position which is not separatist and it 
too was elected with a majority.
<P>
	That majority and minority issue saddens me. I am above all a 
Canadian. I do not have this problem with majority and 
minority, French speaking and English speaking, division and 
narrow-mindedness. I want to work for all my fellow citizens. I 
do not accept to be called a member from God knows where. I 
am a member representing a riding where almost 45 per cent of 
the people are French speaking, and they too matter in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in any country, when the tax rate reaches excessive 
levels, as is the case in Canada now, the ordinary, even 
traditional discontent of taxpayers towards taxation turns into 
resentment. And when the people learn that their hard earned 
money is mismanaged and wasted, such a mess transforms their 
resentment into frustration.
<P>
	When taxpayers witness financial mismanagement in a 
country, there is always a threshold, a limit it would be 
dangerous for any government to cross.
<P>
	When, in this country, people see part of the population break 
the law with complete impunity, they see it is necessary to act 
illegally to have an unreasonable tax reduced, they see that very 
rich people are legally exempt of income taxes while others are 
crushed under the tax burden, social uprising is not far. I am not 
saying we are there already, but I think, in spite of the infinite

patience of Quebecers and Canadians, it could very well happen. 
History is full of such cases.
<P>
	Without going back to the beginning of times, let me remind 
you of an event we all know about very well. The French 
Revolution was triggered by nothing else but excessive taxes 
and the squandering of the royal court. Remember that the main 
point in the list of demands drawn up by the Estates-General 
was the existence of a privileged class which paid no taxes.
<P>
	In Canada and Quebec we have our own kind of aristocracy, a 
class of people who pay almost no income tax. The marquesses 
of today are the family trusts. I do not want to get too sordid, but 
I suggest there is in our country, as there was in France in those 
days, a toiling and struggling population which is shocked by 
such injustice and incompetence.
<P>
	Please do not misunderstand me, Mr. Speaker. Once again, I 
am not saying the two factors of frustration I mentioned, 
mismanagement and an unfair taxation system, will lead us 
directly to a revolution. We are two very patient nations, too 
wise to let the situation reach that point. In our country the 
individual is far from ready to attack the state, but to escape 
taxes, he is quite ready to hide from the system and hide his 
activities.
<P>
	That kind of behaviour is spreading and, because of that, our 
government is losing control over, even knowledge of, a 
complete section of the economy. Civil disobedience is no 
longer reproved by public opinion. What a failure, Mr. Speaker, 
what a decline!
<P>
	Year after year, the Auditor General, without succeeding in 
shaking the government out of its lethargy, displays for the 
public, who eventually becomes blasé, damning examples of 
carelessness, shortsightedness and waste on the part of previous 
federal governments. This year takes the cake. And, to my 
knowledge, the Auditor General, when reviewing our finances, 
stays strictly within the federal jurisdiction and consequently, 
does not look into this generous source of administrative 
abberation and squandering of public funds which is the 
overlapping of jurisdictions.
<P>
	Here is a particularly painful example of this mess, in view of 
its victims, old age pensioners. Let us see what the Auditor 
General has to say about that. This meagre pension which is, as 
you know, the only source of revenue for a lot of people, could 
be increased, without dipping into the public purse, if the $200 
million or so in overpayments were clawed back or, better yet, if 
they were never paid out, thanks to a better managed fund.
<P>
	If, at least, old age pensioners could be heard by the 
government when they have a problem! But the Auditor General 
tells us that there are 17,000 inquiries on a waiting list and 
sometimes, it takes more than a year before they are answered. 
And that is not all. Service centres and regional offices receive 4 
million telephone inquiries a year, but 7 million calls are either 
cut off or dropped by the caller, out of despair, I guess.
<P>
	Overlapping and duplication of services are another source of 
waste and paralysis, exposed time and time again but always in 
vain.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	A study done by the Treasury Board of Canada in 1991 
indicates that in five provinces at least there was duplication in 
60 per cent of federal and provincial programs. That situation 
being obviously profitable to some officials, it is doubtful they 
would readily propose to eliminate those duplications.
<P>
	As for those elected, they have ignored to date a situation 
which they find politically beneficial since it enhances their 
visibility.
<P>
	I would now like to talk about duplication, particularly in 
Quebec. The hon. member for Joliette recently made a 
declaration in this place and I find it useful to repeat it. ``The 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission has estimated that the 
elimination of duplication resulting from the sovereignty of 
Quebec would allow a saving of $233 million in transport and 
communication costs. This is therefore a potentially important 
issue, although there is no recent study evaluating the cost of 
present duplications in provincial and federal programs''. The 
hon. member went on to say that some sources estimate the total 
cost at close to $3 billion. Those figures come from the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission whose recommendations were 
accepted, namely by the provincial Liberals. It was five billion 
according to them. This is why we ask this House to give the 
Auditor General, without any political partisanship, the 
mandate to conduct a serious and comprehensive study on 
duplication and overlapping in all those spending programs.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is imperative that we regain the confidence 
of Canadians in the government's expertise and sense of justice. 
If not there will be no revolution but we will see the rise of an 
underground economy in Quebec and Canada. Tax dodging 
would become socially acceptable, still illegal perhaps but 
legitimate. Elected officials would be despised. In a word, our 
model democracy we pride ourselves on, and rightly so, would 
slowly deteriorate.
<P>
	To win back the trust of Canadians, we must first have a 
parliamentary committee review mercilessly all public 
expenditures, particularly areas of unnecessary overlap between 
federal and provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Second, the government must put an end to undue tax 
privileges for the Canadian tax aristocracy. Like the aristocracy 
which once caused the fall of monarchy in France, these lucky 
few are not only undermining our finances but are also 
threatening our institutions, since the public feel treated 
unfairly in the face of these privileges.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1210"> 1210 </A></B>
<P>
	Such is the double price we will have to pay, that is review of 
expenditures and suspension of privileges, in order to restore in 
the population the minimum of respect that institutions and 
governments should command. Without such respect, 
institutions are in danger.
<P>
	A last word, inspired by this morning's newspapers. Put in 
headlines over four columns, <I>La Presse</I> states ``Martin's first 
budget will hurt''. We knew that. A lot of people are afraid the 
budget will hurt the have-nots, sparing the rich once again. If 
the awaited elimination of abuse-ridden tax shelters turns out to 
be nothing but a snow job, while social program cuts turn out to 
be too real, the resentment of taxpayers could lead to social 
behaviour that would make us all sorry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes.
<P>
	He obviously is not aware that a member of his own party, the 
member for La Prairie, was appointed chair of the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts this afternoon.
<P>
	Is he, then, leading us to believe that a member of his own 
party is not capable of doing this job? If so, then he should ask 
for his immediate removal. As his own party now chairs the 
committee on public accounts, elected this afternoon, perhaps 
he should consult with his member for La Prairie.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is at least the sixth time today 
that we have been told that the committee we are asking for 
would duplicate the work of the public accounts committee.
<P>
	The committee we are calling for is an ad hoc committee with 
a specific time limited mandate and more power than the public 
accounts committee; in particular, it could look at some aspects 
of provincial accounting to gauge the overlap between federal 
and provincial authority. These two committees do not duplicate 
each other. One is permanent with a specific but relatively 
limited mission; ours has a precise mission and we want 
increased power for it.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for bringing forward those points and I want to 
thank the Bloc Quebecois for bringing forward this motion. It 
points to a very serious problem, the fiscal and monetary 
situation that Canada is in.
<P>
	We have seen successive governments plunge this country 
into debt to the point where the members who speak on behalf of 
the Fraser Institute of Canada, which held a seminar here that 
many of our members attended, are suggesting we may be 
beyond the point of return in getting our fiscal and monetary 
house in order.
<P>
	I want to thank the member for bringing a debate to this House 
that focuses to a certain degree on that issue. It is the greatest 
and most serious issue facing Canada today. The powers of the 
federal government, the provincial governments and the 
municipal governments to tax wealth away from the people is 
the greatest threat to the economic well-being of our families 
and individual businesses and so on that we have in this country 
today.
<P>
	The unbridled power and the irresponsible exercise of that 
power as reflected in the governments of the 1970s and the 
1980s and up until this time poses a very serious threat to the 
economic well-being of our future.
<P>
	If those experts from the Fraser Institute know what they are 
talking about, and I believe they have put forward a very logical 
case, then the government should be focusing on this aspect of 
the crisis, and that is the economic, fiscal and monetary aspect.
<P>
	We are looking at the signs of a tax revolt. We see the 
underground economy, cross-border shopping, and we ask 
ourselves why thousands of normally law-abiding citizens will 
buy bootleg cigarettes. These are all signs that people are simply 
giving up on a tax system that has burdened them to the point 
where they can no longer make ends meet and they are seeking 
illegal ways to get around it.
<P>
	I would like to compliment the hon. member and ask him a 
specific question. He has answered my question partly but could 
he highlight the differences between the committee he is 
recommending and the existing public accounts committee. 
Would he respond to that please?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member who just 
spoke for his approval, basically, of the motion we tabled.
<P>
	Before answering him, I would like to point out that, as one of 
my fellow Bloc members said just now, the committee that we 
are calling for would meet one of the promises made by the 
Liberals in their red book to examine spending thoroughly. If the 
Reform Party agrees with our proposal, why are we arguing with 
each other? We all agree.
<P>
	Now, to answer the question about the difference between the 
public accounts committee and the one that we are calling for, as 
I just said, this is to be a committee with a specific time-limited 
mandate and increased powers which would go beyond the 
annual auditing routine done by the public accounts committee 
and which would tackle a specific current situation that the hon. 
member said was urgent and current.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1211"> 1211 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	It would be an ad hoc committee for the present situation, with 
increased powers to meet their objective, which, like ours and 
the Liberals' objective, is to track down unnecessary spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
explain why a special committee of the House should be set up to 
examine public expenditures, especially in the context of 
employment. The first and most obvious reason is the absolutely 
disastrous situation of government finances in Canada.
<P>
	The second reason is the fact that the public has lost 
confidence in its parliamentary institutions, which is something 
very dangerous for democracy. Indeed, the general public, as 
well as the Bloc Quebecois, feel that there is still some fat in the 
government administration.
<P>
	Moreover, because more and more people live in poverty, and 
because the middle-class is getting poorer and poorer, the 
government has a moral responsibility to the public. It must 
have a transparent style of management, and it must also 
demonstrate the efficiency of its structure. In other words, the 
government must prove its integrity to all Canadians, regardless 
of their economic situation and class.
<P>
	Economic growth must be accelerated and unemployment 
must be reduced to lighten the deficit and the national debt on a 
long-term basis.
<P>
	I come from a working family in Chili, where unemployment 
and underemployment are extremely high. As a lawyer in my 
country, I worked for unions and for the government, mostly in 
labour relations.
<P>
	Here, I was a servicing representative for 19 years in 
Quebec's labour movement. I was very active in the FTQ and the 
Conseil des travailleurs et travailleuses du Montréal 
métropolitain.
<P>
	My first concern has always been employment as well as the 
well-being of laid off workers. I sincerely believe that every 
person has the right to a job which is well-paying, satisfying and 
compatible with his or her skills.
<P>
	Through my involvement in the union movement, I often 
witnessed tragic events, for individuals and families, when 
workers would lose their job, particularly when a company 
would close down for good. This is even more tragic when the 
people affected are workers over 45 years of age who have spent 
their entire working life with the company. Unfortunately, the 
legislation, both federal and provincial, does not adequately 
protect the workers who are affected by mass lay-offs.
<P>
	Statistics Canada said that the recession was over. However, 
the current economic recovery is very different from the one 
which followed the last recession in 1981-82, in the sense that it 
has taken a long time to come and it is still slow. This is mainly 
due to the refusal or the inability of federal and provincial 
governments to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The 
current  financial problems of governments have more to do 
with increasingly insufficient revenues than with expenditures.
<P>
	This insufficiency is due to the large number of unemployed 
people who, of course, cannot contribute and must instead get 
help from the state. The fact that the last recession eliminated 
more permanent jobs than the previous one in the eighties says 
something about the magnitude of the present economic 
dislocation.
<P>
	The deterioration of the job situation has adversely affected 
every sector and region, as well as every category of workers.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	However, it is the manufacturing sector that was hardest hit, 
and very early on, by the recession. A total of 248,000 jobs in 
this sector have been lost across Canada. What a disaster! In the 
space of four years, one in every six jobs disappeared.
<P>
	The recession has affected full-time jobs the most. The only 
net gains in this sector have been in the part-time field. Job 
losses have been concentrated in Canada's two main industrial 
provinces, namely Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson has just wrapped up a trip to 
Europe. During his trip, he announced investments in the order 
of $180 million which he claimed would create some 350 jobs. 
However, since he was sworn in as premier last January 11, 
roughly 1,800 jobs have either been lost in Quebec or have been 
targeted for elimination.
<P>
	Virtually every region has been affected, either by a plant 
closure, by staff cutbacks or by relocations. Plant closures have 
been the heaviest in the Eastern Townships. The closure of the 
Asea Brown Boveri kettle plant was just announced. A total of 
340 workers will lose their jobs.
<P>
	I personally came to the aid of ABB, Asea Brown Boveri, 
employees in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu when another plant 
shut down two years ago. I also helped the workers at the Philips 
plant in Saint-Laurent when a decision to close the facility put 
more than 1,000 people out of work.
<P>
	The Montreal region has also been hard hit. Proctor and 
Gamble is closing and laying off 100 employees in 
Pointe-Claire. Dominion Textile is shutting down its dyeing 
plant and as a result, 105 jobs will disappear.
<P>
	On the cultural scene, the <I>Musée pour rire</I> is closing its doors 
after receiving several million dollars in public funds. As a 
result, 40 people have been laid off.
<P>
	In my own riding of Bourassa which includes the municipality 
of Montréal-Nord, the unemployment rate is hovering around 
the 30 per cent mark, if we include social assistance recipients 
who are able to work. And yet, Northern Telecom has just shut 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1212"> 1212 </A></B>
<P>
down its facility, throwing another hundred or more people out 
of work.
<P>
	I should also point out that the fishing industry which 
provides work for the vast majority of the 6,000 Quebecers from 
the lower North Shore, is in dire straights.
<P>
	Unitel has announced it was cutting 150 positions in Quebec 
and the Discus record chain that it was closing down 13 stores 
and laying off 200 employees. And the list of closures and 
layoffs in Quebec and Canada goes on and on.
<P>
	Yet the federal government ran and won the last election on a 
platform of job creation. Their slogan was ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. 
The opposite is happening, with more and more massive layoffs.
<P>
	On Saturday, February 12, 1994, the FTQ will be holding its 
annual meeting on the solidarity fund, the primary purpose of 
which is to create jobs. I take this opportunity to pay a special 
tribute to its founding president, my friend and colleague Louis 
Laberge.
<P>
	He will soon be replaced by Mr. Fernand Daoust as chairman 
of the board of the solidarity fund. Known mainly for his three 
years as president of the Fédération des travailleurs du Québec 
and 22 years as secretary general of the same central labour 
body, my very dear friend Fernand Daoust is also a man totally 
devoted to the cause of the workers.
<P>
	Fernand Daoust is a man of great stature. The Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs du Québec is gaining in him a 
president who will no doubt apply all the talent we is famous for 
to help achieve its goals. On that subject, I would like to tell you 
more about this FTQ solidarity fund which is a positive labour 
initiative to save and create jobs.
<P>
	I am not done, Mr. Speaker, but I will close on this. True 
economic recovery will result in less unemployment and more 
tax revenues.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the Opposition motion that 
says essentially this: to examine federal expenditures by 
focusing on overlap between federal and provincial government 
programs.
<P>
	This is a noble and essential objective. But why is the Bloc 
asking for such a committee? It is something we should look at. 
Of course, like us and like members of other parties, they want 
to know if it is possible to spend better or less. It is a very good 
thing and I share this feeling. I want to do it and I think we all 
agree that it must be done.
<P>
	We heard today an interesting comment from a member of the 
Reform Party. There are still a few differences between the Bloc 
and Reform. It is sometimes difficult to see these differences but 
I think there is at least one. This member from the Reform Party 
indicated that, in his opinion, the Bloc was trying to open a 
constitutional debate.
<P>
	Why would the Bloc want to open a constitutional debate? If 
we analyze this comment carefully, could it be to promote their 
goal, namely separation from Canada? I hope I am mistaken. I 
do not want to accuse them, but I should remind Bloc members 
that this comment was made today by a Reform member. If there 
are any doubts as to the validity of my interpretation, one only 
has to check <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	It is one possibility, but I think that the Bloc may want to 
move in a different direction. Every now and then, they 
remember that they are the Official Opposition so it is only 
natural that they want to embarrass the government. It is only 
natural that they try to create a situation suggesting that the 
current system of government, namely federalism, is not 
working.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why is it that I make those particular points?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc knows very well that there is a committee which 
exists right now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a committee which exists right now that can attain all 
of the objectives that are in the opposition motion. The Bloc 
chairs that committee. It has the key position on the committee. 
If there is a mechanism that exists to achieve the objectives that 
have been enunciated here on paper then are there other 
objectives that it is trying to pursue? Why is it asking to create 
something that already exists essentially to do those things it 
says it wants to do and that we all want to do, and that is to see 
whether we can spend better and more wisely fewer public 
funds?
<P>
	As we examine this question I would hope that we would ask 
ourselves some very serious questions. We talk about concepts 
such as overlap and duplication as if they were the same thing. 
When I raised a question today of a member of the Reform Party, 
whether the member made a distinction, the member sloughed it 
off, I cannot say the party did, as simply being interested in 
saving money. Let me assure the members that we are interested 
in saving money as well.
<P>
	It seems to me that before we go forward we have to have a 
clear sense of what it is we are trying to accomplish. Do we want 
to attack duplication only which to my way of thinking is 
another program that is essentially the same? Do we want to 
simply look at overlap? Do we know the difference between 
overlap and duplication? Overlap is where there are similarities 
but not necessarily a total similarity and a total duplication. We 
are just sloughing that off.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1213"> 1213 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	There may be a necessity for overlap in some situations. It is 
my view that the more we can eliminate overlap and duplication 
the better off we are.
<P>
	Let me give an example. In the whole question of environment 
there are certain provinces that abut territories. There are 
questions of environment that flow from the federal government 
to the territory as well as to the province. There may even be a 
need for duplication.
<P>
	Let me give but one example. We have schools, generally 
speaking that are administered by school boards. In certain 
instances we need schools that are administered by the federal 
government for our aboriginal people. That is changing and it is 
going in the right direction.
<P>
	To simply say we want to get rid of all overlap, all duplication 
without knowing the distinctions between overlap and 
duplication, without considering whether there are some needs 
for overlap and duplication, is not doing this particular activity 
justice.
<P>
	Everybody would agree that there is overlap and duplication 
between the federal and provincial governments that needs to be 
looked at in a very serious way. What I am surprised at as well is 
that we have not talked about another level of government. Is 
there a need to examine whether there is too much overlap and 
duplication among the various levels of government, federal, 
provincial and municipal? There is in many instances.
<P>
	Let us remember that if we are allowing ourselves to look at 
overlap and duplication between federal and provincial levels 
we ought to be able to extend that to municipal levels because 
municipal structures, governmental structures, are created by 
provincial governments.
<P>
	What about overlap itself within certain levels of 
government, within, for example, the federal government, 
within provincial governments, within municipal governments?
<P>
	Let me give a good example of overlap within federal 
governments. I am told that during the last government there 
were programs related to education, training, retraining; 
education broadly defined, if you wish, to be found in over a 
dozen federal departments.
<P>
	Is that necessary? Is that good for the nation? Can we have a 
focus with that kind of spread, that kind of non-co-ordination. I 
think not.
<P>
	In my own province of Manitoba a very serious duplication 
exists between the provincial and municipal authorities. It is 
social assistance. In some cases people receive social assistance 
from the provincial authorities. In other cases it is from the 
municipal authorities.
<P>
	Sometimes it is very difficult to follow why one gets it from 
one level of government or the other level of government.
<P>
	There are differences in programs. There are administrators in 
both and one could logically ask whether that should continue to 
exist.
<P>
	Let me broach another topic. I do not think we have looked at 
the public accounts committee in a serious way. It can review 
spending. If it can review spending, clearly it can ask questions 
about overlap and duplication. Why would we not use this 
committee?
<P>
	In a sense there is a contradiction there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since we already have a committee, why should we set up 
another one? The existing committee can reach the same 
objectives as those mentioned in Official Opposition's motion 
before us today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It seems to me there is a glaring contradiction. We want to 
attack overlap and duplication and yet we are prepared to 
undertake an act that will cause overlap and duplication.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It doest not make any sense at all.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are many studies that point out that there is a problem in 
this area. The House has heard reference to the 1937 
Rowell-Sirois commission, the 1978 study of the École 
nationale d'administration publique, of the 1978-79 federal 
provincial duplication of services review, of the 1984-85 task 
force on program review, of the regulatory reform initiative, of 
the 1991 Treasury Board secretariat study on federal-provincial 
overlap and duplication.
<P>
	The House will perhaps be happy to note something that falls 
in line with the debate today. In this most recent study, in all 
studies, there were activities of overlap in many areas and 
duplication in a number of areas. Overlap in federal and 
provincial programs took several forms. In general, 
governments were managing some of these overlaps and 
duplications in an effective way. However, they all admitted that 
there is considerable scope for improving program delivery 
through better co-ordination or harmonization.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Let me review the motion to make sure that we are talking 
about the same thing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion before us today reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the Government to strike a Special Committee of the 
House, composed of representatives of all the official parties, with a mandate to 
examine public expenditures by the federal government, in light of the Report 
of the Auditor General of Canada, concerning overlap between federal and 
provincial government programs and in accordance with the following 
guidelines:</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1214"> 1214 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the Committee's deliberations would be an open and transparent process 
allowing for the public examination of official matters;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not possible.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the Committee would have the power to subpoena any witnesses whose 
testimony would be considered helpful;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is possible.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the Committee would be required to report to the House by June 23, 1994;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe that the date is different but surely accommodations 
could be made if this is important.
<P>
	I see no reason to create an additional committee but I see 
reason to pursue the objective of examining where we could 
spend less and yet serve all citizens in a meaningful way. There 
is a committee to do it and I would urge that it be done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us do it. I think we should all work together to cut 
government expenditures at all levels and to create jobs for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
attentively to my hon. colleague from St. Boniface, Manitoba.
<P>
	I note his statement to the effect that in Manitoba, everything 
is for the best in the best of all worlds. Unfortunately, I must also 
note that in Manitoba, not as many people speak French as in the 
last century. I would not want the same thing to happen in 
Quebec.
<P>
	As for his question concerning the public accounts 
committee, may I ask if most of the members on that committee 
are from the party in power? If so, could the party in power 
assure us that the proceedings of the public accounts committee 
will be non-partisan? I would really like to hear the member on 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would answer the question. I 
want to emphasize that my riding is indeed St. Boniface. I quite 
agree that many more people spoke French in Manitoba a 
century ago. Unfortunately, there has been a large drop. People 
still speak French in Manitoba, even though only a small number 
really care about the language and culture and have deep 
feelings towards this language and culture.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I would like to add that where I come from, 
and I do not say it in an unkind way because I am not a nasty 
person, we are trying not only to keep what we have and to 
improve it but we also want to try to understand others and to 
develop ways of working and living together to make everyone's 
life better. For us, that is very important.
<P>
	I drew attention in the House this week to a big Voyageur 
Festival we were having and I invited all my colleagues to come 
and see how things were in our part of the country. I would be 
really glad to see you because we hear people speaking French, 
we have native people, we even have people from all over the 
world. Frankly, it is wonderful. Tomorrow night, I will be with 
francophones from France and francophones from Manitoba, 
because we still have people who speak French.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I want to go back to the comment regarding what is going very 
well in Manitoba. I think the hon. member was listening, but he 
was not paying attention as closely as he should have because I 
gave an example of something which was not going well. I said 
that there are problems. If the hon. member thinks there are no 
problems, whether we refer to Quebec, Manitoba or another 
province, then I honestly think that his vision must be blurred.
<P>
	There are problems everywhere. And we are here to solve 
those problems. I recognize that what we are doing here is very 
important. I recognize that everybody wants to reduce spending. 
If this is what you want to do, and I believe it is, fine. But we also 
want to do it, and the Reform Party wants to do it as well. 
However, what I said was that there is already a committee 
where this can be done.
<P>
	The chairperson of that committee will be a Bloc Quebecois 
member. Do we have a majority? I think we do, but you are not 
going to tell me that because we have a majority we are not 
going to listen to common sense, even if it comes from a 
member of another party. If that was the case, it would not work 
at all.
<P>
	The hon. member might want to reconsider what he said, 
because he is suggesting that we, Liberals, do not have people 
who can sit on this committee, listen to a proposal which makes 
sense, and say ``yes, this is a good idea''. I want to assure the 
hon. member that we do have such people. In fact, we have a lot 
of talented men and women who are willing to work for you. 
They want to create jobs and cut non-essential government 
spending, and they also want to make our country better for 
everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that my colleagues did mention several times during this 
debate that the special committee would be a committee with 
accrued powers.
<P>
	As the Auditor General himself keeps telling the government 
year after year: ``I do not have access to all the information''. 
This is something the government has to understand. This is 
something the Auditor General himself is saying. In his report, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1215"> 1215 </A></B>
<P>
he did say that the use of government aircraft cost us $50 
million, including $25 million to transport ministers, but he also 
said that he did not have the tools to examine these expenditures. 
He had the same problems with the information about the  
expenditures of the Royal Canadian Mountain Police versus 
transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	So, more information, that is what we want the committee to 
have in order to consider the expenditures item by item. Give 
your committee all the information available about the 
expenditures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I am glad to be so popular with my colleagues 
from the Bloc Quebecois. I understand what my colleague is 
saying, I am not the government, but I do understand what he is 
saying, and I can assure him that the government understands it 
as well. You are telling us that the Auditor General needs more 
information.
<P>
	You want me and everyone listening tonight to believe that the 
existing committee does not have the authority to give to the 
Auditor General all the information he needs. Well, I want my 
colleague to know that it is possible, the existing committee can 
do just about anything it wants. The question is will the Bloc 
allow the committee to do it? I do not have the answer to that.
<P>
	We can give the Auditor General exactly what he wants. We 
can give him all the information he needs, whenever we want to. 
There is nothing magic to it; it is possible, now-
<P>
	The previous government did not want to do it, but we have a 
new government that wants to help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think this 
is a slight exaggeration. We had an experienced and highly 
respected person, the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, chair 
the public accounts committee for years. He worked tirelessly, 
given the powers he had. The same powers that the committee 
now has. And what results did we see?
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	For years, Liberals on the public accounts committee wanted 
to know everything and to have the same powers as others. And 
what did they do with the powers they had? They were unable to 
get the information they wanted or to force ministers or senior 
officials to testify. Mr. Speaker, the public accounts committee 
has a great deal less power than the Auditor General and you 
misled the public by saying otherwise-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. Would the hon. member kindly 
address his remarks to the Chair. The parliamentary secretary 
has 45 seconds remaining to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have never misled anyone. Sir, 
you have some nerve making this kind of comment! It was the 
previous government that did not want to satisfy the needs of 
members of this committee. I have clearly stated that this 
government is open-minded. We are prepared to co-operate 
with you if you are willing to work with us, for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As there are 20 seconds remaining, I 
recognize the hon. member for Terrebonne.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to quote two sentences from the red book and then you can 
fulfil your duties. ``Cynicism about public institutions, 
governments, politicians and the political process is at an 
all-time high''. There are 15 seconds remianing. ``Therefore, 
the government is proposing to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. It being six o'clock, it is 
my duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALDEFENCE">NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
other side is obviously anxious and interested to hear what we 
have to say; that speeds things up.
<P>
	It is important to wonder about the basic role of the Canadian 
parliamentary system. In the House, various procedures allow 
the Opposition members to enquire about government activities. 
Among these, the Question Period remains a first-rate mean to 
discover and recognize the true position of the government on 
current issues.
<P>
	Therefore, when the government apparently does not wish to 
answer, we can eventually resort to what is commonly known as 
the ``late show'', as you said it yourself, Mr. Speaker, to force 
the government to act more responsibly and to answer our 
questions in the best interest of Canadians. That is where we are 
at now, and I urge the government to give clear answers to the 
questions of the opposition.
<P>
	I asked the Minister of National Defence about an incident 
involving an helicopter of the Canadian Armed Forces and 
Mohawks in Kanesatake and I got more comments and questions 
than answers. Opposition members are entitled to ask about the 
origin of the distress signal detected by Canadian Armed Forces. 
That signal caused the incident on January 21 and as long as the 
public does not know where that signal came from, doubts will 
continue to linger in the mind of all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	The matter is not closed simply because this government tried 
to cover it up through a joint statement of National Defence and 
the Mohawks. On the contrary, one can speculate about the true 
reasons why the government tries to downplay and ignore the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1216"> 1216 </A></B>
<P>
incident. Maybe this government needs to be reminded that 
something did happen on January 21.
<P>
	Why was a distress signal detected in the Kanesatake reserve? 
If that signal was not used in a real distress situation, why was it 
sent? Who sent it and why? What kind of device can send this 
distress signal? Exactly where dit it come from? Was it an act of 
provocation, or rather a mistake made by the owner of a 
state-of-art device who accidently sent such a signal? Why 
Kanesatake?
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Those are the kind of questions for which the government 
refused to give us the information we are entitled to. This 
incident sets a precedent that can have serious consequences for 
the population in general.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me. Order, please. The hon. 
member's time has expired. I recognize the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of National Defence and Minister of 
Veterans Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence has discussed this 
issue at length in the House. We have been open and 
forthcoming about the incident. There is no mystery and there is 
no doubt.
<P>
	As the minister stated, a signal from an emergency locator 
transmitter, ELT, was detected on January 21 by a Hercules 
aircraft during a routine flight. Canadian forces policy dictates 
that search and rescue, SAR activity, be initiated whenever an 
ELT transmitter emission is detected because such emissions 
can indicate the possibility of danger to human life or property.
<P>
	A Labrador helicopter was dispatched to assist the Hercules in 
searching for a possible distress situation. From the air members 
of the SAR team were able to identify the general area. The 
helicopter then set down in the area and crew members set out to 
further localize the source with hand held equipment.
<P>
	Before the source of the signal could be identified, crew 
members were approached by an individual. He stated that shots 
had been fired at the aircraft and that they should leave the area. 
Comments were advisory and did not convey any threat. The air 
crew did not hear any shots being fired nor did they detect the 
presence of weapons. Let me reiterate that there is no physical 
evidence that shots were fired at the SAR helicopter and reports 
that bullet holes were found in the helicopter are absolutely 
false.
<P>
	There were never any reports of an aircraft going down in the 
area, nor was there any visible evidence of a possible distress 
situation. With this in mind the air crew was correct in its 
decision to avoid the unnecessary endangerment of personnel by 
leaving the area. The ELT stopped transmitting the following 
day.
<P>
	Chief Peltier and the Minister of National Defence have 
discussed this issue to their mutual satisfaction. There is no 
dispute over what is Canadian airspace and there is no dispute 
that the Canadian forces will continue to use airspace in the 
conduct of legitimate defence and search and rescue activities.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, on January 21 
I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs several questions 
regarding his government's position on the violation of human 
rights in Mexico.
<P>
	At the time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs answered that his 
government would listen to suggestions and discuss the matter 
with the Mexican authorities.
<P>
	We were surprised at the minister's comments. When one 
realizes that Canada has a long tradition of defending 
democracy and human rights, the government's silence was 
cause for concern. Considering also that the Prime Minister and 
the Minister for International Trade publicly announced there 
was no connection between our trade agreements with Mexico 
and respect for human rights in that country, we started asking 
some serious questions. On the other hand, the Secretary of 
State responsible for Africa and Latin America made it clear that 
Canada was always concerned about human rights issues among 
its trading partners.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment 
intervened on January 24 to establish clearly a link between our 
trade agreements and environmental protection. Are we to 
understand that the government sees human rights as being less 
important than the environment?
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians want to know once and for all 
whether Canada sees a link between respect for human rights 
and the signing of trade agreements and establishing close 
trading relationships.
<P>
	If the answer is yes, why was the government not more 
energetic in its representations to the Mexican government 
following the brutal repression of the people of Chiapas, shortly 
after NAFTA was signed? And how do we justify the privileged 
business relationship Canada has with China, although human 
rights are still being violated in that country?
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If, on the other hand, the new government does not see a direct 
link between respect for human rights and its trading 
relationships, how does it justify Canada's retaliatory measures 
against Haiti, for instance? Quebecers and Canadians want to 
know what the present government's position is and they want 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1217"> 1217 </A></B>
<P>
position to be consistent. How can we explain the fact that the 
government has a double standard?
<P>
	Canada and Quebec enjoy an excellent reputation for 
development assistance and respect for democracy and human 
rights. The Bloc Quebecois also feels that the resulting 
economic space and reciprocal trade are very important for our 
economy. Finally, we ask the government to clearly establish 
consistent criteria for all these countries tp be applied 
consistently to problems concerning human rights and 
democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to remind the hon. 
member for Laval-Est that the Government of Canada remains 
concerned about the conflict in Chiapas State of Mexico in early 
January, particularly the loss of life and allegations of human 
rights abuses.
<P>
	We have conveyed these concerns to the Mexican 
government, both through our ambassador, David Winfield, in 
Mexico and through the Mexican ambassador here in Ottawa, 
Sandra Fuentes-Berain.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is encouraging the Mexican 
government to continue the open and conciliatory approach it 
has taken since the second week of the crisis to address the 
situation in Chiapas, including the following important steps: 
the appointment of Manuel Camacho, the former foreign 
minister and former mayor of Mexico City as the chief 
conciliator for Chiapas; the appointment of Dr. Jorge Carpizo, 
the former President of Mexico's human rights commission as 
the new interior minister; the involvement of Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz in negotiations to resolve the situation in Chiapas; the 
ceasefire; the meetings of President Salinas with indigenous 
groups in Chiapas; the amnesty offered to the Zapatistas by 
President Salinas, which was ratified by the Mexican Congress; 
and the appointment of an ombudsman responsible for human 
rights in Mexico.
<P>
	The Government of Canada trusts that the Government of 
Mexico will address and resolve the fundamental underlying 
causes of the conflict in Chiapas, including social, economic 
and human rights issues.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PRIVATIZATION">PRIVATIZATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
following up on a question I asked the Minister of National 
Defence on January 21.
<P>
	The question I asked related to the excessive cost of 
government moves. The cost of these moves is in excess of $100 
million. Government moves are handled through four van lines, 
three of which are 100 per cent American owned and one that is 
30 per cent American owned.
<P>
	Ten years ago these four van lines were fined a total of 
$250,000 after pleading guilty to conspiring to lessen 
competition. A court order prohibited the companies from 
exchanging information or becoming involved in any sort of 
price and service agreements.
<P>
	These four van lines are still handling government moves and 
are in collusion to stop competition in government moves 
outside of the four van lines. Paul Leader, the senior 
vice-president of operations and director of government liaison, 
of Atlas Van Lines wrote to me and my colleague in Kitchener on 
December 15, 1993. Part of the letter states: ``I am writing to 
you on behalf of the four van lines in Canada, Allied, Atlas, 
North American and United. For the past 25 years this group has 
been working with the federal government handling all the 
moving requirements for its employees.''
<P>
	The government is the biggest client of the moving business 
in Canada accounting for 35 per cent of Canada's moving 
business, yet pays 10 to 23 per cent more than CBC, Canadian 
National Railways, Northern Telecom and Canada Post.
<P>
	A 1992 study by Consulting and Audit Canada conservatively 
identified $10 million in possible savings, which could be as 
high as $26 million.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1983 the Department of National Defence, as the country's 
biggest mover, received the lowest price on an average move 
when compared to five other major corporations. In 1993 the 
federal government paid the highest price on an average move.
<P>
	When I started asking questions related to government moves 
I have been continually frustrated by government bureaucracy. I 
have experienced a classic example of ``Yes, Minister'', a 
British sitcom television program.
<P>
	The interdepartmental committee, chaired by national 
defence, contracts with the van lines to carry out government 
moves. I have had people tell me that weights of goods moved on 
behalf of the government have been inflated, which if correct 
constitutes fraud, and that gifts have been given to employees of 
the interdepartmental committee responsible for contracting 
moves with the van lines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue at hand involves the way the government 
purchases removal services for removal and related services for 
government employees. We are debating it because a claim has 
been made by the hon. member for Waterloo that the 
government thwarted a competitive plan to save taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	Let us review some of the background. As the Minister of 
National Defence stated in the House on January 21, the former 
government received six bids to take over the management of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1218"> 1218 </A></B>
<P>
government moves. Of the six, only one was compliant and cost 
several million dollars more than  the government option. The 
remaining five bids were non-compliant.
<P>
	Only 10 days before the election, former ministers in the 
Conservative government directed two pilot projects without 
authorization, one with a firm whose costs were millions more 
than the governments and the other with a company whose bid 
was found to be non-compliant. In other words, this 
non-compliant company went through normal government 
procedures to get this business but was unsuccessful. 
Nevertheless just over one week before the election, 
Conservative ministers awarded this unsuccessful bidder a pilot 
project. This government immediately cancelled the authority 
to conduct the pilot project.
<P>
	The government is committed to ensuring that the taxpayers 
of Canada get the greatest value for their dollar and we are 
continuing to examine all options that are available to save 
money.
<P>
	One question that comes up is: Are carriers blocked from 
bidding? No, they are not. Potential bidders must meet certain 
criteria in order to qualify. The requirement for the fiscal year 
1994-95 will call for local representation in at least seven 
provinces covering 55 per cent of the interdepartmental 
committee business to meet departmental location 
requirements. That is an improvement over the current 
requirement of 85 per cent in all provinces. This reduction in 
representation was done to further encourage competition.
<P>
	The government is committed to seeking ways to save 
taxpayers' money. The minister understands the hon. member's 
concern and is devoting every attention to ensuring the best use 
of limited resources.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to come back to the subject of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, as the 
information provided by the Minister of Environment puzzles 
me.
<P>
	Allow me to take you back 23 years, to make sure we are all 
fully aware of the threat it poses. I will do my best to report the 
facts as accurately as possible.
<P>
	On September 7, 1970, the <I>Irving Whale</I>, a tanker with a cargo 
of 3,200 tons of oil, sank off the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	A certain number of leaks were stopped, but several common 
murres covered in oil have recently been found on the shore. 
Based on these discoveries, an environmental specialist 
speculated that having reached its stress limit, it is only a matter 
of time before the tanker bursts open.
<P>
	What bothers me is not having the faintest idea what actions 
have been taken. Let me explain. To a very specific question on 
her intentions concerning the release of the Marek report on the 
condition of the wreck, the minister answered that she would 
make it available as soon as possible. However, discussions with 
Coast Guard officials seem to indicate that there would actually 
be two separate reports instead of just the one, as I thought 
initially.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	On top of the Marek report, there would be one from the CEF 
consulting firm on environmental hazards. Both reports, by the 
way, are still secret.
<P>
	Is there not cause for concern when you ask the Minister of 
Environment if her department has a specific plan to avert a 
potential environmental disaster and she answers that she is 
looking for a financial solution?
<P>
	If the financial aspect carries so much weight, perhaps the 
financial cost of some 3,000 tons of oil spilling on the shores of 
the Magdalen Islands and Prince Edward Island should be 
evaluated.
<P>
	If only out of respect for the citizens who are living under the 
constant threat of a spill, the time has come to show 
transparency and tell the truth about this disaster waiting to 
happen.
<P>
	You will agree with me that, had this wreck been in Halifax 
harbour, we would not have had to wait 23 years for action. 
Things would have moved much faster.
<P>
	Last Thursday, the Minister of Environment said she opted for 
refloating the tanker.
<P>
	If this issue has been moving like never before during the past 
few weeks, as she reported, can the Minister of Environment tell 
us why it is that the people who are living with this time bomb 
will have to wait until the summer of 1995 for refloating to be 
undertaken?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, as an evidence of openness, 
it is I, first of all, who informed the member for Frontenac about 
the <I>Irving Whale</I> problem.
<P>
	The first thing I did as a minister was to tell all the critics from 
all the political parties what my priorities were. It is I who 
informed the member opposite that, 20 years ago, the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> cracked and that I was trying to make it a priority of 
refloating the boat.
<P>
	We must compare this action with the one that was taken by 
the leader of the opposition, who was himself the minister of 
Environment for almost two years. I come here and after only 
100 days, I have the plan ready to start, not because we had 
movements from the Opposition, but because the member for 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine, directly, and the member of Prince 
Edward Island worked in consultation and in conjunction with 
myself, the minister.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1219"> 1219 </A></B>
<P>
	I take my responsibilities seriously.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member talks about transparency and openness. His 
own leader was Minister of the Environment for almost two 
years and did not even answer the letters of the fishermen who 
wrote to him from Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fishermen, seeing a time bomb, wrote to him. He did not 
care to reply to their letter.
<P>
	I think that we have a plan. We are working very hard and 
there were even meetings last Monday. Meetings are planned in 
the riding. The member of Parliament in the riding is the one 
who has the real power. He already had access to the meetings 
that will take place on March 2 and 3, both in Prince Edward 
Island and Îles-de-la-Madeleine and, after that, you will see 
that we will get results. In 100 days, the Liberal government can 
solve a problem that has been dragging on for 20 years. That is 
real power.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, on January 
21, I repeated the question on cigarette smuggling I had already 
asked I do not know how many times. I never found the answer 
satisfactory, but we finally have an explanation in the admission 
made by the leader of the government this week.
<P>
	The important thing about this cigarette smuggling affair 
must not escape us-and I was the first to ask the Prime Minister 
questions about the possibility of reducing taxes to help Quebec 
solve its cigarette smuggling problem.
<P>
	First, the Minister of Finance answered for the Prime Minister 
and said: ``There is no way we are going to lower taxes''. Then, 
the Prime Minister told me: ``Maybe we will lower taxes. We are 
discussing it with the provinces''. Later on, I was told: ``We 
probably will lower taxes''. Finally, the government did lower 
taxes as requested by the Premier of Quebec.
<P>
	On the same issue, when I explained to the Prime Minister 
how serious the cigarette smuggling problem was in Quebec, he 
first told me: ``Oh! cigarette smuggling is not such a serious 
problem in Quebec. The RCMP is taking care of it''. Then, I was 
told: ``Yes, there is smuggling, but everything is under control. 
Shipments are being intercepted by the RCMP and maybe the 
problem will eventually disappear''. Later on, I was told: ``Yes, 
there is smuggling, but the hon. member will not convince us 
that it is the native people who are engaged in this kind of 
activity. There is smuggling, the RCMP are doing their job, but 
it is not necessarily the Indians that are doing the smuggling, as 
the hon. member for Roberval says''. And finally, they came to 
recognize that ``yes, there is smuggling. Yes, it is being done 
mostly through the Akwesasne reserve''.
<P>
	They also finally admitted, when the Solicitor General 
answered a question I asked, that the RCMP were recovering 
80,000 boxes of cigarettes. Just imagine what that represents. A 
quick tally showed that this amounted to a tiny percentage of the 
cigarettes smuggled into Canada.
<P>
	This week, when the Prime minister announced the plan, the 
RCMP finally recognized that it was able to control barely 1 per 
cent of all cigarette smuggling throughout Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Environment was talking earlier to my 
colleague about transparency. The cigarette smuggling issue is a 
fine example of smoke screens. This is an example of an issue on 
which we, the opposition, with our little means, have had to try 
and get information every day, every minute, every moment this 
House has given us to finally uncover the truth, to shed some 
light on a serious problem which was really disturbing 
Quebecers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I simply want to say that there are two other 
problems concerning the smuggling of cigarettes which have not 
been solved by the Prime minister. He has not done all his 
homework yet. He has not succeeded in convincing premiers of 
other provinces to join in the plan, which would have been 
essential. Now that he is only halfway there, Ontario will 
become the linchpin of smuggling activities in Canada.
<P>
	And then he has not succeeded in meeting with the Indian 
reserve leaders to prevent any sad incidents which could take 
place. We are now being told that the Solicitor General has done 
his job.
<P>
	It is disturbing to see such openness. It is disturbing to see that 
one has to wring scarce information out of this Parliament.

	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, on January 21 the opposition House 
leader stood in this House during question period and accused 
the Prime Minister of vacillation on the subject of fighting the 
contraband cigarette trade. In fact the member for Roberval said 
and I quote: ``His hesitation is the main reason for the growing 
revolt among Quebec convenience stores''.
<P>
	In response to this unfounded accusation I would like to share 
with the House what the Leader of the Opposition, the member's 
boss as it were, said about the Prime Minister's leadership on 
this issue: ``I think that Jean Chrétien behaved like a Prime 
Minister-and as such guardian of the integrity of the law''. 
This was quoted in the <I>Toronto Star</I>.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The opposition House leader and his party are trying to take 
the credit for the Prime Minister's decisiveness and his national 
action plan.
<P>
	Canadians know the truth. Canadians understand the 
complexity of this issue and that the plan including enforcement 
crackdown, a reduction of consumer taxes, special action on 
tobacco manufacturers and the largest anti-smoking campaign 
in Canadian history is not thrown together in a couple of weeks. 
Months before members of his party were on national TV 
breaking the law openly, this government was working 
diligently to put together balanced public policy.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said in his statement on February 8, 
there is no perfect solution but we have come up with a fair, 
workable and decisive action plan. We must put an end to the 
terrorizing of entire communities. Canadians are counting on all 
members from all sides of this House to accomplish this very 
important task.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask for the indulgence of 
members. A stopwatch is clearly needed here in the chair. I think 
I have been cutting members off who have not gone to the 
maximum. The member for Waterloo has asked that he be given 
another minute since I cut him off and the Clerk agrees that I cut 
him off a minute too soon.
<P>
	With the indulgence of all present I would ask that the 
member for Waterloo be allowed to finish his remarks. He has 
another minute. Is that agreeable?
<P>
	Hearing no dissent, thank you. The hon. member for 
Waterloo.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, we will have 
to cut and paste <I>Hansard</I>, but thank you.
<P>
	There are further examples of employees working for the 
government retiring on pensions and then going to work for one 
of the moving companies.
<P>
	Further information sent to the government in an attempt to 
win a share of the business by an excluded move management 
company and answers from the government ended up in the 
hands of the van lines.
<P>
	This is not right. As the biggest mover in the country we 
should be receiving the best price on behalf of the taxpayers of 
Canada. At a time when we are looking at major cutbacks to 
military expenditures, we need to be as cost effective as 
possible. We must fight waste and inefficiency.
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> did a series of articles on this issue. In an 
editorial on January 28, 1994 the <I>Citizen</I> called for a Commons 
committee inquiry. I join that call for an inquiry. We cannot as a 
government afford to waste $25 million or more in these times 
of fiscal restraint.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted.
<P>
	This House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.31 p.m.)
