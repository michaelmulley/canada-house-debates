      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more than Queen and Consort, Her Majesty and His Royal Highness have become in a sense our friends, familiar companions on a shared journey to the full expression of our national identity over the past six decades, one of whose basic components is the encouragement, dignity and stability of our constitutional order at the centre of which is the Maple Crown.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressures this marriage has faced—media, public and family pressures—are beyond our imagination. And yet the solidity of their marriage highlights the value of an institution that has been called into question many times over. Our Queen's sense of duty and Philip's strong and innovative spirit are complementary; their marriage is a true union of spirits. We must never take for granted the sacrifices they have made by fulfilling their calls. We must never stop being amazed that they share “the love that asks no question, the love that stands the test; that lays upon the altar the dearest and the best.”</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House high partisanship and deep difference often causes us to divide, disagree and dissent. That is rightly so. It is the stuff of politics. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on a day like this we can perhaps for a few moments think of a greater truth, the stuff of romance, of vows kept and love sustained, and commitments shared on the part of two of the most active senior citizens in the world who maintain so busy a round of duty, bringing happiness and a sense of belonging to so many that they meet.</div>

Bryon Wilfert (Richmond Hill, Lib.)</A>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to speak today on behalf of my party and my constituents on the occasion of such great joy: the diamond wedding anniversary of Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So often in this House we are forced to deal with matters of great consequence. We respond to issues of the economy, social justice, peace and war. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is refreshing indeed today to stand to speak of something so fundamental, so inspiring and, in this day and age, so rare as two people linked together for a lifetime, bound by love and duty to each other, to tradition and to their country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, because of this couple in question, one must agree that it is a matter of great consequence. Our Queen and Prince Philip are part of our history. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my friend across the chamber so ably reminded us, the royal couple has left an indelible mark on the post-war history of our nation. In Canada, great matters of state, commerce, sport and culture, seem to demand obviously great attention. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, in large part, is because of who we are as a nation: a proud member of the Commonwealth and the inheritor of a parliamentary system, and so many other civil institutions that have served us so well. But it is also, in large part, because of who they are and the dedication that they have shown this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been our Queen, the Queen of Canada, since 1952. Without a doubt, no royals have seen more of this country, charmed more of its people, and met more of our prime ministers. Think about this. The first prime minister Elizabeth met in her role as monarch was Louis St. Laurent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear, from time to time, of uprisings of anti-monarchy sentiment in this country. But it strikes me that more often than not those who speak harshly of the monarchy do so in a way that targets the institution not its present occupants. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People may object to the cost of the office, the pomp and the ancient traditions. But they are generally careful to target their disdain in such a way as to spare the royal couple. This is perhaps the greatest tribute one can pay to the Queen and her Consort. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an age of instant opinions, banner headlines and tabloid journalism, Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh have been able to insulate themselves from the worst of it. No mean feat when they have lived their lives and have spent their marriage at the centre of 60 long whirlwind years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about that as well, not only being married for 60 years but being married for 60 years under a spotlight that follows their every step; a spotlight, perhaps even more significantly, that follows the every move of their children and, now, their grandchildren, too.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who lives in the public eye must stand in awe at the patience and grace with which the two elder royals have conducted themselves. It is a spotlight, I might add, that they have not sought but that they have lived with in grace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Majesty was born to play a role. The Duke of Edinburgh, 60 years ago, agreed to join her on that stage. Together, they have performed brilliantly. And on this day in particular, they deserve our thanks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip have never forgotten Canada and we, in turn, must remind ourselves never to take them for granted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I said the royal couple has been an important part of our history. I believe that I can safely say the same about their role in our nation's future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, the proud members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, I offer heartfelt congratulations to our Queen and her Consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, on the occasion of their 60th wedding anniversary.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People all across Canada and throughout the Commonwealth join together in recognizing and paying tribute to a remarkable achievement of 60 years of marriage. Indeed, the whole world watched the magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey yesterday to mark the longest royal marriage in known history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All weddings are public affairs but some couples more than others have to live in the full light of public life, no one more than the Queen and Prince Philip, as recent years have proved. The poet laureate of Great Britain spoke these words at the ceremony yesterday:</div>
    </p><a name="Para774253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>
          <p> Love found a voice and spoke two names aloud--<br> two private names, though breezed through public air--<br></p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
    </p><a name="Para774254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak for those of us in public life who have often marvelled at the poise, the dignity, and the character demonstrated by the Queen and Prince Philip as they performed their many duties, duties that often took them to this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians have enjoyed seeing our Queen celebrate a trio of milestones in recent years: her Golden Jubilee marking 50 years of her reign, her 80th birthday, and now her 60th wedding anniversary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen and Prince Philip have earned our admiration, our affection and our esteem as an example of unwavering devotion, dedication, sense of duty and integrity. They are an inspiration to the loyal subjects in Canada and the Commonwealth. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Her Majesty has been a dutiful and steadfast influence and beacon of stability in a rapidly changing world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the NDP and the many Canadians who feel deeply proud of their monarchy, may they continue to share with us as they enjoy many more years of health, happiness and companionship.</div>

    <center><b>Question No. 12--</b></center><b>Mr. Dennis Bevington</b>:<a name="Para774283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to a national energy strategy: (<i>a</i>) what is the government's position on the development and implementation of a national energy strategy; and (<i>b</i>) are there current impediments developing and implementing a national energy strategy and, if so, what are they?</div>
    </p><b>Hon. Gary Lunn (Minister of Natural Resources, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para774284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the response is as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para774284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government of Canada is committed to building a strong and distinctive energy advantage.  We understand that energy is critically important to our Canadian way of life and long-term economic growth.  Canada is the only stable, democratic country in the world with growing energy export capacity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our energy policy is guided by the principles of a free and competitive market, respect for the provinces’ jurisdiction as the direct managers of Canada’s resources and targeted initiatives to protect the health and safety of Canadians, e.g. pipeline regulation, and environmental sustainability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that the production and use of energy, particularly fossil fuels, generate air emissions that contribute to smog and negatively affect the health of Canadians.  Our challenge is to ensure that we become a clean superpower.  Canada has a responsibility to produce and use energy wisely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiatives under our government’s ecoACTION plan are practical actions that combine economic opportunity with environmental and social sustainability.  We are focused on three areas: renewable energy, energy efficiency and science and technology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote renewable power, we have committed $1.5 billion through the ecoENERGY renewable initiative to put 4,000 megawatts of clean energy on the grid.  In budget 2007, we increased access to accelerate capital cost allowance for industries generating cleaner energy and provided $2 billion over the next seven years to provide incentives to producers in the biofuel sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve energy efficiency, we have launched the $300 million ecoENERGY efficiency initiative which includes measures to encourage the construction, operation and retrofit of more energy efficient buildings and houses.  We are also strengthening the energy performance standards under the Energy Efficiency Act and regulating fuel consumption in motor vehicles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our promotion of clean energy technology through the $230 million ecoENERGY technology initiative is focused on accelerating the development and market readiness of technology solutions in clean energy supply.  We recently added $85 million through federal granting councils for research on key priorities on energy and the environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal energy policy will continue to serve Canadians well and to provide benefits in a number of areas, such as: maintaining and enhancing the prosperity of Canadians;
providing a secure supply of energy for Canadians and Canadian industry; and
producing energy in a sustainable manner consistent with our environmental objectives.
</div>
    </p><a name="Para774292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements that compose the federal energy policy will continue to evolve so that Canada can meet the challenges and benefit from opportunities that arise in international and domestic energy markets and accommodate new technologies and new cleaner energy sources as they become commercial.  The federal energy policy is sound but not static and we will continue to look for ways to improve this approach through dialogue with Canadians, which include all levels of government, industry and other stakeholders.</div>

    <center><b>Question No. 43--</b></center><b>Ms. Tina Keeper</b>:<a name="Para774293"></a><p>

    </p><b>Hon. Chuck Strahl (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians, CPC)</b>: <a name="Para774294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the response is as follows:

</div>
    </p><a name="Para774295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)* Indian and Northern Affairs Canada’s policy is to deliver the income assistance program according to provincial and territorial rates and eligibility criteria. Shelter allowance falls under the basic needs component of the income assistance program. From fiscal year 2003-2004, when the policy renewal for income assistance took effect, until fiscal year 2005-2006, approximately $11.1 million had been reimbursed to Manitoba First Nations living on reserve. Of this amount, approximately $3.7 million has been reimbursed to 23 First Nations living within the Churchill riding; </div>
    </p><a name="Para774296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Since 2003, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has been reviewing its income assistance policy with respect to shelter allowance to ensure each region is applying the shelter allowance component according to provincial and territorial legislation; </div>
    </p><a name="Para774297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has reviewed its application of shelter allowance and is satisfied that it is consistent with provincial and territorial rates and eligibility criteria; </div>
    </p><a name="Para774298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) No funding or structural changes have been made to the shelter allowance component of the income assistance program; </div>
    </p><a name="Para774299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Budget 2007, tabled on March 19, 2007, includes $300 million for housing, $150 million in fiscal year 2007-2008 and $150 million in fiscal year 2008-2009, which does not include funding for shelter allowance. The 2007-2008 main estimates, tabled on February 27, 2007, include about $652.8 million for the income assistance program. *This would include approximately $60 million for shelter allowance, based on the 2005-2006 expenditures of about $59.6 million. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to join my colleagues in the House in discussing a very important piece of legislation that has been brought before us for our consideration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people, on hearing the name of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3, An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</A>, may think it deals with immigration policy, but in many respects this is a security bill. This proposed law of course deals with security certificates and, in particular, the issues that arise out of the February 23, 2007 Supreme Court of Canada decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is, as has been stated a number of times by various members, that if new legislation is not passed by this House to address concerns raised in the February 2007 Supreme Court decision, then the security certificate process will effectively terminate, so this is indeed an important debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security certificate process itself has been in existence for approximately 20 years. In fact, a variation can be found as far back as the 1960s, when it was utilized to remove from Canada an organized crime figure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1991 we have seen in this country the use of security certificates 28 times. Since 2001, a pivotal mark, of course, in the history of anti-terror initiatives, the Canadian government has issued six security certificates. The system most notably has been amended twice, once in 1991 and again in 2001.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole security certificate system does represent a contentious process that has over the years created as many critics, it seems, as supporters. Among those that have opposed the system are the Canadian Bar Association, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, Canada also has come under criticism for its security certificate system from the United Nations Committee Against Torture, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the United Nations Human Rights Committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notable Canadians such as former solicitor general Warren Allmand and former foreign affairs minister Flora MacDonald have also expressed opposition to the security certificate system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there has been support for the system both from Canadians at large and from successive Canadian governments that identified the security certificate system as an important and indispensable tool to deal with individuals who represent terror, crime or human rights threats to Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that an earlier court challenge to the security certificate system resulted in the December 10, 2004 decision by the Federal Court of Appeal that found the process constitutional. This, of course, remained the prevailing judicial ruling until June 2006, when arguments were made with respect to two individuals being held on security certificates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of these June 2006 arguments before the Supreme Court of Canada was the judicial decision of February 23, 2007, which immediately changed some provisions of the security certificate system and required the government to amend the law within one year, that is, the court issued a suspended ruling with effect by February 2008.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the court's rulings with immediate effect was the decision to strike and effectively replace the provision that distinguished between refugee claimants or non-residents and those with permanent resident status.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspended ruling dealt with, of course, the fairness of the exclusionary provisions with regard to evidence being used to sustain the security certificate. This part of the Supreme Court of Canada ruling goes to the heart of the issues that the government has indicated it is trying to address with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>, which we are debating today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the court essentially ruled that the absolute inaccessible nature of the evidence used to hold a person on a security certificate was inconsistent with sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The ruling is of significant consequence to Canadians.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030">(1030)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Charter of Rights and Freedoms represents for Canadians not only a document, but rather a depository of our national values and our traditions of freedom. When our highest court finds provisions of a law are incompatible with the charter, we are called to take note.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> is designed to address the issue of secrecy with respect to evidence. The Supreme Court, in simple terms, found the total secrecy and inaccessibility of evidence used to hold a person under a security certificate to be egregious and in need of redress. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, by creating the so-called advocate, has, as its purpose, the redress of the Supreme Court's concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">justice minister</A> would create a list of advocates. These would be lawyers, as we understand it, with at least five years of relevant experience, have no conflict of interest and in possession of the appropriate security clearance. These advocates would have an opportunity to meet with their clients prior to reviewing the evidence using only the court summary that is not considered sensitive. Then they will have access to the evidence. Once this has taken place, they cannot reveal to their clients the contents of the evidence. They can make a judicial appeal based on their viewing of the evidence with respect to the contents but they cannot reveal its contents to their clients. This is, of course, a major departure from the traditional view of lawyer-client privilege.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that there remains a secrecy aspect of this process that still seems to challenge most conventional views of judicial fairness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to remember that these situations are unique and rare. They apply only to non-Canadian citizens and there is judicial recourse, albeit limited in comparison to standard legal practices with which we are generally accustomed as citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country, we are not alone in these challenges. The United Kingdom has undergone similar debates and challenges. In 2004, the House of Lords, or law lords, ruled against the system in place there that allowed for unlimited detention. The result, after much debate and angst within the political arena, was a significantly modified and much more limited system of non-traditional detention for potential terror and human rights suspects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for us today as parliamentarians is not unlike that which has faced legislators in the United Kingdom and other traditional western democracies. What is the proper balance between fundamental human rights protections and the need to protect the state and its citizens from persons of risk and, in particular, non-citizens who seek to take up residence in Canada?</div>
    </p><a name="Para774342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fundamental question, a question that we will need to consider carefully over the next short period of time leading up to our vote on this matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must tread carefully when we venture into the realm where fundamental legal rights need to be compromised or withheld. We must exercise caution when we make decisions that afford to our security services and the court's secrecy that we would normally consider inconsistent with the principles of our democracy and our judicial system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, over the coming days we as legislators will determine and finally vote upon the bill that is before us today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the need for security of our state and of Canadians require the measures we are bringing forward into law? This is a question we will reflect upon as we prepare to vote on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has changed. There are threats that would once have seemed inconceivable to us that now present themselves as real. Is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> justified? Does the need for this kind of law outweigh the concerns?</div>
    </p><a name="Para774347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know all members of the House will ask, as I will, these important questions as they cast their vote in the very near future. Canadians expect no less than this from us and we must serve them well in this regard.</div>

It allows for their deportation without them ever having been charged or convicted of those very serious crimes. Here we are removing people from Canada who are alleged to have committed very serious criminal violations but have never been charged, convicted or punished for those crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member believes that it is appropriate to remove people from Canada without holding them accountable for serious criminal activity, like terrorism or threats to national security, and then sending them to their home country or to another jurisdiction without them ever having been charged, convicted and punished for those serious criminal matters.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of what I was trying to state in this debate is that I have serious concerns, as do many people who are involved in human rights. Many organizations, from Amnesty International to others, have raised concerns and alarm bells. We want to ensure that whatever legislation we bring forward is charter compliant. We heard from the Supreme Court that there were issues of concern in the legislation that was brought before this House in years past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One positive thing I have seen come forward from this is the role of the special advocate. It is something that the United Kingdom also has in place, and I see it as a very favourable thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must say that there are still some concerns with this legislation but, at the same time, I think it warrants going before the committee to at least have a discussion there so we can hear from the different witnesses who come forward, specific groups that are involved in human rights, and then let us make our decision when it comes before this House at third reading.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great thing about our parliamentary system is that we do not adopt laws in one day. It is a slow process and I know the process frustrates some people but there are some beneficial aspects that come out of it. One of them is that we can look at legislation, speak to the different stakeholders out there, the different community groups that have issues of concern, and the legal experts and then make the decisions and, if necessary, amendments at the committee. At the committee stage we have the ability to hear witnesses, make proper amendments and then come before this House for a third vote. </div>

    </p><a name="Para774362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been mentioned, security certificates do pose a challenge in terms of human rights. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously on February 23, 2007, that the process of determining the reasonableness of security certificates violated section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court was very clear. The government does require a mechanism to remove individuals from Canada who pose a threat to national security. However, the system must be reformed and the court had particular concerns with respect to the secrecy of the judicial review system, which prevents individuals from knowing the case against them and, hence, impairs their ability to effectively challenge the government's case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court agreed that the protection of Canada's national security and related intelligence sources does constitute a pressing and substantial objective, but it is also found that the non-disclosure of evidence at certificate hearings is a significant infringement on the rights of the accused.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774365"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the government must choose a less intrusive alternative, notably the use of special counsel to act on behalf of the named persons, while protecting Canada's national security. The Supreme Court gave Parliament one year to allow Parliament the opportunity to design a legislative remedy that protects Canadians and respects basic charter rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> would amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to create a special role, the role of a special advocate. The purpose of the special advocate is to protect a person's interest in proceeding where evidence is heard in absence of the public and of the person or their counsel. This should provide better representation to the person who is detained.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to see the bill be sent to committee as we want to ensure that the role of the special advocate has powers, that it is not just a puppet. Hence, the bill, with its various changes, needs to be sent through for a thorough review.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill proposes some changes that are positive. For example, when people are detained under a security certificate, the bill proposes that the people detained must have their detention reviewed by a judge of the Federal Court within 48 hours of the detention beginning. Any person still detained six months after the conclusion of the first review may apply for another review of the reasons for his or her continued detention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774369"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we have five Muslim men who are subjected to security certificates in Canada. Only one man, Hassan Almrei, , remains at the Kingston Immigration Holding Centre, which has been nicknamed by critics as Guantanamo north.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mohamed Harkat, Mohammad Mahjoub, and Mahmoud Jaballah have all been released from prison but are under strict house arrest provision, as is Adil Charkaoui who successfully challenged the previous laws as unconstitutional.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration security certificate procedure still allows suspected terrorists, as well as refugees and landed immigrants accused of human rights violation or serious criminality, to be detained and deported from Canada. However, many deportations have been delayed over claims that their lives will be endangered should they return to their country of origin.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of the security certificate process have slammed the current bill saying that it changes little and will likely be back before the Supreme Court before long. Matthew Behrens, the coordinator of the campaign to stop secret trials in Canada, says that the legislation would continue to leave the accused in the dark. He said that it would also allow evidence to be heard that would be considered inadmissible in a court case against a Canadian citizen.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has also faced criticism from the Canadian Council for Refugees, the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group and the Canadian Arab Federation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill which is before us is similar to current laws in Britain where special advocates attend closed door hearings. The British system has drawn complaints for the special advocates' lack of necessary cooperation and information from intelligence agencies to be effective. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the concerns and therefore, it is important that the bill be sent to committee for further review before we make any decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court laid out several options it would consider appropriate. Both the House committee and the Senate committee, in reviewing the previous anti-terrorism act, spent considerable time on this very issue and provided very clear recommendations on how to address the void left by the court's decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the decision of the Supreme Court on security certificates and praise the wisdom of the court in providing Parliament with a year to address the issue. We need to ensure that this bill, when it is presented before Parliament, has the right tools, meets the Supreme Court challenges, and the committee will do its due diligence in ensuring that the security certificates do not violate the human rights of Canadian citizens and are mindful of issues. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a world where global terrorism can come to our doors in no time. It is important to protect the security of Canadians; however, we need to ensure that we are in line with the Geneva convention on human rights.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism, espionage and organized crime are serious matters that should be dealt with under the Criminal Code, not the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security certificates are the wrong way to deal with the threats to our national security. The security certificates process violates civil rights and undermines core values of our justice system. That is why they were struck down by the Supreme Court in the first place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security certificates will not make Canadians any safer. That is why we are going to be opposing this legislation. I would ask my colleague across the way, are there not two major problems with the security certificates? First of all, it seems to me that they do not punish those people who are plotting terrorist acts. Security certificates allow for the detention and deportation of those suspected of terrorist activities, but they do not ensure suspected terrorists are charged, prosecuted or jailed for their crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is whether the aspects of the security certificate process, like detention without charge and the inability of the accused to know or examine evidence against them, do not undermine our justice system and our civil liberties.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the provisions that we do have in the legislation seem to be modelled on the system in Britain. In the United Kingdom a number of special advocates have withdrawn from that process because they believe that it was too significant a compromise to the principles of basic fairness in the criminal justice system there. In fact, just recently the joint human rights committee of the British parliament said that the special advocate process was Kafkaesque and amounted to a star chamber. Those are very serious criticisms of that system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A former special advocate, Ian Macdonald, said that what he was doing as a special advocate was adding a fig leaf of respectability to a very odious process and he resigned because of that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, two ministers give authorization to issue such a certificate: the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</A>. The current security certificates procedure is set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act passed in 2001. It provides that the ministers of Citizenship and Immigration and Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness can sign a security certificate attesting that a permanent resident or foreign national—and not a citizen—is inadmissible to Canada for security reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the security certificate is signed, it goes to the Federal Court. When the court deems that the disclosure of certain evidence or testimony would be injurious to national security or the safety of any person, it holds in camera hearings without the accused’s lawyer and the accused. This procedure makes it impossible to cross-examine witnesses heard behind closed doors or to verify the reliability and truthfulness of the evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge gives the accused a summary of the information or evidence the judge examined in the accused's absence. The accused can be heard at a hearing. If the Federal Court judge deems the certificate reasonable, it automatically becomes a removal order, and the accused cannot appeal this decision. However, in January 2002, in the Suresh case, the Supreme Court held that, barring extraordinary circumstances, deportation to torture will generally violate the principles of fundamental justice.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 23, 2007, in the decision in <i>Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the security certificate procedure violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, certificates violate section 7 of the charter, which reads as follows:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security certificates have been part of Canadian legislation since 1978 and have been used on a number of occasions. A total of 27 certificates have been issued to date, five of them since the attacks of September 11, 2001, if memory serves. The certificates issued in recent years in connection with the threats of terrorist attacks have generated interest among many legal experts in the mechanism for assessing and examining the risk an individual poses to society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of the judicial process that is initiated after a security certificate has been signed gave rise to some points of contention, which led the government to revisit several elements of the certificates. Unlimited detention, when there is the risk of torture upon deportation, was sharply criticized by all parties. The Kingston Immigration Holding Centre, where individuals were being held, was referred to as Guantanamo North. The ministers responsible for authorizing the certificates have often stated, to defend their position, that the individuals were being held in a “three-walled prison”, insinuating that they were free to leave the country at any time should they wish to do so. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration inspected the detention conditions of individuals held at the Kingston Immigration Holding Centre. My colleague for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78519,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78519&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</A> also attended these meetings. We presented our recommendations and observations to the government. The majority of individuals detained have since been released under very strict conditions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem with the current conditions. These make life just as difficult for the friends and family of these individuals because their lives are now governed by conditions that require them to obtain a multitude of authorizations from the court.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one of these individuals has been forced to wear an electronic bracelet so they may be tracked at all times.

Mr. Harkat must ask the court's permission just to have relatives visit and dine with him. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court ruling states that he must be accompanied at all times by a person duly identified by the court which, in my opinion, interferes with the freedom of other individuals who can no longer live a normal life because they must fulfill the conditions at all times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have asked us why we do not sentence them if we have proof that they present a threat to security and the government has enough evidence to incriminate them. They should be brought before the courts and be given a fair trial.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774409"></a><p>

Among other things, we asked that there be a special advocate and the right to appeal. As far as detention is concerned, we asked for a review of indefinite detention, that a mechanism be implemented to review its relevance. We also asked that this detention be reviewed so that at a given point, a person can be released. This will prevent keeping the person detained without evidence and allow that person to be properly charged in our courts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, there is nothing in the bill on other issues such as warrants to arrest a person, a foreign national, on the burden of proof required and on evidentiary evidence that may or may not have been obtained through torture. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will fear of the threat of sleeper terrorist cells that the government is talking about take us? When people conspire to commit criminal acts, we usually charge them and bring them before our courts.</div>

If there is one thing that I learned in my practice at the Bar... it is that good cross-examination requires really careful preparation and a good knowledge of your case.

    </p><a name="Para774418"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of legal experts felt that the government should have taken the opportunity to conduct an in-depth review of the security certificate procedure, taking into account the experience of special advocates in other countries such as Australia, New Zealand and England.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, a study on security certificates commissioned by the Canadian Center of Intelligence and Security Studies, with financial support from the Courts Administration Service, explained the weaknesses of the systems used in Canada and elsewhere in the world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration heard from Mr. Ian MacDonald, who, in 1998, was appointed special advocate to the Immigration Appeals Commission by the attorney general of the United Kingdom. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also assigned to deal with national security cases before and after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. He publicly resigned in 2004 in protest against the indefinite detention powers without trial imposed by the British Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, and has since acted in control order appeals. He represents immigration clients at the European Court of Justice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. MacDonald explained why he resigned and the downsides of using special advocates. I think that the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security could benefit from Mr. MacDonald's comments and expertise. Furthermore, the University of Ottawa has carried out a number of studies on security certificates and the use of special advocates in the process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the bill that is before us, I have the impression that the government has tried to do the minimum necessary to comply with the court's ruling. We have examined the bill and will make some amendments to it to address certain concerns about the security certificate procedure. However, for the time being, I believe that the government has taken a risk in doing the bare minimum. The process could have been reviewed in depth, and the government had a golden opportunity to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House decides that this bill should be studied in committee, the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security will be able to make these amendments, and the Bloc Québécois will also put forward some amendments. For example, the Bloc Québécois will propose an amendment that allows counsel defending the interests of an individual facing deportation to see his client again in order to obtain additional information, once the evidence has been disclosed. Experience with the CSIS complaints process has shown that it is possible to work this way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to see the right to appeal the Federal Court decision and an end to indefinite incarceration and arrests without warrant of foreign nationals. We would also like to change the burden of proof so that certificates are upheld only if the court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual represents a threat. We also want the bill to prevent the deportation of an individual to a country where he could face torture.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have long denounced the security certificate mechanism. The government's position, the procedure it is proposing, has been widely criticized. Consequently, we would like a number of aspects of this bill to be corrected, and we will have the opportunity to do so in committee.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a few words about the role of the Supreme Court in bringing about these kinds of changes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time Parliament has been asked, invited or told by the Supreme Court of Canada to do some additional homework to repair our legislation. I can recall a situation that developed about 10 years ago. It was the Feeney case, which was in front of the criminal courts. The case had to do with the ability of a police officer or peace officer to pursue an individual who was suspected of a crime. It is essentially a scenario involving hot pursuit, where the individual is seen committing the crime and then followed until the officer is able to arrest the individual and bring him or her in for either questioning or charging.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Feeney case, the police officer, in pursuing the individual, followed him to his residence. The individual entered his private residence and at some point the police officers followed and went in. The question that came up was whether a police officer could invade the privacy of a private residence without a warrant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until then, our laws and our court jurisprudence had accepted that in a scenario of hot pursuit, a police officer could follow and enter into a private residence. In the Feeney case, the Supreme Court found that under the charter the police could not go into a private residence in that circumstance, and that the law needed repair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go through this carefully because I think this case and others are developing a kind of a protocol and jurisprudence, a kind of a dialogue with the Supreme Court, one that is necessary. It took us a long time to get here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Supreme Court makes a charter interpretation of the law and it finds something non-compliant with the charter, it has the ability to strike it down immediately, or to strike it down after a certain period of time, or to read in a change to effectively legislate. The court can say that it will add these words in the statute, just like Parliament should have legislated them in the first place.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not do that very often. It does not read in very often and it perhaps does so reluctantly. In this particular case, in the Charkaoui case, that brings us this legislation, it did not read in. It gave Parliament time to repair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Feeney case about 10 years ago, it struck down and gave Parliament six months to fix it. At the time it made the ruling Parliament was going into a general election. In my view at the time I thought that was pretty dumb of the Supreme Court. I am saying this with some respect. Looking back I have the benefit of 20:20 hindsight of course, but at the time the Supreme Court of Canada gave Parliament only six months to fix a piece of criminal law legislation when we were going into a general election, which would necessarily involve a break of several months. This did not give Parliament enough time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point the bright lights turned on and the Department of Justice went back to the court and obtained a further extension. That was reasonable. The court was not unhappy with that. The point at the time was that this business of the court disallowing and giving Parliament three months or six months had to be done with a working knowledge of how Parliament worked. The government itself does not have the power to legislate. The government must bring the matter to Parliament and Parliament, through both Houses, makes the changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very unhappy about the Feeney situation that developed with Parliament. It has however allowed the development of a dialogue between the courts and Parliament. In this case the court gave Parliament a year and that should be enough time. In this case, if the House passes the legislation, it can deliver on what the court hoped we might deliver on. The court is doing its job. I do not criticize the courts for interpreting the law on behalf of citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case the law does not invent or reinvent security certificates. It revises the procedure that is used in relation to security certificates. I know that there are those in the country who question the need for security certificates under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always accepted and they have been in the law here for some time, that our government, the people representing the people of Canada under the Immigration Act, need the ability to remove people from Canada. We do it all the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every week there are dozens of people being removed from Canada as illegal immigrants. These are people who do not have status here, people who should not be here. They are removed simply because they do not comply with the Immigration Act or maybe they have serious criminal records.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for removal are all set out in the statute. To my way of thinking, the security certificate provisions are simply a refined component of immigration deportation procedures. It is not a special thing developed to remove whomever the government thinks it might want to remove. In fact, if I can take that other perspective, it is simply a deportation procedure on a faster track with one important difference. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person involved has been found by the government, not simply an official in the government, not an immigration officer or not a bunch of immigration officers, and not the Canada Border Services Agency but two ministers of the Government of Canada and effectively the cabinet, to be a danger under national security and under security definitions, and must be removed.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must always remember that we are not dealing with Canadians. We are dealing with non-Canadians. The security certificate provisions do not involve Canadians, only non-Canadians. The non-Canadian category includes people with no status and people who have permanent resident status but are not citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always maintained that government needs the authority to remove people because we deport people all the time. There are perhaps two reasons why the security certificate procedure has been designed specifically for security reasons. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the circumstances involving security may or may not be quite pressing. As history has evolved, it would appear that the circumstances lying behind security certificates, in most of the cases they have been used, are not that pressing. The procedure has not been used all that often, a dozen or two times over the years perhaps. It is not like the person is a terrorist and about to push the button. The certificates have involved individuals who comply with the security concern definitions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason for a specific procedure is that in dealing with security matters some or most of the information that will be brought forward to describe the security concern will be information that is protected, secret, confidential, classified, or whatever we want to call it. In most circumstances, it would be neither appropriate nor wise, nor allowable to present that information in an open court or public forum. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have classified that information because it involves security matters outside the country and has been received on a secret, classified basis, and analyzed and presented. There needs to be a procedure to protect that information for the same reason we protect all classified security information. We do that routinely as a country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We protect our classified information right through the entire range of government. If we are using classified security information in relation to an individual subjected to these procedures, then we need a special procedure that will do that. That is one of the reasons why we use the security certificate procedure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just offer a hypothetical example, one that is not too bizarre. I will refer to the mythical Carlos the Jackal, who I understand is now deceased. Imagine that person had been found living in Moose Jaw under an alias and we wanted to remove him from this country, but he had not committed any offences in Canada. Would he have been a simple deportee? Would we invite him for a hearing in front of an immigration officer and then tell him to come back a week later when a decision would be made? Would we ask him if he wanted a lawyer? </div>
    </p><a name="Para774457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lots of procedural fairness available to people subject to deportation proceedings. The answer with respect to my example is clear. We would probably want to remove him quickly. We would have classified national security information which could not be disclosed on the street because it would reveal some of our procedures and protocols on dealing with security matters. That is one of the reasons why we do not make these things public. However, they are real and ongoing. So, getting rid of Carlos the Jackal would require a special procedure, and that is the security certificate procedure that we have developed. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that particular hypothetical case, he is not a permanent resident; he has no status in Canada; he is hiding here; and he is to be removed to his country of citizenship. This is not a rendition. This is simply a removal to his country of citizenship; and in that case, there were probably a lot of countries looking for him. Nonetheless, that is a security certificate procedure, hypothetically, as opposed to a simple deportation removal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard an hon. member, I think it was the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78598,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78598&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Trinity—Spadina</A>, say that the security certificate procedures breach the charter. They do not. They have all along, up until now, over all the years we have had them, been found to be charter-compliant, except for the Charkaoui case and the courts spotted flaws, things that we could do better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Charkaoui case, the courts have said that presenting classified information to a judge without adequate disclosure to the person subject to the proceeding was not fair. It was not charter-compliant. It just did not go as far as it could. We could make more disclosure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I can revive my hypothetical, we would not give the whole file to Carlos the Jackal. We would actually find a way to make him aware of the nature of the facts on which he is being removed from Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method chosen by the statute is the appointment of a special advocate. This is not a new construct. In security matters, we have already put to use specially retained security-cleared counsel in other aspects of litigation and security work. I will just give members one example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an individual employee of the Government of Canada or a complainant involving the work of CSIS or an opinion on a security clearance by a department based on the work of CSIS has a complaint about that, he or she may complain to the Security Intelligence Review Committee. That committee has routinely retained security-cleared counsel to view all of the evidence and to advocate on behalf of the individual who, for security reasons, is not able to directly see all of the classified information. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special security-cleared counsel, under the SIRC security hearing procedures, has worked quite well, in my view. It has worked since 1984. There have been no serious concerns expressed about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the security certificate procedures here, we are inserting and putting into that an analogous mechanism where there will be a special advocate who will be a lawyer and who will have the ability to, under the supervision of the presiding judge, review all of the classified information or the classified information which the judge believes is necessary to allow adequate sufficient charter-compliant disclosure to the individual subject to the hearing. That is a good mechanism. I fully support it and I am sure it will work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing I want to say is that I have a concern about section 82.2. This section would allow peace officers, when a person is released during the certificate procedure, to arrest the person if they know there has been a breach of the condition or if they anticipate a breach. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about giving that authority to a peace officer, about giving to peace officers the power to arrest someone because they think there might be a breach of condition happening. I am worried about an abuse, not a fair situation or a good faith situation. I am worried about a breach. However, this issue can be looked at by the committee in terms of fairness, charter compliance and the right allocation of power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all other respects, I remain supportive of this legislation.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the member raises a great point, which is that this legislation does not violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that this is about protecting Canadians first. It is about making sure that in regard to any concerns we have about terrorist threats in this country and criminal elements who are non-Canadians, who are not citizens or residents of this country but who happen to be here, those persons can be placed under security certificates, now under the auspices of not only having a judge issue these certificates, but having a lawyer advocate on their behalf.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the legislation meets the needs of the person in question who is going to be placed under a security certificate. That has been expressed by the Supreme Court. Also, it protects Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes down to it, we have to take into consideration the health and well-being of Canadians. Trying to prevent as much as possible any of these terrorist elements from being in our country has to be of utmost concern to Parliament. Therefore, I am very glad to see that the hon. member is supporting Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the hon. member. There are divisions in the House. Some fairly far-fetched arguments are being presented by members of the other parties, including members from his own party. I would ask that he broach this topic. How do we bring those members who are not supporting the bill to the table, especially those in the Liberal Party, to say yes, we are going to stand up for Canadians and protect Canadians, and security certificates are the right way to prevent terrorism in this country?</div>

    </p><a name="Para774475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we would have is a deportation of a non-Canadian just the way we would deal with someone involving serious criminality or another basis for deportation. Then we would not have this red flag of security this, security that, security certificates, and big brother and all that stuff. We could just say, “This was a deportation for security reasons, itemized, and presided over by a judge”. The procedure has to go to a judge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other deportation procedures do not even go to a judge. This procedure goes to a judge. It is imbued with tons of procedural fairness.

    </p><a name="Para774478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been looking through this bill to try to understand if there is any prohibition that would prevent the government from putting one of these security certificates on someone and then deporting the person or having the person removed to a country that performs capital punishment or torture.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada obviously has had some unfortunate experiences with this in the past, with Maher Arar and others. I am wondering if that prevention has been made in the bill. As the member has addressed in his comments, in regard to the balance among security, the rights of individuals and the rights of Canadians that we all enjoy, we also seek to treat people who come to this country with a similar amount of respect in trying not to deport them to torture and in insisting that we do not deport them to countries that perform capital punishment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if the member has identified that in the bill. Can he give the House an assurance that this has in fact been removed as a potential result of one of these security certificates being performed?</div>

There have been some procedural changes to ensure that the refugee claim component still exists and is dealt with under the security certificate procedure. The current law actually provides for the displacement of refugee claim procedures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before every removal in a refugee claim, as we know, there is the pre-removal risk assessment, the PRRA, and pre-removal risk assessments result in people not being removed to places where they will be in physical jeopardy. The court has said that we do not have to do the PRRA on the security certificate. I think that is the way the courts have interpreted it: that security certificates are so significant that we do not have to do the PRRA.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this brings back in through the side door the refugee procedures, so there may in fact at some point be a clash between refugee procedures and PRRA. I do know that generally Canada does not want to deport people to countries that have a death penalty. Canada avoids that. In a security removal, people are not being deported on crimes where they are subject to the death penalty. Canada is simply deporting a non-Canadian to the country of origin.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have is around the role of the special advocates. To my mind, the role of the special advocate has been introduced in order to achieve natural justice for every person who stands accused by the state of allegedly violating the laws of the land. Normally, that solicitor-client relationship is predicated on who pays the solicitor. In this case, it is the government that has created the special advocate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question. There is only one individual representing the state with respect to the role of the special advocate and adjudicating on what that relationship is, and that is the presiding judge. If information came forward that would result in a security certificate being applied to another individual, what role does the judge play in transferring and processing that case? Inasmuch as the member has already stated that the information is secret and the only person who makes the decision is the judge, what is the role that the judge plays? </div>
    </p><a name="Para774488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the House and the public would like to know what the checks and balances are with respect to continuing in the public interest the application of the certificate.</div>

The judge does not speak for the government. The judge is in an impartial judicial appellate function. The law requires that a judge review, as in an appeal, the decision of the government to determine if it is reasonable or not. That is what the judge does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a departmental advocate, so to speak, someone to carry the case for the government. That person knows everything, if the advocate has done his or her homework, about the individual. The judge can know everything and at the end of the process would know everything. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special advocate will work on behalf of the person subject to the certificate but will be paid by the government, much in the way legal aid pays from time to time for representation in criminal courts. The fact that the government pays the special advocate does not create a barrier, as I look at it, with the individual.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the member raises a good point. We in this country are quite used to having that existing common law relationship of solicitor-client. I am wondering whether the fact that the government describes this position not as a lawyer or counsel but as a special advocate somehow alters the solicitor-client relationship. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an interesting question that I hope will come up in committee. Perhaps one or more of our law societies may choose to address just what exactly is the relationship, the obligation, of the special advocate to the person subject to the procedure.</div>

The passage of the bill has the real potential to usher in a new era for mining in Cape Breton and to continue the region's long history with this traditional industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is standing up for workers and communities that rely on traditional industries. We recognize the vital role that the mining sector plays to ensure Canadian prosperity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong mining presence in Canada from coast to coast and as far north as one can see. Canada is one of the largest mining nations in the world, producing over 60 minerals and metals. We are a world leader in the production of mining products, such as potash, uranium, aluminum and nickel. Canada ranks third in global production of diamonds in terms of value. Mining and mineral processing contributed some $40 billion to Canada's gross domestic product in 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five coal mines were in operation in Canada at the end of 2006. Most large scale coal mines are located in western Canada, in New Brunswick and in Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all our fossil fuels, we know that coal produces the greatest amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes heavily to global warming. As a result, we are more conscious than ever that we need to develop clean alternatives and clean up fossil fuels.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of renewable energy, we are investing $1.5 billion in wind, small hydro, tidal power, solar, biomass and geothermal energy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for coal, the energy source that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> is related to, clean coal technologies are being developed in order to significantly lower the emissions from coal burning power plants and to reduce the environmental side effects of the coal industry as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid growth of clean coal technologies is of the greatest interest to the Government of Canada. To that end, we have launched the ecoenergy technology initiative, a $230 million investment in the research, development and demonstration of clean energy technologies. A major component of this initiative is the development of the science and technology that will make our conventional energy sources cleaner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first investment this government made under this initiative was in clean technology. Earlier this month, my colleague, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Natural Resources</A>, announced an $11 million investment in federal funding for a project that will make Canada a world leader in clean coal technology. This project will be a joint undertaking by the Government of Canada and industry. It will support research in developing a coal gasification power plant that will turn sub-bituminous coal into synthetic gas and hydrogen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a significant process with important implications. By converting coal into synthetic gas and by capturing and sequestering the resulting carbon dioxide, we can create electricity that is cleaner than that produced by the best natural gas facility operating today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Natural Resources Canada's CANMET Energy Technology Centre, the government has been investing in the development of viable technology for near zero emission clean fossil fuel such as oxyfuel combustion. This centre has also developed a clean coal technology road map which outlines a vision for the development and implementation of clean coal technologies. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This technology will thus not only help us to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, but also reduce air pollution. It will reduce greenhouse emissions to almost zero. Consequently, this clean coal technology will help Canada and countries around the globe educe greenhouse gases and pollution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognize that coal will continue to play an important role in our future and in the world's future. At the world level, coal accounts for about 25% of energy consumption and is used to produce 40% of the world's electricity supply. It will continue to be an important component of the energy mix in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we must do everything we can to clean up this resource and ensure it is used in a way that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of coal mining in Cape Breton is well-known to members of this House and to all Canadians. Most of this mining was done under the sea, with the greatest subsea extension out from shore being almost four miles. It is very similar to some of the mining that I know took place in Nanaimo and on Vancouver Island which was also underneath the seabed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Donkin block is part of what is known as the Sydney coalfield, a resource that has made an enormous contribution to the Canadian economy. Total coal production for Nova Scotia between 1863 and the year 2000 was some 455 million tonnes, of which 72% was produced from the Sydney coalfield. This coalfield contains the largest coal resource in eastern Canada with 12 major seams. Donkin represents the most eastern extension of the Sydney coalfield that is accessible from the north coast of Cape Breton. It is the last primary block of unmined coal that can be mined from the coast.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developer of the Donkin mine, as selected by the Nova Scotia government, is the Xstrata Donkin Mine Development Alliance. It expects to complete a feasibility study next year and production could start shortly thereafter. The coal that will be produced by the Donkin coal block development is a most valuable resource and one that will contribute to the economic well-being of Cape Bretoners and Canadians as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Cape Breton region, the Donkin mine will mean an additional 275 jobs directly, and indirectly, the project could generate another 700 jobs. Nationally, about 370,000 Canadians are employed in the mining and mineral processing industry. Canada's 1,200-plus exploration and mining companies operate in over 100 countries globally and hold over 8,700 mineral projects around the world, of which almost 50% are located outside of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major challenge the mining sector faces in Canada is that our current regulatory regime is not keeping pace. Companies have expressed, time and time again, a complete frustration with our regulatory system, how it is too slow, too unpredictable and designed without efficiency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has recognized that we need to improve our system to adequately respond to our environmental priorities, which is why we have invested $150 million in increasing capacity in federal departments and in establishing a major projects management office. This new office will ensure that regulatory reviews are carried out with greater efficiency, transparency and coordination across departments.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I would like to split my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78849,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78849&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cypress Hills—Grasslands</A>, if that is so amenable to you.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased today to introduce Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15, An Act respecting the exploitation of the Donkin coal block</A>. This bill demonstrates once again that our government is committed to building a stronger, safer and better Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are committed to encouraging economic development in all regions of this country and to create job opportunities for all Canadians, regardless of where they live. For the people of Cape Breton, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> would help to create that opportunity for economic development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by explaining the resource, the Donkin coal block, that the legislation deals with. The Donkin coal block is a large, economically promising coal vein located off Cape Breton Island. In fact, it is the last major undeveloped subsea coal resource in the Cape Breton region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been described as the largest undeveloped coal resource in all of eastern Canada. Both the province and the federal government have obligations regulating the development of the Donkin coal resource block, including labour, health and safety matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate objectives of the bill are to facilitate the provincial management of the mine by Nova Scotia and to provide a clear regulatory regime to govern its development. This legislation would also allow both levels of government to retain their current positions with respect to regulatory jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond these immediate objectives, however, a larger purpose is being served. The legislation would provide Cape Breton with an opportunity to advance its own economic development. It does so by facilitating a return to Cape Breton's time honoured industrial tradition of mining coal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some very clear benefits will follow the development of the Donkin mine. To begin with, mining will once again bring good jobs to this traditional mining region of Canada. The development of the Donkin mine is forecast to create 275 direct and up to 700 indirect jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of the mine could also mean hundreds of millions of dollars to the provincial economy in salaries, equipment and goods and services. Three hundred million dollars is expected to be spent in start-up investments alone and coal royalties will be in the range of up to $5 million annually.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the development of the Donkin will help stabilize the tax base of this community for many years. If it gets to the development stage, we expect to see at least 10 years of operations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal was first mined in Cape Breton 322 years ago. The island was settled because of coal and coal mining was its livelihood for hundreds of years. Most of this mining was done under the bottom of the sea with the greatest subsea extension out from shore being almost four miles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1980s, the Cape Breton Development Corporation, DEVCO, spent $80 million to dig two exploratory tunnels from the shore out to the face of the Donkin block. However, the mine was never brought into production. The tunnels were sealed and flooded to avoid pumping costs. DEVCO closed its last Cape Breton mine in 2001.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the closure of the last mine on Cape Breton, energy prices, including coal prices, have dramatically increased. This and newer technology, such as clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage, have renewed interest in coal as an energy source and renewed interest in the Donkin project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous advantages to the Donkin site. For example, the Donkin block is located in a proven mining district with a long history of safe and successful extraction. The block appears to have sufficient size, potential and access to domestic and international markets for industry to stand on its own financially. The passage of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> will help to determine whether this is so. Nearby there is a local workforce with extensive underground coal mining experience, a workforce that welcomes the return of coal mining jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block is near a railway connection and two deepwater ports equipped to export coal to an international market. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Donkin site has a valuable asset in the two exploratory tunnels which are already driven to the face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia announced a call for proposals to develop the Donkin coal block in 2004. A year later, a company by the name of Xstrata was announced as the winning bidder. The Xstrata Donkin Coal Mine Development Alliance began to evaluate the potential of bringing the Donkin mine back into production. It was at this point at which a considerable challenge arose. It was clear that if Xstrata or any company decided to proceed with development there would be confusion and uncertainty over regulatory jurisdiction because both the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia have ownership claims to the offshore.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155">(1155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also clear that Xstrata Donkin Coal Development Alliance would soon face major decisions on whether to proceed with development or not. Because regulatory matters affect cost and planning, Xstrata was in need of certainty over the applicable regulatory regime before its decision could be properly made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia shared an interest, as they do today, in seeing further economic opportunity in Cape Breton. Therefore, both governments sat down together to find a solution that would provide Xstrata with a clear regulatory regime that would permit development to proceed, if that decision was made, and to do all this without jeopardizing either government's claim to jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today is that solution. Essentially the bill permits existing provincial laws regarding matters such as labour standards, labour relations, resource development and occupational health and safety to be incorporated into federal law. The administration of these laws is then delegated to the province of Nova Scotia. This will permit a clear and single regulatory system to be established for Donkin Coal Development. It will also permit both levels of government to retain their current positions with respect to regulatory jurisdiction while facilitating the economic development of Cape Breton Island. This is a solution that works for everyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also provides that all Donkin coal and coal bed methane royalties will be collected by Nova Scotia and remitted to the Receiver General for Canada. A remittance in that same amount will then be turned back over to the province. In other words, the province will receive the benefit of all royalties if the mine goes ahead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The components of this bill may appear complex, but their intent is quite simple. The bill provides Cape Breton, and Nova Scotia, with greater opportunity for economic development. It permits the development of the Donkin mine to proceed under an appropriately designed regulatory regime and it facilitates provincial management of the endeavour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to emphasize that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> does not guarantee the development of the Donkin mine. It guarantees that the decision to proceed or not to proceed will be free from any uncertainty regarding regulatory matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would emphasize that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> is an outstanding example of cooperation. It is an example of cooperation between governments to fulfill a common interest in seeing the development of the Donkin mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By introducing this legislation, the government is demonstrating its commitment to the economic development of the Cape Breton community and to Nova Scotia as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> applies directly to the development of the Donkin mine, but our government has also taken national initiatives to support the mining sector. Since coming to office 21 months ago, our government has taken consistent action to reduce the tax burden on Canadian businesses, including those in the mining sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mining sector presents extraordinary opportunities across Canada and our government will help seize those opportunities by providing a single window for major projects approval. The major projects management office provides a single point of entry into the federal government for the approval of proposed projects. This is going to improve our ability to apply our world class environmental standards while increasing regulatory efficiency.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to see this legislation finally come forward. Negotiations between the province and the federal government have been ongoing for a number of years. I think back to the last election and my Conservative opponent at the time said that the foot dragging on the part of the then Liberal government was going to negate a great opportunity to develop the Donkin mine site. He also said that when his party was elected as government, this issue would immediately come forward. Two years later, it is finally coming forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary that this take place. It is certainly what we were working toward back then. There were long, arduous and protracted negotiations between the two levels of government, but the legislation is here today, and it is a positive thing for the people of Cape Breton, for the people of Nova Scotia, and for the people of Canada as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues have indicated through their comments, the history of coal mining in Cape Breton dates back over 300 years. Coal was discovered in Cow Bay, which is now Port Morien. That coal was shipped to Louisbourg and provided heat for the Fortress of Louisbourg during the years of development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coal has been mined in Cape Breton for numerous years. It fired up the engines of our navy's boats in both world wars. It has contributed to industry in central and western Canada. Cape Breton coal has powered much of what Canada is as a country. We have a proud and rich tradition of coal mining in Cape Breton. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we support in Cape Breton is submarine mining and underground mining. There is a great deal of opposition and concern around surface mining. We cannot confuse the two. We want to make that clear. The legislation before us today is about underground mining.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work started on the Donkin project back in 1970. I will share quickly a story with my colleagues across the way. As a young university student during a summer in the late 1970s, I and three friends took up a contract to help clear the land on the Donkin site. We were paid a certain amount for every acre that we cleared and the pulp that we felled and the brush that we burned. It was during that summer that I realized I was not going to make my living as a woodsman in the woods of Cape Breton. However, it was a great opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly thereafter, because of the situation with OPEC, Devco pursued the Donkin opportunity. It drilled two tunnels three and a half miles out in the ocean and about 200 metres down. Things changed and the price of coal altered quite a bit on the world market, and the project was shelved and the mines were flooded. Currently, the world price for coal is at an all-time high. It is now about $95 a tonne. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on this side of the House are very committed to long term, sustainable energy opportunities. Cape Breton is seeing an increase in sustainable energy initiatives, such as Cape Breton Power's incorporating windmills in many places where coal mines used to exist. They are making a contribution to the overall energy package for the people of Nova Scotia, but there still remains a high demand for energy. As has been indicated, 40% of the world's energy still comes from fossil fuels. We cannot be intimidated by that and dismiss coal as a source of energy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of the investments that have been made, it is important that we as the nation of Canada get out in front on some of this clean coal technology. We have certainly done that to date and continue to do it. I had the great opportunity to see the NRCan facility in Bells Corners and some of the work it has undertaken with clean coal technology. It is truly impressive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the demand outside our borders, such as in China, and that is only going to increase. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be Canadian technology that leads the way in solving the CO<sub>2</sub> problems. We have seen the investment that has been made at the CANMET site in CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration by capturing and sequestering the CO<sub>2</sub> in the ground. The technology has come so far so fast. As a nation we have to continue to invest in that type of technology so that we can continue to decrease our carbon footprint.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the province of Nova Scotia through this legislation will be the regulator. There will be federal regulations for the site, but they will be applied by the province of Nova Scotia. That will look at resource development, labour standards, occupational health and labour issues. All of those things will be administered by the province of Nova Scotia under this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As had been mentioned by the previous speaker, Xstrata is currently developing the Donkin site. Xstrata is an international player in the minerals exploitation community. It has the fiscal and technical capabilities of taking on a project of this size. It is a very large, complex mining project under sea considering the dangers of undersea mining. It is the world's largest producer and exporter of thermal coal. It is one of the top five producers of coking and metallurgical coal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xstrata has 43,000 employees worldwide. It has operations in Australia, Germany, Norway and South Africa. It is a tremendous player in the coal market. It has an excellent record on health and safety and environmental issues. It is very excited about this Donkin project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to speak with Darren Nicholls, the project manager. He shared with me the fact that he could not see this project going any better. The company is very pleased with the way it has gone to date. The company is very supportive of this piece of legislation. It may want to tweak things a bit, which can be done within the regulations, but the company is supportive of this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has done a good job since it has come to Cape Breton in getting involved in the community. I was very impressed with that. This past year I had the opportunity to go to Donkin. The Donkin development association just finished a project. It opened a passive park area adjacent to a school, Veterans Memorial Park. Xstrata played a fairly significant role. It worked with the councillor, Kevin Saccary, and a community group of volunteers and developed a park, very much supported by the community. Xstrata stood shoulder to shoulder with community members and helped deliver on this. That is an indication the company cares about the community and is willing to invest in it.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210">(1210)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had said, the federal position was that federal laws were applicable in this situation and there was an obligation to enforce them. However, it is very pleased that the province of Nova Scotia, wanting to exploit this resource, is entering into a agreement that would address labour relations, labour standards and occupational health concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, it has been indicated before that pieces of infrastructure are there now. Rail spurs are there now as well as a deepwater port. However, that comes to another part of what will be necessary with the opening of Donkin mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a very active port in Sydney, with a coal mixing area. Provincial Energy currently mixes coal at the Sydney harbour site. However, there is a dredging problem. We hope the government will see the merit and the importance, through the Atlantic gateway initiative it is putting forward, of dredging the Sydney harbour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently there is about 45 feet of clearance. Right now it is shipping partial loads with some of its coal transfer. In order to take full boats, we hope the government will be able to invest in Sydney harbour, look at the dredging project put forward by the community and the harbour authority and assist with that. It is more of a bump in the midst of Sydney harbour, but it would go a great way in unlocking the full potential of that harbour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative would have tremendous benefits for the people of Cape Breton, in Glace Bay and broader areas. We have a rich coal mining tradition. A good friend of mine, Billy Delaney, said that Glace Bay was a child of industry and without it we would be an orphan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come a long way, too. In the late 1990s our unemployment rate was on either side of 25%. Now we are currently down around 12% or 13%. There is still a fair amount of seasonal employment. A lot of guys working out west who are coming home and the money is coming back home. That is not the ideal situation. We still need that anchor industry. Our community understands fully that this is a tremendous opportunity, and we look forward to it. There will be 275 jobs. We know that jobs within the mining sector usually pay 3:1 or 4:1 in other job developments. Therefore, we think that will be a shot in the arm. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some of those guys who are working out west now are looking forward to coming back and resuming mining careers. We have young people who are very interested in getting started in the mining industry. I know the industry will get 275 guys who will make that mine hum and it will be nothing but successful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We anticipate in the order of $300 million in startup costs for an initiative of this size. As well, the coal royalties will be paid to the federal government and then they will be fully remitted back to the province. We anticipate approximately $5 million annually in coal royalties that will stem from the Donkin project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darren Nicholls and the Xstrata people are extremely excited about the legislation coming forward and this opportunity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to speak with District 26 United Mine Workers president, Bobby Burchell, just recently. The union is pleased with this as well. It was consulted earlier on this project, back in April and May. No major concerns have been expressed, but the union believes it can address whatever the concerns might be, through the regulations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is an important day for the people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A>. It is an important day for this broader community. We have been through a lot as a community. We are seeing our economy transition. Things are okay.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the briefing, the comment was made that it would bring much needed jobs to an economically depressed area of the country, which was kind of interesting. We are past that now. I think the members of the House, who have been to Cape Breton, can see that. I have a colleague from Nova Scotia who can see that. We are not Mississauga or Kelowna yet, but things are going okay. However, this will be a tremendous shot in the arm as we continue. While this is a retooling of the economy, it is the old game coming back that will make a contribution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the estimates put forward today in the speeches have probably been somewhat conservative, that the mine might operate for 10 years. There is probably potential for even greater operation past 10 years, and some of them have been up to 25 years. They may be ambitious, but nonetheless, with the legislation there is very little we can find that would prove to be any problem whatsoever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague was asked a question about the Westray incident. I believe the province of Nova Scotia has learned a great deal through the Westray experience. Through consultations, the federal government has clearly outlined its expectations. The province of Nova Scotia will be required to and will administer those regulations to the best of its ability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is without reservation that I will work with my party to support the legislation to ensure it goes forward. We hope it will provide a tremendous opportunity for the people of Cape Breton.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes that the federal government should do more for regional economic development. It should stop undermining the efforts that provincial governments—particularly the Government of Quebec, since I am a member from Quebec—want to make by respecting the priorities set by the provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For members of the Bloc Québécois, creating and maintaining jobs in the regions, as well as providing assistance to workers in difficulty, such as those in the forestry or fishing sectors, is just as important in Quebec as it is elsewhere. In our view, this Conservative government is washing its hands of the whole issue, by refusing to propose any support programs for older workers—we mean real income support for older workers—or change the employment insurance criteria, and by renouncing its earlier ideas concerning the creation of an independent employment insurance fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, all too often, the federal government listens to reason and develops legislation and policies to promote this regional development. Fortunately for Nova Scotia, that is what it is doing with the Donkin coal mine project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the efforts of the elected representatives of that riding cannot be overlooked. According to my colleague, they fought to convince the government that enough time had been wasted and it was time to act. Thus, it has been a happy ending for Nova Scotia and it appears that everyone is finally happy with the agreement.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois' position is that, since Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> is the result of an agreement between the federal government and the Government of Nova Scotia and has to do with a specific case, that is, the Donkin coal mine, and since there are no direct repercussions for Quebec, the Bloc Québécois does not intend to oppose it. We will work hard in committee, as I was saying, to push the bill through as quickly as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word of caution, however: being in favour of the principle of the bill does not mean that we have absolutely no problem with the spirit of the bill. I alluded to this a little earlier when I asked my question. We deplore the fact that the federal government is prepared to incorporate provincial legislation by reference when it comes to creating 275 jobs, but that it is not willing to do so, far from it, when it is a question of the language of work, for instance. I will come back to this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, with its trademark rigour and hard work, the Bloc Québécois will examine the provisions of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> that raise questions. This is the case, for instance, when it comes to the sharing of royalties and the exclusion of royalties on coal-bed methane from the Canada-Nova Scotia offshore petroleum resources accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of offshore revenues, this Conservative government is acting against the interests of Quebec because the equalization formula does not take into account all revenue from natural resources and therefore penalizes Quebeckers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the time being, I would prefer to focus on the main objective of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A>. I would like to point out, and it is truly important to say so, that this bill is the result of an agreement between the federal government and the Government of Nova Scotia, which seeks primarily to settle a jurisdictional matter. These two governments both claim to have jurisdiction over the Donkin coal block. Many discussions have taken place to establish who has jurisdiction over the management and exploitation of the Donkin coal block.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To settle this issue, Nova Scotia and the federal government arrived at an agreement: establish a single set of regulations governing resource development and labour issues, including industrial relations, occupational health and safety and labour standards</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225">(1225)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regime proposed by this bill may be divided into three parts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides a legal regime to facilitate the exploitation of the Donkin coal block. It gives the Governor in Council the authority to incorporate Nova Scotia laws into federal law by regulation, and gives Nova Scotia the power to enforce those laws. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> further governs the royalties from the exploitation of the Donkin coal block, through a system similar to the existing one for petroleum royalties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also amends the Canada—Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act to exclude coal bed methane associated with a coal mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to point out to this House that coal bed methane is the natural gas found in most coal seams. It is considered to be the cleanest burning fossil fuel and one of the purest forms of natural gas, often so pure that it only requires slight processing and can be delivered directly by pipelines.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of these three items, the legal reference regime, is dealt with in clauses 13 and 15, which are the core of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 states that the Governor in Council may make regulations excluding from the application of the Canada Labour Code any employment in connection with the operation of the Donkin coal block.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it allows the Governor in Council to make regulations to incorporate by reference any act of the Province of Nova Scotia to make it applicable to the Donkin mine workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 states that an authority designated by the province, and not federal institutions, is responsible for applying the regulations incorporated by reference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> allows the federal government to exempt workers of the Donkin mine from its own legislation in favour of Nova Scotia's legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the second point, clauses 9 to 12 of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> address the issue of royalties specifically. They establish a system similar to the one that already exists for oil royalties, namely that the royalties on coal and coal bed methane are to be collected by the Receiver General of Canada and a portion will be remitted to the province in accordance with the terms of an agreement to be reached between them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the purpose of clause 16 is to amend the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act in order to exclude coal bed methane associated with the development or operation of a coal mine from the definition of natural gas and therefore exclude it from the accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come back to the offshore revenues I was talking about earlier. Budget 2007 announced an equalization reform that unduly favoured the provinces receiving revenues from natural resources and blatantly ignored some of Quebec's basic requests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, on October 10, 2007, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of Canada and the Premier of Nova Scotia announced an agreement between that province and the federal government on equalization reform.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government announced it would relax the application standards of the equalization formula. Budget 2007 allowed Nova Scotia to choose between two equalization formulas. It could either use the old formula and continue to receive 100% compensation for offshore development, or it could choose the new equalization formula whereby basic equalization payments increase but compensation for offshore development decreases. Nova Scotia could choose to stick with the old calculation method, but once it used the new equalization calculation it could no longer go back to the old formula.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The announcement on October 10 changed all that. Nova Scotia can now choose the formula that is most advantageous to it at the beginning of each fiscal year, until the expiry of the Atlantic accords in 2020.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230">(1230)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to enjoy the benefits of future offshore projects, Nova Scotia had chosen to retain the old equalization formula. If it had adopted the new formula, it would have received additional equalization payments estimated by the provincial government at $289 million for 2008-09. The new formula will therefore let Nova Scotia keep additional amounts calculated under the new formula and it can return to the old formula if the development of new offshore platforms makes the old formula more advantageous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason that this is to Nova Scotia’s benefit is that, in our opinion, it is still being done at Quebec’s expense: the equalization formula still does not take all natural resource revenues into account. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that formula does not reflect what Quebec is calling for. It contains loopholes that favour the fossil fuel producing provinces by allowing them to exempt natural resource revenues from the equalization formula. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec is calling for the equalization formula to be reformed to reflect a 10-province standard, 100% of natural resource revenues and the real value of property taxes. That is the only formula that will result in equalization achieving its objective, which is to provide the receiving provinces with a per capita fiscal capacity equivalent to the Canadian average. It seems that the Conservative government is not worried about that, though.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us come back to the language of work. It must be noted that when it comes to creating 275 jobs, something we applaud, the federal government is prepared to incorporate the laws of Nova Scotia by reference. But the government does not want to consider incorporating compliance with the language of work provisions of Quebec’s Bill 101 by reference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet this is the government that boasts about recognizing that Quebeckers form a nation. To date, that recognition has not been supported by any actions or consequences, although what it means is that the House of Commons recognizes the attributes of the Quebec nation, and in particular its language and culture, by definition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, when the House of Commons recognized the Quebec nation last fall, the Bloc Québécois emphatically pointed out that that recognition had to have consequences, that there could not simply be purely symbolic recognition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The official language of Quebec is French, everywhere in Quebec, except in matters relating to the federal government, for which there are two official languages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the first concrete action that must be taken: to recognize that in fact Quebeckers form a francophone nation in America. If the Canadian parties are consistent in that recognition, they will have to understand that the Quebec nation and the French language are inseparably connected. Recognizing one means recognizing the other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Quebec nation has developed a tool for ensuring that French is the common public language: the Charter of the French Language or Bill 101. We often forget, though, that insofar as Ottawa is concerned, Bill 101 does not exist. As a result, areas under federal jurisdiction are exempted, including within Quebec. For example, banks, telecommunication firms, interprovincial transportation companies such as CN and CP, ports and airports are exempt from Bill 101. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774653"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois wants the federal government, therefore, to recognize and abide by the Charter of the French Language in Quebec in the Official Languages Act and comply with the spirit of the Charter in regard to the language of signage and of work in related legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to what the Conservatives have suggested, the Bloc Québécois is obviously not asking the federal government to interfere in linguistic issues in Quebec. All we want is for the federal government to comply with the Charter of the French Language. The Official Languages Act and the Canada Labour Code are both federal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774655"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canada Labour Code already requires the federal government to adjust to provincial legislation when setting minimum wages. In Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A>, the Conservative government agrees to exempt workers from its legislation in deference to the laws of Nova Scotia. If it is possible to adjust the federal legislation in both these cases, how can they justify refusing to adjust the federal legislation on language? </div>
    </p><a name="Para774656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal or federally regulated companies are not affected by the Charter of the French Language, particularly insofar as the language of work is concerned. Some of these companies choose to abide by it, but it is all entirely voluntary. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235">(1235)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois wants the Canada Labour Code to contain a provision, therefore, that “any federal work, undertaking or business carrying on activities in Quebec is subject to the requirements of the Charter of the French Language”. This would comply with the request voiced in 2001 in the Larose report. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment would eliminate the legal void that enables federal companies to flout the Charter of the French Language when it comes to the language of work. It is important, though, to note that many federal companies decide on their own to abide by the francization programs of the Office de la langue française. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, some federal companies fail to comply with Bill 101 and do so with impunity. Since 2000, some 147 files have been closed at the Office de la langue française because it could not do anything in view of the fact that the companies were under federal jurisdiction. These figures refer only to files that were opened in response to complaints. If no one complains, no file is opened. We can conclude, therefore, that the number of delinquent firms was probably higher. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a long aside to explain why we are happy that Nova Scotia and the federal government have managed to reach an agreement by negotiating an accord to abide by the provincial legislation and that the federal government demonstrated a real openness in this case. We are asking for much the same thing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the position of the Bloc Québécois: since Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> is the result of an agreement between the federal government and Nova Scotia, and it deals with a particular situation, the Bloc will not oppose it and will agree in principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I will not forget this precedent. And I will make sure that I remind the Canadian government about this type of legislative adjustment it offers to some provinces but not others. I pledge to remind the government of this precedent when we debate this issue in the House of Commons. </div>

Many committee members are concerned about the issue of natural gas and coal bed methane. And it is a subject we would like to debate in committee in the coming weeks, looking first at the International Energy Agency's assessment of natural gas energy projections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, this agency issued a report, which assessed projections of Canada's energy needs. In this report, natural gas is examined as an attractive fuel. However, we must still take a hard look at how fossil fuels are being used because it must be said, and I think my colleague will agree with me, that they are the main emitter of greenhouse gases. We must find solutions, either by capturing them or storing them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774668"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think—and my colleague will agree—that research and development for these technologies currently lacks support to produce results in the near future that could be used more quickly, for example, by those operating coal mines.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to what she had to say, I would like to know one thing. Clause 13 provides that the Governor in Council may make regulations excluding any employment in connection with the operation of the Donkin coal block from the application of the Canada Labour Code.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean that employees working at the Donkin coal mine will not be subject to the Canada Labour Code and will therefore have the same working conditions as all workers in Nova Scotia? Consequently, if anti-scab legislation were in effect in Nova Scotia, could these employees also benefit from it, unlike other employees governed by the Canada Labour Code, who cannot benefit from such legislation?</div>

    </p><a name="Para774673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is a successful outcome. This agreement was many years in the making, and local elected representatives took great pains to make the federal government understand how important the agreement is to their community, to economic development, to job creation in these sectors and to their image.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say—and I am sure my colleague understands why I am stressing this—that we in the Bloc Québécois hope that the Conservative government will be just as open to amending the Canada Labour Code and the Official Languages Act in order to recognize the Charter of the French Language and our Bill 101.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, the Bloc Québécois hopes to receive the support of the opposition members and the Conservative government, of course.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is a mine in northwestern Quebec, the Siscoe mine, that had to shut down a few years ago because of plans to dig under Lac Siscoe.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, it was made clear that the purpose of the bill the Bloc introduced this morning was to make the federal government comply with Bill 101.

    </p><a name="Para774692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin my remarks, I have a brief comment on the comments by my Bloc colleague. I think this act is an example of how the federal government and provincial governments, in this case the province of Nova Scotia, can work cooperatively for the better good of both. This act is not trying to drive divisions between areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for the Bloc is a member of the natural resources committee. She would be well aware that Nova Scotia's mining regulations, in particular the underground regulatory regime for coal mines and underground mines, are some of the best in the world because of the disaster that occurred at the Westray mine during the explosion there and the loss of those miners, which is still certainly in the minds of all Nova Scotians today. The laws have been improved because of that disaster and the regulatory regime that exists there has some of the best regulations in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear, what is going to happen here is a single regulator in terms of resource development and labour matters. That regulator will be the Province of Nova Scotia. It will be facilitated by incorporating the provincial legislation into federal law and delegating to the province responsibility to administer these new federal laws. I want to be clear on how that will happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, this legislation is about cooperation. It is not about driving wedges. It is not about causing a schematic shift across the country to pit one province against another province or one part of the country or one region of the country against another. This is a good, practical solution to an ongoing jurisdictional discussion between the Province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada.</div>

We are not committed to trying to find a way to pick a fight and cause an ongoing schism in the federation. We are committed to actually finding a solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada and the Government of Nova Scotia have worked cooperatively to ensure that Cape Breton benefits from this economic opportunity. As the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Natural Resources</A> has mentioned, Donkin is the last major undeveloped or underdeveloped coal resource off Cape Breton Island. This resource is not underground on Cape Breton Island. This resource is underground offshore Cape Breton Island. We need to be very clear about where this resource lies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation presents an excellent opportunity not only for the people of Cape Breton and Nova Scotians, but we expect that when the Donkin mine is open and in full operation it could create up to 275 jobs. This is extremely important to the province of Nova Scotia and the island of Cape Breton in particular. Indirectly, the project could generate 700 jobs. This is very good news for an area which in the past few decades has seen the decline of its coal and steel industries. The salaries, the equipment purchases and the sales of goods and services associated with Donkin could provide hundreds of millions of dollars to the economies of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give members a bit of history on the development of the Donkin mine and coal in Cape Breton. Certainly, the region was settled because of coal, and coal mining has been the main livelihood for more than the past 100 years. On an historical note, it is interesting that when Nicholas Denys settled on Cape Breton Island in the late 1600s and had his trading post set up somewhere in the Sydney River area, it is thought now, he wrote in his diary of open seams of coal in the Sydney area on Cape Breton Island.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255">(1255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly when Louisbourg was settled by the French, one of the reasons was the proximity of coal in the Cape Breton area. That was surface coal. The Donkin mine, of course, is under the ocean and offshore of the coal producing area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of coal is still evident today in the communities and the culture of Cape Breton. Miners who worked in the subsea mines have a long history. Many Cape Bretoners today can trace miners in their families going back more than 100 years. Cape Bretoners are proud of this mining heritage and they have never forgotten it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years, the work sustained many families, but it certainly was not an easy life. It was extremely dangerous and extremely hard work. Today, mining is still dangerous and hard work, but it is a very different profession compared to what existed 100 years ago. Mining provides good jobs and builds strong communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Donkin, it is important to note that this development is not starting from square one. A lot of the work at Donkin has already been done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploration of Donkin began in 1977 with the original wells being drilled by ship. Eleven holes were drilled during a three year period and several seams of coal were detected. The Cape Breton Development Corporation of those days spent $80 million on two exploratory tunnels in the mid-1980s. At the time, the coal was deemed too expensive to extract, the tunnels were sealed and flooded, and the development did not proceed, but the coal is still there and the tunnels still exist.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, Cape Bretoners have lived both with the anticipation and with the disappointment of not seeing Donkin developed. Today I am happy to say that the pendulum has swung back to that feeling of optimism on Cape Breton Island. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, today's energy situation is very different from the recent past. Energy prices, including coal prices, have risen dramatically and new clean technologies are being developed, resulting in a new interest in coal as an energy source. Another factor favouring Donkin today is that the coal deposit may be of sufficient size and potential to be a source for international markets. We know that there is a very hot market for coal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby on Cape Breton Island, and certainly in Nova Scotia, there is a local workforce with extensive underground coal mining experience. These are some of the best workers in the world when it comes to mining and extracting coal. It is a workforce that welcomes the return of coal mining jobs. Local businesses certainly would welcome this development too. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Breton also has two local coal-fired power stations capable of using Donkin coal. The rail infrastructure is in place to ship coal by train to two more power plants elsewhere in Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us not forget the potential of Sydney Harbour, which sits ready to ship coal to international markets. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> mentioned that in his speech. Some preliminary work may need to be done to assist the Sydney Harbour authority to move some of the larger ships in and out of the harbour, but that is all part of the infrastructure requirements that would be needed to fully develop the Donkin coal mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the positive factors supporting this initiative. As we have heard, this is the last major coal deposit off Cape Breton Island. If it gets to the development stage, and I certainly believe it will, we expect to see at least 10 years of operations in the Donkin mine. In addition to providing much needed jobs, the development of Donkin would help stabilize the tax base of this community for many years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement signals a small revival of coal in Nova Scotia. It is not a return to the old days when coal was king in Cape Breton, but Donkin has the potential to provide a viable industry to Nova Scotia and help the province meet its energy needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Cape Breton are anxious to see this development proceed. Certainly the Province of Nova Scotia is anxious to see it proceed and the Government of Canada is anxious to see it proceed. Coal mining will once again bring good jobs to this important region.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300">(1300)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be clear from my comments that there the benefits of the initiatives I have outlined are manyfold. There are jobs and opportunities available. There are infrastructure jobs and there are dollars that will be helpful to the local community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there is broad support out there for this piece of legislation and for the Donkin mine and the Donkin coal seams to be developed. In fact, the federal government went so far as to carry out consultations with all interested stakeholders last spring, and I can report that there is very strong support indeed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community of Cape Breton is excited about this opportunity. The labour unions and groups representing the rights of workers, including the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour, have expressed support, and the employer and the offshore board have expressed support.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governments of Canada and the Province of Nova Scotia have a shared interest in seeing this further economic opportunity for Cape Breton. That is why they have worked closely together on this issue. I believe both levels of government deserve credit for their efforts to reach an agreement that will allow development of the Donkin coal seams. This bill provides a clear regulatory regime to permit the Donkin development if Xstrata decides to proceed with production.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a fair amount of discussion here about existing provincial and federal laws, but existing provincial laws regarding matters such as labour standards, labour relationships, resource development and occupational health and safety will be incorporated into federal law as part of the agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this can happen when organizations work in a cooperative manner for the better good of both the Province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada. Nova Scotia will administer these laws so that a single and clear regulatory system can be established for the Donkin project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that this legislation allows both levels of government to retain their current positions, with nothing changing, with respect to ownership and regulatory jurisdiction, while facilitating the economic development of Cape Breton and certainly Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By introducing this legislation, the Government of Canada is demonstrating its commitment to the economic development of the Cape Breton community and to Nova Scotia as a whole. This bill, I believe, is an outstanding example of cooperation between governments to facilitate a common interest in seeing the Donkin mine project proceed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recognize the work of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Natural Resources</A>, his parliamentary secretary and my colleagues on this side of the House, as well as the work done by my colleagues on the other side of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there is pretty well unanimous support for this piece of legislation. There is some discussion and that is why we are in this place. We are here to look at the various areas of bills that we feel are projecting the common good and also to recognize what we see as flaws. I am happy to say, from what I have heard from members on the other side, that they recognize this as a cooperative and very positive piece of legislation for the province of Nova Scotia that will certainly benefit the regional economy of Cape Breton Island.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I would like to say that coal was king in Cape Breton Island for many years, but it was also important to the entire province of Nova Scotia, certainly in the New Glasgow area. Earlier I mentioned the Westray explosion and the unfortunate circumstances that surrounded it. Coal was mined throughout Nova Scotia, in Springhill as well, and not just in Cape Breton. As well, there is still a very skilled workforce capable of underground mining, one that any employer would be lucky to hire.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish Xstrata, the company that will be primarily involved in Donkin, the best of luck. If the Province of Nova Scotia and the federal government can continue to work in a cooperative manner, I think this can be an example for other provinces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed the first couple of minutes of his intervention, but I believe he did speak somewhat about land based coal deposits in Nova Scotia. Being a member from Nova Scotia, I know he is very much aware of the sensitivity around the land based coal deposits. In fact, there is opposition to any type of surface mining, strip mining operation, in the Cape Breton area particularly, Point Aconi, Boularderie and the Port Morien area.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member had identified this early in his presentation and if he could clarify with the people who are paying attention to the legislation, that this legislation in no way impacts on land based deposits.

    </p><a name="Para774728"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para774730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project we are talking about, the Donkin coal seams, is under the ocean. It is not land based. Even though it is underground, it is certainly not within the jurisdiction of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always considered the coal seams an offshore jurisdiction. That is why this unique piece of legislation has been put in place because quite frankly, Nova Scotia was claiming jurisdiction for the Donkin coal seams along with the federal government. This was a cooperative way of getting beyond that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to make this point, and in no way am I trying to step on provincial jurisdiction here in Point Aconi or the Prince Colliery or any of the other mines that still have some potential in Cape Breton Island. Let us be clear, these are for undersea resources. They are not for land based resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other debate is a Nova Scotia provincial debate. The other debate about open pit mining is strictly in the purview of provincial jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would ask people who are listening to this discussion to take a look at some of the examples in Nova Scotia where there has been a cleanup of a lot of these old mine sites, and they have been open pit. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trenton-New Glasgow area is a prime example of that where a local company came in, Chisholm's, I believe was the company name, and it did have an open pit mine. It certainly was dusty and caused a problem for a few years. However, it did an extremely good job and reclaimed a bunch of old mine sites that were frankly a personal hazard for all the local children in the area who were playing in some of these mines. Some of these mines went back 150 years. It is not as simple as one versus the other.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the Conservative government is acting against Quebec's interests because the equalization formula does not take into account all non-renewable natural resource revenue, and therefore penalizes Quebeckers.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if he thinks that the equalization formula should include offshore resources.

We know that Mr. Williams, Premier of Newfoundland, was very angry when the Conservatives failed to keep their election promise. The former premier of Saskatchewan decided to sue the federal government because of that. This is a very serious problem. One Conservative member even became an independent because of it.</div>

We are much better off when we all work cooperatively. I certainly appreciate his comparing this agreement to the offshore agreement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the argument that Nova Scotia put forward on the Donkin coal mine, and certainly on the methane, is that it is offshore, so it should be covered under the same agreement with offshore oil and gas. Methane gas and coal bed methane being drilled from jackups on the ocean, or from drill ships, or semi-submersibles, whatever it is drilled with, I concur, should be treated the same as other offshore resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the member should know the original agreement signed on the offshore has been available to Nova Scotia under our government since the beginning. It is part of what is on the table. He mentioned Premier Williams of Newfoundland and Labrador. It has been on the table for Newfoundland and Labrador as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to the provinces to decide if they would choose to take that agreement or if they would choose to take the new equalization formula which offers 50% of their natural resources. Certainly, members should also be aware that the way the offshore accords were written the moment a province becomes a have province, it would lose the benefits of the offshore accords which would have given it 100% of its natural resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Newfoundland and Labrador in particular, that will probably be sooner rather than later. We are expecting it will become a have province and especially with the escalating value of its energy resources, Newfoundland and Labrador will probably become a have province in 2009. Therefore, it would lose the benefit of the original accord it signed anyway. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new agreement is much better for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in particular than the old equalization formula because under the new formula it would continue to receive 50% of its natural resources like any other province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in closing, part of this and the reason why I took the time to explain that to my colleague from the Bloc is the fact that the Government of Canada, on this piece of legislation, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A>, has worked in a cooperative manner in a positive way for a positive outcome both for the province of Nova Scotia and the federal government.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going to result in over 275 jobs for the people and miners of Cape Breton.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the members opposite on the Conservative side are actually wanting to raise the whole spectrum of the Atlantic accord. Just this morning, for the fourth consecutive time, there was to be a briefing by the Department of Finance for those interested in the amendments that were forced upon the people of Nova Scotia in their Atlantic accord agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what they asked for in these amendments. It is not what they were promised. Everyone in the House and everyone in the province of Nova Scotia, in Atlantic Canada and throughout this entire country knows that the promise that was given to the people of Atlantic Canada was 100% exclusion of all non-renewable natural resources for the equalization formula with no caps.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That however was not what was translated and provided by the Conservative government once it took office. That commitment was given on January 3 in an open letter to the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, followed by an open letter to the Council of the Federation under then Premier Ralph Klein, as chairman of all 10 provinces and 3 territories, that there would be 100% exclusion of all non-renewable natural resources for the equalization formula with no caps. The statement was also given, “no excuses”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to be surrounded now by excuses, by fine print and by a cap. That quite frankly I think causes the people of Nova Scotia still some great concern, especially when there was to be a briefing just this morning.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fourth consecutive time a briefing was scheduled for all interested parliamentarians from both sides of the House.

Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> specifically provides an exclusion to the Canada--Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act. If I am speaking about the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Resources Accord Implementation Act, it is because it is included in this particular bill. When I do that, I am speaking about the substance of the bill. So I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for reminding members of the government that when they introduce a bill, they should get to understand the bill that they are introducing before raising points of order or objections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is very important. There is a matter of trust that has to be brought forward to the people of Nova Scotia. Exactly what will the bill result in for them? How will this translate, because a side deal of which nobody understands the content, as in the original Atlantic accord and the changes to the equalization act, does not do anything to instill confidence in the people of Nova Scotia. But what does is when members stand up and represent their constituents, like the member from Cape Breton and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A>. They are keeping their eyes on this sort of stuff. They are making sure that their constituents and the people of Nova Scotia, and indeed all of Atlantic Canada, are fully aware of the consequences of this. This bill is going to be supported by the Liberal Party of Canada and this caucus because of the hard work that came forward by members of our caucus to make sure that the work got done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be 275 new jobs as a result, should the private company, Xstrata, decide to go full force and develop the mine, which we are all extremely confident that it will. There will be significant resource revenues that come into the province of Nova Scotia. I note that one element of this bill requires that all royalty payments should go to the Receive General for Canada first and then flow to the government of Nova Scotia second. That, quite frankly, causes me some concern, because we know the track record of this particular government. It could decide to block that particular flow of royalty revenues if the government happens to have a future disagreement with the province of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have confidence that this mine will proceed because of the hard work of all interested members of Parliament, those who actually got to know the bill and the context of it, who supported it and are adding to this. But one thing has to be clear. There is a matter of confidence and trust that if people say that they will do something, they should do it. There was an absolute guarantee given to all 10 premiers and 3 territorial leaders of this country. It was broadcast to the entire country in the middle of the election campaign back in 2006 that there would be 100% exclusion of non-renewable resource revenues from the equalization formula with absolutely no caps involved.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we have?

But one day, we will have that particular piece of legislation, I am confident, tabled in the House and we will be able to see with the rest of Canadians what exactly is entailed in this.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Cape Breton, as the hon. member rightfully pointed out, as throughout Nova Scotia, have really adapted to a new economy. They have developed new manufacturing expertise. They have delved into and succeeded in information technology. They have developed a strong and robust tourism sector. They are exporting their products, their goods and their services to the entire world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative of Nova Scotians is to be admired. It is a role model for the rest of the country. I for one look at the successes of the people of Nova Scotia with some amount of admiration, reflecting on the fact that I have had some involvement with it with my hon. colleague, who is as well a former minister of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Nova Scotia know that they need a cooperative relationship with their federal government in order to succeed, to be able to harness those resources. Without that cooperative relationship, we have no success.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular bill does provide a glimmer of hope that there is that sort of basis of trust and support to be able to do that by streamlining those regulatory regimes. But I can also say that this mine provides 275 jobs to the coal sector. Just imagine if there was complete and full disclosure on exactly what the environment of the offshore oil and gas would be for Nova Scotia if we understood what rules would be imposed by the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member quite rightfully points out the fact that there is an impasse in one of the strongest growth resource sectors that we have in this country. The people of Nova Scotia are being denied a benefit from that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite right that as of this morning, for the fourth consecutive time the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> and his departmental officials refused to meet, after scheduling an appointment to brief caucus members and those interested parliamentarians on the specifics of those particular changes that they imposed which were contrary to their election promises. For the fourth consecutive time that particular briefing was cancelled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is an affront to the people of Nova Scotia. It is an affront to the parliamentarians in this House and in the other place who wanted and needed to attend that briefing in order to be fully informed of a deal that was stated to be signed, sealed and delivered. It does not exist. Perhaps the reason the budget implementation act has not yet been tabled in this House is that the Conservatives do not yet know exactly how they are going to word the budget implementation act, because they do not know the context of their own deal.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This basically involves a jurisdictional issue involving a provincial mine. It is good legislation. I certainly will be supporting it when it comes to a vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would classify the mine as a provincial mine. It is a mine that is not being developed fresh. A lot of the infrastructure is there, although when the infrastructure was established, it was determined at the time that it was too expensive to take the coal out of the mine, the coal which is a proven resource.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mine is located six or seven miles subsea. As such, it would be under the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada. However, the entry to the mine and all other aspects of the mine would be provincial issues. We can see the chaos and confusion that would result, because at certain points in time workers would be doing activities in certain locations that would be under the jurisdiction of the Province of Nova Scotia and then if they moved on into the mine pit, they would be under the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada. There would be uncertainty, confusion and chaos. It is incumbent upon the Government of Canada and the Government of Nova Scotia to clarify that so that the private sector developer, along with the Government of Nova Scotia and the people who live in Cape Breton, can move forward on this particular development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased with the legislation. I am pleased with the level of cooperation that exists between the Government of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada on this particular issue. I am not going to get into the other issue that was discussed in the last 15 minutes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation transfers most of the jurisdictional aspects in connection with the operation of the mine to the Government of Nova Scotia. For example, occupational safety, workers compensation, labour, prosecution of offences, et cetera, will be under the ambit and at the expense of the Government of Nova Scotia. There is a detailed platform for dealing with all jurisdictional issues that has been agreed to by the Government of Canada and the Government of Nova Scotia. Basically, it is a delegation of responsibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other speakers in this House, I want to congratulate the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> for their hard work, their dedication and their perseverance in bringing this matter forward. They are to be congratulated. Certainly the people in Cape Breton can go to bed tonight knowing full well that they are well served in this institution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from the province of Prince Edward Island. We have actually had a similar experience there which worked well. That was when the fixed link was constructed, the bridge that connects the province of New Brunswick with the province of Prince Edward Island. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, that involved legislation and an agreement. In that case, as members can see, a lot of the site works were done either in the province of New Brunswick or in the province of Prince Edward Island and so there were jurisdictional issues involving the Government of Canada. All parties came together in a cooperative agreement and it really did not result in any issues. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course sales tax is one of the other issues that has to be worked out in these agreements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I alluded to briefly in my opening comments, this is not a new mine. It has been around for quite some time. A lot of the exploratory work has been done. The tunnels actually were done quite some years ago. After the analysis and a lot of the work was done, it was determined at that point in time that it was not economically feasible to mine the coal that was there. It was just too far out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, things have changed over the last number of years. As everyone is aware, the price of coal and energy in all its elements has increased dramatically. Technology has improved substantially, not only technology involving the clean coal issues but also the extraction of the coal. Those issues have all combined together to make this particular initiative now economically feasible, as I understand, and I hope it will be moving ahead. This will be an excellent development for the island of Cape Breton.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with legislation that deals with a particular mine. I know the mine is important for the Island of Cape Breton and for the province of Nova Scotia but I suspect that this situation will be repeated over and over. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many activities are occurring in the Arctic. There are other issues. It is my recommendation that the government ought to consider some type of overarching legislation that would deal with incidents such as this where we deal with a mine or a bridge or some other installation that would have cross-jurisdictional issues involved so that the overarching framework can be dealt with through agreement. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement would need to come to Parliament and a parliamentary committee but I am not sure we would need to deal with it through legislation in each and every instance. We might be dealing with a mine or a project that is not as big as the Donkin coal mine and it would be a shame if the expense and the delay would have to be involved in getting legislation through both the provincial legislature, the Parliament of Canada and, of course, the Senate of Canada. That is just a suggestion I would make as we go forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In researching this particular issue, it is clear to me that the major stakeholders on this particular project are very much behind this legislation and this initiative. The Province of Nova Scotia and the people who live in Cape Breton, the municipality of Cape Breton, the trade unions, including the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour, all seem to be very supportive of this particular legislation. That is one of the reasons why I support the legislation 100%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some discussion about environmental concerns and that needs to be dealt with. I hope and I believe it will be dealt with by the Province of Nova Scotia and that all the legislation that it has on its books will be vigorously enforced as this project goes forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that has been raised in the debate is that this is a wedge issue between different provinces and different regions of the country. I do not see it that way at all. I see it as a positive development where one province or one jurisdiction has made an agreement with another jurisdiction and, in each case, it required legislation. This is the legislation that has to deal with the Government of Canada. I do not see it, in any way at all, as different jurisdictions. It is a cooperative initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider this legislation to be positive. I congratulate the people who were involved in bringing it forward to the House. I want to tell the House that I will be supporting the bill when it comes to a vote.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that my colleague with his legal background is very aware of the history of coal mining in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. However, the Province of Nova Scotia would be taking on full responsibility for all matters around labour relations and occupational health and safety. We are very much aware of the Westray tragedy. It was an incredible tragedy for the people of Nova Scotia and the entire coal mining community. I had hoped that we had learned from that experience.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the member confident that with the regulations there, that the federal government will be able to keep the Province of Nova Scotia's feet to the fire and ensure that matters of labour relations and occupational health and safety are carried out? Is there enough clout on the part of the federal government to ensure that this operation is played out in a safe and practical manner and that looks after the best interests of those who are working with this operation?

    </p><a name="Para774814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several years ago, I read a lot of the material that arose as a result of the inquiry dealing with the Westray matter. I would point out that the regulations were there then too but they were not enforced at the time. There was a very lax enforcement structure to deal with occupational safety issues. The people who were supposed to be acting on behalf of the people of Nova Scotia and on behalf of the miners who worked in the Westray mines were not, in my opinion, doing their job. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations were there but they were not being enforced and we all know the final consequence, which was a tremendous tragedy in Atlantic Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, I remember dealing with the Canada offshore development and the concerns that the developers had in that instance about the regulatory time.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are talking about the overall general theme of mining today on the Hill, with people from the industry, workers, et cetera, we also have the privilege of dealing specifically with a bill that would help build this industry in a particular location for a specific town.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason I am particularly pleased to speak to this bill is because of my personal professional background. Prior to being elected to the House of Commons in June 2004, I had previously worked as a mining and exploration geophysicist, having obtained my geophysics degree and graduating previously from the University of Saskatchewan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege of working in all three of Canada's northern territories, the wonderful territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. I also spent some time working in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. My final project before I was elected was in a place called Salluit in the most northern town of the province of Quebec where I worked on a nickel sulfide project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great pleasure for me to speak to a piece of legislation that is in some way related to my previous profession. People need to understand that mining is important for Canada. It is important for Canada historically and in the present.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fur trade was probably the first industry that really flourished in Canada from coast to coast and pushed inland the exploration, mining was not far behind. Some who have read their history books may remember that some of the explorers who came to Canada came specifically to look for mineral deposits, gold, diamonds and copper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, one of the more amusing stories in Canadian history is how some of the early explorers from France became very excited when they thought they had discovered massive diamond deposits in Quebec. They filled up many barrels of these diamonds and returned home. However, after a little investigation, they were not quite sophisticated enough to tell the difference between quartz and diamonds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, mining has been very important to Canada. We export somewhere in the neighbourhood of 77 different products. We are internationally known for our uranium deposits, potash, nickel and coal. We have seen the rising price of coal impact on our dollar. This is an industry which impacts every region of the country, be it oil and gas, hard rock mining or whatever. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have particular expertise in this country for the development of our laws, geological infrastructure, the Geological Survey of Canada, the well done mapping programs and the organization and stability of our programs. That is one of the reasons why, not only in Canada but around the world, Canadian mine engineers, geoscientists and all others are recognized as experts in this field. That is just an introduction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are dealing with a particular piece of legislation that deals with a specific situation off the coast of Nova Scotia, which makes it an important bill for Cape Breton and, indeed, for all of Nova Scotia. This legislation deals directly with the prosperity and jobs in the region of Cape Breton. I am pleased to stand and support this bill.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345">(1345)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the Donkin undersea coal resource located off Cape Breton Island has the potential to bring significant economic benefits to the Cape Breton region and to all of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the province of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada contend that they have legal obligations regarding matters such as regulating resource development, labour matters, occupation, health, safety, et cetera. In December 2005, Nova Scotia announced Xstrata Donkin Mine Development Alliance was successful in its bid to explore and develop the Donkin coal block resource. After more than one year of exploration, Xstrata will make its final decision on the development, in August 2008.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the federal government nor the provincial government wish to see issues of jurisdiction hamper the prospects of this project. We do not want red tape to kill jobs with people of Cape Breton. However, for the commercial operation of the mine to proceed, an effective regulatory regime is needed. The bill is about that. What we need is a clear understanding among all parties affected, proponents and possible employees and the community at large as to what the rules of operation are going to be on this project.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government sees it as necessary to find a way around this impasse. I believe it is important to understand the process that brought us to this point of view. In my view the legislation is an example of good will and commitment by both levels of government, provincial and federal. Consequently both levels of government have put the question of jurisdiction aside to collaborate on a mechanism permitting the development of a safe and efficient mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the federal government and the Nova Scotia government worked together for a year to develop the proposed legislation. Starting in March, federal and provincial officials agreed on an approach to develop an appropriate regulatory regime to develop the Donkin coal block. The agreement involves the incorporation of provincial statutes by reference into federal law of laws related to coal and coal bed methane resource management, labour relations, labour standards and occupational health and safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this, Nova Scotia agreed to amend its occupational health and safety laws to ensure that subsea coal miners would have the same level of protection that they have under federal legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also under the agreement, administration of the new federal laws will be delegated to a provincial government official or authority. This helps us to move forward to clear the path, to move forward for the development of the Donkin site if the private sector decides if the mine is a viable, profitable operation. Again, to be clear for everyone who is listening, the legislation only enables and takes away the red tape so that the private sector can have its own initiative to grow and develop these necessary jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public meetings were held this past April to discuss the regulatory framework. These sessions resulted in assurances that labour, community and industry groups understood and supported the proposed regulatory regime. The outcome is this bill, the Donkin coal block development opportunity act, introduced in this Parliament by the hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Natural Resources</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with the issues of health and safety, we know there are dangers faced by coal miners and we know safety is paramount for them. Throughout history worldwide, I think of some particularly tragic incidences in Canadian history. We do not want any dangers or loss of life to happen again to our miners. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> would clarify the occupational health and safety regulations that would apply to the Donkin resource. By eliminating confusion over who would protect these workers, we hope to protect each and every worker better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed legislation will permit the incorporation into federal laws of existing provincial laws regarding such matters as labour standards, labour relations, occupational health and safety and coal and coal gas resource management. The administration and enforcement of these laws would then be delegated back to the province of Nova Scotia. This provides a clear and stable regulatory system, the Donkin coal development. It also permits both levels of government to retain their positions with respect to ownership and regulatory jurisdiction.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350">(1350)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the bill would ensure that coal and coal bed methane royalties associated with exploitation of the offshore portion of Donkin could be collected by Nova Scotia and then remitted to the Government of Canada. In turn, a remittance of an equal amount would then be made by Canada to the province of Nova Scotia. It is my understanding that is being done to be in compliance with other previous acts and legislation even though to the untrained ear it sounds somewhat cumbersome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As all members can see, the immediate objectives of the bill are to facilitate provincial management of the Donkin coal block and provide a clear regulatory regime to govern its development</div>
    </p><a name="Para774845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on from health and safety issues, we need to talk about the economic advantage. We know not all areas of the country are equally advantaged with various economic assets and so forth. Cape Breton is one of those areas that, in spite of the ingenuity its people, has had on few more challenges, so these jobs and this growth is very important for this area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation provides Cape Breton with an opportunity to advance its own economic development to let the people of Cape Breton continue to be masters of their own house. Nowadays, clean coal burning technology exists and we have an opportunity to employ hundreds of experienced people from the coal mining industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By facilitating a return to Cape Breton's time honoured tradition of mining coal and by creating up to 275 direct jobs and 700 indirect jobs, the Donkin enterprise will give us another chance to revive the coal mining industry in Cape Breton.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation for the Donkin mine would ensure that local people, who know the resource, would be there to inspect these mines and inspect them in a timely manner. As well, the project could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the provincial economy in salaries, equipment purchases and so on, all very good things for the economy of Nova Scotia and Cape Breton.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as far as the specifics of the bill, the Donkin coal block development opportunity act is an outstanding example of federal-provincial cooperation. We are pleased to see that similar legislation already passed in the Nova Scotia legislature. It is now up to us, as federal members of Parliament, to do the same thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While that sums up the specifics about the bill, let me also add a few other things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said when I started out talking about the broader issues of mining, mining is a part of Canada's heritage. We see this very clearly in Cape Breton. I am not all together perfectly acquainted with Cape Breton, being a prairie boy who has worked across it. However, the image I have of it has to do with coal mining. When we think of the interior of British Columbia, we think about the mining and the resources. We go to places in Canadian geography, names we know of but many us have not been to, places like Flin Flon, Trail, B.C. and areas farther north. We see the new diamond mines in the north. Mining is a part of who we are as Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very proud of our high tech and knowledge based economy, but we also need to understand that this high tech knowledge based economy interacts with our natural resources economy and our mining economy. Canadians are world-class leaders when it comes to geological sciences to geophysics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We look at the work of the University of Toronto in developing things, projects that were started in the second world war for military applications for mining and mining for the military. These things have developed because of the mining infrastructure and the knowledge that we have in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we continue to develop and build this industry. It provides jobs from coast to coast. It will continue to provide economic development. It is one of those core elements that we need. We need agriculture and food to live. We need elements to provide shelter. For our industrial and manufacturing production, we ultimately need minerals.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355">(1355)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para774855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how I would like the people of Canada and those listening today to view the bill, not specific legislation on its own, standing for one area, but as a symbol, something to speak to the whole broader issue to develop our act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774856"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government and this House could take an important step toward ensuring the full equality of transgender and transsexual Canadians by including gender identity and expression as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act. Other actions are needed to end discrimination in the workplace, in housing, in health care, in the justice system and in the provision of identity documents.</div>

    </p><a name="Para774877"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mining sector is one of Canada's greatest assets and sources of wealth. It is a key economic driver for some 1,200 communities, mostly in rural and remote areas of our great country. The mining and mineral processing industries generate more than 369,000 jobs and contribute some 4% of the GDP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774878"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government stated in the Speech from the Throne that the “mining and resource sectors present extraordinary opportunities across Canada”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774879"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New projects will provide many employment opportunities, including partnerships with aboriginal people to provide skills and training necessary to take advantage of these prospects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774880"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mining Association of Canada has committed to further strengthening this relationship with a draft framework on mining and aboriginal peoples as part of its “Towards Sustainable Mining” initiative. Our government will do its part through initiatives such as the major projects management office and the northern regulatory improvement initiative, and through corporate tax reductions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixteen years ago, Canada signed on to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, yet for 16 years Canada has had no one to monitor the well-being of children.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it has had no plan for kids at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, Conservatives are doing nothing while foreign corporations are trying to buy up child care centres right across Canada.

Promoting physical activity is essential to children's health. A quarter of Canadian children are either overweight or obese.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One estimate suggests that obesity currently costs the health care system $1.6 billion annually.

    </p><a name="Para774926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, the Conservative government's response to the health committee report, “Healthy Weights for Healthy Kids”, shows clearly that it lacks the resolve to develop a comprehensive national plan to fight childhood obesity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para774927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government must provide immediate leadership to ensure that the growing trend of increasing childhood obesity is reversed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of National Child Day, I call on the government to adopt the recommendations to combat childhood obesity put forward recently by the Standing Committee on Health.</div>

I do not understand why the Liberal leader has said he would take it away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government created a new $2,000 child tax credit and provided an additional $250 million to the provinces, which has helped them announce the creation of more than 32,000 spaces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is spending $5.6 billion this year alone on early learning and child care. This is the single largest child care investment in Canadian history, three times more than the previous Liberal government ever spent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 13 years of countless broken promises, even the former deputy leader of the Liberal Party, Sheila Copps, had to admit that her government did not create a single child care space.</div>
    </p><a name="Para774933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fitting that this year's theme is “The Right to be Active”, because getting active is what this government has done after more than 13 years of Liberal inaction. </div>

For the benefit of members who may not have been in the House at that time, I will quickly go through the essence of the bill and then move to questions and comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of this bill is a coal mine that was previously built and flooded over. It runs under the surface of and offshore the coast of Cape Breton. For economic reasons it had previously been shut down, but for economic reasons there is now a possibility of reopening it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offshore jurisdiction normally falls under the federal government, but because this mine is very close to the shore and most mines are on shore, there is a bit of a jurisdictional overlap between the provincial and federal governments. The purpose of this legislation is to sort that out and make possible the development of this mine off the coast of Cape Breton.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are many technical points regarding health and safety, economic development, et cetera, in general it may be said that the purpose of this legislation is, for legal purposes, to expand the jurisdiction of Nova Scotia a little way offshore in a broad non-technical sense. One may think of it in a legal sense as being very similar to a mine that is on ground, shall I say, in Nova Scotia, and not under the water.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that all members of the House support the bill. It is a very good bill as far as respecting jurisdictions and promoting the rights of the province. It is a very good bill with respect to economic development. It is very fitting that today this bill is being debated on mining day here in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, let me say again why this government has proposed this bill and why I believe all members should, and hopefully will, support this bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps to support economic development in a region of Canada that needs it. It is not that all regions do not need it, but this area, where coal historically was king, can very much use economic development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps to continue to build our mining sector and export oriented industry. While some of the coal will be used domestically, there is a very good probability that a large percentage of the coal will be exported, possibly for metallurgical or thermal purposes. The coal has the potential to be used for both but can be used either way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is also an example of cooperation between the Nova Scotia government and the federal government. Governments can work together. We have a complex federation. We have a complex series of governments to deal with the nuances and the needs of each region, to respect the local desires and needs, and yet unify our country as one grand confederation. This bill builds on that, both pulling together across the country and developing locally. It provides for the clarity and stability that all businesses need when they are doing it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bill that is good for Canada, good for Nova Scotia, and good for Cape Breton. There may very well be 275 indirect jobs created through private sector investment and 700 direct jobs. I congratulate the people who are showing the initiative to redevelop this mine, the people of Cape Breton whose industry and initiative are pushing this forward and the members who have supported it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all hon. members to support this legislation and future similar legislation from this government.</div>

We want to be assured, though, as we go forward that the demand for energy is not going to subside any time soon and that the demand is going to remain high. It is imperative that clean coal technologies be embraced and developed. Canada has an opportunity to be a leader in that field. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having had the opportunity to go out to the CANMET plant in Bells Corners and seeing some of the things that have been taking place at the NRCan research project, it has been very reassuring and encouraging with CO<sub>2</sub> capturing and sequestration.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague is from Saskatchewan. SaskPower is very much at the fore of a number of different initiatives. I have received a number of emails from people who are concerned about the further use of coal and fossil fuels. I want to reassure people that there are steps being taken and positive things being undertaken. I know the member's province is at the forefront with SaskPower, so he may want to elaborate on some of the great victories it has had in recent years.</div>

    </p><a name="Para775155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we answer a question on clean coal, we first need to define what is meant by the terminology because the terminology “clean coal” has changed over the years. At one time many of the concerns were the sulphate particulates, the so-called, to use the slang that is often used, the SO<sub>x</sub> and the NO<sub>x</sub> particles that are emitted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years that has evolved and become more and more of a concern. Currently, the term is being used to talk about carbon dioxide and, in particular, carbon dioxide captured or sequestration. There are several different approaches to the term. The terminology is flexible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coal industry across North American, and in Canada especially, has been very good at developing clean coal technologies to take away those pollutants that previously were there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, with the emphasis on shifting to carbon dioxide, the industry began to shift over to deal with that particular problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Province of Saskatchewan along with SaskPower have been looking at developing and working with technology and is looking to partner with other thermal producers of electricity across the country. Their decision has been to not push quite as aggressively forward as they had previously been thinking with clean coal. It does not mean that they do not view it as having a potential for strong development, but it has to do with various scale sizes in Saskatchewan's economy, the potential to ramp up and to go with natural gas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall future for clean coal is very good. The technology is developing. The one thing we always have to be cautious about is that particular types of coals need particular nuances for certain situations. However, various technologies are being developed by both government and private industries to absorb, sequester or merely use for other purposes the carbon dioxide that is being emitted from coal plants.</div>

This bill demonstrates the entrepreneurship and courage of the people of Cape Breton, who have never lost hope regarding the issue of coal in their economy, their province, their corner of Canada.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para775162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the history of Nova Scotia and, in particular, Cape Breton and other parts, coal brings about the worst and most difficult stories in our history and also the best. We know of the mining disasters. We also know of the labour strife over the years, the beginnings of the industry which was a near slavery type situation for the workers in that industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know what it has brought to our province in terms of immigration into our province and developing a culture. The songs of Cape Breton alone are great cultural riches to Canada and a lot of it relates back to the growing and the beginning of the implementation and continuation of the coal industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it was a very difficult day in Cape Breton in that whole economy when we had the loss of the last operating deep mine. It is a great pleasure to see the renewal of this industry and to look at the courage of the people of Cape Breton who never lost faith. The labour unions and the skilled people who worked within those mines never lost faith. They knew of the potential of Donkin. They have had great support and leadership by their members of Parliament, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> who worked ardently on bringing this to where we have it now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems that we encounter when we deal with a project like this that is a little bit off the beaten path, slightly different than the others, is that the basic infrastructure for the mine is on land and the resource is under the sea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the jurisdictional thing, it becomes a question of who owns it. Is it the responsibility of the Province of Nova Scotia? Is it the responsibility of the Government of Canada? We have been unable to resolve that discussion. Even at this point we have been unable to resolve that argument in ownership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least what we have here is an agreement among the two, that the most important thing is the communities, particularly the communities of Cape Breton in this region, and there is a possibility for economic development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill brings us to an accommodation where no party abandons their jurisdiction. The federal government still claims ownership of the resource because it is the sea floor. The provincial government still maintains that it has a right and responsibility for occupational safety and environmental regulations, as do the feds. However, we have come to an agreement where the province will be the regulator and will adopt the federal law, implement federal law and be the agent that will be dealt with in all these matters with the acting companies. I think it is a very good arrangement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78505,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78505&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Charlottetown</A> who said earlier that it would be good if we could have some overarching legislation or proposals in this country that could take care of situations like these in the future because this has kept that community in stress for a long time. For a number of years the community has wanted to redevelop that mine. A very large international company with a good reputation in that field was interested in doing it but it needed a lot of patience because it was a three or four year process and the legislation was not done. We are doing it now but we must wait for the regulations and get the work done. It would be a lot better if we could have it faster in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was dealing not so long ago on behalf of the federal government with the Province of Nova Scotia, working with the offshore oil industry that was looking at getting permits to operate on the Nova Scotian shelf. Because of those same types of disputes as to who the regulator is on occupational safety, who the regulator is on labour and who the regulator is in all the other fields, both of them claimed jurisdiction, so we ended up with two sets of regulations. The approval process ends up taking two, three or four times longer than it would in another active field in other parts of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775171"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that time could be linked to better operating conditions, then it might be understandable, but it cannot. It is not that we do a better environmental job on those or that we ensure better safety for our people. It is just the bureaucracy and the technicalities of getting those permits which are so difficult.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775172"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have come a ways a bit and have some agreements in Nova Scotia on the offshore that we have been able to improve through the smart regulation process started in the Chrétien days. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just had good results in my community. A large quarry in a beautiful, pristine community wanted take away all the basalt rock and ship it to the U.S. It did not want to destroy its communities so it tried to excavate the seashore in Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there were federal and provincial jurisdictions. On the socio-economic side, the Province of Nova Scotia was the only one that could stop the proposal. The federal government maintained responsibilities on the establishment of a port and on the environmental questions related to the fisheries and seawater, as well as some elements of the groundwater in the province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution we found at that point was to have a joint review panel under the Environmental Assessment Act of Canada join with the review panel of the Province of Nova Scotia to create one review panel where the laws of both apply. Dr. Bob Fournier, who chaired that panel, heard from experts and from the community and came out with a recommendation not to pursue the project, which was a great relief to the people of western Nova Scotia, although maybe not unanimously. Some people would have liked to have seen the jobs associated with it, but most people did not want to see that type of activity in their community. On that side it was the provincial regulations that prompted the provincial responsibilities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the federal side, Bob Fournier made some interesting points on an environmental side and the whole seacoast of Nova Scotia. That was a good area of cooperation but we want to see more between Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada. As has been pointed out in this House today, for Nova Scotia to advance there needs to be that type of cooperation with the federal government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a great day when the prime minister at the time, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, met with the member for Halifax and, with the Premier of Nova Scotia and the minister responsible for petroleum development, signed the Atlantic accord, the Canada-Nova Scotia agreement. It was a beautiful day because not only did it bring us some much needed money to do the economic development and those projects that we needed in Nova Scotia, but it also signalled cooperation for the future. We could set aside some jurisdictional disputes and problems and look at how we could improve the lives of people, and all of Canada benefits from that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand how disappointed Canadians were when the budget was presented in this House by the current government and, after it had specifically stated that it would support that agreement, it demolished the agreement completely. Nova Scotians know that $1 million were lost in Nova Scotia. What probably bothered them more than that was the pretence over the summer months that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the premier had resolved it and that they had come to a mutual understanding that would restore the Canada-Nova Scotia agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I know that to be false. I know the offshore Canada-Nova Scotia agreement, as well as that with Newfoundland and Labrador, meant that those provinces would benefit from revenues from the accord above and beyond revenues of any new equalization program, any changes in equalization or any other programs of the federal government. The benefits under the accord would be above that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have said in their exchange of letters, as best as I can understand it and as every analyst has told me so far, that the provinces can choose either/or in any of the given years whether they want to go by the provisions of the new equalization formula or of the old accord, which is a little better than what was put in the budget last spring but is not still the full accord. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know exactly what the loss will be. I would guesstimate in the area of $600 million for Nova Scotia but I cannot say for sure because the government will not show me the information. It will not provide it. What we have seen is an exchange of letters between the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> of the federal government and the minister of finance of the Province of Nova Scotia. When we listen to what these people have said, specifically the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> in the press conference in the foyer when he was with the premier, he said that there would be no stacking.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One briefing was arranged for a late Friday afternoon. For members from Nova Scotia, myself included, it takes an hour to get to the airport and on the flight. Then it is a two hour flight. Then it takes about three hours to get back to my riding. I had intended to leave as early as I could on Friday afternoon, but this meant I would have to go home on Saturday and I would lose the best constituency day of the week. I agreed to stay here. Then that meeting was cancelled. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there was no intention of having the meeting. The intent was to have us wait around here and then cancel at the last minute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My memory does not permit me to recall the fourth meeting, but I will talk about three of them. Another meeting was arranged during the week of the November 11 break, when everyone was in their constituency. This meant that 11 MPs and a bunch of senators would have to fly back, at the taxpayer cost, to spend a couple of days in Ottawa, perhaps only one, for that briefing. I would have lost those days in my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended the November 11 celebrations with students at a number of schools in my riding. I visited the veteran's wing at the Yarmouth hospital and spent an afternoon with the veterans. I would have had to cancel two days of those meetings to be in Ottawa for that briefing. </div>

The minister agreed to move the meeting. The parliamentary secretary said that the meeting would be held this morning, November 20 at 10:30. Fourteen minutes before the meeting, we found out that it had been cancelled. No reason was given for this cancellation. We only saw the officials scurrying down the hall to the elevator. They had received their order from on high that there would be no briefing. What do we have? We do not receive a briefing. </div>

He promised to support the accord. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember sitting on the government side and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and his ministers, who were on this side at the time, asked that the budget, which included the implementation of the original accord, be divided, so they could support the accord and not vote for the full budget. Opposition members at that time were willing to support the accord, or so they would tell Nova Scotians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instant the Conservative government got its hands on the levers of power, we saw in the first budget a warning shot. It said that the Atlantic accord was not well accepted everywhere in the country because it was a special provision. Sure it is a special provision. There are special needs. All these museums in Ottawa, financed by the federal government, are special provisions. They are not a per capita distribution of federal funds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our government invested in the oil sands in Alberta, we saw there was a great economic opportunity, and oil was not at the prices that it is now. We accelerated the cost allowance program for that industry so it could become what it is today, the great economic generator of the country. This was not done on a per capita distribution of special tax incentives. It was done as a special assistance to that part of the country because it had a certain potential, a certain resource and it was good for the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people from all over the country, including from my riding, went and found good work in that area. Hopefully some day they will return to my riding, with the expertise they have gathered there, and develop businesses and give employment in the area. It was that type of an investment as was the Atlantic accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Atlantic accord gave some economic development money to Nova Scotia and to Newfoundland and Labrador so they could develop their provinces.

We are talking about fairly significant royalties for both coal and for the methane gas that comes off of it. The coal bed methane is a 5% of value royalty, which is very significant and will be very good for the people of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia. The royalty going back to the province has a range of $5 million per year on the coal itself, which will all come out of the consolidated revenue fund. This is very significant and important. The only reason why we should talk about the Atlantic accord is on that basis.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is this government was able to take the considerations of many members of the House from Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada, including the member from Cape Breton, whose own party was unable to get the job done.

    </p><a name="Para775204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of economic development, I thank the member for raising that point because it is very important. When we look at that type of operation in the rural part of our country, it has economic spinoff. There is the opportunity for families to stay close to their home and raise their children in their area. All the ancillary businesses that will grow will provide services not only to those families but to this business. I do not think we can overestimate the value of that, maintaining that culture and providing those opportunities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a big change in Cape Breton and it has been very difficult. That change has happened all over Nova Scotia, as well as all other rural areas in the country. We have depopulation and the movement of people toward the urban centres or toward areas like the tar sands, for example, where there is a huge opportunity. Therefore, it is very good when we can have this type of attraction that keeps people there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there have been other changes also. We have seen people investing in Cape Breton in non-traditional areas, high technology, robotics type machinery, manufacturing. I have seen some very good investments by the communities themselves to further develop the natural resources. The crab industry, for example, used to be shipped to New Brunswick for canning and processing. It is now done within the island of Cape Breton, which provides new economic input.</div>

One of the toughest moments was when I and my colleagues, the former minister for ACOA, the member <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> and the natural resources minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A>, boarded the plane and we went to Cape Breton, to my home town. We made the announcement that the federal government was finished in the coal mining business in Cape Breton. It was a tough day. Many of friends were involved in that industry. The impact that had on the community was significant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our community is resilient. We are a tough group. We have moved on from there. As the member has mentioned, we have diversified as a community. I think quite a bit of that was because of a fund and moneys that were invested through his early stewardship through the ACOA portfolio. Therefore, Cape Breton Island has a much more diversified now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be great legislation. Any legislation has to protect the interest of the greater public good. It is important that the legislation does not handcuff industry in moving ahead with these types of opportunities. Also what is important is we protect the health an safety of the workforce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member believe the legislation does those types of things: protect the public good, unleash the corporate sector, in this case Xstrata, to do what it has to do to develop the project, but still not compromise the health and safety of the men and women who will work on this project?</div>

I had some difficult days as minister of fisheries, but as minister of ACOA in Nova Scotia that was a difficult day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember going to Cape Breton to announce the closure of the mines. The only thing on my mind at that time was probably that I should have taken my guidance counsellor's advice in high school and become a crossing guard. To tell a community that what it has known for hundreds of years is no longer there, it is gone, and that part of the culture that keeps the community together has disappeared all of a sudden is very difficult.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a tough time for Cape Bretoners, but they rallied. The federal government at that time put money into the growth fund. We asked people from those communities, some living still in Cape Breton and others living abroad, to volunteer their time and their energies, at a cost to them professionally and personally, to steward the reinvestment into that economy. It was a beautiful thing to watch. We see a lot of those benefits now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is unfortunate is a lot of time and ink is spent on the projects that are not working and not enough time and ink is spent celebrating the entrepreneurships of those communities that have been able to take advantage of those investment opportunities and assistance and turn things around.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like everyone, I see people on airplanes all the time or we meet them somewhere. They talk about Nova Scotia and they talk about going to Cape Breton and the Celtic Colours. It is a beautiful festival. It brings a huge amount of money into Cape Breton. None of that would have been possible if there had not been some government intervention and investment at the beginning to start those projects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I will go to the point about the safety of the people. I am quite confident the bill does that because there is no reduction in the criteria at any point. The criteria remains the same. It is the administration of it that is simplified. </div>

    </p><a name="Para775219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a number of folks have spoken today. Quite a number of my Atlantic colleagues from both sides have spoken on the bill. As we have stated before, basically what it does is facilitate an economic opportunity for Cape Breton Island and the province of Nova Scotia, but I am also going to talk a little later about the spinoff benefit for New Brunswick as well. I think this is a big benefit for Atlantic Canada, especially when it comes to coal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill creates a legal framework for the mining operation at the Donkin coal block. The economic opportunity is to be able to bring that coal to the surface from an area some three kilometres offshore Cape Breton and transport the coal to market. The operation, as people have said, will produce 275 direct jobs, potentially as many as 700 indirect jobs, and hundreds of millions of dollars for the provincial economy in terms of salaries, equipment and a range of goods and services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity came about on December 13, 2004, when the energy minister of Nova Scotia, Cecil Clarke, sent out a press release. Some of the benefits of this opportunity, stated a news story, would be:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para775223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That last statement is absolutely true in regard to the complexity of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A>, talked earlier today about the price of coal being at almost record highs of almost $100 a tonne. That is a tremendous development and means a tremendous amount of opportunity for employment in the area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, Nova Scotia announced that the Xstrata Donkin Coal Development Alliance was the successful bidder. The company immediately launched a multi-million dollar study to evaluate the potential for bringing the mine into production. The study is currently under way, but the major key decision point on this is February, and if all goes well a positive decision on mine development will be made in August.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 25 people are currently working at the Donkin mine site. Xstrata has drained the water from the two tunnels dug to the coal face in the mid-1980s by the Cape Breton Development Corporation and the company is now preparing to drill into the coal seam to obtain further information on the resource.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a resource standpoint, everything appears favourable. However, for Xstrata to come to a positive decision, there is another issue that needs to be clarified, and that is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously mentioned, the Donkin coal block is located offshore Cape Breton Island. Both the Governments of Canada and Nova Scotia claim ownership of the resource. Accordingly, they both believe they have an obligation to regulate the resource. This creates quite a level of uncertainty for Xstrata and puts the company in a position where it is faced with two regulators. Facing even one regulator can be a daunting task, but facing two is incredible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> will remove this uncertainty. It would make clear to Xstrata, its employees and the regulators what laws will apply and who should enforce them. Because regulatory regimes affect costs, Xstrata is looking for regulatory certainty before its February 2008 decision point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think about some of this regulatory uncertainty, I think about our major project office for some of these major projects in the mining area. I think of the potential that this will give some of these projects to get off the ground. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those major projects is coming to the fore in New Brunswick in my riding of Tobique—Mactaquac, where a major tungsten mine potentially will be developed in the Stanley-Napadogan area. What a tremendous opportunity this is for an area that has seen its forest industry ravaged. It is a tremendous opportunity. I think this regulatory aspect will certainly help that.</div>

The objective of the effort is to establish regulatory clarity to facilitate economic development and to do so in a way that is acceptable to both governments. In March of this year, federal and provincial officials agreed on an approach. This was quickly followed by a period of federal-provincial consultations with the public. These sessions resulted in assurances that labour, community and industry groups both understood and supported the proposed regime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee-employer groups, community organizations and the Canada--Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board were all supportive. In June, cabinet approved the drafting of the legislation required to get this done.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal framework proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> covers resource development and a number of labour matters. The latter includes labour standards, industrial relations and occupational health and safety, which is so important when we look at the development of these underground mines and consider the inherent danger that goes with them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides the governor in council with the authority to make regulations incorporating provincial laws into the body of federal law. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> also excludes corresponding federal laws from applying to the Donkin coal block.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws would be incorporated as amended from time to time by the province and with other adaptations if necessary. For example, we would not incorporate anything that was in conflict with the federal claim to the offshore without first amending it. Any provincial law incorporated federally would be administered and enforced by the provincial official responsible for the relevant provincial law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By means of this legislation, both levels of government will be able to work together to ensure that occupational health and safety provisions will serve the Donkin miners well. More specifically, Nova Scotia's trade union act, the occupational health and safety act and the labour standards code will be incorporated into federal law through regulation should this bill become law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia has accepted to amend its occupational health and safety laws to include certain elements that exist under federal law. This is meant to provide the highest level of protection for workers. The labour matters covered by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> will not in any way sacrifice accountability, transparency or health and safety for the sake of regulatory efficiency.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> also clarifies the matter of royalties. These will be collected by the province and then remitted to the Government of Canada. An equivalent amount will then be provided for the province. The bill requires that an agreement concerning royalties with the Province of Nova Scotia is subject to the approval of the governor in council. For greater certainty, it has been made clear that the User Fees Act does not apply to any fees contained in provincial laws incorporated by reference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this bill? It is so important and so critical. The coal that will be produced by the Donkin coal block development is a most valuable resource, one that can contribute to the economic well-being of Cape Bretoners and Canadians as a whole. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One only has to look at the people who worked in the mines before the last underground mine was shut down in 2001. Since then, some of these folks have been working out west. What a tremendous opportunity this represents for these people to return, just like a lot of people from Atlantic Canada would.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does this development represent a huge potential benefit to Cape Breton from a mining perspective, it also could represent a new source of coal for the region's electric generating stations. This mine could bring on stream an additional five million tonnes per year of Canadian coal into the market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While 16% of Canada's supply of electricity is generated from coal sources, that percentage is much higher in Nova Scotia, where 60% of electricity comes from coal and roughly 15% to 20% does in New Brunswick.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia Power has four major coal stations in operation that use approximately 2.5 million tonnes per year, with the two largest stations accounting for the majority of the use. Those are the 600 megawatt Lingan plant and the 300 megawatt Trenton plant. These generating station investments are important to maintaining competitive power rates in Nova Scotia for the over 460,000 customers of the utility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a homegrown source of coal that could ultimately replace imported coal could be a very important cost and security of supply benefit to Nova Scotians, and to Atlantic Canada for that matter. New Brunswick has a 458 megawatt coal plant at Belledune, which is equipped with scrubber technology and could be a beneficiary of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to note that Nova Scotia Power recognizes that generating clean electricity and energy is important. The utility has taken steps to implement cleaner-burning fuel technology, such as the circulating fluidized bed technology at Point Aconi, with announcements of millions of dollars to equip other stations with scrubber technology. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the summer of 2006 there was a project undertaken to retrofit the Lingan plant with pollution control technology for NOx, which has announced another potential $170 million project to put in scrubber technologies to lower the sulphur dioxide emissions, a technology very similar to what exists at our Belledune plant in northern New Brunswick. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments are in addition to the announcement of over 200 megawatts of wind power generation in the province. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canadians and the utilities recognize the importance of generating clean electricity. We recognize the importance of taking positive steps to develop renewable resources, but we also have to face facts. Our generation's profile is based on thermal. It will take a while for us to wean ourselves off that, but we cannot afford to just leave a stranded investment of many billions of dollars out there with no way to collect dollars of revenue against it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the measures being taken in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> will provide the regulatory certainty required for the Donkin coal block project to proceed. It will provide the highest level of protection for the workers involved. It will permit both levels of government to retain their current positions with respect to ownership and jurisdiction. It will facilitate the economic development of Cape Breton Island and, I would maintain, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and all of Atlantic Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> is also an outstanding example of cooperation between governments to fulfill a common interest in seeing the development of the Donkin block. By introducing this legislation, the Government of Canada has demonstrated its commitment to the economic development of the Cape Breton community and to Nova Scotia as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086202,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086202&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-15</A> will clarify those occupational health and safety regulations that apply. We know the dangers that are faced by coal miners and we know that safety is paramount to coal miners. We have seen this in situations that have happened over the last year or two in the U.S. and other countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By eliminating confusion over who would protect these workers, we hope to protect them better. I know that Nova Scotia has come a long way since Westray as well. What this does for the Donkin mine is ensure that there are local people who know the resource and who will be there to inspect these mines and inspect them in a timely manner. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, as previous speakers have suggested, the technology exists that can burn coal cleanly, and we have an opportunity here to employ hundreds of people in Cape Breton Island. We have an experienced workforce in the coal mining industry and a community that wants this development. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Donkin enterprise will give us another chance to revive the coal mining industry in Cape Breton. What a great story that is for us. We are certainly pleased to see that legislation was passed already in the Nova Scotia legislature. Now it is up to members here in the Parliament of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a tremendous number of positive comments about this legislation today.

    </p><a name="Para775265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada we have businesses involved in what is called remailing. Remailing is a business that most hon. members are probably not aware of. Indeed, remailers collect mail destined for international locations from large, commercial mailers. The remailer, or consolidator, then ships the mail outside of Canada to another country, a country with cheaper postal rates, ideally, a country that has been designated as a developing country by the Universal Postal Union.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Universal Postal Union is an agency of the United Nations. It has been in existence since the late 1800s. Today, it has close to 200 members and deals with postal issues. It does not get involved in domestic postal matters. Its role is to act as a primary forum for cooperation among postal sector players. It actually sets the rules for international mail exchanges and makes recommendations to its members, “To stimulate growth in postal volumes and to improve the quality of service for customers”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Universal Postal Union that established a single postal territory for the exchange of international mail, which obviously is very necessary. This means that when we are mailing a letter out of the country, we can buy an international stamp to put on that letter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post would keep the revenue from that stamp, but it would be a different postal administration delivering that letter. It is that other postal administration that is incurring the bulk of the cost for the delivery of the letter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, under the Universal Postal Union system of international exchange of mail, Canada Post would need to compensate the country of delivery. This compensation is called a terminal due.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Universal Postal Union has classified its member countries as industrialized or developed versus those that are developing. Obviously different countries fit into different categories. This classification affects the rate of terminal due a country is eligible to receive from another country for mail it has received and the rate it is obliged to pay another country for mail that it sent out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a complicated issue, but remailers do not have to pay terminal dues and are therefore able to offer lower rates than Canada Post. The Universal Postal Union also allows remailing. There are other countries that allow remailing. However, Canada does not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago Canada Post took a large number of remailers to court. The courts have rightly ruled, in reading the exclusive privilege of Canada Post, that remailing is an infringement upon Canada Post's exclusive jurisdiction. This exclusive privilege was granted to Canada Post through its legislation. This is legislation that was passed in the House of Commons over 20 years ago when the Canada Post Corporation Act was first enacted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the exclusive privilege is set out in the act, the only way to adjust this exclusive privilege is to amend the act. It is only Parliament that can change provisions of the act, and only after public debate and discussion will that change be made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is pleased to have introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086132,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086132&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14, An Act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act</A>, and the purpose of this bill is to remove all outgoing international mail from Canada Post's exclusive privilege. This would actually enable remailers to operate in Canada without infringing on Canada Post's exclusive privilege. They would no longer be breaking Canadian law. They would no longer be at risk of a legal challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bill is proposing something broader than just remail, its net effect on Canada Post is not expected to be any different. Indeed, the business model of remailers is to collect large volumes of mail from commercial companies. It is not interested in collecting mail from you, Mr. Speaker, nor I.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They offer Canadian businesses lower postal rates. This actually reduces the cost of those companies. This reduces the cost of their goods or services to Canadians, to consumers, which is ultimately a good thing for Canadians. This results in lower costs to the ultimate consumer of the goods or service.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there used to be many federal government departments and agencies that used the services of remailers for their mail going overseas. They had shopped around to find the lowest rates so that they could make effective use of taxpayers money.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation is not intended to allow the mail to come back into Canada and that is very clearly a difference that should be re-explained. The addressee of the letter is to be in a foreign country. We are not touching domestic mail. The addressee is to be outside of Canada. Remailers that attempt to send mail back into Canada will still be in contravention of the exclusive privilege of Canada Post after amended.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not proposing to let other postal sector players put stamps on their mail while it is in Canada. Some other countries also allow an Extraterritorial Office of Exchange, which is defined by the Universal Postal Union as: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a stamp is put on a letter while in Canada, it should have a Canada Post approved stamp. If Canada is to allow these ETOE's, or the Extraterritorial Offices of Exchange, there should be a licensing regime associated with it. We are not going there with this proposal. We are not allowing other countries to operate postal outposts in Canada. We want to help Canadian businesses compete internationally and we are attempting to do that with this legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has studied the issue. Canada Post has told us that it estimates it is currently foregoing revenues in the amount of $50 million to $80 million a year. This is an estimate based on what it has seen as a trend in its revenue stream since new rules were put in place by the Universal Postal Union in 2001. Canada Post does not know for sure how much business it has been losing to remailers operating illegally in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the industry itself has made claims of it being millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars. Because the courts have ruled remailing as unlawful, we cannot get data or information from the industry members that can be validated. These are small businesses often, and some large businesses, and usually located in places such as Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both estimates from Canada Post and from the industry itself are significant. They are also not very close. Some of the difference can be accounted for given that they are based on different premises and, of course, different expectations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Post estimate represents the impact on Canada Post itself and is not a measure of the industry. The industry estimate is more of an estimate of economic impact as it includes supporting businesses such as envelope manufacturers and print shops throughout the country, as I mentioned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should this legislation get enacted, Canada Post estimates losing another $45 million to $50 million a year, so there are financial implications. Its employees will worry that this is a first step toward privatization. Let us be clear. This government will not privatize Canada Post and there are no plans to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post is a very large institution. It is one of the largest employers in Canada. It has one of the largest retail networks in Canada. It provides services to Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Some would argue that it is indeed a Canadian icon. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that in rural communities in my constituency there is no federal institution that is more important to my constituents than Canada Post. That is why this government is taking positive action for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many issues and challenges facing this corporation. It would be easy to get sidetracked on any number of these issues. We just need to ask the previous members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities. They had some discussions on remailers, as my friend across the way will confirm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members tabled motions and amendments to those motions. At the end, they reported back that they wanted time to study the issue. This government has decided that it has done enough studying. The government has decided it is time to take action and positive action will be taken.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill itself is targeted to this specific issue. We do not want to get sidetracked in our goal to address this issue. Indeed, we also do not want changes to Canada Post to be widespread. This government is not interested in destroying Canada Post or privatizing it.

    </p><a name="Para775295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary is right, as the issue was raised within the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities. That committee is responsible for this bill. The Bloc Québécois understood that everyone had also agreed that a public study would be carried out before the bill was introduced. However, the government decided to force the issue once again and to introduce the bill without any public debate. Clearly we can never accept this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post's profits last year totalled $49 million. Canada Post told us that, in order to be able to guarantee service everywhere, in all municipalities and to all mailboxes, to guarantee that every Canadian would receive their mail at home, Canada Post needs to have precisely this exclusive privilege.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canada Post were to lose $50 million to $80 million, that would put it in a deficit and this would also create problems for those who receive the mail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775298"></a><p>

Yet, once Canada Post has finished its review of all mailboxes, 30% of Canadians will no longer receive their mail at home. But that is the Conservative government for you.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary if his final goal is not to completely reduce all home mail delivery. </div>

I do not believe the Bloc and the NDP actually understand what the proposed legislation does. It actually involves one small clause which states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not in any way affect home delivery within Canada. I think that is pretty clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask my colleague from Fort McMurray two questions. First, would he agree with me that the remailers are still doing business in Canada as they have done for the last 20 some years? Second, could he explain the context of this legislation and why it is we got to this point? Why is it that only two years ago suddenly Canada Post decided to take this to the courts to assert what had previously not been deemed an exclusive privilege, but today in accordance with that court ruling is deemed to be an exclusive privilege for Canada Post?</div>

The member is right. The NDP member who asked the question earlier has not been at the committee as long as I have been there and certainly is unaware of what is taking place with this particular piece of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the member is correct. It will not affect domestic mail at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be clear, I had in my office not six months ago members from an association of remailers who have been in business for anywhere from 15 to 25 years. They have been doing the same business day in and day out. They asked me what they were going to tell their employees when they went home. What were they going to say to them when they could not feed their families? </div>
    </p><a name="Para775330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are small businesses and employees across the country who get their livelihood from this particular type of business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is correct. Canada Post did not have an issue with this for over 20 years; it was only recently that it did. Indeed, the government's position is that we are going to take the best steps forward to help Canadians, to help small business and to help the Canadian economy. We are doing that. This is one step toward that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. This is not in any way going to privatize Canada Post. Indeed, it only affects outgoing mail. It does not affect domestic mail.</div>

If members do not mind my repeating what the last questioner asked in the debate, it is about a very small element, section 15 of the Canada Post Corporation Act, to be amended by adding the following after subsection (2):</div>
    </p><a name="Para775335"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The exclusive privilege referred to in subsection 14(1) does not apply to letters intended for delivery to an addressee outside Canada. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para775336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all. That is what the bill is about. We have heard for the last 20 some minutes what the bill does not intend to do, which is fine. I do not think that we in this House should be worried about what it is not intended to do, but rather what it is intended to do. From my perspective, as one of those members referred to by the previous speaker on the committee, this amendment to the Canada Post Corporation Act is really intended to protect the jobs of those small businesses that operate within the parameters of the Canada Post Corporation Act as they were interpreted until two years ago. That is all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can either agree that the jobs of people who have been engaged in legitimate business and the businesses that have been engaged in a legitimate environment are worthy of consideration and protection, or they are not. The moment we agree that those men and women have been engaged in activity that has been productive for them and their families and for the Canadian economy, then we must take an objective and positive disposition to this bill. Why do I say that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para775338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to get a good comprehension of what we are talking about, we have to think in terms of the dimensions of the discussion. It is good to think in terms of dimensions of discussions in dollars and cents. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post's annual report for 2006 says that despite a strong economy, the letter mail product was essentially flat in 2006. There was no growth as far as Canada Post is concerned, but it is concerned about the competition from the small businesses and the men and women that they employ. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us re-examine that context once again. That same report says that consolidated revenues from operations in Canada Post reached $7.3 billion for an increase of 4.6% over the previous year. This is an environment where the letter mail business is flat, so it has increased by 4.6% its revenues which total $7.3 billion according to its consolidated statement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there another number that fits in with that growth? What does a 4.6% increase mean? Again according to the statements in the annual report, it means $320 million of increased revenue. There is $320 million of additional revenue over the previous year in order to carry out its mandate, in order to guarantee the jobs of the men and women in rural Canada and in urban Canada and to deliver the kinds of service that Canada Post is mandated to deliver. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it falls short of its mandate, the Government of Canada, as I read the Canada Post Corporation Act, has always stepped in to ensure that any shortfalls would be guaranteed by the Canadian taxpayer, but that is not the case now. We are not talking about that now. We are talking about an increase of $320 million that has brought to complete revenues of $7.3 billion.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625">(1625)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we ought to focus too much on this. It is a fabulous amount of money. It does not equal anything I have ever dreamed of owning. However, $7.3 billion means that, according to Canada Post, it is now one of the biggest employers in the country. In fact, it is proud to say that it was named as one of the top 100 employers in Canada for 2007 in <i>Maclean's</i> magazine. Things would appear to be going not too badly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the competition for a $7.3 billion company that employs 55,000 people? </div>
    </p><a name="Para775345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We heard the parliamentary secretary say a moment ago that the competition is a group of companies that send letter mail, pick it up and send it abroad, outside of Canada. In other words, they are not interfering with the exclusive privilege of sending mail within the country. In other words, they are not interfering with the mandate of providing that network of communication and jobs around the country. They are not interfering with the mandate to hoist the Canadian flag in communities all around the country so that we can see that our federation works. Those companies and those men and women who have been earning their jobs and their money legitimately, according to the parliamentary secretary who was repeating what Canada Post in its best estimates found to be the case, are a $45 million to $55 million competition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee I pressed some of the remailers. I said that surely it cannot be just $45 million to $55 million. They allowed that maybe they might inch up to $60 million, maybe even $70 million. In any case, according to a very quick calculation on a BlackBerry or any computer we would find that $60 million of gross revenue for these small companies, compared to the $7.3 billion, is about .8 of 1%. That is less than 1%. That is the threat. That is the Trojan Horse that people are now beginning to bring forward. That is why I said that we cannot be talking about what the bill is not going to do; we have to talk about what it is intended to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it is intended to do is to save the jobs of those people who are working for those companies that in their total represent less than $60 million compared to the big giant of $7.3 billion. Seven billion dollars and three hundred million dollars is what Canada Post earns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are trying to save the jobs of those men and women, if we think that their value, their dignity, their right to work is at least as good and legitimate as anybody who works for Canada Post, then we do not have any problem with this bill, because Canada Post does not have any problem with the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Canada Post, in addition to indicating that it grew its income by $320 million, really did say that the net income for the fiscal period ending December 2006 was $119 million. On revenues of $7.3 billion, it netted roughly $120 million. That $120 million net is at least twice the gross value of all those small companies and their employees who will punch the clock or do what they can to go to work every day to raise their families in an environment that is productive, dignified and meritorious of a Canadian dream. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630">(1630)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill should be doing that and that is what I thought the government wanted to bring across to everybody. That is why this bill is so brief. It just simply says to let these people work. Where are they working, according to the parliamentary secretary? They are not working all over Canada so they can diminish the mandate of Canada Post to deliver a network of communication for all Canadians and to bring them together and bind this country tighter as one unit. No. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the parliamentary secretary and to the best estimates of Canada Post, we are talking about people who are engaged in businesses where this opportunity is practicable. In other words, they cannot compete anywhere else. They can only compete in three areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that those three areas might be the greater Toronto area, might be metropolitan Montreal and might be greater Vancouver. Those are not three insignificant markets. They are very large and important but they also have the infrastructure required in order to make some of these very small businesses function.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no competition anywhere else. There is no competition for rural mail service in small communities where Canada Post might be a significant if not the most significant employer. There is no competition for a standard bearer for our Canadian presence, the point of contact between citizens and government around the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 20-plus years the business has developed. Obviously it has not been such an overwhelming success as to make great inroads into the revenue stream of Canada Post because the revenue stream totalled $7.3 billion last year in an environment where the letter mail business was flat and these companies were not able to generate much more than $50 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at this again and ask what we should do as responsible parliamentarians. If we are concerned about the jobs of the men and women who work for these small businesses that operate here in Canada. Members will notice that I did not say they had to necessarily be Canadian owned, but that they receive investment and they do employ Canadians. What happens to the jobs of the people who work for these companies? Will they be absorbed by Canada Post, a company that is trying desperately to be as productive, as efficient and as competitive as any other industrial giant? I do not know. How would it do that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para775356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this business that Canada Post has just realized exists is labour intensive, and it would be labour intensive in places like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver and non-existent anywhere else, will Canada Post absorb those jobs and create new ones so that we now can say, as responsible legislators, that we are not taking away the opportunity to earn a livelihood and create a future for oneself and one's family, but that in fact we are transferring the possibility from these small entrepreneurs to a state related organization?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could do that, that would be fine but, in a competitive environment, Canada Post will not absorb those jobs. It will ask its union members, which is CUPW, to take on any additional work. Does anyone know why? It is because the work represented by those small companies and their dutiful men and women who work every day to earn money to carry on with their livelihood for their families amounts to less than 0.8 of 1% of Canada Post's gross revenues. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone think for a moment that Canada Post will absorb all of those jobs and create more new jobs for every one of those people so that it can spend more? It will not do that at all. CUPW members will be asked to take on additional work, but not for more money, presumably, because in an efficiency driven environment it could not do that, but to do it for the same money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be accomplished by driving out of business these companies that provide jobs for people's next door neighbours? It will not hurt people who are not from Toronto, Montreal or British Columbia's lower mainland. It will not hurt the member from Thunder Bay and it probably will not even bother the members from Ottawa. It will have an impact on people from the greater Toronto area, the greater Montreal area and the greater Vancouver area, where people are working diligently to make Canada a success.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen? Will those people now be transferred from a job in one company to a Canada Post position? The answer is no. It will not happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the House of Commons, our first obligation is to ensure that no legislation goes through the House that damages the potential available to any Canadian and, concomitant with that, the obligation to nurture an environment that gives Canadians that same opportunity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is what will happen, then this legislation is but a very small step in the direction of a positive initiative that should not be apologized for. That is bad English form. We should not add in a preposition and leave it dangling. We should say that it is something that allows a productive activity to flourish in a legitimate environment. That is what this bill would do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, do not let any member in the House confuse the positive aspects, the intentions of this bill, which came out of a committee that considered, deliberated and debated motions and said that we needed to structure legislation that does something positive, such as save jobs, nurture job creators and ensure that the infrastructure that we already have in place and, with all due respect, that is represented by Canada Post, be maintained. The bill took what the committee said and fashioned it in very simple terms, very brief legislation, and said that this was what we had to do.</div>

He is in his usual good form. He is very succinct and gets right to the point.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the member talks about the displacement of people from one area, which is the remailers, and obviously some of them have already left Canada, I was not quite sure where he meant they would end up, in what employ, if in the postal business or some place else. I wonder if he would be kind enough, in his normal succinct way, to answer that question.</div>

The hon. member gives me a compliment when he suggests that I have the entrepreneurial skills to take the considerations that are on the table for every one of those men and women who currently have a job and who are engaged in an enterprise that is giving them a remuneration with which they may or may not be content, but with which they are satisfied currently, and to replace that with something else.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a legislator. I wish I could say I was an entrepreneur, but all I know is that I have asked what will happen to their jobs if the actions that Canada Post was bringing upon them were to have great success. Canada Post could not guarantee that they would be absorbed as additional jobs in the Canada Post corporate plan, and the other companies, if they were forced to shut down, could not guarantee where they would go next. They would be at the mercy of most people who lose their jobs in an open market, out of luck.</div>

That is not what the committee recommended. The committee wrote a unanimous report asking Canada Post to defer its litigation until the committee had really studied the situation. That was the motion the committee passed unanimously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government has tabled a bill and maybe my colleague is in favour of it. There is a problem though: the committee asked the government for a chance, before the bill is tabled, to analyze the situation, have all the witnesses testify, and find out how many jobs are at stake. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. member was talking about small businesses, but Canada Post talks about big corporations. Personally, I have met remailers who say they employ thousands of people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know what the situation actually is in this industry. I also do not want the remailers to cannibalize Canada Post. As we know, Canada Post distributes its wealth in such a way that rural areas have equitable service. If Canada Post’s revenues were ever to decline too much, rural areas could be adversely affected, as they are right now. My Liberal colleague forgets this all too often. By the time Canada Post finishes its safety study, 30% of people will no longer have home delivery. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775373"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could they not have suggested equipping the people who deliver mail in rural areas with small, more suitable trucks, as in the United States, in order to satisfy everyone? No, they decided instead that Canada Post is being deprived of income, before doing a study of the situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what I blame the Conservative government and my colleague for. Once more, they draw hasty conclusions without doing a real study. The committee’s purpose was to prevent Canada Post from proceeding with litigation that it could shut down. The Bloc Québécois agreed to this. However, we want a real study done before a bill is passed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is happing now is that the Conservatives have decided, with the support of the Liberals, that the businesses are right. This means in the end that some rural residents may well lose their delivery service because Canada Post has less income. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope my colleague realizes this. That is what I want to ask him. Does he realize that this change to Canada Post could affect rural mail service? He does not seem to realize it when I listen to him, but Canada Post is— </div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para775387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be for the government to respond. Government members have said that they have gone out of their way to give the kinds of guarantees that only government can give. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in opposition when the then Conservative government of the day started to close down rural post offices everywhere around the country. In fact, it did not make that distinction. It closed down post offices in urban centres and in mine as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a transformation of Canada Post. Should Canada Post get greater income? There is no guarantee that income from these remailers will go directly to Canada Post. There is none. The previous questioner asked me what I would do with the jobs of the people who work for these remailers. We cannot give them any guarantees, just like we cannot give Canada Post a guarantee that the $45 million, $50 million or $60 million that is represented by these enterprises will go directly into its coffers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence of international remailers' business is that mail intended for foreign destinations will not go to Canada Post. It will go someplace else. The businesses have every right to pursue a business someplace else. I cannot constrain, and I do not think anyone else here can, the current customers to go to Canada Post. Were that possible, we might be having a different discussion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Canada Post need more money to deliver in rural communities? I do not know. The consolidated revenue statement says that it made $120 million net last year. It did not ask us for permission to spend that money to improve rural service. Why would it? Canada Post also admits that the market for letters is flat. If Canada Post does not have any clients, what is it going to do?</div>

    </p><a name="Para775393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will summarize it briefly by reading it. It is not a very complicated bill. It is probably one of the shortest bills ever introduced in this House. It has just one clause, a proposed addition to the act that reads as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para775394"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The exclusive privilege referred to in subsection 14(1) does not apply to letters intended for delivery to an addressee outside Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para775395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to grasp the history behind this bill to understand why it is being introduced in the House today. The English and French versions of the Canada Post Corporation Act had a terminology problem. The French version applied this exclusive privilege to letters for delivery to an addressee outside Canada, whereas the English version did not. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this dichotomy, which was in place for over 20 years, remailers infiltrated the mail market. They take mail intended for destinations abroad from companies, put it in a container and send it to addressees via other countries that offer lower rates than Canada Post. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that all those watching the debate on television understand why an exclusive privilege was granted to Canada Post. Among other things, it permits all citizens to receive their mail at their residence, no matter where they live in the great and vast province of Quebec or in the great and vast country of Canada. That is why the House of Commons passed, at the time, the Canada Post Corporation Act: to grant this exclusive privilege so that everyone can receive their mail at home no matter where they live.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, things have changed since then. As I was explaining earlier, remailers, among others, referred to the English version. Since they were already working in this area, they used it to justify forwarding other types of mail that were not letters. These companies were already in business and they decided to do the same with mail in general and to cite the English version in order to do business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, the Canada Post Corporation finally decided to turn to the courts. These are probably the types of questions that we, the Bloc Québécois would have liked to have asked both the Canada Post representatives and its employees as well as the remailers and their employees, in order to discover why Canada Post went to court three years ago. The courts found in favour of Canada Post and were prepared to issue injunctions against companies that were remailing letters abroad. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee, in its great wisdom, wanted to be able to carry out an in-depth analysis before the citizens working for these companies lost their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed with both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party for tabling a bill before taking a hard look at it. The purpose of the unanimous report presented by the Standing Committee on Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities was simply to ask Canada Post to stop legal proceedings until the committee carried out a thorough analysis of the matter. That was the purpose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That goal was finally attained, and remailers were not completely satisfied, but they were fairly satisfied. In the short term, it meant that they did not have to lay off employees until we could conduct a thorough analysis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the House was prorogued. People who take an interest in politics followed these events. All the discussions began again in Parliament. Finally, we have a new session, which is what the Conservatives wanted. The government decided to introduce a new bill before the committee could even hold its first meeting. In fact, the organizational meeting took place this morning. When the government prorogues the House, the committees start from scratch again. It takes 14 days after the members are chosen, which is too long. In short, most committees have been sitting for only a few weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government therefore decided to introduce a bill simply to put an end to Canada Post's exclusive privilege. The government decided to submit the bill to the House of Commons and make the committee work so that we could vote on this. This is clearly unacceptable, because we would have liked to guide the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very hard to pass amendments when the bill is only three lines long. The government knew exactly what it was doing. The bill that was tabled is only three lines long, and we will not be able to add a paragraph and a half or two paragraphs. That is impossible. This means that, theoretically, we will have to vote for or against this bill without ever having made any real analysis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In committee, we will make every effort and use every possible means to call a full slate of witnesses, provided that the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party do not work together and decide to limit debate to one day only. Together, they have a majority, and they could decide to do that. In fact, they could just sweep the whole thing under the rug, so that we could never get to the bottom of things, if they decided that the whole matter was settled. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am a bit disappointed at the speech given by my Liberal friend, who finally seems to have decided that Canada Post is not going to lose any money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Bloc Québécois is concerned. We think that the exclusive privilege is a sign of equality among the citizens of Quebec and Canada, and everyone has the right to have mail delivered to their home. This is why Canada Post was created. I do not like to use this word, but in the old days, it was the Queen's mail. But today, I must say, mail delivery has gone out the window, and the Queen as well, or at least the Queen's mail. Forget home delivery. Those days are over and here is the proof.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary, a nice fellow, explained that no one would lose anything. Forget that. It has already started, and 30% of people who receive home delivery will lose this service for safety reasons explained by Canada Post and its president.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are solutions: in the United States, smaller and better adapted vehicles deliver mail to the door, etc. We could have made such an investment, but no, it was decided that 30% of the population would lose their home delivery for various reasons: size of the route, the way employees work with their traditional vehicle, the fact that they must get out on the side of the road, little space, speed, etc.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I am not making any of this up. Call any Canada Post official and he or she will say the same thing: 30% of people will no longer have home delivery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, they will have to get their mail from the big, green boxes. And, as the Liberal member was saying earlier, all new residential developments have those green boxes. These new subdivisions may all have those green boxes grouped together in one place, but this is not the best solution. If they had really wanted to, home delivery service still could have been provided to Canadians, as it was in the past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This service is being further and further reduced. We are concerned. The parliamentary secretary can get all worked up and say that Canada Post will never be privatized, but as soon as tempting to privatize Canada Post. There will be fewer employees and staff, that is, just what is needed to be able to privatize the corporation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Bloc Québécois' concern. Indeed, we do not believe the Conservatives. They said there would not be any impact and that there would always be rural mail. The minister got all worked up saying that nothing would be changed. Yet, within two years' time, 30% of citizens in rural settings will no longer receive their mail. That is the reality hidden behind the posturing of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should we believe him now, when he says that Canada Post will never be privatized? We cannot believe him any more than the public can believe him. Go and talk to those people who stand to lose their mailboxes and will be forced to go to community mailboxes. Ask them if they believe the minister. No one believes him anymore. He works for us every day, ensuring that we are elected, and we have no problem with this. This allows us to be re-elected, time and time again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in certain respects, this is in no way an intelligent objective. It was decided that a crown corporation would be created and given an exclusive privilege, in order to ensure that all citizens in a large country such as Quebec or Canada would receive their mail at home. It was a laudable objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They pretend to listen, but then they cut services and brook no discussion about it. That is what the Bloc Québécois disagrees with. I am not saying that things would turn out any differently otherwise. The problem is that they decided to introduce a bill that cannot be amended. We will have no choice but to vote for or against the bill. It is only three lines long, so it will be practically impossible to amend. We will have to vote against the bill or for it. The government cannot say that it did not realize this. It has law clerks and knows exactly what it is doing.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All it wanted to do was present us with a fait accompli and ask us if we were for it or against it. That is exactly what committee members did not want to happen. I am having a hard time understanding my committee colleagues who were there at the time. We all wanted Canada Post to drop its case so that no jobs would be lost. We were against losing jobs, but we wanted a thorough analysis. That was our goal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a bill that says,“You have no choice. You can talk about it all you want, but in the end, the point is, are you for it or against it?” If the analysis had been done before, we could have come up with a better, smarter solution that would probably have enabled Canada Post to protect its exclusive privilege while letting remailers keep their jobs. It could have happened. Some of our Liberal colleagues were even ready to do that. We had discussions. But none of that will happen now because the government decided to do things its way. I am disappointed that the Liberals agreed to that. I hope that we can have a debate about this in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Post has very healthy sales, but revenues are down significantly. It is important to understand that the Canada Post Corporation pays taxes in the provinces where it does business. It is a crown corporation, but it has to pay taxes, which is good. It is a corporate taxpayer like any other business. You have seen and will understand that a portion of these revenues goes to taxes. Then, because it is a crown corporation, Canada Post must pay a dividend to the federal government. In 2007, that dividend totalled $48 million. That means that it must turn over its surplus to the Government of Canada. It was decided that things would work that way, and I am not opposed to that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the decision is made to decrease sales and if ever the goal was for Canada Post to earn $49 million or $50 million less net profit, what would be the reaction of the government, which would still want its dividend at year-end? Is this discussed in this bill? It is impossible. This bill can no longer be amended. All the legislative drafters will say that you cannot add anything that changes the substance of the bill. We will therefore not be able to discuss that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sticking point for the Bloc Québécois. The government cannot threaten something that has been in existence for generations and is likely the oldest service provided by the federal government across Canada. The mail is likely the oldest service. The government is attacking it directly, gently, simply by letting companies do what they want, without letting us ask questions, hold a real public debate or invite all the stakeholders. The government has done this by being both judge and defendant and saying that it is not important to Canada Post. It has revenues of $7 billion or $8 billion, but in the end only $49 million is paid in dividends to the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the spending. That is $119 million in net revenues and $49 million in dividends paid to the government. If sales are cut by $150 or $200 million, net revenues and dividends will drop, and we will be forced to cut other services to maintain the dividends for the government, which needs this money to do other things, as it does with employment insurance. It is dipping into the EI fund. The EI fund is not an independent fund. Citizens who make their contributions to EI make them into a fund here, in Ottawa, that is not independent. It is part of the consolidated fund, and the government needs that money to pay down the debt and invest in military equipment or the war.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a choice the Conservatives make. They certainly do not invest in the environment. That much we know. But they will happily invest in the oil industries or in military equipment. It is a choice. The problem is that they have decided to do the same thing with the dividends paid by Canada Post, and want more money to invest in military equipment and in oil resources, but not in services for the public.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not one Conservative member who can guarantee me that today, because there will be no debate on the subject. The debate will be held on three lines of a bill that will ask whether we are for or against allowing remailers to send letters outside Canada. We cannot make even the slightest modification. There will be no debate, and there is nothing we can do about it.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is yes or no. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Liberals and the Conservatives have already shown their colours, it will be yes to the bill right from the start. That is what is disappointing. The real debate will never be held, not in committee or in the House of Commons because we do not hear witnesses here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives way of handling this matter here in the House of Commons with this bill is very disappointing. In the previous session, before the Conservative government prorogued the House, that was not what the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities decided. There was a unanimous resolution in committee, which I will repeat so that everyone is clear, to the effect that Canada Post must not go any further and must end its dispute with the remailers so that no one would lose their job, until a full review of the situation had been done. This review was not done and will not be done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is so limited that all we can say is whether we are for or against having remailers distribute letters outside Canada. I maintain that this risks upsetting the balance of the postal service across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that point, the Bloc Québécois will do everything in its power to shed light on this. We cannot allow the government, the Conservatives and the Liberals, to do this without putting up a fight to make people understand that this bill threatens public services. That is what we are going to do. You can count on the Bloc Québécois. Quebeckers who elected a Bloc majority in Quebec will be glad they have the Bloc Québécois to defend their points of view.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing rosy about this. Always saying yes to private companies, the way the Conservatives do, is very worrisome. We think it is also important to protect the service in all the regions of Canada. Quebec covers a lot of territory and the people in the rural areas are just as entitled as people in urban centres, to home delivery service. In the big cities, you get home delivery service and no one is jealous of that. You probably deserve it. You pay your taxes. Nonetheless, people in rural communities are also entitled to their service and mail delivery at home because they too pay their taxes. They are the equals of city dwellers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, the Bloc Québécois will never tire of debating this injustice being perpetrated even as we speak. I repeat, Mr. Speaker, if you ask all those in charge of safety at Canada Post, they will tell you that, in rural areas, mail service will be reduced by 30% once the safety analyses have been completed. They are not proposing to change delivery vehicles to ones that are smaller and can drive on the shoulder of the road, as in the United States. No, not at all. They are not talking about that; it is too expensive. I understand that, because with this bill they will lose potential revenue or even lose money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must understand why Canada Post decided to take remailers to court. Is it because the problem is growing and their share of the market will double, triple or quadruple in 10 or 12 years? Will Canada Post be cannibalized by these companies? No one in government is asking this question. The matter has already been settled. The bill has already been tabled and it has been decreed that we have to deal with the remailers. We will never know.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, this is very worrisome for the rural postal service. The Bloc Québécois will always support the equity of all regions, whether urban or rural. We will never rise in this House to jeopardize the service provided to citizens, whether they live in rural areas—as I was saying earlier—or in urban areas. Quebeckers and Canadians work hard and are entitled to residential postal service, whether they live in rural or urban areas. The Bloc Québécois will always be there to defend them.</div>

I very much appreciated working with him on the transport committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows full well that the issue of the remailers was actually discussed at committee on a number of occasions. In fact, we even had witnesses before our committee who testified about the impact that this particular industry would have on Canada Post. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a lot of discussion over this issue, and the hon. member also knows that this bill, when it is passed at second reading, will end up going back to committee where he will be able to make all the arguments and say whether his party is for or against this particular bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the hon. member over-complicates the matter. I will read the actual legislation itself. It basically refers to section 15 of the Canada Post Corporation Act being amended by adding the following:</div>
    </p><a name="Para775439"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The exclusive privilege referred to in subsection 14(1) does not apply to letters intended for delivery to an addressee outside Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para775440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is a very simple question and a very straightforward issue: Should remailers continue to be allowed to do business in Canada?</div>
    </p><a name="Para775441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do take issue with the hon. member's characterization of $50 million per year being taken away from Canada Post. In fact, he knows that is not true. The truth is that the $50 million has never been received by Canada Post because remailers have been doing business for some 20 years in Canada and continue to this very day to do business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the hon. member is, how can he claim that Canada Post is losing and will lose $50 million, or whatever the amount is, every year, when in fact it has never received that money?</div>

Why did Canada Post decide to take the matter to court? Because the market was growing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to hear the member say that Canada Post's bottom line will not be affected. The reason Canada Post took these businesses to court is that the market was growing and it was time to clarify the situation. I do not mind if our colleague trumpets his bill, but it is only three lines long, which means that it cannot be improved. Either one is for it or one is against it. That is what I do not like about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is on the committee. He knew full well what we wanted to do, which was to conduct a thorough study before suggesting legislative amendments. He said that we heard a lot of witnesses, but I would point out that not even Canada Post employees were able to appear before the committee. As he may recall, we were unable to call employees before the committee at the same time as the president because they were negotiating collective agreements in other areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study was not a thorough one, even though the committee recommended it unanimously. Canada Post was asked to drop its case until a thorough study could be completed. That is not what the Conservatives decided to do. They introduced a bill that, I agree with the member, is not long. One either supports this bill or one does not. That way, the Conservatives can avoid the whole debate, and we will never know the whole story. Once again, that is the Conservatives' modus operandi in government.</div>

As he will recall, I was very much involved in the discussions in committee. Furthermore, there were a great many motions and procedures. In the end, it all led to a rather lively exchange of ideas, from which resulted a resolution that was unanimously passed by the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as indicated by my hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78639,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78639&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel</A>, this unanimous resolution recognized Canada Post's exclusive privilege and asked it to stop its litigation in order to consider other possibilities through which Canada Post could continue to exercise its exclusive privilege while somehow compromising with remailers. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have major concerns about the bill as it was introduced, I would like to inform the House that I was one of the people who believed that Canada Post's exclusive privilege should not be tampered with. To attack it, infringe on it, chip away at it and lessen it, as this bill seeks to do, would truly be a first step towards something that, in my opinion, we do not want to do. Indeed, we are sinking into something that greatly concerns me, in part, because of some of the reasons indicated by my colleague.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have a question for the member, but since I participated in the discussions in committee, I would also like to set the record straight: we were able to reach this unanimous consent only because the two concepts were taboo. We respect the exclusive privilege, but we are calling on Canada Post to stop its legal actions and learn to compromise with the remailers. This is not at all what the government is doing at this time. On the contrary, it decided to cut off the discussion, in a way that I personally hope to be able to comment on during the debate and that poses considerable problems for me. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, that was the thrust of the discussions. Once again, I am disappointed that the government has introduced this bill that does not give us a choice. It cannot be improved. That is what I find frustrating. Had we been able to improve it, we might have been able to come to an agreement. The way in which it is drafted only allows us to be either for or against it. With only three lines, it is impossible to add a paragraph. The law clerks would find it not receivable.

    </p><a name="Para775468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP believes that prior to even getting to the point of whether we agree with the bill or not, there ought to be a follow through on the commitment to do a review of the entire mandate of Canada Post. Then we would have a better idea of how this fits into what we collectively expect from Canada Post going forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a shame that is not happening. I suppose it is possible there is a good reason why it is not happening. The government may not like the way it looks in the context of a mandate that has just been reviewed, but I will leave that where it is. We will continue to push for this mandate and we will continue to oppose the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot seem to find anything on what Canada Post has to say about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086132,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086132&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A>. I can only hope Canada Post is not being gagged. I hope very soon, either at the end of today or tomorrow at the latest, we will get some idea of what one of the largest crown corporations in our nation has to say about a bill, a bill that goes directly to the heart of its ability to raise revenue and meet the mandate given to it by Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember, as we go through this whole discussion, that Canada Post, in addition to the services outlined in the legislation, has also been mandated to raise revenue on a self-sufficient basis. In other words, Canada Post cannot come back to Parliament and ask for money. It has a good enough service and product that it should be able to raise enough money through revenue to pay for all the costs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember that we have one of the lowest universal letter rates in all the industrialized world. Canada is the second largest country, land mass wise, in the world. That is a pretty good achievement. For all the kicks that everybody likes to take at Canada Post from time to time, for whatever reason, at the end of the day that is a pretty good accomplishment. Canada Post is raising revenue without running a deficit. It is not coming here and asking for money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absolute key to Canada Post being able to provide a service that is recognized around the world and serves the needs of Canadians at a cost that they can afford is the whole notion of the exclusive privilege. It either has an exclusive privilege or it does not. The government wants to have it both ways. It does, but maybe not everywhere: Conservative government, public service, money to be made. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the NDP and the Conservatives start walking down a different road. Our sense is the reason the government is doing this is part ideology. The Conservatives do not like public services. If there is a dime to be made, one of their buddies ought to make it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of what is best for the public interest does not appear on a balance sheet. It does appear in a crown corporation, but it does not in private enterprise and nobody suggests it should. The Conservatives want this business because there is money to be made. That is the only reason, and from all accounts, there will be more and more money to be made each year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a situation where some private enterprises have started to do work that is exclusively the mandate of a crown corporation. Whatever happened to the law and order party in our country? Under other circumstances, if people broke the law, flagrantly no less, and went ahead and started conducting business that was the rightful business of somebody else, the Conservatives would be holding them to account. They would go after them because they broke the law according to the Conservatives. They would be considered a law-breaker of the whole nine yards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we see in this case? The Conservatives are going to change the law because there is lots of money to be made so law-breakers are now complying with the law. That is a pretty good trick if someone can get them to do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at some of the meat in the legislation. I agree with my Bloc colleague that one cannot believe for a minute that just because it is a small bill, and it really is, it somehow will not have a major impact. This is a smooth process. They are not allowed to do something by law. They go ahead and start to do it. The people who have the exclusive right to do what they are doing call them on it and they keep doing it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I understand, Canada Post spent a few years working with the Universal Postal Union trying to come up with a way to square the circle in terms of what that organization represented and the law, which gives the exclusive right and privilege to Canada Post. It did not work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Canada Post said that it would go to court to make it very clear that the work done by the private companies encroached on business that was the lawful mandate of Canada Post. Canada Post won. These corporations, I guess because they care so much about public service and the delivery of mail, appealed it. They lost again.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting what the judges said in this case. Justice MacFarland, who wrote on behalf of a three judge panel that ruled unanimously, said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new challenge that we face as a country. Because of our values, we believe Canadians, no matter where they live in the country, should be able to find, with reasonable closeness, a reasonable facsimile to the services they would enjoy anywhere else in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we achieve that wholly? No, we do not. We can ask anybody. Ask my friend from Sault Ste. Marie whether the health services are the same in Sault Ste. Marie as they are in Toronto. Notwithstanding the difficulties in Toronto, they are that much greater in Sault Ste. Marie. Why? Because it has a smaller population and it is spread out so far.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not even begun to talk about the territories and the extremities of the country. It is a massive country. We believe that things like health care, transportation services, environmental protection and other government services should, as much as possible, be the same, or at least as close as one can reasonably get, never backing away from pushing to get there. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, we do not have to go all that far even in my own province. There are a lot of rural areas just outside Hamilton. If we based our profit margin, as a postal service, on the amount of business that came out those small areas, they would not get any. They would be an afterthought, but that is not the case right now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the same price, we can mail a letter or a package from anywhere in Canada to anywhere in Canada at a reasonable rate. Why? Because the exclusive privilege allows the post office to take profit from parts of its service, which allows it to offset the cost to provide, as close as it can, the same service in rural areas as we get in downtown Toronto. Again, in the second largest country in the world, that is not an easy feat. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is proposed in the legislation will water down the ability of Canada Post to do that. Some might say that it is not doing the work at all right now. As I understand it, that is not factually correct. Some of the work is being done by Canada Post. Some of it is being done by people who should not be doing it. It is unlawful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are running a surplus right now. Overall, not in manufacturing but in many other areas of the economy, things are not going too badly. Profits are being made.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about tomorrow? What about next year? What about in five years, in ten years? Once we begin down the slippery slope of eating away at exclusive privilege we undermine the ability of Canada Post to provide the world class service that it does.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is that simple. That is why we ought to be reviewing the mandate. If we do not want it to do that, then let us stop kidding ourselves and build a whole different kind of post office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not really about whether we believe in privatized services, whether we believe in the private sector or the public sector and which one should be bigger, more important, first dibs on it. Really that is not the issue. It is a side issue. Really what is in front of us is the issue of how we want to handle postal services in Canada. If we want to continue them along the same vein that we have started, then we need to make sure Canada Post has the means to do it. It is that simple.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly do not know of any commercial entity that wants to take over rural postal services only, or other aspects of delivering anything in Canada that is difficult, not to mention our weather. No. There is big money in it and that is why big money was prepared to hire high-priced lawyers to go to court to try to get it ripped open. When that did not work, they looked up at the sky, counted all their lucky stars and said, “We have a Conservative government in power. Let's just get the law changed”, and here we are with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3086132,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3086132&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might as well say that where Canada Post has a chance to make a decent buck, we are going to privatize it, because that is what is going on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Conservatives are going to jump up and flail their arms and say, “This is not privatization. No, no. This is its sibling deregulation”. It is the same thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775499"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake, if this bill passes today and we keep a like-minded government in power--and I cannot say anything about the official opposition; I have heard two speakers and they both took each side of the issue, which is pretty traditional so far, so it is hard to say whether this could only happen with the Conservatives. The Liberals are close enough that they may get what they want from either one. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is if they win this, why would they not be back for more? Why not sit back in the boardroom and say, “Okay. Here is how this works. Let's find out other profitable areas of Canada Post and start doing it. When Canada Post gets upset, we will not even have to take it to court this time. We'll just go straight to the government and the government will stand up and say, 'Why are you doing this to these poor small businesses?'”</div>
    </p><a name="Para775501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, a lot of these poor small businesses have a huge global reach. This is big money. It reminds me a bit of WSIB, workers compensation in Ontario, where the private insurance companies are still standing outside the borders of the province drooling at the prospect of getting their mitts on all that money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this works, why not identify something else, go through the whole process again and eventually water it down to the point where we are in this place one day where there is an attack on the fact that Canada Post is running a deficit. Then they will go looking for scapegoats. And then what? My good friend from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78922,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78922&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Ottawa Centre</A> asked, “Then what?” That is exactly the right question. If Canada Post starts running a deficit, either this place starts to give it money that we have not had to do before because that profit is now not in the pockets of Canadians through the public service, it is in private pockets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear one of the members heckling and asking “Is that bad?” I would say it is bad when either the cost of stamps and postal services goes up, taxes are increased to provide the subsidy or cut the service. Those are the options. I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, with regard to what the hon. member said, that yes, it is bad.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para775504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe if I were lying on a nice deck chair on a great big yacht somewhere being taken care of by those who got all that money, I might feel differently. But as somebody who cares about postal service in Canada and is here to fight for the rights of ordinary Canadians, this is the structure that works.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not even have the guts to say that it was going to change the mandate. No, it takes away the financial means to achieve the mandate. It is deceitful in some ways, if that term is allowed to stand, and it seems that it might be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sham being perpetrated here. We hear the argument that we are picking on people and why would we do this when it is already being done and all this stuff that suggests it is not a big deal and not to get all upset, that this is just the Bloc and the NDP fighting for those working people again or public services. At least some of the Liberals are saying that. I am waiting to get clarification of exactly where they are, so I will not comment. It does not really matter anyway, because they do not vote. They are just a debating society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read something in support of this notion about the slippery slope. Either we leave the exclusive privilege in place in its entirety or we say, no, revamp the mandate and build something completely different. It is one or the other. I agree with my Bloc colleague when he said that this is a vote up or down; there is no mitigating, no amendments, we either believe in this or we do not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what was said in a report 11 years ago, the last time there was a Canada Post mandate review: “Removal of the exclusive privilege would be tantamount, in effect, to tossing Canada's postal system up into the air, allowing it to smash into a random assortment of pieces, and hoping that those pieces would somehow rearrange themselves into a coherent whole that was better or at least as good as the current system”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time Canada Post did not seem to have as much difficulty finding its voice and it said that for as long as it is the public policy of Canada to provide universal letter service at uniform rates, it will be necessary to maintain the limited exclusive privilege for letters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what this is about. This is about legitimizing and legalizing something that is currently outside the law. It is no different from Microsoft, or Disney, or any other big player. Canada Post is protecting its revenue stream, its market. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why on earth would we tinker with a system that for the most part serves Canadians well and does not cost Canadian taxpayers anything beyond the money it costs them to buy the service at the postal station? Why would we mess with that? Why would we tinker with it? There is only one reason and this is my opinion. I am saying this in here, and this is pure speculation, but it is my right to say it and I am going to. It looks an awful lot to me like these private entities could not win in the courts, so they did the lobbying routine, lobbied the government and now the government is prepared to do their bidding to legalize tomorrow what is today illegal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be interested to hear better arguments, particularly from my friend over in the corner who has his laptop and I am sure that all the information is being fed from central command about what his questions to me are going to be and how he is going to attack those wild-eyed New Democrats again. I await that moment, but what I await more than anything is the remote possibility that they might come up with an argument that actually holds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not give us this stuff that we do not care about those private sector jobs. Of course we do. </div>

    </p><a name="Para775556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also raised the issue that some of the candidates for the Conservative government in the 2006 election, and who had participated in this in-and-out electoral scam or scheme, have since been appointed to important posts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House leader of the government answered that the Conservative Party and the Conservative government had done no wrong, that they always follow the law and they have in the past and will in the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not what Elections Canada has said. Elections Canada has discounted and disallowed rebate requests from Conservative candidates on the basis that some of their expenses did not in fact follow the law, and were not made in order to pay for a local campaign and enhance the visibility of the local candidate in his or her own campaign.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House leader of the government also did not answer the question regarding the number of these individuals who have since been appointed to important posts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a couple of examples.

What is interesting is that the minister herself participated in this electoral financing in-and-out scheme.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party is currently under investigation by Elections Canada for allegedly funnelling over $1.2 million in national advertising costs to regional candidates during the 2006 federal election in order to circumvent federal election spending limits. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections Canada itself, not the Liberal Party, not the Bloc, not the NDP and not the media, has rejected advertising expenses filed by 66 Conservative candidates because Elections Canada has determined they did not comply with election law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, in September, the Liberals released the names along with financial details concerning 129 former Conservative candidates and official agents who were named as participants in this apparent scheme to violate spending limits and pad candidate rebates.</div>

The only party that Elections Canada has ruled that certain expenses were not admissible, that violated the Canada Elections Act, was the Conservative Party. It was only the Conservative Party, not the Liberal Party, not the Bloc Québécois, not the NDP. That is my first point.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that the member does not know his geography very well.

    </p><a name="Para775581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 24, I had asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A> to protect Canadian jobs and to stand up for our auto industry. Not only did the minister not answer my question, which is not an always unusual thing around here, but he accused an important workers group of engaging in “fraudulent economics”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That group was an organized union group that was visiting and talking with all members of Parliament. They had a lot of statistics and I have not been able to find any of them that were fraudulent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stressed that the minority Conservative government should never sign a deal that fails to eliminate non-tariff barriers. It is an issue that is important to many of us in the House. The minister replied by saying, “We clearly are focused on non-tariff barriers”. Then he said, “We are focused on tariff barriers”. Which is it? </div>
    </p><a name="Para775584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rubbish answer is clearly not acceptable to Canadians who are trying to understand exactly what this process is and how important these deals are, how the auto industry is extremely important and how the deal with South Korea is an extremely important one for our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manufacturing industry is in crisis and our auto industry is clearly being hit very hard, yet the government continues to negotiate a flawed free trade deal with South Korea that is bad for the auto industry and bad for Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of jobs have been lost this year and more will be lost under this proposed agreement. Hence the reason that we are concerned about exactly what is in the deal and whether or not it will come to Parliament, so that all of us can have our chance to comment on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two weeks ago, Chrysler announced it will eliminate about 1,100 jobs in Brampton as part of its second restructuring in eight months. Since one job in the auto industry results in up to 7,000 spin-off jobs, those are major losses in Ontario and throughout Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minority Conservative government is selling out the auto industry in its free trade agreement negotiations with South Korea. The agreement is so dangerous as it does not provide fair access to the lucrative South Korean market. It is something that we all share. We want a free trade deal, but we want a fair deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to improve our free trade agreement, we must first ensure that the minister and his negotiators have secured an agreement with South Korea that allows Canada's auto industry access to South Korean's large auto market. That is what a free trade deal is supposed to be doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party wants to make certain that any free trade agreement with South Korea contains mechanisms that will actually result in a free and fair deal. The minority Conservative government has refused to have a debate in Parliament on this critical issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our responsibility as parliamentarians on all sides of this House means that we are better off not striking a deal at all if we are not going to strike one that is good for Canada. We must ensure that any potential South Korean free trade agreement is in the best interests of all Canadians. It is critical that the Canadian industry and workers see positive results rather than the continued attack on the domestic industry that has been the result of so many of the Conservative policies.</div>

    </p><a name="Para775593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must remind the hon. member that it was the former Liberal government that initiated the free trade discussions with Korea. Therefore, I am surprised that the hon. member is not more up to speed on what the negotiation process is all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these negotiations were launched in 2005, a free trade agreement with Korea has been a trade policy priority for Canada, and for very good reason. After all, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that Canadian businesses can compete in international markets, including important strategic markets like Korea, Canada's seventh largest trading partner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before launching negotiations, the government conducted comprehensive consultations with the provinces, territories, the Canadian public, businesses and non-governmental organizations. These consultations revealed broad support for an FTA with Korea. </div>
    </p><a name="Para775596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also revealed that beyond the elimination of tariffs and an improved environment in Korea for Canada's service providers and investors, Canadian businesses wanted the FTA to address non-tariff barriers in Korea's markets. That is why, in the FTA negotiations with Korea, Canada is seeking the most extensive, robust, state of the art provisions we have ever sought in an FTA with respect to non-tariff barriers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is especially aware of the concerns expressed by the Canadian auto industry about Korea's automotive market. That is why Canada is also seeking an array of auto provisions to address specific non-tariff measures identified by the Canadian industry and to establish procedural mechanisms to identify and address potential new non-tariff barriers before they arise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond non-tariff barriers, of course Canada is seeking an ambitious FTA package on tariffs, services, investment and government procurement, to name some key areas. An FTA with Korea would eliminate all industrial tariffs, including Korea's 8% tariff on automobiles and auto parts. Korea is Canada's fifth largest destination for exports of agricultural products, so elimination of Korea's high tariffs, average applied tariffs of 52.6%, with over quota rates at 800%, will significantly improve Canadian market access in Korea.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that an ambitious FTA would offer gains for Canadians across the country in sectors as diverse as agriculture, agrifood, fisheries, forestry, machinery and equipment, other manufactured products, and financial and professional services. Results from preliminary economic modelling suggests that an FTA with Korea could increase Canada's total merchandise exports to that country by 56%, or $1.6 billion.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's competitors are moving forward with Korea. The U.S. signed an FTA with Korea in June. At the same time, the EU is moving rapidly toward the conclusion of its own FTA with Korea, and Korea is negotiating or actively exploring FTA negotiations with the likes of Japan, Mexico, China, India and others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para775601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada cannot afford to stand on the sidelines while other countries move ahead to take advantage of the globalization and the economic dynamism in Asia. We must recall that one in five jobs in Canada is supported by trade. To remain competitive, we must ensure Canadian businesses can compete in international markets, including Korea.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government can have all the negotiations it wants but it is like the softwood lumber negotiations.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working closely with Canadians and industry to ensure that an FTA with Korea results in meaningful market access for Canadian exporters and real benefits for Canadians.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the hon. member that the FTA provisions that Canada is seeking are non-tariff barriers and, in particular, with respect to autos, go far beyond what we have ever sought before in an FTA negotiation.</div>
