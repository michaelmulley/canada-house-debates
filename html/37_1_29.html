leave to introduce Bill C-300, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(wearing of war decorations). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to present the 
bill.  It has taken four years of development.  The process was 
very lengthy because of the involvement of a great number of 
players at various levels, from the highest level to the 
community level, in composing, rectifying and making the 
necessary changes to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill insofar as intent is concerned is very similar to 
one that was presented earlier this week in the House. However 
the legislative legal clerks of the House of Commons have 
indicated that the bill I am presenting is far more comprehensive 
and all encompassing and has some very unique characteristics. 
Therefore I am presenting it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to allow relatives of deceased

prescribed by cabinet, any order, decoration or medal listed in 
the Canadian orders, declaration and medals directive of October 
25, 1990, that is awarded to such veterans for war services, 
without facing criminal sanctions.

petition pertaining to the restoration of VIA service from 
Toronto through to Sudbury along the beautiful north shores of 
Lake Superior, through Thunder Bay, Kenora and Dryden, and on to 
Winnipeg on the CPR line.  Those communities where the vast 
majority of people in northwestern Ontario live do not have 
railway passenger service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am presenting hundreds and hundreds of signatures from a 
variety of communities along the north shore of Lake Superior, as 
well as Thunder Bay.  They are asking the Canadian government to 
work in a co-operative spirit with VIA and CPR to reintroduce 
passenger service along that line as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour to move a 
motion in the House today calling on it to take a stand in the 
dispute over lumber between the industries in Canada and The 
United States 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House support the government's will in its efforts to 
restore free trade agreement rules for lumber and inform the 
United States that it rejects any obstacle to that free trade 
process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bringing forward this motion through me, the Bloc Quebecois 
is once again acting as the defender of the rights of Quebec. 
However, in the case of lumber, and in this rare instance, it is 
clear that the interests of Quebec and of Canada converge, as we 
face our American partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 1, at the end of the current agreement, free trade in 
this sector must be reinstated.  Part of the U.S. lumber industry 
must stop its harassment 
of the lumber industry in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, some 130,000 jobs are linked to the lumber industry. 
In Quebec, the figure is over 30,000.  Quebec is the second 
largest producer of lumber in Canada, with 25.5% of production.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec produces approximately 7 billion board feet annually. 
The industry injects over $4 billion a year into the Quebec 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lumber industry is found in various regions of Quebec 
Over 250 Quebec municipalities have sprung up around wood 
processing.  In some of these municipalities, all of the jobs 
are related to this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues will have an opportunity today to speak of this 
industry's importance to the development of jobs and the economy 
in their riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. market is a major outlet, as 51.4% of Quebec exports go 
to the United States, while 47.6% of U.S. products are exported 
to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of Quebec exports to the United States is about $2 
billion annually, while the total value of Canadian lumber 
exports to the United States is $10 to $11 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly illustrates how important this industry is and how 
important it is to revert to a normal free trade situation with 
the Americans, as provided for in the North American free trade 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members certainly know that the U.S. industry, or a part of the 
U.S. lumber industry, has long been complaining about 
competition from the Canadian industry. The dispute has been 
going on for almost 20 years. 
In fact, we have to go back to 1982 to see the first forms of 
harassment by the U.S. industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time complaints have been filed, Canadian and Quebec 
producers have been able to demonstrate that there were no 
subsidies in Canada and any of the Canadian provinces, and that 
their trade practices were fully in accordance with the 
agreements with our American neighbours and with multilateral 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that once again the Canadian industry will be 
able to demonstrate that it is not subsidized, that the logging 
price is established according to market rules and that there is 
dumping whatsoever. We should not delude ourselves. The 1996 
Canada-U.S.A. softwood lumber agreement had no foundation as far 
as trade practices are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec producers paid a countervailing duty of 6.51%, yet they 
were not subsidized. Quebec exporters who are not subsidized 
bore the cost of quotas, yet they should have been exempted. All 
in all, duties of more than 16% were unjustly collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we realize today that we would be better off appealing 
to various tribunals than making a deal that needlessly puts 
Canada and Quebec at a disadvantage, particularly since the 
World Trade Organization now has rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 11, for example, Canadian and Quebec lumber 
producers won another battle, when the World Trade Organization 
accepted Canada's request to create a select panel to examine 
the legality of the U.S. position on the countervailing duty 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this House we all know that for the U.S. industry 
subsidies and the Canadian industry are not the problem. The 
problem is that the U.S. industry has not invested much to renew 
its technology and organizational practices, while the Canadian 
industry generally made major investments. This is the only 
reason the U.S. industry is less competitive than the Canadian 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus in the Canadian industry is that we should simply 
return to free trade for lumber. The industry expects, and 
rightly so, that the Canadian government will support it in this 
regard. The Bloc Quebecois has tried repeatedly to ensure that 
the federal government is supporting this consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that at times we have felt the Minister for 
International Trade was being soft.  On February 22, during the 
same question period, the minister spoke twice about a 
transition toward free trade.  I remind the House that this was 
on February 22. To a question from the Canadian Alliance, the 
minister replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the matter is how we will live the transition toward free 
trade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the same day the minister answered the following to a question 
from the Bloc Quebecois: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that we will have a smooth transition to free trade. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is talk of a transition, I think we can reasonably 
assume that there will be some transitional measures, something 
both our party and the industry oppose.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following day, on February 23, the parliamentary secretary 
talked about returning to free trade in the long term.  The Bloc 
Quebecois asked a question and this is what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long range goal of Canada is very clear in softwood lumber. 
It is to have free trade in softwood lumber with the United 
States. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they start talking about transitional measures and about a 
long range goal, I think there is reason for concern about the 
firmness of the government's position on returning to pure and 
simple free trade in softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the statement made yesterday by the Prime 
Minister in response to a question from the Bloc Quebecois has 
clarified, definitively I hope, the position of the federal 
government: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[—]we have a free trade agreement and we want the Americans to 
comply with it as regards lumber. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is time now for all members of all parties in the 
House to speak out, not only in support of the position of the 
government, the Prime Minister and the industry, but also to let 
the Americans know that we will not allow ourselves to be 
intimidated by the harassment of one part of the lumber 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The necessity for MPs to speak out in this House is all the 
greater since the announcement a few days ago by U.S. Senators 
and members of the house of representatives of their support for 
the portion of their lumber industry that is continuing to 
harass the Canadian industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore calling upon all members of all parties to join 
forces with the industry by adopting the motion I am introducing 
this morning. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by saying that I 
agree 100% with what the member from the Bloc said, except, of 
course, in his references to Canada and Quebec.  The last time I 
looked, Quebec was still part of Canada.  We welcome it to stay, 
by the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western producers, particularly in the provinces of B.C. and 
Alberta which is my domain, because of quota restrictions to 
small and medium sized mills, were able to cut far more than 
their quota would allow.  The end result, because of the extra 
wood, was they had to basically sell at a bargain basement price 
to domestic users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell me what it was like in the province of 
Quebec with the domestic mills?  Did they have a surplus of wood 
which they had to dump on their own domestic market, thus driving 
the price of lumber down?  Was it the same situation there as it 
was out in B.C.? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and the support I sensed behind it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the entire American industry is experiencing a 
depression in softwood lumber prices.  One of the reasons for 
this is that since our access to the American market is limited, 
our domestic supply is too great, particularly since there has 
been a general increase in the North American production 
capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that a lumber industry has developed in 
the southern United States as a replacement for the Canadian 
industry.  In my opinion, a very important factor in the drop in 
lumber prices is the fact that there is a downturn in the United 
States, and there is a risk of its spreading to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore extremely important that the rules of free trade 
be restored effective April 1 to the softwood lumber industry, 
so that pricing will reflect market realities and not the ideas 
of certain American producers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my riding of Sault Ste. Marie is one riding which relies 
heavily on softwood lumber.  It is partly a resources based 
economy.  What I have to say applies to the other cities which 
comprise the region of northern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Softwood lumber is very important to that region and, indeed, it 
is important to the country.  I thank the member for his 
excellent representations and indicate that this motion is likely 
to have very strong support.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is softwood lumber so important?  Why is this one of the 
most important trade issues that the country faces?  I will tell 
the House why.  Softwood lumber is Canada's largest industry.  It 
is an important issue because one in sixteen Canadians work in 
the forest sector.  It is important because 337 communities are 
more than 50% dependent on forestry for economic survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important because Canada has 20% of the world market and 
34% of the United States market.  Goods worth $10.7 billion were 
exported to the United States market in 1999 alone. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the hon. 
member is supporting the motion. It is important that everything 
be extremely clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the commercial practices of Canada or one of the 
Canadian provinces, there is no reason for countervailing 
duties. That is why all members should be supportive of this 
industry, which is extremely important, like the hon. member 
said. We will have the opportunity to vote on this motion, and I 
encourage members of all parties to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on the motion by my hon. colleague. 
The Charlevoix riding depends largely on the development of the 
Charlevoix and north shore forests. In Quebec we have more than 
30,000 workers in the forest industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us during this opposition day will no doubt 
get the unanimous support of the government and opposition 
parties. All regions of Canada, the ten provinces and two 
territories, have a forest industry producing lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our forest is a natural resource on which many workers depend 
for employment. In the past these workers were often referred 
to as lumberjacks and considered as second class workers. Today 
we have to make a special effort to recruit and train people to 
work in our forestry industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion and the amendment must receive the approval of the 
House of Commons in the vote to come because it is vital for our 
economy. We accepted the free trade agreement in Canada. 
This agreement has had advantages but also disadvantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was on the agenda of a meeting between the Canadian 
Prime Minister and the U.S. president. They discussed free trade 
in softwood lumber. I hope that discussion was preparing the way 
for the summit of the Americas to be held in Quebec City, where 
free trade in softwood lumber, among other things, will be 
discussed thoroughly and extensively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they limit Canada's trade in softwood lumber on 
international markets by imposing quotas on Canadian and Quebec 
lumber producers? We have a high quality product, and we have 
the workers and resources necessary. 
The U.S. senate and even Americans in general were afraid that 
we might flood their market because Canadian softwood lumber is 
produced in larger volumes and at a better cost. That is when 
they introduced quotas. They said to Canada: “This is your 
yearly quota”. I think it was in the 1996 agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough in the free trade agreement the United States 
accepted that Canada export as much electricity and agricultural 
products as they wanted to meet their needs. However, if we 
consider another product traded under the free trade agreement, 
textile for example, we find that the FTA was not so good for us 
in Quebec, especially in Montreal. As we know, immediately after 
we opened up our market to textiles from other countries under 
FTA several productive textile firms in Montreal went belly up.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have done like the U.S. and say that we would allow 
imports to Quebec and Canada once we have taken stock of our 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forest products like softwood lumber come from natural 
resources. Why are we penalizing the softwood lumber industry 
and not the mining companies, for instance, or those who produce 
iron on the north shore? It is because we know that there is a demand 
for the iron produced on the north shore, that the doors are 
already wide open and that we need this product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Softwood lumber producers are overregulated and 
overlegislated. Even before they can access the international 
market lumber producers in Quebec and Canada have obligations to 
fulfil. They have to worry about the environment. Clear-cutting 
is no longer an option and forest workers have stopped 
harvesting without worrying about the impact of their 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lumber producers must learn to share the resources. They must 
work in partnership with the people who live on the land they 
want to develop. They also have to work with native communities 
who have some land reserved to them. They have to take into 
account resort areas in some parts of the country and even 
protected areas in parks near rivers and lakes, as well as areas 
where the department of energy and resources has set quotas. 
They must live and work in partnership with the aboriginal 
communities and the people they share the land with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note that we no longer do clear cutting but rather a very 
selective type of logging in order to promote forest 
regeneration. Moreover, considering our climate and the rugged 
terrain in certain areas where it is not easy for the producer 
to harvest lumber using very specialised equipment, we must make 
sure this regeneration is possible. I will indicate you in a moment 
about the cost of lumber on the international market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also often at its expense the logging industry must build access 
roads which are used as well by vacationers and others who use 
the land. Lumber producers must also meet environmental 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is well known that lumber producers get their licences 
or logging quotas after a feasibility and yield study has been 
made. They must also determine how the lumber will be harvested 
and moved. Will noise or water pollution standards be met? 
Likewise studies will be made on the habitat of the moose, deer 
and other species living on the land. Their habitats are in 
these forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lumber producers must also conform to the Canadian legislation 
regarding the quota system as well as to the provincial 
legislation. 
In Quebec, as in other provinces, there are quotas for 
exporting, harvesting and renewal.  This causes certain 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However if we want the resource to be there for the next 50 or 100 
years, we must make sure that it is harvested in a civilized 
manner and that it is allowed to grow back.  With our climate on 
the north shore, a spruce tree planted in 2001 cannot be 
harvested in 2010 when it has reached a diameter of six inches. 
It will be another generation, maybe two, after us that will 
reap the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Account must also be taken of the cost to producers of 
transportation.  The more we log, the more the forest recedes, 
and the further the lumber must be transported.  In addition to 
the costs of transportation and logging, there are processing 
costs.  Recently there has been a terrible increase in the 
price of diesel and gasoline, 
but truckers have not been compensated by the mills or the 
producers.  These are often individual operators with a firm 
contract who have had to absorb the increase in gasoline and 
diesel prices.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also the roads, which often deteriorate during frosts 
and thaws and which have weight restrictions.  At this time of 
the year the trucks are either half full or half empty, 
depending on whether one is an optimist or a pessimist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration must also be given to the costs of processing, 
investment, equipment and manpower training.  Today logging 
requires more than a saw and an axe. It requires specialized 
equipment and very expensive tools.  In my riding there are 
more than six sawmills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes difficult to see the forest for the trees. 
We are asking the Prime Minister, at the summit of the Americas, 
to allow Quebecers to have free trade and to maintain their 
position on the logging and processing of softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I wish to move an amendment.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK42">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the word “process” 
the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“for example the establishment of quotas or tariff barriers.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> The amendment is in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the Bloc for 
their presentations and the motion this morning.  I would make a 
comment and ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition members are free traders and agree that 
the government should make every effort to secure free trade in 
softwood lumber and resist the U.S. protectionist interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that western Canadians have supported free trade 
since prior to confederation, but it was central Canada that 
supported protectionism.  It was only when Quebec business 
interests persuaded Mr. Mulroney to pursue the free trade 
agreement that we got the free trade with which the motion deals. 
I might say there was a strategic alliance between Quebecers and 
western Canadians to secure free trade which makes this motion 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To win any trade dispute with the Americans, is it not true that 
Canadian producers need to hang together, that Canadian provinces 
need to hang together and that Canada needs to hang together? 
Does the member not believe that the bargaining power of a united 
Canada with the United States is greater than the bargaining 
power of a separate Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that the 
Canadian Alliance will support the amendment and the motion to 
allow the free trade of a product such as lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as Quebec remains part of the Canadian federation, as 
long as Quebecers continue to be dependent on the goods and 
services tax and on personal income taxes, we must work as one 
to let foreign countries know that Canadian products are good. 
These issues are not mutually exclusive.

I am not sure that they have adequately protected Quebec's 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Joliette in his capacity as the Bloc 
Quebecois critic on international issues is using this 
opposition day to propose a motion, it is because Quebecers are 
once again adversely affected by the free trade agreement that 
the federal government negotiated while allowing them to impose 
quotas on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is most affected? Quebec for one and Quebecers. 
Bloc Quebecois members represent Quebecers and wish to take 
advantage of this opposition day and say “As long as we are in 
this situation, we will be asking the government and the Prime 
Minister to be our spokespersons at the Summit of the Americas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also asking them to have the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
negotiate so that lumber is recognized in the free trade 
agreement and so that we are not adversely affected by quotas. 
However these two issues would not be mutually exclusive.

harvested in a civilized way.  We would all agree with that 
comment.  That is certainly the case in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in forestry management practices.  It

remarks, I would have had much more to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Softwood lumber is a chief resource of the north shore and the 
Charlevoix area, and many workers draw their income from it. The 
generations that preceded us also drew the bulk of their income 
from forestry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are talking about civilized wood cutting today, it is 
because at one point in time logging companies were given 
access to the forest and allowed to do whatever they wanted with 
it. Today we are talking about selective cutting and the need 
to protect habitats and the environment, and there is a better 
framework for operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member certainly noticed, like me, that we have had 
uncontrolled forest harvesting because clear cutting was

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address the House 
today on a matter of great importance to all Canadians.  I say to 
all Canadians that the softwood lumber business is Canada's 
largest industry, as has been noted by one of my colleagues, and 
that it touches people in every province, including the province 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in sixteen Canadians work in the forest sector and hundreds 
of communities across Canada rely on forestry for their economic 
survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A healthy lumber industry is critical for Canada.  To guarantee 
the health of our industry we need access to our largest market. 
The United States is by far our largest market.  Canadian exports 
account for one-third of the U.S. softwood lumber market.  That 
33% share is the crux of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the softwood lumber agreement due to expire on March 31, it 
is very important to shed some light on what is really behind the 
United States' position in this longstanding dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear on this.  The United States' position on 
softwood lumber is not based on any legitimate claim of unfair 
practices by Canada.  It is based on protectionism, pure and 
simple.  That has always been the case and, unfortunately, it 
appears it may well continue to be the case.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over a century, U.S. softwood lumber producers have been 
trying to restrict Canadian exports.  For over a century, they 
have wanted protection from Canadian competition.  For over a 
century, they have stopped at nothing to hold on to market share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first U.S. duties were applied to Canadian exports of 
softwood lumber way back in 1930.  The duty was $1 per thousand 
board feet and rose to $4 by 1935 before we successfully 
negotiated it back down to $1.  Two years later, in 1937, lumber 
producers in Oregon and Washington petitioned the U.S. government 
for protection from unfair Canadian competition.  At least that 
time they failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As time moved on and the number of Canadian imports into the 
United States increased, U.S. producers became increasingly 
agitated and sought protection.  However, despite the fact that 
the U.S. lumberman's economic survival committee was able to 
prompt both congressional hearings and the formation of a White 
House task force on the issue, the U.S. trade commission chose 
not to impose any restrictions on Canadian lumber imports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 20 years the protectionist actions have continued 
and intensified.  There have been three countervailing duty 
investigations in those 20 years and not once have the U.S. 
claims of subsidy been sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a memorandum of understanding that allowed provinces to 
adjust their forestry practices.  When these adjustments 
effectively eliminated the export charges it made no difference. 
Still, the subsidy claims persisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are in the dying days of a softwood lumber agreement that 
was never intended to address the subsidy issue because clearly 
subsidies were never the issue.  What the U.S. industry has 
always sought is to protect its market share.  That is what this 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Canada does well in this regard.  We do well 
because we produce an excellent product at modern, efficient 
mills and follow practices that ensure sustainability.  We do 
well because we deserve to do well, not because of unfair trade 
practices as the U.S. industry would have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 Canadian softwood lumber exports accounted for 33% of 
the U.S. market, an increase of 8% since 1990.  The lion's share 
of our exports, some 47%, come from British Columbia.  Twenty-one 
per cent come from Quebec, 9% from Ontario and 7% from Alberta. 
Those are the four provinces covered under the SLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Atlantic provinces export softwood lumber to 
the United States, as does Manitoba, Saskatchewan and the 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a trade dispute that affects all Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with the market in a downturn, the United States is 
eyeing Canadian market share and does not like what it sees.  It 
does not like the fact that so many consumers rely on Canadian 
softwood lumber.  It does not like the fact that so many of our 
mills are efficient and modern compared with its mills.  It 
certainly does not like the thought of how much more of the 
market we might get if we really had free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is clamouring once again for protection and 
threatening costly countervail duty and anti-dumping action 
against Canadian producers.  However, rest assured, as the 
Minister for International Trade has stated repeatedly in and 
outside the House, the Canadian government will vigorously defend 
Canadian interests on behalf of all the provinces of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The temptation to restrict imports can be strong for those 
looking to protect a domestic industry that cannot always 
compete.  However, in today's rules based trading system, that is 
no longer acceptable.  Let us not forget that it is the United 
States that has led the charge away from protectionism and toward 
free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that open markets are in our greater economic 
interest and must be created and maintained is a sound argument. 
This is the driving principle behind the WTO and the NAFTA.  This 
is the argument the United States is making again in favour of 
more market liberalization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it is not just Canadian producers who are 
looking for free trade in softwood lumber.  American home 
builders and other consumers of softwood lumber are calling for 
an end to protectionism.  They do not like the fact that they are 
being asked to unfairly subsidize U.S. companies with higher 
prices simply because those companies cannot or do not want to 
compete.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is not self-sufficient in lumber.  It needs 
our Canadian exports.  Mr. Speaker, you know that very well with 
the riding you represent.  Only the market should be allowed to 
determine how much Canadian softwood lumber enters the United 
States.  The market should decide, not American congressmen or 
senators who are under political pressure.  That is not the job 
of the coalition for fair lumber imports.  It is not the job for 
Senators Trent Lott, Max Baucus or Olympia Snowe, and it is not 
the job of U.S. trade representative Zoellick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to responding to protectionist threats from the 
United States and we will do so in consultation with the 
provinces, the industry and other stakeholders.  Such 
consultation has already been very extensive by the minister and 
that will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed that impartial envoys from Canada and the 
United States be appointed to explore the issue from all sides 
and to consult with stakeholders and bring forward non-binding 
proposals for resolving this longstanding dispute.  We must be 
creative and constructive if we are to achieve our goal of free 
trade in softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to indicate my support for the motion and our firm 
intention to pursue Canada's goal of free trade in softwood 
lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to some allegations made recently by certain 
U.S. senators and address and elucidate those with a few facts 
that they do not seem to have at their disposal or which they 
choose to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 1, 2001, 51 U.S. senators alleged that Canadian lumber 
was subsidized and that its stumpage fees were less than the 
market value.  The reality is that Canadian provinces do not 
subsidize the lumber industry.  Timber pricing by provincial 
governments in Canada has been the subject of three U.S. 
countervailing duty investigations in the past 20 years and not 
once have these challenges been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent report from the U.S. congress it is stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence to demonstrate this possible disparity between U.S. and 
Canada stumpage fees, is widespread, but inconclusive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comes from a congressional research service report for 
congress, “Softwood Lumber Imports from Canada: History and 
Analysis of the Dispute”, dated February 2, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second allegation by senators was that Canadian lumber 
producers derive an unfair advantage from subsidized rail rates. 
This is rubbish.  The United States department of commerce has 
been unable to sustain a subsidy finding on any government 
program.  Canada's two national railways are privately owned and 
operated.  There is absolutely no basis for this subsidy 
allegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senators' third allegation stated that log export restraints 
by Canada are unfair.  The United States was unable to sustain a 
subsidy with respect to log export restraints in the last 
countervailing duty investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. has changed its law regarding the treatment of export 
restraints in any future investigation relative to CVD. Canada 
has challenged this provision of U.S. law in the WTO dispute 
settlement mechanism.  It is worth noting that the United States 
also maintains restrictions on the export of logs.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth allegation states that a flood of Canadian lumber is 
the cause of mill closures in the United States.  Lumber imports 
from Canada are not the cause of any closures of lumber mills in 
the United States.  Closures are currently occurring on both 
sides of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cyclical industry which is primarily driven by market 
demand.  The latest available data from the United States forest 
service indicate that in recent years more than 50% of mill 
closures in the U.S. and Canada occurred in the province of B.C. 
alone.  It is not a phenomenon that is unique to the United 
States as we all know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately there are other U.S. voices involved in the debate 
and I would like to address them briefly.  Senator Craig noted 
that there were other U.S. opinions to be heard.  This point 
ought not to be forgotten in the debate over softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United States senators and representatives have recently 
introduced two resolutions before the house and the senate 
calling for a return to free trade.  Representing the interests 
of U.S. lumber consumers, the resolutions underlined that the 
1996 Canada-U.S. softwood lumber agreement had a negative impact 
on housing affordability and jobs south of the border and 
excluded many Americans from home ownership.  It is not something 
any administration in the United States would be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States census bureau estimates that the fees on 
additional shipments are equivalent to more than $1,000 U.S. for 
the lumber in an average new home.  That is simply unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my comments on these unfounded allegations of U.S. 
senators by stating that there is simply no basis in fact for 
them.  They have never stood up to any objective analysis and 
they will not stand up to any future analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade has repeatedly stated 
inside and outside the House that the government desires free 
trade in softwood lumber.  It will vigorously defend the 
interests of the province of Quebec, the province of B.C. and of 
all other Canadian provinces.  It will vigorously defend the 
interests of the  whole country.  The goal is clear: it is free 
trade in softwood lumber.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
U.S. Senator Max Baucus, one of the 51 senators and 
representatives who expressed support for part of the American 
industry, the best solution would be for Canada to levy a tax on 
its softwood lumber exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the parliamentary secretary thinks 
about this suggestion made by the U.S. senator. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not fully understand 
the question from the member. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, this U.S. senator 
suggested that to 
resolve the softwood lumber dispute Canada should levy a tax on 
its softwood lumber exports. 
How does the parliamentary secretary react to such a suggestion? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I heard the member's 
question and appreciate his clarification.  I think he was citing 
Senator Max Baucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Baucus is only a free trader when it serves his 
interests and it does not serve his interest in softwood lumber. 
It cannot work that way.  It is fine for him to propose that we 
agree on an export charge, or whatever, to limit exports of our 
lumber products to the United States.  Does his government agree 
with that?  Categorically no.  That is not the goal whatsoever. 
We want the U.S. to live up to what it says it is and to what we 
signed on to:  free trade.

Minister for International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a northern Ontario riding as do you, Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Sault Ste. Marie and numerous other members from 
northern Ontario.  When 99% of the production in softwood lumber 
is from northern Ontario, it is critical to our fellow northern 
Ontarians that this issue be resolved and that we have free trade 
in softwood lumber.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's efforts in this area are laudable.  It is very 
important to remind the House and those who are listening that 
there are victims of the political posturing we are seeing in the 
U.S.  They could be workers and companies in my riding, in your 
riding, Mr. Speaker, in the riding of the member from the Soo 
and elsewhere in northern Ontario.  Victims whose livelihoods are 
at stake for no other reason but politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities, all too often single industry communities, depend 
upon the forestry sector.  They turn the lights off sometimes 
when the political posturing in the U.S. requires that their 
industry or factory be closed down or work hours be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the parliamentary secretary comment on how his efforts and 
the efforts of his minister will help bring some certainty to the 
livelihoods of the small and big businesses and the workers that 
maintain our very important softwood lumber sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  Having served with him in the House for some 
years, I well know what a vigorous defender he is of the 
interests of his constituents and of those in the Canadian lumber 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is exactly correct when he says there is a lot at stake here. 
There is an unfairness in what is being proposed by U.S. senators 
to our own producers, to the jobs of those producers, to the 
companies and to their valid profits.  I am very pleased that the 
parliamentary secretary raised the issue, but I repeat for the 
record that some U.S. senators and representatives have recently 
introduced two motions in the house and the senate calling for a 
return to free trade in softwood lumber in the United States.. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did they do that?  They cited the fact that U.S. jobs were 
being unfairly injured and that housing affordability in the 
United States was being affected.  To put it bluntly, consumers 
are being ripped off in the United States to the tune of $1,000 
U.S., on average, for a home because the United States refuses to 
be what it says it is, free traders when it comes to softwood 
lumber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary 
for his presentation and congratulate him on his current 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister asked rhetorically what was behind the U.S. 
position on softwood lumber.  His answer was U.S. protectionism. 
We agree but we would add that Liberal and Conservative 
governments ought to understand the subject since they have 
practised protectionism for over 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the minister a cluster of questions around the same 
issue.  What is behind the lack of vigour behind the government's 
efforts to fight U.S. protectionism?  Is it that the government 
still has philosophical reservations about free trade?  After 
all, the Liberals opposed free trade in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so slow to use the dispute settling 
mechanisms in the free trade agreement?  It always has to be 
pushed into using them.  It never seems to charge in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the real reason behind the Liberal government's weakness in 
fighting U.S. protectionism that the government still wants to 
practise protectionism in certain other areas such as supply 
management and cultural industries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, is this not the real reason Liberal efforts to 
fight U.S. protectionism are so weak and inefficient?  Is it 
because it wants to practise protectionism in some other areas 
and this weakens its fight against U.S. protectionism in this 
area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his questions and his kind remarks.  Let me say it is very 
good to see him back in the House and looking so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I have to disagree with him.  I know he is a 
student of Canadian history, and so am I.  Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 
the first great French Canadian prime minister of the country, 
was a free trader. 
He was not always successful in convincing Canadians that it was 
the way to go.  In fact, it cost him severely at the polls.  A 
quick read of Canadian history tells us that Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
was the leader of the Liberal Party and the first French Canadian 
prime minister of Canada. He was an inveterate free trader.  I 
say that just to help a bit with Canadian history in this regard.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure as to why the lack of vigour.  I understand the 
member is on that side of the House and I am over here.  As the 
hon. member knows, the government has made representations on the 
issue.  The Prime Minister raised it personally with the new 
president of the United States, President Bush.  The minister 
raised it personally with the U.S. trade representative Bob 
Zoellick.  The representations on behalf of our softwood lumber 
industry by the government has been consistent.  I think vigorous 
would be the right word to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked why we are slow to move into the dispute 
settlement on this issue.  Let me clarify.  As we all know the 
current agreement ends at the end of the month.  At that point 
free trade takes over.  Canada just says fine, that is great. Now 
that the current deal is over, if everybody lives up to what they 
say they are on both sides of the border, free trade becomes the 
norm.  End of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence my point that it is the United States and its senators in 
their protectionist mode who will take it to a different level. 
Our government need do nothing but live up to the free trade 
agreement that both countries signed.  It is they who will cause 
the dispute.  Unfortunately they have made it clear they have 
every intention of doing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to join in the debate today.  I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forestry industry is very important in Canada.  Last year we 
exported about $10 billion of lumber to the United States.  It 
creates thousands of jobs.  This makes it critically important 
that the government pursue the issue with vigour and that it push 
the Americans as hard as it can to ensure that we have a free 
trade deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, however, I agree with my colleague from Calgary 
Southwest, sometimes the government sends the completely wrong 
message when it comes to the issue of free trade.  Canada does 
not always practise what it preaches.  There are a number of 
sectors where we do not have free trade, precisely because the 
government has decided that it wants to protect certain 
industries for political reasons.  That is regrettable, because 
in the end it undermines our case for free trade.  Frankly it 
leaves Canada less well off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the argument that Canada needs to practise what it 
preaches.  Before I do that, I should like to talk for a moment 
about why free trade in general is a good idea.  Canada is an 
exporting nation.  We rely on exports for much of our prosperity. 
About 43% of Canada's total prosperity comes from trade.  This is 
critical to us and we have to continue to push for the idea of 
rules based trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saddened and it concerns me every time I see a country that 
says on the one hand that it is committed to free trade but on 
the other hand finds ways to circumvent it every time it 
perceives its interests being threatened.  I think the Americans 
are guilty of that in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned, there have been three previous 
investigations into the lumber issue.  Canada has won each and 
every one of them.  Yet the Americans insist on pushing it. 
Canada has not helped itself either.  I argue that the government 
has not always done a very good job of pursuing our interests 
when it comes to free trade and the softwood lumber dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the remarks of the industry minister who said not 
very long ago that he thought some kind of quota system, some 
kind of mixture of the softwood lumber agreement and free trade, 
would be the final result of a negotiation after the current SLA 
comes up for renewal at the end of March. That is regrettable, 
because we also have the trade minister arguing that we should 
have free trade in lumber, which is certainly the position of the 
Canadian Alliance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, we have the Prime Minister saying, I think it was 
just yesterday, that there should be linkages between lumber and 
other industries when it comes to free trade, which is contrary 
to the position the trade minister has taken.  I happen to think 
that the Prime Minister might be a little more correct on this 
than the trade minister.  Nevertheless, people are confused when 
the government is saying different things on this issue and it 
does not help our case at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we make the best possible case that we can to have free 
trade in the softwood lumber industry between Canada and the 
United States?  First, we need to speak with one voice.  I have 
just made the case that government is saying different things on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, sometimes we have to examine the words of the Americans 
themselves and throw them back at them.  When President Bush was 
campaigning for the presidency and since he has become president 
he has said at various times that free trade was a priority for 
him.  Later in April, President Bush and other leaders from the 
Americas will be in Quebec City at the summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One item on the agenda will be a free trade agreement of the 
Americas.  President Bush has made it very clear that he wants to 
pursue free trade in the Americas, and I think Canada does as 
well.  Trade is good for Canada.  There is a powerful case to be 
made for free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think President Bush will have the credibility that he 
would like to have if on the one hand he is pushing for a free 
trade agreement of the Americas and on the other hand he is not 
standing up to his own senators who are pushing for a 
continuation of the softwood lumber agreement.  In other words, 
they are pushing for more barriers to trade, and that is 
completely inconsistent with what President Bush has stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very long ago I was in Washington and had a chance to sit 
down with Vice-President Cheney.  Vice-President Cheney made it 
very clear that he believed in free trade when it came to energy. 
President Bush has spoken of the North American energy policy. 
Free trade would be great, and we agree.  We think that is a 
great idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would people in the energy industry go to great expense to 
build extra generating capacity to send energy to the United 
States, knowing that the Americans could at any point put in 
place barriers and tariffs the moment their own industries were 
being threatened because Canadian producers are so efficient? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have to ask themselves why they would have any 
credibility at all on pushing a free trade agreement of the 
Americas or a North American energy grid when they are being 
protectionist on softwood lumber.  They simply will not have 
credibility and our own people will not invest billions of 
dollars in extra generating capacity when they know there is a 
possibility that these barriers could be thrown up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has to do a much better job of selling the benefits of 
free trade in the United States.  My colleague from across the 
way just pointed out that the coalition for affordable housing in 
the United States has made the case that the current softwood 
lumber deal actually adds about $1,000 U.S. to the price of every 
home in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an important fact that Canada really needs to push.  I 
do not think we have done a very good job of promoting in the 
United States the fact that the softwood lumber agreement is 
actually an extra tax on consumers in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Bush on one hand is pushing his $1.6 trillion tax cut, 
a fine idea for the United States.  We should have tax relief in 
Canada as well.  On the other hand the U.S. is effectively 
raising taxes through the softwood lumber agreement, $1,000 U.S. 
on every new home, because of that agreement.  We need to 
forcefully make that case to the American public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend has also pointed out that there have been a couple of 
resolutions passed in the U.S. congress calling on congress and 
the senate to repeal the softwood deal because of its impact on 
homes.  We should remind senators and congressmen that not 
everybody feels the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We met with Senator Craig from Idaho, the chair of the forestry 
subcommittee in the U.S. senate.  He comes from a state where 
they produce softwood lumber.  He made the point that there were 
other voices speaking on the issue and that not everyone agreed 
with the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make the case that U.S. Senator Craig is making, that 
congressmen are making and that home builders in the U.S. are 
making, that this is a cost to American consumers.  It actually 
costs jobs as well for people engaged in the home building 
industry in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not done a good job of that.  We need to do a far better 
job of making the case so that the public starts to put pressure 
on the senators to urge them to back away from another softwood 
lumber agreement and instead embrace the idea of free trade in 
the lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make the case to the public in the United States, I 
have touched on this already, that the U.S. government's 
protectionism on the issue will ultimately hurt jobs there 
because it undermines its credibility when it pursues other free 
trade agreements which ultimately lead to prosperity.  We urge 
the government to do a better job of making that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply conclude by saying that Canada has to do a better 
job of vigorously attacking positions which oppose free trade. We 
put tremendous effort into all kinds of other things when it 
comes to our foreign affairs policy.  The previous foreign 
affairs minister spent a lot of time globe trotting, pursuing 
noble sounding causes, but he simply did not get down to 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a new foreign affairs minister now.  We urge him to put 
extra effort into reinvigorating our relationship with the United 
States and reinvigorating the case for free trade, something that 
has not happened at this point.  Because of that it is costing 
Canadians jobs and prosperity.  We simply urge members across the 
way to put their resources and their time into reinvigorating the 
whole discussion over free trade that will ultimately benefit 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I thank members opposite for their comments on the 
issue, in particular the comments made by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister for International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments drive home clearly that the softwood lumber 
problem is not a problem between east and west and the provinces 
of Canada.  This is plain and simple a north-south problem 
involving the United States and $10 billion of annual trade in 
that commodity.  I thank the parliamentary secretary because it 
is important to our area that the stated goal is free trade in 
this commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member is 
right that this is a dispute between north and south and not east 
and west, but it continues to raise questions.  My friend really 
did not address this point, but it continues to raise the 
question of why Canada is not more aggressive in practising what 
it preaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend is on the government side, but he knows very well that 
there are still all kinds of restrictions in place in Canada on 
imports of textiles, for instance.  It is hard to make the case 
that we should be asking other countries to engage in free trade 
when we have protectionist measures in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of restrictions on textiles, for instance, it is 
something that hurts third world countries.  It is odd that 
Canada sends aid to third world countries to help them out, to 
give them a helping hand, but maintains restrictions on textiles 
which makes it impossible for them to ever develop an economy. It 
is when we are involved in that kind of double dealing that we 
undermine our own ability to make the case for free trade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure my colleague would agree that when we look at overall trade 
between Canada and the U.S. this issue or this irritant 
constitutes less than 3% of all trade between Canada and the 
United States.  Some 97% of all trade between the two countries 
is going well, but we will continue to see those irritants from 
time to time. 
It is imperative for us to use the existing mechanism to resolve 
those issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague agree that the course undertaken by the 
minister of going to an alternative dispute settlement mechanism, 
as well as venues such as the World Trade Organization dispute 
mechanism and the NAFTA dispute resolution mechanism, is proper? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also he might want to comment on whether or not the whole issue 
deals with efficiencies. The lumber industry is a cyclical 
industry.  When the market is not there for lumber, producers on 
both sides of the equation raise concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing closures on both sides of the border between 
Canada and the United States.  In Canada over 50% of our mills 
have closed as a result of the market.  I wanted to hear from my 
colleague, because he is probably quite aware given his area, 
whether or not those comments constitute the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's 
comments, but in Medicine Had we do not have a tremendous amount 
of lumber.  In fact it is hard to find a tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first point is while we understand the need for rules based 
trade and the need for dispute settlement mechanisms, the best 
solution is not to get to that point in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had five years since the SLA was put in place.  It 
became obvious fairly early on that it was not working in the 
interests of Canadian producers.  Over the last five years we 
should have arrived at the point with the Americans where we 
could have gone into the end of this agreement with an agreement 
that we would pursue free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately we will go into it now and probably get a ruling in 
our favour, but it will cost the industry billions and billions 
of dollars.  That is regrettable.  We are at that point now. Yes, 
we have to use the mechanisms that are there.  Rules based trade 
is the key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend's point about the economy turning down or the lumber 
industry being a cyclical industry is correct.  If we are heading 
for a recession it will raise tensions on both sides and make the 
situation more difficult down the road.  That makes my point that 
we should have had an agreement earlier than today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the motion brought forward 
by our Bloc colleagues.  The Canadian Alliance certainly supports 
the motion as it supports free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with what is happening is that the agreement 
expires at the end of the month.  We have no clear indication 
from the government of what angle it will take.  We have 
conflicting reports from the Prime Minister.  He thinks we should 
have it all linked together with other issues.  The trade 
minister says that it will be negotiated on its own.  We have to 
speed up the government or get it interested in the issue to have 
some resolution of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous to the softwood lumber agreement there were challenges 
against our trade with the U.S. in softwood lumber.  Every time a 
challenge has been brought forward we have won.  It has been 
proven that there is no subsidy issue which would allow the 
Americans a countervail tariff against our industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know very well how hurtful a countervail tariff can be.  It 
happened in my area of the country last year, when a challenge 
was brought by R-CALF in the United States against our cattle 
industry.  Canadian producers had to post bonds at the border 
while this challenge was ongoing.  Money was taken off all cattle 
that went across the line; a proportion of the amount was taken 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end after months of investigation they actually came into 
the offices of feeders and went through their books.  It was an 
horrendous process.  It cost not only the amount of money that 
was taken in tariff, but millions of dollars to fight the issue 
that could have been better used.  We won in the end.  The tariff 
money that was taken was given back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong is that the U.S. passed a law last year to say 
that if there were a challenge, a countervail put against our 
lumber, it gets to keep any money taken, even if Canada wins in 
the end. 
It could cost our industry billions of dollars, and that is 
totally unfair.  That is an unjust law and the trade minister 
should have straightened it out by now.  If we are talking about 
free trade with the United States, let us talk about free trade. 
Let us make it free, fair and rules based trade that we can all 
live by.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are a few weeks away from the expiration of this 
agreement and we do not have the rules in place to move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing on which we have to be absolutely certain is that we 
do not do this alone.  If only four or five provinces sign on to 
the deal then we are lost.  We cannot be separated on this.  We 
must hang in together.  If the trade minister can keep us 
together as a country, then I am sure his leverage and power 
would create a fair package for our softwood lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber industry is huge and, as has been pointed 
out by members opposite, it is important to Canada.  It needs to 
have the government's full focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that in many ways we have let down certain sectors of our 
country.  Certainly one that I want to bring into the debate is 
our grain and oilseed sector.  Because of some of the agreements 
the government has made with reducing tariffs and support to our 
producers, they have been put in a hole that I cannot figure out 
how they will get out of unless we support them ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be more aggressive when we fight the Americans and 
the European Union on subsidies.  We need to beat down the unfair 
subsidies that distort markets and production.  We need to use 
more force.  We do not think enough effort has been put forward 
by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We trade a lot of goods and we are a good trading partner. 
Trading partners can count on us to have good quality products 
that will be delivered on time and at a fair price.  When we have 
those kinds of deals and that kind of reputation, why are we not 
using that as a bigger hammer when we go into these negotiations 
with the European Union and the United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other challenges that have been brought forward in the past 
against the softwood lumber industry have crashed.  The United 
States has done everything it can to try to point out that our 
industry is being unfairly subsidized, and it is not.  If it does 
go to a challenge, let us use the present systems of WTO and 
NAFTA to deal with that.  I am sure we would be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the thing that is really scaring the industry is the law 
that the United States has passed that says that any tariff 
collected would be kept.  I cannot understand how on earth that 
would work but that is what it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity in the last parliament to meet with some 
U.S. senators in Montana: Senator Craig, Senator Thomas and 
Senator Burns from Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.  We were only able 
to meet for a morning but it was good to be able to do that.  I 
think five or six of my colleagues attended the meeting in Great 
Falls.  My realization from that meeting was that we need to have 
more open discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many issues at that time but the one that was 
important to me concerned cattle.  A lot of the stories on both 
sides of the border were not true, were mistruths or were 
misunderstandings.  Even for the couple of hours that we sat down 
and went over a few issues we were dumbfounded on both sides by 
the number of things being said that were just absolutely untrue. 
Opening a line of communication and debate is very important. 
Just a few hours spent on one morning was very helpful on a lot 
of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A coalition of senators has come together to lobby the United 
States government to protect its softwood lumber industry.  It is 
a big and an important issue to them and we have to be aware that 
there is very strong lobby in the United States to protect its 
industry, unfairly we think. Getting back to open, free and rules 
based trade is absolutely essential, not only in this area but in 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it in other sectors of our society where some of 
these agreements have really hurt certain parts of Canada's 
industry and we cannot be doing that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is that of messaging to the people of the United 
States that these tariffs are increasing the cost of a home in 
the United States by $1,000 U.S.  We have to make sure that we 
have coalitions built with people there that the message gets out 
that their own people are being hurt by these countervailing 
duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of one stance from coast to coast to coast in 
this country on this issue cannot be overemphasized.  I believe 
we have to appear united on it because in the end it will be far 
better for all if we can do that than to hive off separate 
provinces and separate parts of the industry to different 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me a little nervous that the trade minister and the 
Prime Minister are not on the same page as of yesterday.  We need 
to be absolutely certain that this will become a bigger priority 
at the cabinet table and that we do take a united position on 
this.  If the Prime Minister is talking to the vice-president of 
the United States saying one thing and our international trade 
minister is at negotiations saying another thing, then the 
Americans know we are not being cohesive and they can split us 
apart and make a better deal for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Vancouver Island North, could not 
be here today to speak to this but he has let me know about all 
the work that he has done on this file.  He is getting together 
with a bunch of folks on the west coast to talk about west coast 
issues, and I am sure this will be at the top of the list on 
their agenda.  He has done a tremendous amount of work on this 
deserves some credit as far as keeping his colleagues on this 
side of the House informed of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish by saying that we need to have this free trade in 
softwood lumber and it has to be coast to coast. It also has to 
be pushed with the emphasis that it deserves because of the 
importance it has to Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is an 
expression “Don't look back unless you want to go there”.  I 
think that certainly applies to this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of northern Ontario, and indeed those involved in the 
softwood industry across this country, do not want to look back 
on that softwood lumber agreement because they do not want to go 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for 
International Trade who made it very clear that the objective of 
the government is to work toward free trade in softwood lumber. 
We are seeking solutions to this trade dispute.  We will 
vigorously enforce our rights under international trade 
agreements at the same time.  That should be clear to all of the 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that is clear 
to all members of the House.  I want to bring in one aspect that 
I was not able to bring in in my previous remarks.  A couple of 
weeks ago we had the pleasure of hosting the British prime 
minister, Tony Blair, who gave what I felt was a very good 
presentation.  I will quote Mr. Blair who is the leader of the 
British labour socialist party.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on trade—.  It is time I think that we started to 
argue vigorously and clearly as to why free trade is right.  It 
is the key to jobs for our people, to prosperity and actually to 
development in the poorest parts of the world. The case against 
it is misguided and, worse, unfair.  However sincere the 
protests, they cannot be allowed to stand in the way of rational 
argument.  We should start to make this case with force and 
determination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day Mr. Blair was here, I had the opportunity to sit in 
the front row with the hope of talking to him before he left, and 
I did.  I was able to shake his hand and thank him for his 
comments, but I was also, in the few moments I had, able to 
remind him that the subsidies the European Union was giving its 
agricultural producers were really causing a lot of pain in our 
country.  I asked him if it would be possible to reduce those 
subsidies to take some of the pain away from our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to the issue of being more forceful at the 
negotiating table. 
I know there have been reports lately, and I am slipping back to 
agriculture, that the agriculture minister was in Europe.  He 
suggested to the Europeans that their subsidies were hurting our 
producers. They told him that he could go to the hell because 
that was the way it was and will continue to be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the forest industry is very important in my riding

industry is very important.  It provides a lot of jobs in the 
community for many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pursue the notion of the quota aspect of the 
agreement.  It really limits individuals from being able to 
maximize the potential of the industry.  It excludes others from 
becoming involved in the industry.  It has, in many ways, hurt a 
lot of different individuals and has had ripple effects 
throughout the community within my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my colleague think is the problem with the 
government's response to vigorously pursuing the notion of free 
trade, particularly in the area of softwood lumber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the whole quota system gave 
an advantage to some and not to others.  It was not right.  I 
even became aware of it in my riding in southern Alberta.  We do 
not have a lot of forest, but there was a gentleman with a small 
mill who was shipping lumber across the border.  One day he took 
a load across and was told that he did not have a quota. 
Probably not being in the mainstream of business but trying to 
make a few bucks shipping logs across the border, he came to me, 
which was when I really became aware of what was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue has to be dealt with openly and has to be rules

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise in debate on this very important motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I congratulate the member for Joliette for having brought 
forward this motion on behalf of his party. This is a very 
important issue and I wonder why we have waited until today, 15 
or 16 days before the expiration of the softwood lumber 
agreement, to finally hold a debate on this issue, which is so 
important for Quebec and Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it extraordinary and unacceptable that it is literally on 
the eve of the expiry of the softwood agreement that we are now 
having a serious debate in the House.  As I said, I congratulate 
the hon. member for Joliette for having tabled this very 
important motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to ask the representatives of the government why it is 
only now, and it is coming from an opposition member, that there 
is this kind of opportunity for debate.  Why did the government 
not bring this forward for debate much earlier in the process, 
well before the date of expiry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all knew that this five year agreement was coming up for 
renewal when it expired at the end of this month.  Why did the 
government not take the initiative to invite all Canadians 
affected by this agreement, such as the unions, the workers, the 
environmentalists and others, to make representations and to make 
their views known about the impact of the softwood lumber 
agreement?  Why did it not to find out their proposals for what 
should take place when it expires on March 31? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has completely failed to show any leadership 
whatsoever on this very important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have already pointed out the importance of this industry. 
I do not have to repeat that.  I am a British Columbia member of 
parliament and the forestry industry is absolutely critical for 
the people and the communities of British Columbia.  We want to 
do whatever we can to strengthen and support that industry and to 
ensure that there is even more value added from the products that 
are produced from that industry. 
We have to take a look at exactly what is happening in this 
industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is we were sold a bill of goods when the 
Canada-U.S. free trade agreement was brought in in 1988 and 
replaced in 1994 by NAFTA.  What we were told at the time this 
came in, and I remember because I was in the House, was that the 
free trade agreement would get rid of the barriers that existed 
with Canadian products entering the U.S. market.  This did not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very well that when it comes to lumber the United States 
has always been the bully.  It does not accept free trade at all. 
It is an illusion.  Time and again when the U.S. has challenged 
Canadian practises, it has been told to forget it.  Whether it 
was on countervail, or dumping or other provisions, it lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is not at all serious when it talks about free 
trade and in its approach to free trade.  It wants to prevent any 
meaningful access by Canada to that market.  We all know that is 
what led to the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber agreement which 
affects the four key provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, 
Alberta and Ontario as producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we overlook the fact that it does not affect the 
Atlantic provinces, which have done very well over the course of 
the past few years in the absence of any restrictions whatsoever. 
We are going to want to hear from Atlantic representatives.  My 
colleagues from the Atlantic are concerned that in any new regime 
the significant benefits that have accrued to the Atlantic 
provinces not be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The options we face on the eve of the expiry of the softwood 
lumber agreement are basically threefold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first option is to renew the agreement.  We could agree once 
again with the United States to accept a ceiling, whether it is 
$14.7 billion square feet of lumber a year beyond which quotas 
are applied, or some other form of ceiling.  Basically we could 
renew the agreement.  On behalf of the New Democratic Party, I 
want to be very clear that is not an option for us.  The current 
agreement must be allowed to expire.  I think there is unanimity 
in the House on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second option, which is the proposal of the Bloc Quebecois, 
is to throw softwood lumber wide open to free trade without any 
kind of restriction whatsoever.  This would come under the WTO, 
NAFTA and ultimately under the FTAA, if the FTAA is negotiated in 
2003 or 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the position the Bloc is putting before us today.  It 
wants to scrap the current SLA and not renew it.  We agree with 
it on that.  However, the Bloc motion goes on to say clearly, 
unequivocally and categorically to throw it open to free trade 
with no restrictions whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to suggest that there is another option and a very 
important alternative that we as New Democrats want the 
government to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to recognize that the current agreement must 
not be renewed.  It must be scraped.  It clearly has not worked 
in the best interests of Canadians, particularly those in British 
Columbia and the provinces that are affected by the agreement. 
The market is not gone.  The other alternative is to replace the 
softwood lumber agreement with a fair trade agreement that gives 
Canadians some ability to ensure that some very important factors 
are taken into consideration in the area of forestry policy.  Any 
trade agreement on softwood lumber should allow the Canadian 
government, as well as the British Columbia government and le 
gouvernement du Quebec, to do a number of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it should maintain employment and community stability, 
set strong environment protection regulations and develop 
policies to promote value added production in the forestry 
industry.  Those are the kind of objectives that surely we do not 
want to give up as Canadians, as the people who own this precious 
and magnificent resource.  That is precisely what the Bloc would 
do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised to hear the member for Joliette, for whom I have 
a lot of respect, suggest that we are losing our sovereignty, 
the sovereignty of Quebec and of Canada, by adopting, for 
example, environmental regulations on the right of the province 
of Quebec, of my province, British Columbia, and of Atlantic 
provinces to set environmental standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what the member for the Bloc is proposing. For 
this reason, NDP members will vote against this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it extraordinary that a party that has spoken out, and I 
respect the position it has taken, strongly about the right of 
the people of Quebec to determine their own future should be 
prepared to throw away that right to make decisions on something 
as absolutely fundamental as forestry policy, particularly 
environmental regulation.  However that is what it is doing.  I 
am going to show in a couple of minutes exactly why that has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we say that the current agreement must be allowed to 
expire.  We recognize that there have been many problems with 
that agreement.  The fact is that the way the quotas were 
originally set was according to 1994-95 exports to the U.S., 
so-called experience ratings.  What that meant was that some 
companies in some regions were penalized because, quite frankly, 
they were not concentrating on the U.S. market at that time.  Yet 
they were locked in to those provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coastal British Columbia, for example, was particularly focusing 
on selling products to Japan.  Because of the quota system there 
was no flexibility to shift into the United States market.  This 
was simply because they did not have any quota.  It was not 
because they were not competitive or efficient enough to 
penetrate that market.   The current agreement clearly is unfair 
in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another very serious concern with respect to the issue 
of raw log exports.  This has been a profound concern in the 
province of British Columbia where we have seen a huge increase 
in the last couple of years in the export of raw logs.  Most of 
those logs were harvested on private lands on Vancouver Island. 
The companies that do that are constantly lobbying the federal 
government to reduce even the weak current restrictions on log 
exports so they might export even more raw logs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a little over 100,000 cubic metres of raw logs were 
exported from British Columbia.  The average between 1992 and 
1998 was around 300,000.  Last year the estimates were somewhere 
between 1.8 million and 2.4 million cubic metres.  That is 
totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing provisions of the SLA, the softwood lumber 
agreement, we know that the restrictions or the ban on raw log 
exports in some cases is considered a subsidy.  Clearly that as 
well is quite unacceptable.  Ironically lumber exports from third 
countries outside Canada and the United States enter the U.S. 
duty free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not dispute the position taken by the Bloc or other 
parties in the House that the current agreement has not worked 
for Canadians and that it must be allowed to lapse when it 
expires at the end of this month.  We want fair and open access 
to the U.S. market.  We want a level playing field for all 
Canadian lumber producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is how do we achieve that.  Why not just move to 
free trade without any restrictions whatsoever, as the Bloc has 
suggested?  This does not particularly surprise me. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember quite well that in 1988-89 and the following years, 
Bloc Quebecois members supported NAFTA. They supported NAFTA, 
saying that it was good for Quebec and for Canada. Now, after 
seven years with NAFTA, can we really say that it was in the 
best interests of the people of Quebec and Canada? I do not 
believe that.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc is suggesting with this motion is that we should 
effectively throw ourselves on the mercy of the great free market 
under NAFTA.  Under NAFTA there is no free market.  The reality 
is that under NAFTA more and more power is being taken away from 
governments.  Power is being taken away from the governments of 
Canada, British Columbia and Quebec to make decisions, as 
democratically elected representatives, about our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at some of the cases that have been brought under chapter 
11 of NAFTA, such as the investor state provision.  We know 
Mexico, for example, has recently been told by a secret tribunal 
that it has no power to ensure that a toxic waste dump is not put 
into a small community of Guadalcazar in Mexico.  It said it did 
not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to accept the Bloc motion, we would be effectively 
surrendering our sovereign right as Canadians, as Quebecers, as 
British Columbians and as Atlantic Canadians to say that we want 
to ensure that we have the opportunity to enforce tough 
environmental standards.  We want to ensure more value added in 
our forests.  We want to ensure that communities and workers are 
respected in the decisions that are made about the forest 
industry.  Under this proposal that would not be possible, so we 
say no to that proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the Pope & Talbot challenge.  This is an American 
company that is challenging the current provisions of the 
softwood lumber agreement.  It is the ultimate in irony.  It is 
saying that, due to the regional disparities which exist, it is 
somehow being treated unfairly.  An American company is 
challenging the softwood lumber agreement, which was pushed by 
the United States, because it cannot make enough money out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the regime that the Bloc wants to take us into.  We as 
New Democrats say no.  That is clearly not acceptable to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do far more in terms of value added.  We also have to 
recognize that there are some serious changes that have to be 
made in the way we conduct forestry.  We do not want to have our 
hands tied as we attempt to make those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in British Columbia, we learned that some of the 
biggest multinational forest companies have been using what is 
called grade setting, which is a practice of harvesting only low 
grade timber to set the grade for huge cut blocks.  That means 
their appraisal is very low for their stumpage payments.  Then 
they switch to harvesting high grade timber but pay the low grade 
stumpage rates.  That kind of abuse of B.C. forests has to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look very seriously at alternatives.  Many of us, 
certainly my colleagues in the New Democratic Party, and many 
environmentalists are concerned about a number of the current 
practices that are the norm in too many parts of British Columbia 
and elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of this kind of race to the bottom approach that the 
Bloc is supporting, and apparently other parties in the House are 
supporting, maybe it is time we looked at tough effective 
environmental standards that would affect all of the countries 
that are producing.  This includes the United States, Canada and 
other competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking at protection for endangered species 
habitat, biological diversity, fish habitat, water quality and 
sustainable logging practices.  Why not call for a global 
approach to sustainable forestry that would involve input from 
communities, workers, aboriginal groups and others?  Why not do 
far more to promote value added and to push for bans on raw log 
exports which are a direct export of jobs from British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned concerns about clear cut logging.  I am pleased to 
note that more companies are moving away from that.  We have to 
look at other reforms as well, which may very well be deemed to 
be trade barriers.  Under the terms the Bloc is suggesting we 
would not be able to undertake them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we have to look at tenure reform in 
the forestry area.  We have to look at how we protect the long 
term ecological health of our forests, how we maintain that 
biodiversity that I spoke of earlier and how we provide a stream 
of sustainable benefits to communities, including non-timber 
benefits.  At the same time we must recognize that workers in the 
forest industry, who are concerned about their futures, should be 
directly involved in these decisions.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look more at moving tenure away from the big 
multinational logging companies and locating more community based 
opportunities such as community forests, locally controlled 
woodlots, expanded small business forestry programs, licences for 
small processors and processing co-ops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is limited, but the concern I have with the 
motion is that unfortunately it is in a sense replacing one bad 
deal with another.  As New Democrats, we say there is that other 
option and that is what we want to put forward in the debate 
today, an option which would allow us to ensure that we can in 
fact respect environmental standards, that we can respect the 
rights of communities and workers to determine their own future, 
that we are not locked in to this investor state provision, and 
that in fact we can make decisions as the representatives of the 
people of this country, as the representatives of the provinces 
we live in, about the future of this very precious resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will recognize that we must move toward a 
much fairer trade system in lumber.  I hope it will consider the 
recommendation of the B.C. forest minister, Gordon Wilson, who 
recently called on the federal government to send a special envoy 
to Washington to try to negotiate a newer and better softwood 
lumber agreement.  He points out, in fact, that if we do not do 
so we will once again be into this endless cycle of countervail, 
threats of countervail and dumping.  We now have a threat that 
there may not even be any retroactivity if we lose at 
countervail, that again under the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, it is important that we recognize, as I said 
earlier, that the market is not God, that the forests should 
belong to the people of this country, the people of British 
Columbia, the people of Quebec, the people of the Atlantic 
provinces and the people all across Canada.  We must not have our 
hands tied in how we approach those forests.  For that reason we 
say no to the renewal of the softwood lumber agreement and no as 
well to the unrestricted proposal of the Bloc Quebecois for free 
trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Burnaby—Douglas.  It was 
as usual a very thoughtful speech on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am kind of curious about the fact that the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, who marshalls his facts so well and understands 
the legal niceties so well, seems to be able to distort the facts 
in a way that is quite astonishing and to come to conclusions 
that are so inconsistent with his own party's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burnaby—Douglas knows very well that the 
minister and the government have been consulting on this issue 
for the last couple of years.  He started his speech by saying 
there has been no consultation and asking why this is so last 
minute.  The minister has travelled across the country.  He has 
met with stakeholders from every group.  He has met with all 
provincial governments.  The government has initialled two WTO 
challenges to U.S. legislation.  In the WTO we are consulting on 
dumping duties.  We have actually challenged their legislation on 
log exports.  The minister has met with the predecessor of Mr. 
Zoellick and is meeting now with Mr. Zoellick.  The Prime 
Minister is now discussing this issue with Vice-President Cheney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have organized a coalition of consumers groups in the United 
States that support the Canadian position because they understand 
the need to have lumber at a price that is reasonable and they 
understand that their own logging industry is driving up prices, 
which will suppress building in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this work did not happen in the last 20 minutes.  This 
has been happening for a long time, so why is the member taking 
that position when he knows it is not true?  Second, why is he so 
opposed, then, to the summit of the Americas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member believes in a fair trade agreement, if he 
believes in an opportunity to get these issues of environment, 
human rights and all the issues he is talking about on the table, 
why is he going to protest the summit of the Americas?  That is 
exactly what we will be discussing there.  Those are exactly the 
issues we will have an opportunity to discuss, but the hon. 
member wants to stymie that negotiation.  He wants to kill it 
before it starts.  Where is the consistency in his position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us cut through the 
rhetoric and the nonsense here.  The member asks why I am going 
to Quebec City and why I am opposed to the proposals of the 
government.  I will tell hon. members something:  we do not even 
know what the proposals of the government are because it refuses 
to make public the texts that are being negotiated.  It is the 
height of sophistry for the Liberals to say “trust us, it will 
be good for Canadian people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for the member, who chairs the foreign 
affairs committee, but it is absolutely absurd to ask the 
Canadian people to simply trust our government to negotiate a 
good deal even though we still cannot see the text that is being 
negotiated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That summit is coming up in a little over a month from now. What 
we were told by the Minister for International Trade in one 
memorable declaration was that there is no problem, that these 
trade deals all look like one another anyway, so if they all look 
the same and are basically the same idea, what is the big deal if 
they cannot show us this particular text.  That is our concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale this:  if in 
fact this trade deal is going to look like the other trade deals, 
does that mean there is going to be an investor state provision 
in it?  Does that mean we are going to give corporations like 
Metalclad, Ethyl Corporation, Methanex and others the right to 
challenge the decisions that we as democratically elected 
representatives make?  We do not know.  We do not know because 
the government has refused to allow us to know.  It will not make 
those texts public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say one other thing, and that is with respect to the 
point I made initially about the consultation with members of the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I congratulate the member for Joliette because I 
believe, though I may be mistaken, that this is the first serious 
debate we have in the House of Commons on this issue. And it is 
taking place two weeks before the expiration of the agreement. 
This is unacceptable. The Minister may have done some 
consulting here and there, but what have we done here, in the 
highest forum of Canadian democracy, where the country's elected 
representatives meet? Absolutely nothing. And this is 
unacceptable.

Burnaby—Douglas talks a great game.  I think that both he and I 
would agree that we certainly want to support our local 
industries and that from what we see in the larger context the 
results are not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides calling the U.S. some names and not hiding his 
anti-Americanism and philosophical opposition to trade deals and 
processes that were not particularly his party's ideas, I am 
pleased that, first of all, he agrees with the Canadian Alliance 
that a return to the old formula, the old SLA, is not a preferred 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to clarify his options, what is he really suggesting?  Is 
it more socialism?  He says the market is not God.  Then who is? 
Is he saying that a wise bureaucrat somewhere in a ministry is 
going to solve it?  Who will decide?  Will it be top down 
government control in the name of these laudable objectives?  Let 
him spell out how the old style of bureaucratic control, the 
failures of the past, would work in today's reality.  He talks 
about fair and open access.  Is that through a socialist 
bureaucracy, through departmental mandarins, through replacing 
markets with edicts and decrees from the czar?  Is that what he 
is talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about standards and sovereignty.  We do not get those 
things through coercion.  We get them through co-operation and 
negotiation.  We can make friendly deals and put limits on our 
behaviour.  When we make a trade deal with someone we may decide 
not to go to war with someone.  That means we are limiting our 
sovereignty or our choice not to go to war because it is of 
mutual benefit to both of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His solution is old style socialism, which is a failure and will 
not bring us the results he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member refers 
to edicts and decrees from the czar.  What we are saying is that 
we are tired of secret, unaccountable tribunals telling us as 
elected representatives what we can do about our own future. 
Those are the real edicts and the real decrees the member should 
be concerned with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more we are losing democracy and sovereignty to the 
hands of multinational corporations, which have the ability, 
under these so-called trade deals, to challenge environmental 
policies and to challenge our policies with respect to social 
programs, cultural programs and other programs.  My colleague 
from Dartmouth can certainly speak eloquently to the concern that 
we have in the cultural sphere with issues like split run 
magazines and so on.  That is the concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I share 
the member's concerns with respect to the weaknesses of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, I would point out that the 
Bloc Quebecois position is clearly known.  We are in favour of 
including social clauses in free trade agreements precisely 
because we have seen the results of previous agreements. We 
know that they have an impact socially and culturally.  I 
therefore share his concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this is not the question.  The question is which rules 
will govern softwood lumber trade between Canada and the United 
States on April 1. 
Will it be NAFTA, with all the amendments that would require 
but which has been signed by both countries, or will we have an 
arbitrary decision by the Americans imposed on us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member tell us how voting against the Bloc Quebecois 
motion will help producers and workers in British Columbia on 
April 1? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact we are speaking on 
behalf of communities, workers, and the environment in British 
Columbia and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to accept the Bloc Quebecois' motion, we would not 
have an opportunity to challenge the provisions.  For instance, 
we would not be able to oppose the American challenge to our 
environmental practices and to our practice of not having raw 
logs exported from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely because we wish to speak on behalf of 
communities, of the environment and of workers that we are 
rejecting these NAFTA rules, particularly the infamous chapter 
11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be fine with the member for Joliette if the big 
corporations are allowed to challenge provisions of the 
agreement, whether in Quebec, in Canada or in British Columbia. 
We, as members of parliament, and the representatives of the 
government in power would have no opportunity to say no.  That 
is what the Bloc Quebecois is proposing and we do not agree.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on this issue because it is a critical 
issue to my party, my region and my country.  It is the number 
one issue that has occupied our attention for the last little 
while.  It is not a simple issue and there will probably not be a 
simple solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For one thing, people should understand that it is a very unique 
situation, where the United States government deals with Canada 
under three different sets of rules.  One is the softwood lumber 
agreement, which includes the four provinces of Quebec, Ontario, 
Alberta and British Columbia.  Then there are four provinces 
under the maritime accord, the four Atlantic provinces of New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland.  Then there are 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, perhaps the most important provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, it is an aberration in international trade when one 
country deals with another country under three different sets of 
circumstances.  It does cause a lot of trouble, but there are 
reasons for the different approaches in these three different 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the four provinces under the softwood lumber 
agreement, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, the 
American industry and the American government perceive that they 
have subsidy under the program of supplying stumpage or softwood 
resources from crown land.  The Americans have said that they 
will consider that a subsidy and they want quotas, taxes or some 
kind of tariff on those four provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada, there is a completely different situation. 
In 1995 when the SLA was negotiated, 61% of all the softwood 
exports from Atlantic Canada came from private woodlots, much the 
same as the lumber industry in the United States.  The American 
industry said the four provinces in Atlantic Canada operated the 
same way as it did, so it said it did not require a quota and 
would not impose taxes or tariffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, over the last five or six years those provinces have 
increased that percentage from 61% to 74.5% in order to address 
the concerns of the American industry and maintain their 
position, because under the maritime accord the four Atlantic 
provinces have, they virtually have total free trade, exactly as 
this bill calls for.  It is free trade and protection from 
litigation, which perhaps is actually even better than free trade 
because of the protection part of it.

by the American industry and government and are under no 
obligations or restrictions at all.  They are not part of the 
maritime accord or of the SLA, but they are there and do ship 
smaller quantities of lumber but of an excellent quality, 
especially from Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would certainly agree with the motion, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House support the government's efforts to restore free 
trade agreement rules for lumber and inform the United States 
that it rejects any obstacle to the free trade process.

establishing quotas and trade barriers”.  We are against quotas.

export tax imposed by the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are free traders as a party.  We are the party that brought 
free trade to the country and to the North American continent. 
As a region we are free traders now in the softwood lumber 
business. I am from the maritimes and our region is a free 
trading region. We have free trade now under the maritime accord. 
The provinces are adamant that they keep that free trade 
agreement in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic provinces are very concerned that, under the 
current scenario of negotiations and all the things that are 
going on behind the curtains which we do not know about, the 
government may be trading away some of these things because we 
really do not know what it is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My biggest fault with the government on the issue is that it has 
not gained consensus in the country.  It has pitted the west 
against the east.  We have two completely different positions and 
then another one in the middle.  I believe that in any 
negotiation we must get all our ducks in a row on our own side 
before we can start negotiating with the other side.  The 
government has made little or no effort to reconcile these 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western provinces under the SLA want to do away with the SLA 
and establish free trade.  The maritimes are already under the 
maritime accord, which is total free trade.  It is a different 
position.  There has been no attempt that I know of to try to 
reconcile these positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the B.C. Lumber Trade Council comes to Ottawa to give 
its side of the position and lobbies hard for it.  The Maritime 
Lumber Bureau comes from Atlantic Canada with Diana Blenkhorn, 
the chairman and CEO of the Maritime Lumber Bureau, and presents 
its side.  Bob Plecas comes from British Columbia and presents 
his side.  The problem is that we are going into the negotiations 
divided.  The government does not have a clear mandate on what to 
do because it has not got consensus from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime provinces have tried hard to address the concerns 
of their customer, the American market.  They have dealt with the 
private woodlot sector.  They have increased their percentage of 
production from private woodlots.  In my view the maritimes have 
earned free trade, deserve free trade, have free trade now and 
should keep free trade as the motion prescribes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is the motion.  The efforts of the government are 
not clear because the rumours are that the government is 
negotiating or considering imposing an export tax.  One of the 
rumours is that some of the western provinces' industry 
representatives are down in the U.S. lobbying them to pressure 
Canada to apply an export tax.  There is even a tentative formula 
floating around of 10% next year for an export tax, 5% the next 
year and 0% the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is yet another concern in this whole environment that the 
government is rushing into something to try to avoid any dispute 
as the free trade agreement of the Americas approaches.  It does 
not want outstanding issues with our number one trading partner. 
If we cannot resolve issues with our number one trading partner 
how can we expand to free trade of the Americas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much afraid that the government will not get a 
consensus or an agreement from all the provinces, and that it 
will dive into something just for the purpose of coming up with a 
tentative temporary deal to overcome the embarrassment of going 
into the free trade agreement of the Americas without an 
agreement with our number one trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just gone through the Brazilian beef issue, which I and 
most Canadians do not think was handled well.  It seemed to be a 
knee-jerk reaction to another industry's situation completely but 
the government applied it to Brazilian beef and banned Brazilian 
beef. 
However, an hour after the U.S. lifted its ban, Canada was forced 
to lift its ban.  This shows that there is total mismanagement 
and a total lack of thought and planning.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement and all trade agreements are critical for the 
whole country but we are afraid the government will take the same 
knee-jerk reaction approach that it took on the beef and apply it 
to the softwood lumber issue in order to avoid embarrassment at 
the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many rumours and proposals floating around now that 
it is very disconcerting to all of us.  Every day in the House, 
when members ask the trade minister, the Prime Minister or the 
parliamentary secretary about free trade, whoever stands to 
answer says that nobody in Canada wants to go back to the 
previous arrangements and the previous agreements.  We take 
exception to that because it is not exactly right.  Four Atlantic 
premiers, that is four out of six provinces, have written and 
signed letters to the Prime Minister saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to continue the current agreement and arrangements would 
have a devastating impact on our region's softwood lumber 
industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four premiers go on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respectfully request Canada take the steps to—ensure no 
lapse in this important and strategic arrangement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, the minister and even the Prime 
Minister continue to stand and say that nobody in the country 
wants the agreement extended.  There has been no effort to try to 
reconcile the differences between the different ends of the 
country.  The Atlantic provinces clearly want the maritime accord 
renewed and continued, yet the minister stands and says that 
nobody wants the arrangement restored and continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the responsibility totally on the Minister for 
International Trade for not reconciling these differences before 
he goes into trade negotiations with another country.  We have a 
split in Canada that has not been reconciled.  I do not know how 
we can go into a debate with another country without having all 
our own country's industries onside and going in one direction. 
There is no leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about free trade, Atlantic Canada has had free 
trade with the United States in softwood lumber since 1842. Under 
the Webster—Ashburton treaty signed in 1842 we have had free 
access to that market.  Atlantic Canada has always had free 
access to that market.  When the dust settles at the end of the 
little negotiation we are about to enter, we will still want free 
trade with the United States.  We want the rest of the country to 
have free trade as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want an export tax in Canada.  We do not want to be 
subject to countervail.  We do not want to be subject to 
anti-dumping.  All these are possibilities if the government does 
not take action and at least get the Canadian side organized and 
get some consensus so that we can negotiate from a position of 
strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is absolutely critical to the Conservative Party. 
Atlantic Canada delivers about $1 billion worth of softwood 
lumber a year to the U.S., with a total market from Canada of $11 
billion.  It is a very important market to Atlantic Canada.  It 
is absolutely critical to us.  It is critical that Atlantic 
Canada keep the free trade arrangement it has now.  It is 
important that the rest of the country establish free trade with 
the United States as well, but not at the jeopardy of the area 
that already has free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party is not satisfied that the government even 
recognizes the differences in the two parts of the country.  We 
are not sure the government understands how the maritime accord 
even works.  Government members never acknowledge it when they 
answer questions in the House.  The bottom line is that they have 
never reconciled the differences between the two parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard the expression, united we stand, divided we 
fall, and right now we are already divided before we go into the 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party supports the motion to honour and respect the rules of 
free trade.  We do not want quotas or trade barriers but we also 
do not want an export tax charged by Canada on softwood exports 
to the U.S.   Many of us feel the government is leaning that way, 
providing a tax against our softwood lumber exports to the United 
States in order to avoid embarrassment at the free trade 
agreement of the Americas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada should stand up for free trade but it 
should not bargain away our right to ship softwood lumber to the 
U.S. by saying that we will have a 10% export tax now, a 5% 
export tax next year and a 0% export tax the next year.  Some 
have even suggested that it may be 20% to 22%, which would be 
absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government, before it even starts negotiations, 
which it probably already has started, to pull the industry 
together in Canada and get a consensus before it tries to 
negotiate in the U.S.  If not, we will have a hodgepodge of 
agreements again as we do now.  We have three different 
agreements in Canada.  It makes no sense.  It is very difficult 
to monitor and even difficult to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my party will be supporting the motion, as 
amended, which would avoid any trade barriers or quotas and would 
extend the rules of free trade in the softwood lumber industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening to the hon. member talk about the case as it 
affects the Atlantic provinces.  It is called the maritime 
agreement but it is understood that it also includes 
Newfoundland.  When we refer to the four provinces, we locally 
call them the Atlantic provinces, but in this case all four fall 
under the maritime agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about perhaps renewing the maritime agreement 
or that we should have complete free trade.  Would the member 
give us an example of the difference, if there is a difference, 
between what the maritime agreement provides now for the people 
in that area and what free trade across the board would do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague asked an 
interesting question about the maritime accord and where the name 
came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name came from the United States.  The United States 
considers anything east of Quebec in Canada to be the maritimes. 
However the maritimes consists only of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
and P.E.I.  The Atlantic provinces include Newfoundland. In this 
case there is an aberration where the maritime accord refers to 
all four Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritime accord provides the maritimes, the four Atlantic 
provinces, with total free trade and access to the U.S. There are 
no quotas, no tariffs and no limit.  Not only that, it provides 
protection against litigation for anti-dumping and countervail 
charges which could be brought by the American industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an excellent agreement.  It provides access to the 
American market for Atlantic Canada.  It provides thousands of 
jobs in Atlantic Canada.  It has allowed for a vibrant, strong 
industry that can compete next to American lumber producers head 
to head under the same circumstances.  As I said earlier, 74.5% 
of our softwood lumber exports come from private woodlots, quite 
similar to the experience in the United States. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first, I congratulate the member for Cumberland—Colchester.  He 
has been a very effective voice on this issue in the House.  He 
has, on numerous occasions, tried to draw out of the government 
the position it is trying to put forward with respect to the 
softwood lumber agreement but he has not been successful.  He 
indicated today in his speech that not all the provinces believe 
what the Prime Minister and the Minister for International Trade 
have been saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will pose a question to the hon. member.  We 
recognize that the position the hon. member has taken is that 
there should be open borders, free trade, no excise taxes and no 
quota systems.  We all seem to feel that the right way for trade 
within North America is free trade across an open border between 
the United States and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is the major lobby group in opposition to this free trade, 
in the United States particularly?   Who is opposing this open 
borders concept?  Who will this have an impact on should an 
excise tax be placed on softwood lumber going across the border? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those are good questions. 
He is obviously a very intelligent and thoughtful member from 
Manitoba where there is a lot of clear, cold air.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is opposing the free trade agreement in the United States? 
The industry in the U.S. is opposing it.  The system in the U.S. 
is guaranteed to have opposition from the U.S. industry.  If the 
U.S. industry is successful on April 2, which I think it will be, 
it will lobby its government to charge Canada or the Canadian 
industry both countervail duties and anti-dumping charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the U.S. government is successful in imposing those 
countervail duties and anti-dumping charges, all the money will 
go to the industry that filed the complaint in the first place. 
Why would the industry not file a complaint against Canada if we 
go into free trade?  We strongly believe that on April 2 they 
will file the application for countervail duties and anti-dumping 
charges unless the Canadian government comes up with some kind of 
interim agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so unfair.  The industry in the U.S. has a tremendous 
incentive to apply for countervail duties and anti-dumping 
charges.  It will get the benefit if the charges are levied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who is being impacted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  A lot of people are being impacted.  In 
the U.S. consumers are now starting to complain because they like 
Canada's softwood lumber.  They like the quality, the price and 
the availability of it.  If Canadian lumber is restricted then it 
will drive up the price of all American building products and 
will have an impact on U.S. consumers.

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today on an issue that is extremely important of course 
for a region like mine, the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, but 
also for the whole province of Quebec and for a number of 
regions across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a major exporter of lumber. Lumber ranks among our 
greatest resources. 
We have been engaged in a trade dispute with the United States 
for some 20 years. Given the escalation in the means used, 
we should clarify this whole issue once and for all and support 
our industry to the end, so that this sector like many others 
is covered by a true free trade policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is proposing the motion today to show 
solidarity with an industry that has succeeded in building a 
very strong coalition, which shows that people are prepared for 
comprehensive and global free trade. These people are prepared 
to begin to play, on April 1, by rules that should have been in 
place for quite some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not review the whole history of this issue, but since 
1982 the Americans have challenged on a number of occasions 
the fact that the Canadian industry was subsidized, using all 
kinds of recourses in the process. This situation was primarily 
due to a different approach, since in Canada large areas of 
forest and land are publicly owned, while in the United States 
they are privately owned. The Americans have always felt that 
stumpage fees were perhaps too low and they have used that 
argument to claim that our industry was thus being subsidized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have made that claim wherever they could, including in the 
United States, but not exclusively. They won a number of cases 
internally, but when the time came to clarify the matter before 
organizations other than those pressured by the American lobby 
or by the U.S. industry, their claims were never validated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a variety of reasons, this led the Government of Canada to 
sign agreements on two occasions with the American government, 
the protocols of which included acceptance of a system limiting 
our ability to sell our products freely on the U.S. market.  The 
first of these was in 1991 and the second in 1996.  It was to 
run for five years, terminating on March 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past five years, the current system has included quotas. 
Of course, even if the government wanted to recognize past 
production, a quota system creates problems for us in that it is 
too discretionary as to who has or does not have the right of 
production.  Some benefit from the quotas on what we are 
entitled to produce, without falling victim to the drastic 
American measures.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many members have had this experience, but I 
and many others have heard complaints from people in our regions 
that they did not have a big enough quota or were not given any 
at all.  This creates problems for new players in the market. 
Lacking quotas, they are at a disadvantage compared to those who 
do have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we end up with an economic system in which highly 
arbitrary choices influence the capacity of certain industries 
to develop and prevent others from developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for the government to stand up and vigorously 
defend Canadian and Quebec producers.  Just to remind the House 
briefly, so we understand what we are talking about, the 
industry in Quebec produces about 25% of Canada's output.  I am 
giving figures for Quebec, but you will no doubt hear members 
from other areas during the day telling you how important this 
industry is for their region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry in Quebec produces seven billion board feet. 
Production is measured in board feet.  There are over 30,000 
jobs linked to the lumber industry in Quebec.  The sawmill 
industry accounts for 20,000 jobs and the forestry industry, 
10,000.  This industry is important in a number of 
municipalities, as we can see from the figures given this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 250 municipalities in Quebec where all of the 
manufacturing sector jobs are related to this sector.  There are 
250 municipalities.  We are therefore talking about something 
really important to many communities throughout Quebec, and I am 
sure that this is true in many other regions in Canada.  It is 
very common to have a lumber business as the major activity in a 
village with, of course, a few other economic activities about. 
But the manufacturing sector is where we have to keep improving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ability to export lumber does not excuse us from other 
issues, such as better processing our products, producing more 
value added products or better using our natural resource.  All 
of this is an extremely important issue we must not lose sight 
of.  But trade rules must be the same for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that, when I was first elected in 1993, I had the 
opportunity to have discussions with Tembec Inc., a major player 
in that industry back home. On the general topic of free trade, 
officials from that company said “Yes, this is one way free 
trade. The Americans really like having access to our market, 
while it is very difficult for us to have access to theirs”. 
They were referring to all these problems they were experiencing 
in their industry or foreseeing because of the complex situation 
and the numerous challenges by the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Americans are very good at extolling the virtues of free trade. 
They will do exactly that at the Summit of the Americas. They 
will make great speeches in support of a market covering all the 
Americas. But it is another story when they are confronted to 
realities like the one where part of their industrial sector 
could be threatened by the very productive companies we have 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, we always talk about productivity gaps 
between Canadians and Americans, but there are sectors, like 
mining and logging, where our productivity rates are excellent. 
We too often forget to mention that. Whatever we may think and 
despite the fact that traditional economy has been run down and 
called “old economy”, there have been massive investments in 
the natural resources sector. Such sectors are often among the 
most productive in the Quebec and Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in these sectors want access to the U.S. market just as 
much as the Americans want free access to ours. 
That is what free trade is all about.  But we are familiar with 
this tendency of the Americans to say one thing and, in practice, 
to block free trade.  This is one area where the Government of 
Canada will have to stand behind an industry. There are major 
legal battles on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain provinces are being accused of dumping.  There is again 
talk of challenges because this industry is subsidized.  The 
government must not abdicate its responsibilities towards the 
industry in this battle.  It must not negotiate any sort of 
transitional agreement whatsoever.  This is one thing that 
worries us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government clarified its position, but there was a 
suggestion of hesitation when it said there would be a transition 
towards free trade.  No transition is necessary.  On April 1, we 
will be in a free trade position.  This means that businesses 
will be in a new phase; admittedly, some will have a transition 
to make, but we do not want a transitional agreement.  We want 
full free trade and we want the government to mount a strong 
defence of our industry in these battles, to be there for us and 
to take the lead, so that we do not find ourselves in the 
situation we have been in for several years now. The result of 
arbitrary decisions has been that some companies have been able 
to grow while others have not, and some have been limited in what 
they could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an excellent test of the effectiveness of the Minister 
for International Trade.  We will see whether or not he is up to 
the task.  He has everything he needs to succeed. The industry 
is strong and parliament will be very solidly behind him, I am 
sure, with the Bloc Quebecois motion moved today. He has a 
responsibility to succeed.  The Government of Canada must 
succeed because this industry is extremely important to our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course things will be heated for a while, because the 
Americans will make all sorts of threats, but we must follow 
through so that we do not find ourselves having to make this same 
argument every five years. We must resolve this once and for all, 
clarify the situation, and enter fully into free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have every confidence that our industry will do well in these 
circumstances and that our economy will be able to grow further.

<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I compliment the Bloc member on his 
speech.  He described many of the problems Quebec has in the same 
terms that I would describe the problems in British Columbia. 
Half of the $11 billion trade in Canadian wood comes from British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to what the member said, it seems to me, though, 
that the main problem is simply the inability of Americans to 
want to compete with us on fair ground and the inability of the 
Canadian government to handle a consistent and well thought out 
trade position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the farming communities that we represented on the 
streets in Ottawa yesterday.  Their lifeblood is being drained 
away trying to compete against subsidies.  I think of the dumping 
of apples in British Columbia.  I think of the recent Brazilian 
meat kerfuffle and a poorly thought out position by the Canadian 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has perhaps the highest efficiency lumber mills in the 
world.  These mills do not only put out a train car of lumber a 
day.  Medium size mills put out a trainload of lumber and know 
the value of every stick on the train as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that we have difficulty with stumpage.  This lie is 
being propagated by those who do not wish to compete on a fair 
playing field.  There is no advantage in stumpages for our 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have long roads over high mountains and deep swamps.  We have 
the high costs of getting the raw materials to our mills.  We 
have a situation now where mills are faced with an unfortunate 
choice because the weight restrictions are already on roads in 
British Columbia.  The mills have yards full of logs and the 
unfortunate choice of having to mill them at a loss or leaving 
them stacked in the mill yards and swallowing the costs of 
getting them there.  No one is making money in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the government to think about what it is doing and 
to understand that the issue is competition.  It is hard to 
compete against people who benefit.  It is not hard to understand 
how they avoid wanting to compete when the duties that Canada 
pays go as cash into their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, what specific proposals would the member have for 
Quebec?   They may be reminiscent of what we would need in 
British Columbia.  What specific proposals would he have for the 
federal government as it talks to our U.S. trading partners about 
the issue?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin by answering the 
question, and then I will make comments.  The answer is simple. 
What we are asking the federal government is nothing 
complicated: true free trade and nothing else.  It is the basis 
for the best solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pick up on some of the points raised by the 
Canadian Alliance member.  The lumber industry is a highly 
productive industry, both in Quebec and in British Columbia.  I 
am pleased to be able to repeat this.  There has been much talk 
of the new economy over the past 10 years or so, but our 
traditional resource sectors are now consumers of new 
technologies. 
These are highly productive sectors and perhaps among the best 
adapted to the integration of these modern new development 
concepts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are, therefore, highly productive sectors.  It is not our 
problem that the Americans cannot compete with us.  In the case 
of Quebec, we know that the figure was, if I remember correctly, 
0.01%, the last time we checked the industry subsidy.  We are 
talking of something that is marginal to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our prices are lower, it is not because of a subsidy but 
because of our efficiency.  The federal government needs to tell 
the American government now that there will be no more 
foolishness of signing agreements right and left, and thus 
hindering trade in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how the Minister of Industry took pride in 
announcing, in connection with a trade dispute with Brazil, that 
it was high time that Canada stopped acting like a Boy Scout in 
the conflict between Bombardier and Embraer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same in this case also.  It is time for 
Canada to start acting like a true partner to the industry, to 
move to true free trade once and for all, and not to bow to the 
pressures exerted by the Americans during the period of 
turbulence that is coming when there will be but one objective: 
for free trade to start up on April 1 and just keep on going and 
going. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like my 
colleague, I congratulate the member for 
Joliette, for initiating this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also scandalized, a bit like the member for Burnaby—Douglas 
earlier, that an issue as important as this is being raised 
today, two weeks before the end of the agreement, two weeks 
before free trade resumes and by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an important matter as this should have been given special 
attention by the House, debated and treated with something 
besides arrogance on the part of the government when we ask 
questions about it.  It should have been responded to in a way 
that at least gives impression the issue is being addressed, if 
forestry workers are not given full satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked questions on lumber in the House, we had the 
impression the issue was a bit embarrassing or that it did not 
concern us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, thanks to my colleague from Joliette, we are 
having an indepth debate and we can show just how important this 
matter is.  It is important for Quebec and for the 
rest of Canada.  As we have just said, what does it mean 
for Quebec?  It means 30,000 jobs, including 10,000 in the 
forest.  This matter is doubly important for my 
riding of Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we will be celebrating the 350th anniversary of the 
city and the region of Cap-de-la-Madeleine.  We are at the start. 
The forest is part of our culture, part of our past and will be 
part of our future if properly handled.  My riding includes the 
city of La Tuque, in the north. 
Each time there is talk of American dissatisfaction over lumber, 
I can say the workers around La Tuque are not particularly happy 
with the situation.  They do not like it a whole lot.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I travelled around that region. They begged me to 
press the minister to do his best to defend this cause. He 
should stop saying in the House that he has everything under 
control if he is to come back after a meeting with the Americans 
and say that he is a bit discouraged by the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mauricie region depends on the wood industry, on softwood 
lumber. Our industries have managed to adapt. Our industries are 
financially viable. As my colleague said earlier, perhaps the 
Americans are afraid because we adapted a bit quicker than they 
did. However we must now have the opportunity to compete 
freely. We can be replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sources say that the wood industry in general, especially the 
softwood lumber industry which is the object of today's debate, 
involves some 250 communities in the province of Quebec. Most of 
the 27 communities in my riding are concerned by the softwood 
lumber issue. I hope the minister will understand. Even if we do 
not obtain unanimous consent from the House, I hope we will give 
the minister a clear enough mandate for him to stand up and 
avoid weakening his position. To this end there is nothing else 
to do but to come back to free trade as of April 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read again the motion of the member 
for Joliette: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House support the government will [—] 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to underline the word will, because I was wondering if 
the will was there. I have faith in the Prime Minister who 
seemed to be saying yesterday that the will was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion goes on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the government—in its efforts to restore free trade agreement 
rules for lumber and inform the United States that it rejects 
any obstacle to that free trade process. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us is extremely important. In the riding of 
Champlain and in the Mauricie region, history is closely related 
to the forest. I remember the fight that I personally led in the 
late seventies, as a member of the national assembly, regarding 
the closure of pulp and paper mills. At the time, Trois-Rivières 
was considered the world capital of pulp and paper. We held our 
ground and we modernized the plants, thanks to René Lévesque, 
who believed in the importance of unconditional government 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lévesque used to say that the broadest possible consensus 
was needed to protect such an important industry. When we ask 
the minister about this issue, I would appreciate it if we could 
get answers other than those that we were given yesterday, and I 
am not only referring to this specific issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, when we put questions to one minister, another would 
reply. Then, when we would ask a question to the second 
minister, the first one would provide the answer. We were 
treated as if we had no right to speak in the House, as if 
democracy did not exist. Today's motion seeks to strengthen the 
minister's resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a great poet, Félix Leclerc, who was born in La Tuque and 
spent his childhood there. Another great performer, Sol, our 
national hobo, did a show to pay tribute to Félix Leclerc, after 
he had passed away. Sol ended his show by saying “This great and 
extraordinary poet of ours finally made us realize one thing: to 
become a giant, one has to stand up”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the minister to stand up and to protect our lumber 
industry with all his energy. This morning, we are giving him 
our support, so that the people in La Tuque, Saint-Tite, the 
Mauricie and all of Quebec will know that everything will be 
done to protect their jobs in the lumber industry, and that the 
Americans will realize that, as of April 1, it is free trade and 
nothing else.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to compliment my Bloc 
Quebecois colleague for his speech.  It reminds me again that so 
many of the difficulties that Quebec experiences with the federal 
government are the same difficulties that we in British Columbia 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of 27 communities in his constituency, a majority of 
which depend upon the wood industry.  I am not competing with him 
in any sense, but in my constituency which is more than 120,000 
square kilometres in size with 36 communities, there is not one 
of us who does not depend upon the forest industry.  This is an 
extremely important issue for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our minds it is an issue of fair competition.  We believe 
that we have taken up the challenge of competing fairly and now 
we are being castigated because we have outdone our competitors 
in the United States.  We have the most efficient mills in the 
world not because they came cheaply or easily, but because of the 
kind of wood we have in the forests and because of the kind of 
difficulties with which we have to compete.  This includes the 
kind of equipment that we have and the kind of personnel we have 
to recruit, train and employ.  We are able to compete very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say we are not competing fairly is more than wrong.  It is a 
falsehood being promoted by people who would rather make profits 
by making false accusations than competing fairly.  We have 
mountains called Pike's Peak.  To bring in the lumber, truckers 
go up one mountain they call Heaven because it is so far away and 
so difficult to get to.  Those are the kind of difficulties we 
have overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come through a period of softwood quotas where some of 
the major companies have made it through fairly well but not 
easily.  There is no room for expansion for those who would like 
to grow.  We have had a very difficult time.  Now we are coming 
to a period where we are talking about countervailing duties and 
anti-dumping penalties that will make it even more difficult for 
those who are already losing money.  This is the difficulty we 
face.  We need fair competition and free trade so that we can 
compete fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the presence of the foreign trade minister who is in the 
House today, what recommendations would my colleague make so our 
foreign trade people can take to Washington a consistent, clear 
and urgent message that free trade with Canada depends not only 
upon wood, but upon the whole spectrum of free trade? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. When he talks about the competitiveness of the workers 
of his province, and the same goes for Quebec workers, he is 
right to say that some industries are able to face competition. 
In this sense, this is why free trade is beneficial for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech, one must have the energy, the 
willingness and the strength to succeed. To my knowledge this 
strength is also to be found in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers who have such issues to contend with should submit 
them to us for discussion, to obtain the support of parliament 
and make use of its strength, so that they can meet with the 
Americans and tell them that we are almost unanimously in favour 
of free trade. There must be free trade because this has been 
negotiated. It has to happen now. No barrier is acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member 
for Vancouver Quadra whose contributions to this very difficult 
file have helped the government a lot.  I thank him for his work 
on this file. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in the House today and to respond to the 
opposition day motion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Joliette. Since the beginning of the 37th 
parliament the member and his party have often brought up the 
issue of softwood lumber in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already given an overview of Canada's position on lumber 
during oral question period in the House and from time to 
time to the media, but I am very glad to know that today all 
parliamentarians will have the opportunity to discuss one of the 
most important business issues for Canada, one that touches 
hundreds of communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian softwood lumber products are the largest group of 
products exported from Canada to the United States. In fact one 
out of every sixteen Canadians works in our forestry industry 
and is dependent, for his or her income, on the production and 
export of our forest products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada, from British Columbia to Newfoundland, at least 
half of the economic well-being of over 330 communities is 
dependent on the forest products industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's role in the production and export of lumber is unique. 
It represents 20% of lumber exports worldwide and 34% of lumber 
exports to the growing U.S. market. Our plants not only employ 
64,000 Canadians. They also provide housing to millions of people 
on this continent and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact last year we exported $10 billion worth of lumber to 
the United States, which is no small feat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement has had its good sides for our industry, but after 
five years we have come to realize that it also had its 
weaknesses. The industry in Canada and the U.S. have now agreed 
not to renew the 1996 agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to move away from managed trade in this industry and 
to turn toward what should already have been in place for a long 
time: free trade in softwood lumber. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Canadians want and deserve.  Regrettably it is also 
what the United States softwood lumber industry fears the most. 
We have recently seen American legislators propose resolution 
after resolution calling for further restrictions on Canadian 
exports to the United States.  I take this opportunity today, 
therefore, to put the issue into perspective by addressing what 
is really behind the U.S. industry's attack on our exports and 
the nature of the challenge we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. industry and some supporters in congress have long been 
mesmerized by their own rhetoric.  U.S. claims of subsidization 
are in fact no more true today than they have ever been.  Today I 
would like to focus on what are actually the five essential facts 
of Canadian softwood lumber trade with the United States.  These 
hard facts, which we all need to keep clearly in sight, will form 
the foundation of the Canadian position on softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the U.S. industry's position on softwood lumber is not 
based on any legitimate claim of unfair practices by Canada.  It 
is based on protectionism, pure and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada has a right under our trade agreements including 
a right of access to the United States softwood lumber market 
which the United States must recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Canadian forestry programs do not constitute subsidies to 
the Canadian industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, Canada is a leader in sustainable forest management 
practices.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the role of the Government of Canada is to safeguard the 
Canadian interest in the face of U.S. protectionism and to work 
toward free trade in this vital sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take each of these five points in turn.  First, it is 
good old protectionism that has always driven the United States 
industry position on softwood lumber.  We have heard U.S. claims 
that there will be a wall of wood coming from the north when the 
softwood lumber agreement expires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally Canadian lumber shipments to the United States 
arrive in April as demand for wood increases due to spring 
housing starts.  This is normal and is not a wall of wood from 
the north.  In reality what we could face is a wave of 
protectionism from the south washing over us on April 2.  This 
has been going on for nearly a century.  United States softwood 
lumber producers have always wanted to restrict Canadian exports. 
They have always wanted protectionism from Canadian competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are now interests in the United States that have 
taken a position against another round of protectionist measures 
in this sector.  American homebuilders and other consumers of 
softwood lumber are also calling for free trade, pointing to the 
adverse effects in the United States of reducing access to 
Canadian wood and the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. homebuilders claim that protectionism costs United States 
consumers $1,000 for every home built in that country.  This is a 
steep price to pay to protect the United States lumber industry. 
The fact is the United States needs and relies on our lumber.  It 
is not self-sufficient.  Second, et me talk about our rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second essential point has to do with the protectionist 
threats currently being uttered by the U.S., which go directly 
against our trade agreements, those of NAFTA and the World Trade 
Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already taken steps.  We have initiated two 
major dispute settlement proceedings at the WTO against the 
U.S., proceedings that directly affect lumber. 
What counts is that we are not prepared to allow the U.S. to 
concoct its own version of the rules established internationally 
or to choose which of their trade obligations they are prepared 
to honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most central point in the softwood lumber issue is as 
follows.  Throughout all our discussions about lumber, the U.S. 
has always alleged that the Canadian industry is subsidized. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Canadian industry 
is not subsidized by cutting rights or by any of our policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why despite several tries the Americans have never managed 
to get their subsidy allegations to stick.  In fact, their subsidy 
allegations have never been proven.  If they build another 
countervail case, we will defend ourselves against such 
allegations as we have in the past. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, let me address the question of forest management 
practises and the environment.  Once again the facts speak for 
themselves.  Canada, with 94% of forest land under public 
ownership, controls harvest levels so that forests are not 
depleted.  Canada grows twice as much wood as is harvested 
annually.  Less than one-half of 1% of Canada's commercial 
forests are harvested each year, well below sustainable harvest 
levels.  Canada, with more commercial forest land, cuts less than 
half of what is harvested in the United States each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple truth is that Canadian harvests are limited by annual 
allowable cuts that are based on the sustainable growth rate of 
the forest.  As recently as January, a joint survey conducted by 
the University of British Columbia and Yale University ranked 
Canada as one of the top three nations in environmental 
sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the Government of Canada's role is to safeguard Canadian 
interest.  During the past year I have consulted with Canadian 
industry from all regions of our country to hear its views on how 
to proceed next. 
I have asked Canadians at large through open dialogue their 
thoughts and ideas.  I have brought our stakeholders together to 
listen to what they had to say about our trade with the United 
States. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I met with representatives of all provincial and 
territorial governments in Ottawa to discuss their specific 
concerns and to determine together how we should proceed.  In an 
effort to bring all views forward and to continue our dialogue 
with our neighbour to the south, I met with United States trade 
representative Bob Zoellick in Washington a little more than 
three weeks ago.  At that time I presented Canada's case to the 
United States and proposed as a way to avoid our recent history 
of trade dispute on softwood lumber that both countries appoint 
envoys to provide governments with non-binding recommendations on 
solutions to this dispute. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work with all the stakeholders in Canada and 
to ensure that the interests of all of Canada's regions from 
British Columbia through Quebec to the Atlantic provinces will 
be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, even though we are working toward finding 
solutions, we will also affirm our rights under our trade 
agreements.  We are entitled to free trade.  We want free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I support a vigorous Canadian lumber sector, as 
do all members on both sides of the House.  This is why I will 
support the motion by the member for Joliette.  I encourage all 
members on both sides to do the same.  We must send a clear 
signal to the US that our House of Commons is united in its 
support for the Canadian lumber sector and let it be known that 
we will defend our rights under the international agreements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question 
for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to explain how it can be that in the United 
States when there is a dispute, when an appeal is won, and I 
presume the decision must be executed as in a regular court, it 
does not work that way for the Americans.  Even if they lose, 
they try a kind of blackmail on us and we end up forced to 
negotiate what is coming to us as a result of the decision by 
the trade tribunal.  I am not laying any blame whatsoever on 
anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like him to explain how, even if we win out, they 
will not comply unconditionally but come after us with other 
agreements on milk, eggs, yoghurt, margarine or mayonnaise.  Do 
the Americans only use free trade when it suits them?  That is 
what I would like explained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question 
is an extremely pertinent one.  That is why I expressed a degree 
of impatience after my discussions with the new representative 
of the Bush administration, Bob Zoelleck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who insist on repeating false statements, even 
when they know they are wrong.  This is the situation as far as 
the softwood lumber industry in the United States is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, whom I thank for his speech this 
morning, has clearly demonstrated that this is an issue of 
market share.  When the Americans see us with 30% of the market, 
that is okay, but the minute we start to pull ahead, because of 
the highly competitive nature of our industry with its 
modernized mills that are highly productive and therefore highly 
competitive, they try to rein us in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the international systems and tribunals provide us with 
recourse and the rule of law applies. 
In fact, their stubbornness leads them to use certain tactics, 
which are regrettable but which are part and parcel 
of the legal systems under which we live. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his remarks 
and I wish him well in the fight against American protectionism 
and the fight for free trade in this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister a somewhat technical question, 
but one that is very important in terms of jobs and the Canadian 
interest in this question.  As the minister will know, the lumber 
industry includes not just the primary sector but a secondary 
sector that is involved in remanufacturing of wood products, many 
of which are directed toward the United States. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will also know that this sector is very large.  It 
includes, I think, 300 independent producers in B.C., Alberta, 
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.  It employs over 40,000 Canadians 
annually.  Its production is about $4 billion annually in sales. 
The sector accounts for about 10% to 15% of Canada's exports to 
the U.S. under the current SLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will also know that group is actively working 
on the development of a transparent and enforceable process 
through which Canada's secondary sector can be, from an 
administrative perspective, effectively excluded from any 
countervailing duties or from any other restrictions imposed on 
Canadian softwood lumber exports to the U.S. either now or in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is, does the minister recognize the concerns of the 
secondary lumber sector and support its efforts to avoid injury 
when the current SLA comes to an end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for Calgary Southwest for his good wishes in this very difficult 
and complex file.  I trust that we will all be able to work 
together on it, opposition and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are very much aware of the differences between the 
primary producers and the secondary remanufacturing of wood.  In 
the last agreement a great deal of secondary re-manufactured 
products were included.  In our view, it is very important that 
American producers, when they act the way they are announcing 
they will act, have the same mentality and the same refinement in 
distinguishing it.  We will monitor that very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it will be up to U.S. producers, but n my view they 
should not have countervailing duties on any of the softwood, 
neither primary nor secondary groups.  We will demonstrate that 
such measures are not legitimate because we are not subsidizing 
any part of our sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it will be important to monitor closely what products 
the Americans attack or put under investigation in early April if 
they decide to go that route.  We will be able to demonstrate 
that we are not subsidizing either group, and we will do 
everything we can to protect both sides of the softwood lumber 
industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the minister will know, we strongly agree that the current 
softwood lumber agreement should not in any way be renewed and 
should be allowed to expire at the end of this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two very brief questions for the minister.  As the 
minister knows, I represent British Columbia.  One of the very 
serious concerns there is the dramatic increase in the volume of 
raw log exports from British Columbia.  In 1997 the amount was a 
little over 100,000 cubic metres.  Last year it was perhaps as 
much two million cubic metres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the government are under pressure from some 
forest companies to reduce current restrictions on raw log 
exports.  Will the minister make it clear to the 
House, to the people of Canada and particularly to the people of 
British Columbia that he will not in any way reduce restrictions 
on raw log exports and that in fact he will take steps to ensure 
there are even fewer raw logs exported? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, what is the response of the minister to the proposal by 
the B.C. minister of forests that he attempt to seek the 
appointment of a special envoy to negotiate a fair trade 
agreement with the United States so that we will not be into this 
destructive cycle of countervail, tariff and anti-dumping 
procedures after March 31? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assure the member 
that whatever we do about the log exports from British Columbia 
it will not be done under pressure from the United States.  Either 
the provinces or, as in the case of export control, the 
Government of Canada makes all the decisions for Canadian 
forestry practices.  However, whatever we do it will never be 
because of pressure from the United States on this file on which 
we feel very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thank the House for its support on this complex and difficult 
file.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the envoy, I had a conversation this morning with 
the British Columbia forest minister.  The envoy idea was put 
forward by our government.  It was not a suggestion the B.C. 
minister put forward but a suggestion our government put forward. 
I raised it with Bob Zoellick, the United States trade 
representative of the Bush administration.  He sounded skeptical 
at first but has not rejected the idea.  It could certainly allow 
us to have a calmer dialogue on facts, as I have tried to put in 
my own remarks.  It is a suggestion our government supports 
because we initiated it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too acknowledge how complex the situation is.  It has 
tremendous potential to be divisive for the country and may pit 
four of the provinces against the other six.  However we will 
work with the department if we are kept in the loop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of specific questions.  First, as the minister 
knows, the maritime accord gives Atlantic Canada true free trade 
and the four Atlantic premiers have asked for the maritime accord 
to be extended.  Will the minister assure the Atlantic provinces 
that any future agreement will assure the continuation of the 
free trade and protection from litigation that are provided under 
the maritime accord? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for the past 20 years 
the Atlantic provinces have been exempted from all quotas and any 
other restrictions the United States has imposed on the rest of 
our country.  We would like all of Canada to benefit from free 
trade with the United States.  We will fight very hard to 
maintain Atlantic Canada's complete access to the U.S. market.  I 
want the same for British Columbia and every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want free trade and we deserve free trade.  We hope very much 
that the Americans will respect Atlantic Canada as they have for 
the past 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Americans move in early April I hope they will not target 
the Atlantic provinces.  I hope they will recognize that the 
Atlantic provinces do not subsidize.  I also hope they will 
recognize the great history we have had in the past 20 years.  I 
would like the rest of the United States' producers to respect 
the rest of Canada as they have respected our Atlantic provinces 
in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  At this point I see there are still 
members rising.   I will put myself in the hands of the House as 
I believe I should, depending on the availability of the minister 
and the desire of the House to continue the questions to the 
minister.  We have more than generously used the question and 
comment period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Because this is such an incredibly important issue, and 
because the minister is here and has obviously said he would stay 
a little while, I would ask for unanimous consent 
of the House that we continue for as long as the minister may 
stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
very specific question for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently many Americans and a minority of Canadians in some 
industrial sectors think that to avoid a trade war with the U.S., 
Canada should voluntarily impose an export tax on its lumber sold 
in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to tell us if such an idea has been 
categorically rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
remain in the House a while longer. The only problem is that 
after question period, during which I will be available to answer 
questions from opposition members, I must appear before the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade. I 
do not think anyone could contend that the Minister for 
International Trade is not making himself totally available to 
his colleagues in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the question of the hon. member for Joliette, who 
is the seconder of today's motion, I will say that this was the 
solution Bob Zoellick suggested when I met him. He asked me if we 
would consider that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that there is absolutely no consensus 
that we should limit our access to the U.S. market through an 
export tax or any other means. There is absolutely no consensus 
in Canada for such a tax, which could be construed as an 
admission that we are subsidizing our industry, which, of course, 
we are not. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister's seeming 
support for this motion, but I have some questions to ask him 
about the fact that the government appears to have come 
considerably late to this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as three years ago in the softwood lumber agreement 
the signs and evidence of market distortion, the harm it was 
causing our industry and indeed the creation of the have and have 
not quota holders were becoming quite prominent.  It is only 
within the last several weeks that the minister and the 
government have been talking about this issue in a public 
fashion.  The minister may well have been talking to industry 
leaders over the last year but it has only been in the last 
several weeks that he has talked about it publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the Americans have beaten us to the punch and have 
come out with their sabre rattling.  We have had lots of time to 
work on this.  We have had as much as two or three years to try 
to drum up support south of the border for our position with the 
coalition of senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister and the government come so late to the 
party in a public way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am flabbergasted by 
the question because we have been working very hard at it for 
quite a few years.  If the opposition failed to ask me questions 
on the issue over the last few months and years, it is certainly 
not my fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been working in Washington through our embassy and 
through the lobbyists we have hired.  We have also been working 
with industry from all regions of Canada and with the provinces. 
We have helped build a coalition in Washington of home builders 
and consumers.  We have built strong arguments and cases that we 
have put forward time and again.  I can tell the member that our 
government is ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we have come to the House if an agreement that would 
be terminated March 31 was the wish of everyone?  I do not know 
how I could have come to the House without having done exactly 
what we have been doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus that we let the agreement terminate.  I can 
tell the member that we have mustered all the support we could in 
Washington.  We have consulted and maintained a united front on 
the Canadian industry both with the provinces and the industries 
themselves.  We are in much better shape to meet the challenges 
that are awaiting us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
hon. colleague from the Bloc, the member for Joliette, asked the 
minister what his and the government's position was on the export 
tax.  The minister acknowledged that there was no consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was not whether there was consensus.  We recognize 
that there is not consensus.  I believe the question, certainly 
from my perspective, was whether the minister and the government 
supported an export tax and whether they would support an export 
tax as another way of buckling to U.S. pressure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think my answer to 
the earlier question was quite clear.  There is no such consensus 
in the country and the government reflects the consensus we have 
been building and working on.  We will not admit that we are 
subsidizing our industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for staying to take questions because it is an 
extremely important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not been able to participate in the debate, but there was 
a comment made about the have and have not provinces for quota 
holding.  The member who made that comment should take a look at 
some of the facts before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six provinces in Canada now enjoy free trade with the United 
States in softwood lumber.  In Atlantic Canada that goes back to 
the Webster-Ashburton treaty of 1842.  There is a lot of history 
in reciprocity of softwood lumber products between Maine and 
Atlantic Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have six out of ten provinces that enjoy free trade 
now it is the position of the Conservative Party that we should 
not be encompassing all six provinces with the other four that 
are suffering under a softwood lumber agreement.  We should be 
seeking free trade for those four provinces directly.  We could 
support that from our position.  I would like to hear the 
minister's position on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government stands 
for Canada, for the Canadian forestry industry.  We do not want 
the six provinces that have free trade right now to be subjected 
to quotas.  It is the last thing I would ever want.  I want to 
free the rest of the country from the restrictions and the quotas 
we have right now.  I want to free British Columbians, Albertans 
and Quebecers from the self-restrictions to which they have been 
subjected.  I want to keep our country united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to affect the Atlantic provinces and the 
privileged position they have had in the last five years.  I am 
glad for them.  It has served them well.  I am glad for the 
Atlantic provinces, but I want to fight to maintain a Canadian 
position and not play east against west or any other division.  I 
want Canada as a country to be united behind all our softwood 
lumber producers.  They deserve a free and total access to the 
United States market.  This is what American consumers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is my understanding that the House had agreed that we 
could ask short questions of the minister as long as he cared to 
stay.  I come from an area that would be devastated by this and I 
would very much like to ask a short question under the rules that 
we established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The rules were established as 
indicated by the hon. member but, as he has also mentioned, at 
the availability of the minister.  In one intervention not long 
ago he mentioned that he had to prepare for question period and 
that he had to testify as a witness at committee. The minister 
will be available all afternoon in these other forums, so I think 
we will have to resume debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest of respect, I know the hon. member for 
Cariboo—Chilcotin has been a very active participant in the 
debate since I have been in the chair and I suppose all day on 
this very important issue.  It is my understanding that the 
minister is not able to stay right now, so I will have to resume 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
join the Minister for International Trade in supporting the 
motion.  I also commend the Bloc Quebecois for the admirable 
dedication to the cause of Canadian unity that the resolution 
exemplifies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of subsidies in the free trade of softwood lumber to 
the United States is one that is dear to the hearts of all 
British Columbians.  It is an essential aspect of our economy and 
our social fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the difference between forest practices in the 
United States and Canada, which is at the heart of any claim to 
subsidization, it is a matter of whether we have private land or 
public land logging.  In Canada, as has been noted, 90% of 
logging is done on public land, with 10% on private land.  In the 
United States it is the other way around, with private logging 
making up 90% of its logging practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sustainability which the public demands in Canada of those 
logging practices is absolutely critical to the question of 
whether or not there are subsidies.  It is also critical to the 
health of the economy, society and environment of Canada. 
Sustainability depends on a balance among those things.  We 
simply will not have economic strength if we do not have social 
stability.  We will not have social stability unless we have 
environmental integrity.  We must keep those in balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to the debate as I have with great interest today, 
I have been taken by the amount of unity across the country that 
has been expressed by many hon. members from different parties. 
In that spirit I want to make my next statement very gently.  I 
simply observe that sometimes the failure from the left is that 
it believes government can do everything. 
Of course it cannot.  Sometimes there could be a failure of the 
right as well while properly mistrusting big labour and big 
government but not sufficiently mistrusting big business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is particularly ironic given the fact that so much faith is 
put in the marketplace.  The greatest threat to the marketplace 
and the cause of market failure is often uncompetitive practices 
and large monopolies.  In the spirit of what we are saying in the 
House, I should like to touch on those two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the economic issues, we have heard of the large 
importance to Canada as a whole of softwood lumber exports to the 
United States.  That is of particular interest and importance to 
British Columbia, making up approximately 47% of those exports, 
totalling almost $11 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues from Prince George—Bulkley Valley and 
Cariboo—Chilcotin have properly recognized the importance to 
their communities and resource based communities around British 
Columbia of sustainable support of this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forest industry in British Columbia has contributed greatly 
over the last decade to the forest management practices that we 
enjoy in British Columbia and demonstrate across Canada and 
around the world.  These are not subsidized.  Stumpage rates have 
been significantly increased, as well as forest practices over 
the past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the forest industry agreement in British Columbia, those 
extra stumpage charges have been dedicated to forest renewal, 
restoration of stream beds and replanting, new research in forest 
sensitive forest practices, retraining of forest workers into 
different jobs, and more sustainable practices.  They are also 
dedicated toward value added manufacturing which is to be the 
lifeblood of the future of diversified economies in resource 
dependent communities.  The forest industry resource based 
communities have all done their part in British Columbia to make 
sure that we continue to enjoy economic strength from this 
vitally important industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social stability in communities, in British Columbia and Canada 
as a whole is based on economic strength not only in resource 
based communities but for the general public.  The issues of 
health care, education, social structure and infrastructure are 
dependent on a strong economy.  The resource based economies, the 
forest industry above all, is the lifeblood of that economic 
strength in many parts of Canada, particularly British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the environmental balance which is so critically 
important and which underlies the strength of the argument that 
we do not have subsidies, certainly in British Columbia or 
anywhere else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the entire last century we have taken on the responsibility 
of the idea of sustainable yield logging.  However, in the last 
20 years, the meaning of what that total yield should be has 
changed as we have gone to integrated resource management.  We 
look to all interests of society in the integrity of the 
environment and to non-forest product uses for our forests.  This 
is reflected in the cost of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forest companies in British Columbia and across Canada are 
required to go through detailed planning processes that usually 
involve multiparty planning processes which adds considerably to 
their costs but to the balance to be brought to those multiple 
uses of the forests.  They must observe very high logging 
standards in terms of road building, stream side protection and 
reforestation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not deforest in Canada.  We replant all our forests. Those 
forests are not all the forests.  We protect other values like 
old growth values and parks.  We have doubled the amount of parks 
from 6% to 12% in British Columbia over the last eight years. 
This is one of the costs that goes into our logging practices 
which eliminates any argument of subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard comments and concerns, properly placed, that 
logging practices and subsidies to industry not destroy our 
environment.  The worry from the NDP is that perhaps free trade 
of the Americas, if not NAFTA, may contribute to the destruction 
of our forest ecosystems.  That need not be so and I do not 
believe it is so in British Columbia or across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have in NAFTA is an environmental parallel agreement for 
environmental co-operation which allows non-governmental 
organizations to challenge governments, in much the same way the 
hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas spoke of in international 
corporations challenging governments under chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
That is available under the commission for environmental 
co-operation at the NAFTA environmental commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look to Quebec City and free trade of the Americas, 
environment and labour conditions will be parallel agreements to 
any agreement that Canada signs.  In addition to those that are 
included in NAFTA, there will be agreements on human rights, 
democratic development and education.  Free trade of the Americas 
as negotiated in Quebec City will build on the experience of 
NAFTA, the importance of environmental integrity and the 
effective enforcement of environmental standards which Canada is 
bound by and which underline the non-subsidy in terms of our 
forest practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a healthy industry in the country.  We are economically 
and socially dependent upon it and it must continue.  I am very 
pleased to support the resolution for a Canadian unified position 
behind its forest industry with all the integrity it practises to 
accomplish fair trade access to American markets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver 
Quadra for his comments and for his knowledgeable participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people have a lot to say about British Columbia and 
about the rest of our country, particularly in other forums.  For 
example, I recently received a copy of a letter from the German 
Tourism Bureau expressing concern about the use of our land mass. 
It does not think it should send tourists to Canada or to British 
Columbia because of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also aware that there are stories about a mythical land of 
the Great Bear Rain Forest.  A bear with a gene mutation that is 
white rather than brown or black has spiritual qualities and is 
called the spirit bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What effort is the Government of Canada making to influence our 
position in this trade difficulty with American consumers?  We 
have a toehold there.  We have heard that retail marketers do not 
want to have duties imposed.  They want to have free trade.  We 
understand those consumers would like to have free trade because 
houses are $1,000 or $1,300 more with the duties applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Government of Canada doing to promote our position 
and put down the falsehoods, the untruths and even the lies that 
are being told about how we produce lumber and look after our 
crown lands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question.  The Minister for International Trade gave 
quite an account of the list of initiatives over the last number 
of years that the Government of Canada has taken to build a 
coalition of support in Washington to advance the argument the 
hon. member is mentioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the consumer interest of the United States public 
in avoiding what in effect is a tax on house building of over 
$1,000 U.S. per household is something that should and is being 
brought forward and a coalition built around it.  The Government 
of Canada has been working hard over the last two years to build 
a coalition within Canada to work with forest product companies 
and their legal advisers to prepare and advance the argument as 
effectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 years the Government of Canada has demonstrated 
its zeal in promoting a unified Canadian interest in the softwood 
trade by aggressively arguing against countervails in the past 
and winning those arguments before international trade tribunals. 
The government has expressed its strong intention to continue 
aggressively on that course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague made an interesting comment regarding the 
Great Bear Rain Forest.  I think of it as the central and 
mid-coast of British Columbia and outstanding old growth forests. 
When we look at free trade in softwood products we must think of 
marketplace democracy as well, which not only works in favour of 
forest companies but in favour of the environment.

trade in order to underline the importance of it.  Marketplace 
democracy has played a large part in the largest forest companies 
in British Columbia.  Sitting down with the largest environmental 
groups and working out a joint solution to logging practice on 
the west coast will be demonstrably at the forefront of those

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you and the minister for allowing us to have 
an extended question period on this topic.  That was a noble 
gesture by both yourself and the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for my colleague from Vancouver Quadra has 
to do with the linkage of free trade and the softwood lumber 
agreement with other sectors of trade.  That spectre was raised 
by the Prime Minister, but there were some contradictory comments 
made by other ministers of the crown.  Would the member agree 
with the notion that was raised by the Prime Minister that 
perhaps we should link the free trade agreement with other 
sectors, such as energy, or should we not go down that route? 
What would his opinion be on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of linkages is 
an important one and, of course, our trade relationship with the 
United States, quite apart from anything that might be negotiated 
under the free trade agreement of the Americas, exists under 
NAFTA and our joint membership in the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our relationship with the United States under NAFTA includes 
being parties to the North American agreement on environmental 
co-operation and labour co-operation.  We already that linkage 
that would bear on our free trade arguments with respect to 
softwood lumber under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look beyond that to the other 32 countries of the 
hemisphere, and the Prime Minister spoke to this, it is important 
for us to understand that while there are great benefits to be 
had by society in all countries through freer trade and the 
development and increased wealth that comes from it, those will 
not actually be achieved unless there is some requisite level of 
human dignity and human rights in those countries, unless they 
have some sort of democratic support for the policies of those 
countries, and unless they have some sort of level of labour 
standards and environmental integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our interest is not just in free trade, although that is an 
essential part of democracy and liberalism, but it is also a 
precondition to the necessary stability in the rules of law and 
the rules based system that will allow us to trade with other 
countries in a successful way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
just like me, you sense the determination that characterizes the 
Bloc Quebecois and its members when the time comes to discuss an 
issue that is at the core of Quebec's economic vitality, since it 
concerns our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I clearly remember that when the current Quebec premier was the 
Minister for International Trade he said in his policy statement 
that Quebec was a trading nation. When that statement was made, 
40% of Quebec's production was exported. This percentage has 
since increased, because that was some years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot debate the motion before us without paying tribute to 
the hon. member for Joliette, who proposed it and made us aware 
of the importance of not renewing the Canada-U.S. trade agreement 
on lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Joliette for showing tenacity, for 
displaying extreme perseverance, and particularly for being a 
good teacher. This issue could be debated strictly in boring 
economical terms, but it is one of the great strengths of the 
member for Joliette to always succeed in showing both the 
economic and human dimensions of the issues for which he is 
responsible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank him and I hope that all the political parties in the 
House will support his motion, which is not a partisan 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of which side members may sit in the House, they can 
support this motion. Why? This motion says three things: 
there is a natural resource; there is an economic 
resource to be exported; and there are producers who have complied 
with the rules of the game. This is what we must discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though they followed the rules, producers were prejudiced 
by the imposition of a countervailing duty that should not have 
been imposed. 
Let us start by establishing the importance of the lumber 
sector in Quebec's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, before getting to the heart of the matter, I hope 
that we can count on all the political parties represented in the 
House to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say as well and without any partisan overtones 
that we have a few grievances against the Minister for 
International Trade.  Despite his support for the motion—he is 
redeeming himself but barely—we must include in the equation 
when we discuss these issues the fact that the Government of 
Canada has shown itself to be a miserable defender of Quebec's 
interests in the matter of lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for the vigilance of the member for Joliette and 
his colleagues, we might think that the government would be 
tempted to renew an agreement that was once again prejudicial 
to Quebec lumber producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can rest assured that things will not happen that way 
because the Bloc Quebecois is here and we want to pass on the 
baton to all those wanting to work with us in defending the 
interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have the full attention of the Chair, I want to tell the 
Speaker that Quebec is the second largest provincial producer of 
lumber in Canada, with 25.5% of production.  It is therefore easy 
to understand the importance of the Bloc Quebecois motion in 
keeping with the mandate to provide a strong defence of the 
interests of Quebec, a mandate we received in a resounding 
majority in the latest election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is the second largest producer of softwood lumber, with 
approximately seven billion cubic metres a year.  I think that 
the importance of this sector for Quebec is well understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a matter of production.  There is also the 
matter of keeping jobs.  That is why the member for Joliette was 
so eloquent and appealed to us as parliamentarians to vote in 
favour of this motion.  If this agreement is not renewed and 
Quebec's softwood lumber producers are allowed to return to a 
full free trade position, over 30,000 jobs in the softwood lumber 
industry will be on the line. That figure was for 1999, so it 
is extremely current. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still bearing in mind the member for Joliette's wish to present 
the latest statistics, I remind the House that 20,430 
people were employed in the sawmill industry and 10,000 in 
forestry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Canada is concerned, the relationship between the 
economic forces of Quebec and those of the other provinces is 
very clear.  That is why I was pleased earlier to see members 
from Alberta, British Columbia and the maritimes rising to speak 
and express their support for the Bloc Quebecois proposal.  This 
bodes well for all the virtual and potential possibilities of a 
partnership between a sovereign Quebec and eventually the rest 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want the member for Joliette to 
think that I was going to forget a piece of information as key to 
our understanding of this debate but the lumber industry contributes 
more than $4 billion annually to Quebec's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 250 municipalities are developing, growing and taking shape 
around the wood processing industry.  This industry provides 100% 
of the manufacturing jobs in 135 towns and villages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on with examples of the importance of this 
sector, but I think that all members of the House have understood 
that this is an important battle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the early 1980s to 1996, and I do not think this is too 
strong a term, a trade war, economic guerrilla warfare, was being 
waged between Canada and the United States around softwood 
lumber.  I understand that Canada, which includes Quebec since we 
are not yet able to have our own policies on this, has been 
accused of unfair competition and preferential policies in this 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are, we must admit, barking up the wrong tree.  It 
is my understanding they were under the impression that we 
could not even provide fair competition. Quebec producers, I 
would remind hon. members, were forced to assume a countervailing 
duty of 6.51% although they had proven that they were not being 
subsidized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that all hon. members will understand that this 6.51% 
duty had to be added to the existing production costs.  We can 
imagine what this means for price setting by the producers 
concerned.  When we look at the issue in a little more detail we 
see that the actual rate of subsidy to Quebec exporters was a 
teeny tiny, insignificant 0.01%, a Lilliputian amount that is a 
far cry from 6.51%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois has been so vigilant in this 
matter. We cannot accept that in 2001, 2002 and 2003—I think that 
the agreement expires in March—these countervailing duties will 
be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec, which is very activist, 
asked the federal government, which has a minister responsible 
for international trade, that the countervailing duty for Quebec 
exporters be reduced to 0.01%, as I just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the inescapable, sad and totally unacceptable fact is that 
the federal government was unable to protect Quebec's interests 
and that lumber producers were not charged what they should have 
been, that is at a rate of 0.01%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec 92% of the forest is publicly owned. This shows how 
true it is that Quebec is a land of natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a demonstration was made by us—and the hon. member for 
Joliette will correct me if I am wrong—and even by the U.S. 
department of commerce. This made us realize that the market 
price for lumber from private woodlots had nothing to do with any 
unfair practices but was truly closely related to what could be 
anticipated, given the natural market forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is running out, but I remind hon. members 
that we are seeking unanimous support of the House on this 
issue, which is not a partisan issue.

yesterday's farm rallies have ended but the plight of farm 
families endures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hurt really began after 1993 when the government took a 
sledgehammer to agriculture.  Hiding behind the World Trade 
Organization and with a compliant reform opposition that hates 
words like support and subsidy, the government socked it to 
Canadian agriculture by killing off transportation subsidies, 
like the Crow benefit, and by jacking up user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite recent announcements, federal support for agriculture is 
nowhere near what it was when this government assumed office. 
Net farm income in Saskatchewan averaged just $5,000 last year 
and this year looks worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All MPs, but especially government backbenchers, are realizing 
that the inability to help our farmers in a meaningful way 
resides ultimately with the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message from the farm to the Prime Minister is this.  He 
should stop governing by polls or by whether the official 
opposition or the media cares about agriculture.  He should do 
the right thing and put sufficient resources into agriculture to 
ensure that our farmers will once again be on a level playing 
field with their major competitors.

of ten Canadian provinces currently have free trade with the U.S. 
in softwood lumber.  The federal government must ensure that 
these provinces are not included in future agreements that would 
restrict free trade as it currently exists.  Instead, we need 
free trade for the other four provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta 
and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently 145 sawmills operating in the maritime 
region and only five of these sawmills are publicly owned.  As 
well, 22% of Canada's private woodlots are in Atlantic Canada, 
with 72% of Nova Scotia's woodlots under private ownership.  This 
mirrors the American position where 75% of forest land is 
privately owned, and is one of the reasons why the Atlantic 
region was not subject to the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1842 that the Webster-Ashburton treaty provided 
reciprocity in forest products between Maine and Atlantic Canada. 
We need to see free trade continue for the six provinces that 
currently have free trade in softwood lumber.  What Canada does 
not need is countervail or anti-dumping restrictions against any 
Canadian softwood.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister just said that the ethics counsellor looked 
into that and it was a closed deal.  The Minister of Industry has 
been going on for weeks saying that the file is closed.  In fact, 
that file is open again.  The ethics counsellor just said that he 
is looking into it again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

damages our international image and puts Canadian lives at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration at what point

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

is an important one because criminality and security concerns 
make someone inadmissible to Canada.  Therefore before anyone is 
granted permanent residence status in Canada both criminal checks 
and security checks are completed.

<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one thing very clear.  Mr. Amodeo is not a

However, we see all this as an attempt to whitewash the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Prime Minister is a very simple one, which I 
believe merits consideration.  Does he not understand that the 
only way to settle this matter, to exonerate himself—the only 
way, there are not 50 of them, only one—is to provide us with 
the record of sale, as we have demanded so many times already?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> The problem. Mr. Speaker, 
is that this same ethics counsellor whitewashed the Prime

did so without checking all the facts.  This proves that he was 
more concerned with hastily whitewashing the Prime Minister than 
finding the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not realize that, by refusing to make 
the bill of sale public, he is implying that there is something

The trustee reported to the ethics counsellor who monitors 
this for everyone in the House.  Even MPs consult him.  He

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when Canadians buy gasoline at the pumps the price 
includes federal and provincial taxes.  On top of that, this 
greedy government charges the infamous goods and services tax. In 
simple words, consumers pay the GST on other taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Prime Minister, since he is the expert on GST, 
justify the application of the GST on other taxes?  Why will he 
not remove it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when we looked 
at this issue earlier it became obvious to us that there was a 
heavy load of provincial taxes and federal taxes, and that if 
there were to be any meaningful relief it would have to be 
carried out by both levels of government.  That is why we made 
the offer to the premiers to do so, and they turned it down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the crude cost of gasoline is 28.9 cents a litre. 
Federal, provincial and excise taxes are added to it.  Then 7% 
GST is charged on the total.  The price of the same gasoline 
becomes 74 cents per litre.  We are talking about a tax on top of 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister at least should not be so greedy as to charge 
consumers GST on taxes.  A tax is neither a good nor a service. 
Why would he not be fair and not charge the GST? 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I have said 
all along, it is very obvious that if we are to get meaningful 
relief to consumers at the pumps then we will have to enter into 
it in a very co-operative way, working with the provinces.  That 
offer was made to the premiers.  They did not accept it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I am ready to rule on the 
point of order raised on Thursday, March 1, by the hon. 
member for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's concerns stem from the adoption by the House, 
on February 27, 2001, of a government motion to amend the note to 
section (5) of Standing Order 76 and the note to section (5) of 
Standing Order 76.1.  As you no doubt know, these sections deal 
with the Speaker's power to select amendments at the report 
stage.  The hon. member's problem lies in the fact that the notes 
contain the following phrase: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be 
guided by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the 
United Kingdom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member argues that, to do his job properly if he has to 
draft amendments, he must have access to the rules governing the 
selection of amendments in his own language, French.  He 
indicates that documents from the United Kingdom are available 
in English only and that, as a result, he cannot do his work 
effectively, since he cannot understand the nuances and 
subtleties of the rules.

amendments until his rights and those of other francophones are 
protected and respected. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the government House leader, the whip of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader, the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
and the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle for their interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know well, the role of the Speaker is to preside 
over the business of the House of Commons and to rule on 
procedural matters, whether this involves interpreting standing 
orders or deciding issues of privilege or decorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion on this point of order made various references to 
specific statutes.  The hon. member for Richmond—Arthabaska 
referred to the Official Languages Act and the Constitution Act, 
1867, while the parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader referred to the Parliament of Canada Act, noting that 
act's specific reference in section 4 to the House of Commons of 
the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these references are an interesting backdrop, it must be 
remembered that it is not the Speaker's role to rule on the 
application of any act, but rather to examine issues in light of 
possible transgressions of procedural practice and procedural 
precedent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member insists that he will not have access to the 
rules governing the drafting of amendments because they will be 
“in English”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the House has simply decided to amend the 
note to section (5) of Standing Order 76 and the note to section 
(5) of Standing Order 76.1 by making explicit reference to the 
practice followed in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Standing Order 1 states the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by other Order of 
the House, procedural questions shall be decided by the Speaker 
or Chairman, whose decisions shall be based on the usages, forms, 
customs and precedents of the House of Commons of Canada and on 
parliamentary tradition in Canada and other jurisdictions, so far 
as they may be applicable to the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Standing Order stipulates that if, during proceedings in 
matters of public interest, a procedural question arises that has 
not been provided for or mentioned in the Standing Orders or 
other order of the House, the Speaker of the House must base his 
or her decision first on the usages, forms, customs and 
precedents of the House of Commons of Canada; then on 
parliamentary tradition in Canada; then on that in other 
jurisdictions, to the extent that it may be applicable to the 
Canadian House of Commons. This provision does not refer directly 
to the codified rules or standing orders of other jurisdictions, 
but primarily to the tradition on which they are based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 1, which has existed since 1867, recognized the 
origins of our Westminster Parliament and stated that this House 
would be guided by British precedent.  From 1867 to 1986, it 
stated this explicitly: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all cases not provided for—, the rules, usages and forms 
of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom—shall be 
followed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986, the House amended Standing Order 1 recognizing that 
parliamentary practice in Canada had evolved to the point where, 
in unprovided cases, it might seek guidance from the wider 
community of parliaments.  The members of the Special Committee 
on the Reform of the House of Commons considered that the 
practices of the Canadian House of Commons need no longer be tied 
to those of any other assembly or any other country. However, 
they recognized that in unprovided cases, there was still great 
usefulness in examining the precedents and authorities in other 
legislatures and parliaments, especially those in the 
Commonwealth.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, on the committee's recommendation, the House adopted the 
current wording for Standing Order 1 to reaffirm that the House 
of Commons had the freedom to tailor its procedure to its own 
needs while preserving Canadian traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have drawn such a detailed history of Standing Order 1 to show 
you that the House of Commons of Canada has often turned to the 
United Kingdom in cases that were not provided for.  Of course, 
the situation has evolved, and now we also consult other 
jurisdictions to the extent that their rules or practices are 
applicable to the House. However, the fact remains that if, at 
the report stage, a situation arises that is not covered by our 
practices or by the practices of the United Kingdom, I would be 
required, under Standing Order 1, to consult the practices of 
other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such circumstances, the availability of documents in either 
of our official languages is not a consideration.  Instead, I 
would respectfully suggest that it is the interpretation of such 
practice and the Chair's judgement on how such practice will be 
applied in this House that is the key concern for members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has a long history of consulting the precedents in 
other parliaments that have followed the Westminster tradition, 
and the language of these documents has never seemed to be an 
obstacle.  When we discuss procedural matters during the daily 
business of the House, we frequently consult the various editions 
of Erskine May to develop our arguments.  The wide range of 
documents that we consult on parliamentary precedent are not 
necessarily available in both official languages, but we have 
been able to work with them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House recognizes that members are entitled to receive 
service in both official languages.  Simultaneous interpretation 
is provided in the House and in committees and members have 
access to free translation services.  One of the roles of the 
Speaker is to protect and defend members' rights to work in the 
official language of their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, in keeping with what I said earlier about the 
application of other practice in this Chamber, I am currently 
studying the application of these notes to Standing Orders 76 and 
76.1, and I will return to the House with a statement on how this 
note will be interpreted.  The statement will, of course, be 
available in both official languages and members can govern 
themselves accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile I cannot grant the request made by the hon. member for 
Richmond—Arthabaska to suspend the implementation of the 
amendments in question.  Because the motion was adopted by the 
House, these amendments are now part of the Standing Orders of 
the House, and it is my duty to be governed by the Standing 
Orders.  Only the House can decide to change the Standing Orders. 
As always, the Chair is in the hands of the House, which may 
decide if and when it will modify the rules under which its 
deliberations are conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the hon. member for having raised this issue, 
and all those who made a useful contribution to the discussion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  For my clarification, does that mean that it is no longer 
a requirement that documents respecting the procedures of the 
House of Commons be in both official languages? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will want to read the 
judgment the Chair has just given.  I think he will find the 
answer in that judgment.  I do not want to confuse him by giving 
answers to questions.  I think the judgment is quite clear, and I 
know that he will find it so when he has a chance to review it.

Speaker, I simply would like you to clarify for me what you just 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I right to think that the motion, as passed, does not change 
the standing orders of the House of Commons, but is meant to 
provide guidance to the Chair? May I ask you also if the subject 
matter of the motion in question does not involve a number of 
existing practices in Canada, which would eliminate the need to 
look at what is done in the United Kingdom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know, Mr. Speaker, if you understand what I am asking. 
I will make it clearer. I would like you to tell me if this 
motion is simply meant to guide you in your rulings and does not 
change the standing orders of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion refers to a practice followed in the United Kingdom. 
However, according to the ruling you just gave, foreign practices 
have to be taken into account only when there is no existing 
practice here, in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: since there is a practice that has been 
followed in Canada for a number of years with regard to the 
selection of motions at report stage, does what you just told us 
eliminate the need to refer to a foreign practice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Once again, I think the member will find the 
answer to his question in the Speaker's ruling I just made, which 
he will soon be able to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also indicated in my ruling that there will be another 
presentation by the Chair regarding the acceptability of 
amendments at report stage. There will be something on this 
subject soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ruling I gave today and with the presentation I will 
soon make to the House, the member will certainly have all the 
answers he needs, or at least I hope he will.

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the member opposite who in his usual eloquent and 
studied fashion made some interesting points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the facts with respect to this particular issue, 
and more to the point in terms of Quebec, the Canadian government 
ensures that Quebec's interests are very much assured in this 
particular area, and in other areas as well, because of our 
economic and political clout, and quite frankly because of our 
reputation around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that I think Quebecers understand the importance of 
a federal system and how federalism works in the country.  I 
remind the hon. member that in the last 20 years Quebecers' 
standard of living has risen 30%, as it has in other parts of 
Canada, such as in Ontario.  I also point out that the 
unemployment rate in Quebec has dropped to 8.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently the CHST transferred $1.5 billion from the federal 
treasury.  It represented 80% of all the money that was given in 
the country.  An additional $429 million will be given over as 
soon as the ceiling on the equalization payments has been 
eliminated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simple, Quebecers understand the benefits of being 
in this great country called Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member a specific question, contrary to his 
sovereignist kind of protestations.  Over the last number of 
years the softwood lumber industry and the sales to the United 
States from Quebec have gone from 20% to 25%.  That is great news 
for Quebecers.  How does he explain that?  If things are so 
terrible and the Canadian government, as he seems to indicate, 
cannot do its work right, how can that be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite should be congratulating the government 
and saying what a good job the government, and especially the 
minister, is doing on this important file.  At the end of the day 
it is good news not only for Quebecers, but for people in British 
Columbia, Alberta and others as well.  It underscores the 
commitment of the government in this very important area to 
ensure that all Canadians benefit, especially Quebecers.  Sales 
have gone from 20% to 25%.  That is good news, and we should be 
congratulating everyone involved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, if I were asked why Quebec 
should become a sovereign nation, I would without any hesitation 
use the softwood lumber issue as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people realize that Quebec producers were hit by 
countervailing rights 100% higher than the price in effect in 
the U.S.? The hon. member, who is just as naive as he is 
guileless, rose in this House to say that the federal government 
stood up for the interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one area where the federal government neglected 
Quebec's interests, it has to be the lumber industry. 
We urge all members of parliament to vote in favour of this 
motion so that we can go back to full and comprehensive free 
trade, as we should have done in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly let me say that the day will soon come when Quebec 
becomes sovereign.

There is agreement among other members of the House, including 
his own government, on the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my colleague see as being the most important issue? 
How might we be able to move forward together to solve the issue

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I will be very brief. The hon. 
member is a moderate man, with a moderating influence and a 
balanced approach. He has called for calm. For his call to be 
heard, a consensus must emerge. That consensus is for all 
members to support the Bloc motion, even if—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is of course a bit intimidating to rise just after 
my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve who is always so 
eloquent, funny and lively in his speeches. 
However, with all the humility that I am known for, I will try 
to vie in skill with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that on this file the Bloc Quebecois has once again 
acted as a catalyst for common sense. For months now the Bloc 
Quebecois has pushed for a return to a common law between Canada 
and the United States, this common law being free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber industry is a vital industry for Quebec as a 
whole. More than 30 000 jobs in Quebec alone are related to the 
lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, 20,430 people were employed in the sawmill industry and 
10,000 in forestry management. The lumber industry injects more 
than $4 billion each year in Quebec's economy. It is therefore 
very important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This important segment of Quebec's industry and economy has been 
adversely affected by federal government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that Quebecers strongly support free trade in 
principle. For that matter, it is very interesting to see the 
Liberals joining a free trade position, and I am pleased to see 
that, while Quebec sovereignists supported it long before them. I 
remember that in 1993 the Liberals were campaigning against 
free trade, while we were strongly in favour of this 
politico-economic philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, which supports free trade as Quebec does, 
has seen the federal government set its interests aside to sign 
an agreement with the Americans. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General boasted, 
saying that Canada stood up for the interests of Quebec and 
that, thanks to Canada, Quebec's interests were protected. In 
this case, we can see it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec producers were subjected to a countervail tariff of 6.51% 
even if they were not subsidized. Is this what you call standing 
up for Quebec? Is this a government really concerned by Quebec's 
interests? I wonder on what planet the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Solicitor General lives. The fact is that this 
government's action has been detrimental to the interests of 
Quebec. The subsidy rate for Quebec exporters was actually 
one-tenth of 1%. A countervailing tariff of 6.51% was imposed on 
the Quebec industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-subsidized exporters in Quebec bore the brunt of quotas, when 
in fact they should have been exempted, as was the case in the 
maritimes for instance. 
Many rallied to the position of the Bloc Quebecois, among others 
the Canadian Alliance, which is now supporting us, as does the 
federal government—and I am glad it finally did, because its 
position was not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members know as well as I do that the position of the Minister 
for International Trade was not clear. On February 22 and 23, 
there was talk about free trade being a long term goal for 
Canada and the need for a transition period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 22 the Minister for International Trade said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the matter is how we will live the transition toward free 
trade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996 lumber agreement is due to expire in a few days 
and only a month ago we did not even know what the federal 
government's position would be. Thanks to the work of the Bloc 
Quebecois and other organizations, the federal government 
finally listened and rallied to the common sense, deciding to 
come back to the common law which the free trade agreement 
between Canada and United States is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For once, and this is rare, I cannot but congratulate the 
federal government for having listened and rallied to the Bloc's 
position, which is based on common sense, not only on the 
economic interests of Quebec but also on those of the rest of 
Canada, and for supporting the Bloc Quebecois motion. This 
motion will ensure that exporters from Quebec and Canada have 
access to the large U.S. market without any tariffs or other 
barriers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
comment on the remarks of the member opposite on the softwood 
lumber situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent 15 years of my life in the forestry sector and 
mucking around in countervailing duty problems. 
First of all, the problem is not Quebec versus B.C. versus 
Alberta versus the maritime provinces.  The problem is that the 
Americans have a different system.  They have mostly private 
lands.  The timber is auctioned.  In Canada most of the timber is 
on crown lands and is subject to stumpage and royalties.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that relative sense, I can tell hon. members that Quebec is 
not exactly lily white in terms of the relative standing 
vis-à-vis other provinces.  All provinces in Canada have the same 
battle.  We all have to fight the same common system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact it was in 1996 that the industry came to the Government 
of Canada and, in a pretty broad consensus, argued very 
strenuously for a five year quota agreement, a managed trade 
agreement, because the industry was sick to death of these trade 
wars.  The minister at the time, Roy MacLaren, who was a free 
trader to whom managed trade was anathema, consented to managed 
trade because the industry wanted to buy five years of trade 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the situation, especially in the maritimes 
because the member draws the story out of the maritimes, the 
maritime provinces were excluded because most of the lands there 
are private lands, as he well knows, and if Quebec could have 
been excluded, it would have been.  However, there had to be a 
willing agreement on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member on one point.  I applaud the 
Minister for International Trade.  He has been speaking out very 
strongly in a very unified manner on behalf of the industry 
across Canada.  I am very confident that we will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member opposite, what do you think about the 
relative positions?  If you look at the American system compared 
to the Canadian system, why should we have to defend our system 
when they do not have to defend their system in the 
countervailing duty process? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Madam Speaker, first I want to thank the 
member opposite for his question. He used the pronoun you, so 
I assume the question was for you. I will answer it anyway, if 
only to relieve you from this responsibility and to prevent you 
from having to take a stance, you who play such a neutral role 
in the debates of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite mentioned the fact that most woodlots are 
privately owned in other provinces, whereas Quebec has a 
different system where 92% of woodlots are publicly owned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said Quebec was not “lily white” on this issue. I assume it 
means beyond reproach. 
Perhaps we can rely on an organization that is not from Quebec 
or from Canada to assess the impact of the public ownership of 
woodlots in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the U.S. department of commerce concluded that the 
method used by Quebec to establish stumpage fees on publicly 
owned woodlots was equivalent to a subsidy rate of 0.1%, not 1% 
but 0.1%. I remind members that this rate is 100 times lower 
than the limit above which a countervailing duty must normally 
be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the previous question, why is it that, if the 
subsidy rate in Quebec was 0.1%, the federal government 
negotiated an agreement whereby Quebec exporters were subject to 
a countervailing duty rate of 6.51%? That is the question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, earlier, some 
members seemed to find it bizarre that Quebec would sponsor a 
motion asking the Canadian government to protect us.  We were 
told that this is contrary to our ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier agree that a 
sovereign or independent Quebec could better defend itself and 
would not have to ask another government to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Madam Speaker, I know I have very little 
time. It is unfortunate because I would have liked to dwell on 
the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, I do think that in political life, as in day to day life 
or the life of nations, we are our own best advocates. 
For example, I never saw Canada ask Washington to represent 
Canadian interests in the international arena. Of course I 
would prefer that Quebec be represented by Quebec and not by 
Ottawa.

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to add my voice to those of other members who have 
already spoken to this most crucial issue.  As the Minister for 
International Trade said, the softwood lumber industry is a 
basic element of the Canadian economy and we must protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes are extremely high. The softwood lumber industry 
creates thousands of jobs for Canadians.  It is the lifeblood of 
hundreds of communities across Canada.  It is one of the main 
export sectors in Canada and it plays a crucial role in our 
trade balance.  I would also add that in Beauce, my own region, 
hundreds of jobs depend on this industry which affects a 
thousand individuals if you include families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our softwood lumber exports to the United States represent 
nearly $11 billion. About a third of the lumber Americans need 
to build and improve their homes and businesses comes from 
Canada. There is absolutely no way the United States can meet 
their needs by themselves, but they still insist that access to 
their market by Canadians be limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the cost of this protectionism? American homebuilders 
suggest that the cost for the consumer is $1,000 for every new 
house built in the United States. This is a very expensive 
protection for the American lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber trade has been regulated for 5 years by the 
softwood lumber agreement. 
This agreement provides for quotas of softwood lumber that can 
be exported duty free to the United States from British 
Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. It has bought us five 
years of relative peace in a long, endless, and costly conflict. 
The industry endorsed the agreement almost unanimously, but now, 
it is almost unanimous in its determination to fight for the 
free access to this crucial market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood agreement will expire on March 31. If no other 
agreement is reached, two things will happen almost for sure. 
First, we will come back to the WTO and NAFTA rules, both of 
which give us access to the U.S. market. Just as important is the 
fact that WTO and NAFTA provide us with a rules based system and 
dispute settlement mechanisms that we will not hesitate to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, for all intents and purposes, in the U.S., this industry 
which relies on government assistance will try to have 
countervailing duties imposed on Canadian softwood lumber 
exports. From what we hear, the American industry wants to take 
antidumping measures against Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a protectionist approach is unacceptable and, as my hon. 
colleagues pointed out, it is contrary to our trade agreements. 
These agreements prohibit the United States from imposing 
quantitative restrictions or customs duties on Canadian softwood 
lumber exports unless and until they can demonstrate, through 
fair enforcement of trade rules, that these exports are made 
possible because of unfair trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States must prove that we are subsidizing our 
industry or that we are dumping softwood lumber on their market; 
they must prove not only that we subsidize our industry and dump 
lumber, but that we do so in a way that is prejudicial to 
American producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have never been able to prove their allegations. In the 
last 20 years, there have been three investigations on potential 
countervailing duties and none of them has proven their 
allegations. That does not deter them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the United States make new claims, we will defend our 
positions, you can be sure of that. The Government of Canada will 
ensure that our rights under WTO and NAFTA are upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we go about it? As my colleagues have mentioned, our 
government has been proactive. Twice, we have used the WTO 
dispute settlement process against the United States to help 
clarify the rules governing new trade measures.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first case is a challenge of the declared intent of the U.S. 
to consider our export controls on raw logs as subsidies giving 
rise to countervailing duties. It is obviously an important issue 
at a time where we are faced with the possibility of new trade 
action by the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had consultations at the WTO on a new U.S. legislative 
provision that is both unacceptable and, in our opinion, contrary 
to our trade agreements. It relates to countervailing and 
anti-dumping duties that are not implemented in the appropriate 
manner. Under this provision, the U.S. government would keep the 
customs duties already paid, even though the countervailing or 
anti-dumping duties have been successfully challenged and 
repealed. This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as our minister said after his meeting in Washington 
with the U.S. trade representative, Mr. Zoellick, we are trying 
to get some clarification about what is called the Byrd 
amendment. It would allow U.S. customs to distribute the product 
of countervailing and anti-dumping duties to the very companies 
in the U.S. that petitioned for those duties. This seems totally 
unacceptable. Not only is it contrary to United States 
obligations as a WTO member, but we believe that that cannot be 
applied to Canada under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States should not be allowed to pick which ones of 
their trade obligations they are willing to respect. The  United 
States have not only signed the trade agreements, they even led 
the movement for their negotiation. Therefore the time has come 
for the United States to abide by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is firmly committed to having the 
rights of Canada under those international trade agreements 
respected and upheld. We deeply believe in a rules based trade 
system. That is why we took advantage of the mechanisms provided 
in those agreements to make sure that U.S. protectionist 
measures do not prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect our obligations and we expect the United States to do 
the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are faced with an inquiry about the potential imposition 
of countervailing duties, we will fight it and we will win. We 
are ready. The provinces are ready. The industry in Canada is 
ready, probably more than ever. We have allies more powerful 
than ever before, in the forms of groups of consumers and 
retailers and of associations of home builders in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to ask insistently that impartial envoys from Canada 
and the United States be appointed to explore the issue from all 
sides, to consult with all the stakeholders and to bring forward 
non-binding proposals to resolve this longstanding dispute. We 
will examine every possible option for the resolution of this 
dispute so that our softwood lumber industry can resume the 
activity it does so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am pleased to indicate my support for this motion 
and our firm intention of pursuing Canada's goal of free trade 
in softwood lumber across Canada and particularly in Quebec and 
in my riding of Beauce.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, there is something that I want to bring to the attention 
of the House, especially the government, regarding the softwood 
lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic provinces are subject to what is called the 
Maritime accord which was signed in 1996.  This accord exempts 
Atlantic Canada from the softwood lumber agreement, and there is 
a reason for that.  I sometimes get the feeling that that is lost 
in the halls of government.  It ignores the fact that 75% of all 
lumber produced in Atlantic Canada comes from private land.  That 
is why it was excluded.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, stumpage fees in Atlantic Canada are much 
higher than they are in other parts of the country.  That is why 
we have this special recognition or exemption.  That is why we 
were included in the Maritime accord, signed in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern that we have on this side of the House is that the 
government, in its negotiations with the United States, has 
ignored this very fact.  What we have is an agreement that might 
come about, or penalties that might be imposed on Canada which 
might be a better way to express it, that are going to punish 
Atlantic Canada.  It is going to punish us despite the fact that 
we have managed our forests well and have what we call market 
prices for our stumpage.  We have never been part of the problem. 
If we want to look at that, we are part of the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member aware of recognition of the special status of 
Atlantic Canada in regard to the Maritime accord signed in 1996, 
and has he made that case to his cabinet colleague who is 
carrying this file for the Government of Canada?  In addition to 
that, going back to 1982, we have always been exempted from the 
lumber agreement, the SLA. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.): </B>Madam Speaker, I can assure my 
colleague from the opposition that I was indeed aware of the 
fact that the Atlantic provinces were excluded from the 
agreement. Four provinces were party to this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada represents all provinces, and I am sure 
our Minister for International Trade and our government will 
continue in that direction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened closely to the 
comments from my colleague for Beauce.  I know they have a very 
active and very important forest products sector in that area.  Of 
course, we all know what the issue is.  The issue is market 
share.  Every time we take more than 30% of the softwood lumber 
market share in the United States, it comes back, it reinvents 
the rules and changes them to suit its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite astounding that we have a system of countervail 
where we have to defend our system but we cannot attack the 
American system.  We know there are subsidies in the U.S. system. 
They take place at the state and local government levels, whether 
it is property or sales tax abatements, industrial land or 
co-generation.  Because of the process in the U.S. system, we 
cannot attack its system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a much better method which is called net 
subsidies.  The U.S. could only launch a countervail if there was 
a net over a de minimis, a net subsidy difference that was 
important; net its subsidies against ours.  However, why should 
we have to defend our industry and our process because it is 
different from its?  We cannot attack the U.S. system?  The 
Americans are now alleging that lumber from crown land is moving 
through the maritimes into the U.S. market.  That is equally 
false as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague tell us why we cannot come up with a better 
system where we could challenge and attack American subsidies? 
Why do we have to defend our own system?  Is that not wrong? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Madam Speaker, if I understand the question, 
of course we have to defend our position. However, we can also 
launch challenges, to show our determination and to ensure that 
we are treated fairly and that NAFTA and the WTO agreement are 
complied with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay—Superior North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the debate today centres on what we perceive to be the 
softwood lumber industry but it is really a larger debate. Today 
what is being challenged by the expiration of the agreement on 
March 31 of this year really affects the forest industry in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, and I am sure it has been said here today, the 
forestry industry is Canada's largest single industry. It employs 
more Canadians than any other industry.  It has more communities 
directly involved in the forestry business than any other 
community.  It adds about $25 billion to $27 billion a year to 
our balance of payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking exclusively about the softwood lumber 
industry.  We are talking today about Canada's largest single 
industry of which softwood lumber is about half of the forestry 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about that and why the Americans are trying to 
influence our market penetration on this business, what we have 
to do is understand what happens in the forestry business when we 
harvest a tree and maximize its utilization.  I want to explain 
why it is so important to the total concept of what the forestry 
industry is all about.  It is not exclusively making 2x4, 2x6 and 
2x8 lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we harvest a tree, the bark is stripped off and it is put 
through the mill.  Out of the mill we will get 2x4 and 2x6 
lumber, whatever that tree will provide.  When that process is 
over, the residue of that tree is then turned into chips. Those 
chips are then shipped to the paper plants and used to make the 
fibre for our wood products, our crafts and so on that are so 
necessary for the total forestry business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bark that we stripped off that tree is presently being used 
as biomass to generate the very power that is running and 
operating these mills throughout Canada.  That includes eastern 
Canada, the province of Quebec, Ontario and western Canada.  We 
are not dealing exclusively with regions, rather with the 
productivity throughout Canada as it comes out of the forestry 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become our largest industry.  On top of that, it is a 
sustainable development.  By the very fact that we are utilizing 
everything on that tree, means we are being prudent in the use of 
a resource.  Given the changes in our forestry practices over the 
last seven to eight years, Canada can be looked upon as the 
leading country in operating its sustainable forests and 
utilizing its natural resources to their maximum potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop beating around the bush in finding out just what we 
are trying to accomplish.  What the Americans are trying to 
accomplish in the debate, although they use the softwood lumber 
as a ploy, is the release of the raw logs that we are collecting 
and harvesting in Canada.  They want the raw logs shipped to the 
United States so they can use their manufacturing process by 
using our basic natural resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to eliminate our ability, proven over the last five 
years, to value add to the products of our forestry industry. 
Just take into account the rougher headed lumber that we were 
shipping to the United States.  It was a value added product. 
Take into account the drill studs that we were sending to the 
United States.  Those are all value added products that the 
Americans put an embargo on because they did not want them 
included in the 14.7 billion board feet quota system, that was allowed 
under the agreement.  That is what they are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States producers are using the softwood lumber debate 
as an economic advantage.  In Canada, and to the credit of all of 
the softwood lumber industries in Canada from coast to coast, a 
good part of the profits in the last several years have been 
applied to the new technology that is working so well in our 
mills.  A lot of the profits have been reinvested in plants.  As 
a result, we have perhaps the best technology in softwood lumber 
production in the whole world. 
I could take anyone to a mill in Nakina, in the furthermost 
regions of northern Ontario, where the production methods are so 
sophisticated that one would not believe the amount of production 
that can come out of that one mill because of the advanced 
technology employed in that particular mill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Americans have failed to do during this period of time 
in this particular industry, which they are complaining is being 
abused and injured, is that they have failed to take their 
resources and apply them to their businesses in order to produce 
more and in order to better this type of business.  What they are 
trying to do is harm the Canadian industry and take away its 
competitive advantage, because in their industry they have failed 
to keep up with the rapid progress the industry needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result is that the Americans want to utilize our trade 
laws, a threat of a countervail and the threat of the 
anti-dumping legislation in order to enhance the position of 
their industry in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our industry in Canada today takes up about 33% of the United 
States industry.  That is because of the restriction to the 14.7 
billion board feet.  Let me explain why we get such a large 
section of the United States market.  We get 33% of it.  We could 
get a lot more if we had a free trade agreement with the United 
States without the threat of the countervail and without the 
threat of the anti-dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, Canadian lumber products and forestry 
products are the best in the world.  There is no question that 
the softwood lumber we produce is one of the best products in the 
world.  A little known fact is that when an average sized house 
in the United States is built and the carpenters insist on using 
Canadian lumber, they can take between seven and ten days off the 
production time of that house because of the sturdiness, quality 
and lack of water content in Canadian lumber.  Our lumber is 
rigid, is treated properly and is more competitive than their 
lumber.  It is better than American lumber and it sells on the 
floor of the hardware store at the same price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot compete with that today.  As a result, they are 
using the trade measures that we have in Canada in order to harm 
Canada's largest single business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem, but what should we be doing about it?  Let 
me offer a couple of suggestions.  In Canada, with the market 
conditions we have seen in the last several months, and with the 
new technology, e-commerce, we have seen what has happened in the 
marketplace in the last weeks.  Every time this happens, 
Canadians and the Canadian economy have to revert to where we 
began.  We are a resource based industry.  What are our natural 
resources?  They include natural gas, and its shipment to 
wherever we can.  They include the production of crude oil and 
its shipment to countries that want to buy crude oil.  Our 
natural resources include all the products that we mine from the 
ground.  Our natural resources also include fresh water, which we 
have in abundance, particularly in the northern parts of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that these are the natural resources 
of Canada.  At the bargaining table, whether it is with the 
United States or any other country, we cannot isolate those areas 
that are natural resources at the expense of every other national 
resource.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the member for Thunder Bay—Superior North with some 
interest, because obviously he has taken some time on this and 
has a background in and knowledge of the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Softwood lumber is one resource that Canada has.  I appreciate 
the fact that he brought others forward, but I would like to 
focus my question on the softwood lumber debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps because of lack of time, there were a couple of factors 
that the hon. member did not get a chance to bring up.  One is 
the fact that lumber prices have fallen, within the last year 
especially.  When the market gets expensive and the market is 
demanding lumber products, we can ship across the border with a 
fair amount of impunity because the Americans want our raw 
materials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what also happens when the price of lumber is higher is 
that there are a lot of substitutions in the construction 
industry.  More concrete is used and a lot more steel studs are 
used.  A lot more timber or softwood lumber replacements come 
into the construction field at such a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue, I believe, and the issue I would like the member to 
reply to, is the very motion that is before us, that we want free 
trade in softwood lumber.  As I mentioned earlier in the debate 
today, we now have free trade in six of ten provinces in Canada. 
We have a softwood lumber agreement that covers up to 14.27 
billion cubic feet of lumber coming out of B.C., Alberta, Ontario 
and Quebec.  The issue is that we need the government not to 
include all of Canada in one agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to support those four provinces in getting free trade in 
softwood lumber, which we certainly will do, but in regard to the 
other provinces that have free trade in lumber now, we need to 
maintain it and assure those provinces that they will not be 
lumped in on countervail, that they will not be lumped in on any 
duty coming out of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member understands that and would like to 
comment on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question, but it really is counterproductive to what the 
House is trying to accomplish today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one issue that comes out of this debate, it is that 
Canada deals with other countries as a whole, that we do not 
become parochial in our negotiations and look after the interests 
of one section of the country over another section of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand full well what the member has talked about in the 
area from which he comes, that is, his area has had free trade 
because of its ability to convince its American counterparts that 
it has private timber limits, as do many of the Americans. 
However, at the end of the day I hope that what he and his 
provinces, the maritimes and Newfoundland, have been enjoying for 
the last five years under the trade agreement would start to be 
enjoyed by every other province in Canada, by all of the 
provinces, that is, free access to the United States market 
without any threat of countervail, without any threat of 
anti-dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us operate in the marketplace in the United States.  Let us 
operate freely, openly and competitively and we will show what we 
can do as a country with respect to selling our product in the 
United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Thunder Bay—Superior North 
and congratulate him on the good work that he has done as the 
co-chairman of the Canada-U.S. Interparliamentary Group. 
This issue has come up from time to time because we both joined 
that group in 1988.  Of course he has risen higher through the 
ranks than I have because he is now co-chairman.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have a question for the member.  I have with me an article 
from the St. Croix <I>Courier</I> which is written by John

a congressman from the U.S. he is trying to lobby the United

statistics and logic he uses are totally out of line in terms of 
what we have been telling Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member enlighten us in terms of what our minister has 
done and the information that he has used to lobby for our 
interests in the United States?  In other words, how could the 
information become so distorted by an American congressman in 
defence of the American case versus ours and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sorry to

will allow the member to give a very brief answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague 
across the aisle for his question.  It is amazing and I do not 
know how the U.S. can get away with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a letter written to the president of the United

where they are absolutely wrong in the accusations they make 
about the Canadian forestry industry.  The information being

incorrect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to use my time to assert the importance of the forest as a 
resource and of its harvesting by the softwood lumber industry 
for an area like the riding of Matapédia—Matane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the makeup of my riding, I will divide my speech 
into two parts and talk about the situation and the issues for 
two separate regions, namely the lower St. Lawrence area and the 
Gaspé peninsula. These are two huge areas that I represent, 
along with one of my colleagues on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April Fool's Day, we stand to be made fools of by the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber agreement which has been in force since 
1996, will expire on March 31. I think we should consider our 
past, present and future situation in order to avoid the 
problems we have had before with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the next few minutes I will try to illustrate the situation 
in areas similar to my riding. The hon. member for Beauce stated 
earlier that 1,000 residents in his riding will be affected by 
the softwood lumber agreement. In my riding, I have 2,000 people 
working in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to show that any action taken in an industry like the 
forest industry must be well targeted, because it can have a 
serious impact on communities like mine that have already been 
hard hit, for instance, by the downturn in the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have realized how detrimental the 
current softwood lumber agreement is and, as a famous politician 
recently put it, how harmful it is to the Quebec industry. Some 
might say barbaric, but I think that word has not been properly 
used in the last little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me review the current situation as seen by the forest 
industry commission of the Gaspé Peninsula—Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
regional consultation and development council, a group of 
stakeholders who truly believe in the development of our forest 
industry. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our forests, a natural resource once thought to be 
inexhaustible, are and remain very vulnerable from many points 
of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nature itself and human activity did play a role and still do. 
They are very important change factors. We should use good 
judgment and foresight. In other words, we should be very 
careful, because the forest industry is just as vulnerable as 
the natural resource is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find two bioclimatic zones in the Gaspé peninsula. The 
peninsula is surrounded by fir forests with a mixed stand of 
yellow birch and softwood trees like the balsam fir, white 
spruce and white cedar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two main harmful elements are spruce budworm infestations 
and fire. They obviously have an impact on the lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other bioclimatic zone is the middle of the peninsula. It is 
made of fir forests with white birch stands. Here, we have 
stands of balsam fir, white spruce and white birch. The ground 
is usually very rugged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is quite false to suggest that the lumber industry 
in my area has an advantage compared to the American industry, 
because of our harsh climate and rough land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My region is almost totally covered with forests: they take up 
96% of the land. People in my area say things like: “I was 
raised in the woods”. 
Some 87% of this forest is publicly owned. It is mostly made up 
of softwood stands, 48%, or mixed stands, 33%. Standing volumes 
mostly contain the following species: fir, spruce, birch and 
trembling aspen. Obviously these are all species that are 
affected by the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly two-thirds of the stands are considered young, being 50 
years old or less, even though more than 17% of the forest is 
made up of stands over 90 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the privately owned forest, it covers a 383,000 hectare 
area 95% of which is made up of small private properties, meaning 
properties of about 800 hectares or less, the other 5% being made 
up of large private properties. This area occupies a very narrow 
stretch of land on the periphery of the peninsula, the width of 
which varies between 2 and 20 kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main benefits from the forest in the Gaspé area come from 
the management and harvesting of the forest biomass, which, as we 
know, is affected by the softwood lumber agreement. The largest 
part of the region's publicly owned forest is subdivided into 
management units, and available timber volumes are allocated to 
processors through harvesting and forest management contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this industrial use of the forest, other users such as 
hunters, fishers and vacationers can also enjoy the forest and 
its various resources. All this to show that the logging industry 
is very important to a riding like Matapédia—Matane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This industry employs nearly 2,000 people, as I was saying 
earlier, which accounts for more than 45% of primary sector jobs 
in the region. 
This means that any change to the softwood lumber agreement will 
have disastrous consequences on a region such as mine. The four 
logging co-operatives in the Gaspé Peninsula are concentrated in 
the Baie-des-Chaleurs area. They employ nearly 500 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the five logging groups, they are spread out throughout 
the peninsula and employ more than 600 people. Add to that some 
15 logging contractors, two nurseries, four consultants and seven 
forestry advisors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Management activities on publicly owned woodlots are financed 
through timber royalties, contrary to claims made by the 
Americans, and paid by individual operators based on their allotted 
volumes. These royalties are also used to fund activities related 
to the forest resource development program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1996-97 close to $22 million were paid in 
timber royalties, stumpage fees, et cetera. in our region alone. Of 
this amount, $8 million were used to fund regular forest 
management activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 80 wood processing companies employ nearly 2,000 people, 
which represents 26% of jobs in the manufacturing sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two cardboard and paper mills, one of which, Gaspésia 
in Chandler, is currently shut down. There is a recovery plan in 
the works and, if I may say so, federal aid is still not 
forthcoming. In the Gaspé there are also 19 sawmills covered by 
timber supply and forest management agreements<B>  </B>and more than 60 
sawmills in operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the forest sectoral commission of the regional 
consultation and development council, which is made up of various 
stakeholders from the forestry sector, there are three main 
issues at stake: to preserve and create direct and indirect 
forest sector jobs, which is almost impossible without a free 
trade agreement; to improve the skills needed in the Gaspé forest 
sector to ensure full and comprehensive economic and social 
development; and to promote integrated management of all our 
forest resources in order to protect our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regional consultation and development council has also 
prepared a brief on the situation in the lower St. Lawrence area, 
which I would like to briefly review for the House since my time 
is running out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Populated areas and the physical environment join together in 
great surroundings where nature is everywhere and influences 
every aspect of daily life. Nature dominates in several different 
ways. One quarter of our municipalities are along the St. 
Lawrence estuary. Various crops are cultivated on cutover marine 
terraces and the gentle slopes of the valleys. On the north-east 
side, mixed forests can still be found on the Appalachian 
plateau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region's development relies therefore on the development and 
sustainability of our natural resources. Public expectations are 
very high. It urges us to strive for excellence, as we have done 
in the past and will continue to do so, for instance, with our 
high performance sawmills. This is probably what irks the 
Americans the most. Despite our climate and our situation, we are 
still able to perform and compete with them on their own turf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the need to take into account national and 
international concerns about sustainable development further 
reinforces this idea. The challenge to excel that we must pursue 
forces us in a way to raise the bar of our ambitions and to 
aspire to become a reference in the area of natural resources 
protection and use. And that we have already achieved to a great 
extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forest environment includes the land, the resources it 
contains, the multiple uses that are made of it and the 
relationship between the human beings and the natural environment 
in which they live. From now on, the values and aspirations of 
the people of the lower St. Lawrence, combined with the national 
and international concerns, must govern the protection and use of 
the local forest environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable development and biodiversity are at the heart of the 
forest resources protection goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our area has to become a model. It already is one. We now have 
to promote the great potential of those sites while aiming at 
optimum production. As I was saying at the very beginning of my 
remarks, 2,000 jobs are affected in the Matapédia—Matane riding. 
I wonder what the Americans will do when the time comes to 
negotiate a lumber agreement after the free trade area of the 
Americas has become a reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first of all, with all due respect, I will address my 
comments to you, because the rules require so, and I will also 
address them to workers in the lumber industry, to the thousands 
of workers who, as we speak, have lost their jobs, temporarily, 
we hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec in the last six months 20 businesses all related to 
the lumber industry have shut their doors temporarily, we 
hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be talking and pussyfooting in the House, but in the 
field, there is a lumber crisis. This crisis is obviously the 
result of the 1996 agreement, but it is also fuelled by the 
economic recession that is forthcoming in the United States. 
Consequently lumber prices have dropped by 17% in the last six 
months while stumpage fees imposed on businesses have not been 
reduced accordingly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1992 stumpage fees in Quebec have gone up 117%. Since 
1996 these same fees have increased by 53%. In 1992 the U.S. 
department of commerce, a venerable institution, said that if 
stumpage fees were calculated as subsidies the benefit gained 
by Quebec producers would be only 0.01% compared to American 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I will let the workers in the lumber industry be the 
judge of Canada's efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House the minister and a bevy of members on the 
government side said they agree to support the motion put forward 
by the Bloc Quebecois, which has been fighting for months for a 
good outcome for the softwood lumber agreement, due to expire on 
March 31, 2001, for the implementation of free trade as of April 
1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been telling the government for many months that the 
agreement will expire on March 31, 2001, and that the transition 
for that industry is provided for since 1996. The softwood lumber 
agreement was a transitional agreement that was supposed to 
expire on March 31, 2001 and free trade was supposed to apply as 
of April 1. Sadly, that is not what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are just a few days away from the expiry of the 
agreement and although free trade is supposed to come into effect 
as of April 1, the minister responsible and the Prime Minister 
still cannot assure us that, in spite of the implementation of 
free trade, there will not be any retaliation by the U.S. 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the main cause of concern for workers who are currently 
jobless. This is cause for concern because, in my opinion, it 
will demonstrate that Canada is no longer effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian government cannot get our American neighbours to 
agree on an issue that has been ongoing for 20 years, we will no 
longer have any reason to stay within this country because its 
only strength is its negotiating power.  We will see what happens 
on March 31. We will have proof that the Canadian government has 
failed on the issue of softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of my colleagues said, Canada is in the process of 
showing its ineffectiveness in an economic field of utmost 
importance for Canada from coast to coast to coast. The agreement 
expires on March 31, 2001, but over the last 20 years, and more 
specifically over the last five years, the Canadian government 
has been unable to find a satisfactory solution for the softwood 
lumber industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it again, 20 plants have closed and thousands of 
workers still do not know if these plants will reopen one day. We 
cannot be absolutely sure that reprisals will not keep these 
workers from getting their jobs back.  The economic climate is 
clouding over in the United States and free trade is the true 
solution.  We have given proof of that here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My eminent colleagues have established today that the Canadian 
softwood lumber industry can compete with any other around the 
world, in all categories. If Canada cannot protect its own 
position in a field where it is one of the best in the world, it 
is showing its weakness.  We will let them go ahead, but I am 
convinced that they will, once again, prove that Canada cannot 
protect the interests of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard several comments in this House these past few 
weeks. The Prime Minister spoke to President Bush to discuss the 
lumber issue and was told to talk about energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an hon. member said earlier, I hope they will not put all of 
Canada's natural resources on the table to negotiate the lumber 
agreement. The lumber issue has been discussed for 20 years now 
and it must be settled by March 31 in the evening. It must be 
solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada cannot do it, I hope they will not tell us that they 
intend to use other natural resources, for example our energy or 
water, as leverage in the lumber negotiations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a catastrophic error. Given the lumber agreement 
signed by Canada in 1996, it would be a disaster for the energy 
industry and the hydro industry that Quebecers are doing their 
very best to protect. The government must not be allowed to use 
natural resources as leverage to negotiate the lumber agreement. 
We have had a problem for 20 years now and it is time for Canada 
to prove that it is strong and powerful enough to protect the 
interests of Quebecers and of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to the Prime Minister and the Minister for 
International Trade these last few weeks, I am convinced that 
Canada will not be able to reach an agreement by March 31.  Once 
again, it will show that it is not the power it says it is and 
that it does not have the respect of the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the workers of Quebec will once again pay the price. 
I am talking about the thousands of workers in Quebec who, as we 
speak, no longer have jobs in the softwood lumber industry. Even 
though, since 1992, the industry has increased countervailing 
duties by 117% as the Americans requested, even though 53% of 
countervailing duties have been increased since 1992, and even 
though there has been a drop of 17% in the selling price of 
softwood lumber, countervailing duties have barely dropped by 3%. 
Obviously, this industry will once again be abandoned by the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am proud to support the motion by the member for 
Joliette.  I hope that members of all political parties in the 
House will be unanimous when it comes time to vote on such an 
important position for an industry that is one of the most 
important in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Canada is facing a considerable challenge.  Pardon 
me, but I am not confident that our minister and our Prime 
Minister have the political strength to be able to defend the 
interests of Quebecers.  I am certain that, the day after March 
31, we will see the U.S. government once again imposing duties, 
tariff barriers, and quotas on our industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to put up with what we are putting up with now, 
which is to say drastic job cuts and factory closures in an 
industry which is one of the most prosperous and in which we are 
the most highly competitive in the world.  And all because our 
government does not have the political strength to be able to 
negotiate with its neighbours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity over the Christmas break to go to 
Australia with my family.  I have the good fortune to be married 
to an Australian.  She has been away from her country for 18 
years so we thought the Christmas break would be a great time to 
visit her homeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there we were at a place called Heron Island which is on 
the Great Barrier Reef.  Madam Speaker, if you ever have an 
opportunity to visit an absolutely idyllic setting I recommend it 
to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was quite idyllic unless of course one had the misfortune to 
be seated next to a lumberman from Montana.  I had a rather 
unpleasant lunch with an American lumberman and his wife.  I will 
distinguish between the two by saying that his wife was really 
quite pleasant but he was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, I got quite an earful about rapacious Canadians 
and how we engage in unfair trading practices and have subsidies 
and stumpage fees, et cetera.  I do not claim any great expertise 
in this area, but I thought I gave about as good as I got.  I 
expressed to him my views as a parliamentarian that we were as 
fed up as fed up could be with the gross hypocrisy of American 
interests in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that free trade for the Americans is only free 
trade if it works for the Americans.  If it stops working for the 
Americans it then ceases to be free trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out to that individual that in pretty well every free 
trade dispute with our colleagues to the south over NAFTA-like 
issues, most disputes had been resolved in Canada's favour and 
that we were heartily sick of being dragged into the courts and 
proven right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, my views did not endear myself to this Montana 
lumberman and he and I parted ways.  He then saw his way clear to 
leave the island the following day, by private helicopter may I 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My little vignette is in some measure a reflection of what goes 
on in Canada's relationship with the Americans on a daily basis. 
We trade about $1 billion a day.  Clearly the U.S. is our most 
significant trading partner and clearly we are its most 
significant trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a trading nation, has been a trading nation and, for 
the foreseeable future, will always be a trading nation. 
Something in the order of 40% to 45% of our gross domestic 
product is dependent upon trade.  The comparable figure, which is 
quite an interesting figure, is that it is about half for the 
Americans. About 20% of their gross domestic product is dependent 
on trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election four out of the five parties essentially 
ran on free trade platforms.  The one party that did not run on a 
free trade platform got around 10% of the vote and barely hung 
onto official party status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade enjoys pretty broad support among Canadians, 
something in the order of 65% to 70%, but, as I said, we are 
heartily sick of being dragged into court.  Fortunately, we seem 
to be winning most of the disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Americans trade and we, on the other hand, trade freely.  We are 
not a colonial power.  We cannot and do not use threats of 
military intervention to get our way.  We need agreements and 
therefore we need rules.  Rules based trade is better than 
gunboat trade.  The resolution therefore is timely because it 
gives Canadians another opportunity to reaffirm their commitment 
to free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it difficult?  Of course it is difficult.  Does it take up a 
lot of time?  Yes.  Do we have an endless number of lawyers?  Yes 
we do, but let us look at the alternative.  Are we to become an 
isolationist nation?  I do not think so.  Are we to somehow or 
other become a colonial power?  I do not think so.  For the 
foreseeable future what we are doing is the way we will go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber agreement expires this month.  Canada's 
position is pretty darn clear on this one:  Trade in softwood 
lumber should be governed by the WTO rules or the NAFTA 
agreement, period, end of sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House support the government's will in its efforts to 
restore free trade agreement rules for lumber and inform the 
United States that it rejects any obstacle to that free trade 
process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pretty difficult proposition on which to argue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations will be difficult as the U.S. congress and 
president are clearly captives of the lumber lobby.  It is a 
powerful and well-financed lobby.  To give members some 
perspective on the role of lobbyists in the U.S. system I will 
treat them to another vignette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to be in Chile representing Canada at a 
conference on tobacco reduction strategies.  I along with the 
American senators were the only English speakers at the 
conference.  As we are wont to do, politicians being politicians, 
we chatted.  I asked the U.S. state senators why they did not run 
for congress.  I asked them why they did not move up and run 
federally.  Their response was, money.  I asked what the problem 
was with money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that to be a congressman in the United States one 
needs $1 million every two years.  That means that a person would 
need to have $10,000 a week.  It would mean that every Monday 
morning a congressman would need to find 10,000 bucks somewhere, 
and if he or she is from Montana, Idaho or one of the large 
lumber states, his or her $10,000 would most likely come from one 
of the lumber lobbies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I began to understand, in my own little naive Canadian way, the 
intersection of money and politics in the U.S.  On another 
occasion I could possibly reflect on how it is distorting 
democracy in our neighbour to the south.  It certainly gave me a 
new perspective on how lobbies interact with congress in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in tough here.  The entire political machinery of the 
U.S. congress and the executive branches are lined up against 
Canada on this issue because they are captives of the lumber 
lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position taken by my separatist colleagues opposite would be 
laughable if it were not so pathetic.  Quebec wants to go it 
alone with the Americans.  Good luck to it.  I am sure George 
Bush lies awake at night wondering what that wily Landry will 
think of next.  If Canada has to muscle up, so to speak, just to 
get the Americans to deal in the area of WTO and NAFTA-like 
rules, what will poor little pathetic Quebec do to get its fair 
share? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec wants it both ways, as if that were news.  It wants to 
negotiate for itself but have an economic partnership with the 
rest of Canada.  Of course if the economic partnership does not 
work in any particular sector then it will gas the economic 
partnership and go on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in my riding, as you probably were, Madam Speaker, during 
our break week.  Frankly, I got a pretty good earful from my 
constituents about transfers to Quebec.  They were a little 
irritated with the gross up in equalization.  That was 
immediately following the gratuitous insult concerning the 
chiffon rouge but before being told we have no real culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time Mr. Landry looked at where his bread is 
buttered and realized that Quebec, in spite of its government, 
has prospered in Canada.  It has done very well, thank you very 
much, under the softwood lumber agreement.  It has increased its 
share from 20% to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a novel idea if Mr. Landry paid a tad more attention 
to the model and business realities of a large provincial economy 
rather than hurling gratuitous insults at the rest of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real reason the lumber lobby is spending its money on 
lawyers and politicians is that the industry has not modernized. 
The American industry is in the dark ages.  It has not modernized 
like Canadian mills and therefore it cannot compete with Canadian 
mills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this is all about power.  This is all about lumber 
power.  This is about Canadians hanging together.  If we do not 
hang together we will certainly hang separately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I enjoyed the member's comments.  I 
will refer first to what the minister said when he was in the 
House.  In answer to a question I had asked, he said that his 
department had been working on the looming deadline for softwood 
lumber for quite some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was correct in my comments when I said that may be true, but 
the fact is that the government has not been revealing that to 
the Canadian public or to workers in the forest industry, which 
has caused a lot of consternation and apprehension.  It is only 
within the last several weeks, subsequent to the United States 
starting its sabre rattling, that the minister said that the 
government has been working on this and that it has started to 
take a tough stand on behalf of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what progress has been made, for example, in dealing 
with the other large lobby groups in the United States, such as 
the American coalition for affordable housing and the lobby group 
that represents lumber retailers and builders in the United 
States. 
What has Canada done to try to draw on their strength as 
lobbyists to help us with the U.S. government and the senate? 
Where do we stand?

because once we get into negotiations it commits us to 
negotiating another agreement.  That is an important point.  We 
could have high level discussions, but we would like to know, as 
would thousands of Canadian forestry workers, where we are in 
these talks.  They see a looming deadline three weeks from now. 
They hear sabre rattling from both sides.  Where are we in these 
talks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
is an experienced politician.  He knows that negotiations carry 
on all the time at a variety of levels over a period of time. 
Everyone knows that there is a March 31 deadline.  The pressure 
to arrive at an agreement is certainly there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly expect, although I cannot say because I am not 
involved in the negotiations directly, that Canadian lobbyists as 
such would be approaching the affordable home builders 
association and the consumers of these products and saying that 
their industry causes a great deal of expense to American 
consumers because it is an inefficient industry.  We could supply 
the product they want which is as good as, if not better than, 
what they get at cheaper prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what free trade is all about.  I would expect that our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a question for the government member who just spoke.  Free 
trade works fine when there is lots of demand, but right now we 
do not have the same demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All kinds of products can be shipped out of Canadian mills but 
there is a lessened demand on the American side.  At the same 
time there is a downturn in the American industry.  Its sawmills 
are shut down. Our government has said all along that it intends 
to let this go under free trade and that it does not have to 
negotiate anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are guaranteed on Monday, April 2, that the Americans will 
either have countervail duties or anti-dumping charges, or our 
government will have some type of export tax in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the plan?  What is the government doing about it?  When 
does it plan to have it in place?  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would use the phrase of 
a certain hon. member, namely, I reject the premise of the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If on April 2 there are countervail duties or anti-dumping 
charges then on April 3 we will have a lawsuit.  If that is the 
way it is, that is the way it is.  I cannot simply extract a 
negotiated agreement because I wish to extract a negotiated 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the thrust of my speech, for Canadians free trade 
means free trade.  It does not mean anything else other than free 
trade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this topic.  As a former director of 
international trade in Yukon it is a topic dear to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I am very happy when more free trade leads to the 
reduction of expensive tariffs for all Canadian consumers, but 
particularly for the poor.  When we would otherwise add 10%, 20% 
or 30% to the price of goods for no good reason, it does not help 
the poor or any consumers.  I am pleased to talk about and 
support free trade in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the purpose of my speech.  I will not debate any of 
the details.  Our opposition critics, the good negotiators in the 
government, the minister and the parliamentary secretary can get 
into that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like during my intervention to commend all members of 
the House on their co-operation on the issue.  I also commend the 
Bloc for what is a courageous and very productive use of an 
opposition day under these circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member I wanted to do this before I became public enemy 
number one in the House.  Obviously I will get into many tough 
debates with my comrades opposite because I strongly disagree 
with the visions of the parties opposite. If I did not believe 
strongly in the Liberal vision, it would have been fraudulent of 
me to run under the Liberal banner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I disagree with the visions and some of the positions 
of the other parties, I never once doubted the intentions of all 
member of the House to work and help Canadians.  They all believe 
in what they are putting forward and they are all working very 
hard to help their constituents and all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion exemplifies that.  Efforts like this one where 
the whole House is working together is one way of showing 
Canadians the hard work that all members do for their 
constituents and the courageous decisions they make in their 
interest.  It does not neglect the fact that we will do heavy 
battle to advance our visions because that is what we believe in. 
It also shows that when there is a common enemy or common problem 
we can all work together.  We need that when we are threatened by 
such an external force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In commending the official opposition today, members will 
probably notice that I have not done this too much since I have 
been here.  I should like to tell a couple of other stories 
related to commending members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night I was at a dinner.  A private sector person of a 
major Canadian company spoke.  He said that earlier this week all 
parliamentarians in the House of Commons voted on a common front 
to approve a motion on an issue that was very important for 
Canada.  The message that got across was that we were all 
co-operating on an issue that was very important to Canadians. 
Parliament and everyone here obtained a lot of respect for doing 
that.  Today's motion is not dissimilar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more minor point, I was also proud as a new member when 
Tony Blair, the leader from Great Britain was here.  We all stood 
in appreciation and with decorum to recognize a leader of a 
country that was a partner with us.  In particular, I commend 
Bloc members because due to some of their positions in history it 
may have been very difficult for some them.  They showed the 
greatest degree of decorum along with other members of the House. 
I was touched by the degree of decorum that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being from Yukon I have an interest in today's debate. As the 
rest of Canada, we want to avoid countervail duties such as the 
one of 6.51% which the department of commerce tried to levy 
against Yukon exports in 1992.  That would have been very 
difficult for us.  Members can imagine with winters at minus 40 
degrees the transportation costs and the increased wages.  Yukon 
is totally uncompetitive as it is.  Obviously we are no threat to 
anyone because our production costs are so high.  We do not need 
any more disadvantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our wood, because it is so dry and so cold, takes a long time to 
grow.  It is a very high quality wood.  It has the same name, 
white spruce or lodgepole pine, but it is a different type of 
wood.  It is very strong and it is fine for exporting for 
furniture exports but it is no threat to anyone.  We do not want 
to be caught as innocent bystanders in this dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to my main point about commending the House for 
co-operation, it is essential that we stand together when we have 
51 senators of both parties in the United States standing against 
us.  Those are 51 senators of the most powerful nation in the 
world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to address Americans, especially American 
anti-poverty groups and consumer groups that I am sure are 
watching CPAC.  I cannot imagine they would not be.  Consumers, 
anti-poverty fighters or consumer groups in the United States 
should take a message back to their senators who have been 
raising tariffs and increasing house prices over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can poor people in the United States afford the increased cost 
of houses which would result from increased tariffs?  Do their 
consumer groups really want Americans to continually pay more 
money for housing because of a few senators who are trying to 
increase tariffs?  Do all poor people in the United States really 
have houses?  Can they afford their being artificially expensive 
because of the tariffs a few senators are trying to impose?  They 
should tell these senators that they want free trade in lumber so 
that they have the lowest priced housing for the people who 
really need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen to American companies if they did this?  The 
lumber companies where some of their family members work would 
become more competitive and would sell more with fewer tariffs. 
When they become more competitive they will sell more of their 
products and be able to better compete in world markets.  This 
would ultimately lead to those companies becoming more efficient, 
providing more sales of American goods and more employment for 
Americans.  That would help their families as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a win-win situation.  They have to take these senators or 
anyone who tries to lobby for increased tariffs to task. 
Continuing softwood lumber tariffs do not make sense from their 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I respect and appreciate all members of the House 
for co-operating for the common good of Canadians. Any victory is 
not a victory of one partisan party but is a victory of our 
entire parliament.  Any loss is a loss for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows:  the hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette, Ethics 
Counsellor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, as a member from British Columbia I 
appreciate the time to ask some questions and make some comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to reiterate to the member and the government 
the reason this is such an exceedingly important issue to Canada 
and in particular to my province of British Columbia. It is 
probably not known by the member that on a balance of trade net 
benefit basis the forest industry outperforms every other sector 
of export in Canada.  It has a net benefit of some $39 million to 
Canada on the balance of trade.  That is important.  It employs 
about 130,000 people in Canada and as a high as 50,000 or 60,000 
in the province of B.C. in work related to the forest industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of British Columbia has seen the complete 
devastation of the forest industry caused by to a very large 
degree the softwood lumber agreement we have had to work through 
over the last five years.  It sounded pretty good in the 
beginning.  We were to find a way to deal with the constant 
threats of countervail. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what has happened is that we have had a market 
distortion which has been disastrous to our economy in British 
Columbia.  We have had the creation of mills that have quota and 
mills that have not.  It is not a level playing field.  Because 
of their obligation to the ministry of forests and to their 
timber licences to cut the wood and process it, they have had to 
in effect literally dump the wood in the domestic market at 
prices far below their costs to produce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is having a disastrous effect and the government has to 
realize that.  In the city of Prince George, which is almost 
wholly dependent upon the forest industry, the unemployment rate 
is somewhere around 17%.  In my riding it is somewhere around 15% 
overall because of the softwood lumber agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our mills have simply used their quotas.  They are into their 
expensive penalty wood.  They have had to lay off people because 
they cannot afford to carry on business that way, so when I ask 
the government where the public display of good stewardship of 
our lumber industry has been, I am very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been a public display.  The government has 
admitted that it has been working on it for the last year, but 
there has not been an expression to the people in the forest 
industry in British Columbia that the the government is working 
on this and understands the crisis and the severity of the 
situation.  The government has left the forest industry and 
workers in British Columbia wondering whether on March 31 the 
world is going to come to an end for them.  It is going to get 
considerably worse.  They do not know that the government has 
been working on it, if indeed it has, but we will take the 
government at its word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Yukon if he understands that 
on March 31 the lifeblood of the forest industry in British 
Columbia will be at the highest crisis point it has been at in 
decades.  If so, has he and will he, along with other members of 
the Liberal government, continue to impress upon the Minister for 
International Trade that we must not allow the Americans, by way 
of this large lobby group, to push us around on this like they 
have traditionally done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada cannot buckle under on this one.  The member from Thunder 
Bay said earlier that we cannot now move to another natural 
resource and start to rattle sabres at the U.S.  That is exactly 
what the U.S. has done to us.  It has singled out the lumber 
industry and wants to go to war on it.  Why should it be fair for 
them when it is not fair for us?  That is my question.  How can 
we allow the Americans to zero in on lumber and say we are unfair 
when we are not prepared to say that if that is the way they want 
to play we are going to zero in on something that they really 
need?  What does the member have to say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell:</B>  Yes, Madam Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise now at the end of the day to 
speak to the Bloc Quebecois motion on softwood lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here this morning when the hon. member for Joliette 
introduced his motion. Afterwards I listened to what the first 
speakers for the various parties had to say, and all parties 
except for the New Democratic Party indicated that they would be 
voting in favour of the motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore this must be a very positive motion. Some parties, 
especially the one opposite, often say that the Bloc never has 
anything positive to offer. This time members have to 
agree that this is a good motion. Even the government has come 
to this realization since it has indicated it will be 
supporting the motion. What is surprising is that an opposition 
party had to bring forward such a motion. Time is of the 
essence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The softwood lumber agreement with the United States will expire 
at the end of the month, on March 31, just two short weeks from 
now. 
It was urgent that we addressed this very important issue 
because it will affect a large number of jobs in Quebec and 
throughout Canada. Even the member for Yukon, who just stepped 
out, seemed interested in this issue. I know I am not supposed 
to make such a comment, but the Speaker has already been very 
kind to me, as she always is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to remind the House of the terms of the 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House support the government's will in its efforts to 
restore free trade agreement rules for lumber and inform the 
United States that it rejects any obstacle to that free trade 
process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excellent. 
Everybody seems to agree, except the NDP, which is consistent to 
a point with its own past position on free trade. It has always 
opposed free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows me to digress for a moment and remind the House that 
before 1993 and even during the election campaign, the Liberals 
and the Prime Minister spoke very negatively about free trade. 
Back in 1988 the elections were fought on free trade and the 
Liberals were dead against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may explain in part their lack of a firm position until 
yesterday. When questioned the Prime Minister stood and said 
he was very much in favour of free trade in this industry and 
other industries. He may be a late convert, but that is what he 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises a number of questions. How sure can we be that 
government members, who were against free trade in the past, will 
be very good negotiators of a free trade agreement on softwood 
lumber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports free trade. I should remind the 
House that in 1988 the Parti Quebecois, Quebec sovereignists and 
even Premier Bourassa supported free trade. There was a consensus 
on this in Quebec and it did have an impact on the course of 
events. We signed an agreement first with the United States and 
then with Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at extending free trade to the three 
Americas. It is fine and negotiations will start, 
but despite the fact that I have always supported free trade in 
principle I want to point out an area where I am not satisfied, 
as are many workers I might add, and that is shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these negotiations we cannot blame the current government, 
because it was the Conservative government that was in office, 
but the fact remains that maritime transport and shipbuilding 
were excluded from free trade. This is very damaging now for the 
industry, which has only 2,500 employees. At the time, more than 
10,000 employees and, depending on the time of the year, up to 
15,000 employees were earning a living in this industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this not included? What we have learned from people 
involved directly or indirectly, anonymously in some cases, is 
that the famous automobile pact that favoured Ontario has been 
used as a bargaining chip to exclude maritime transport and 
shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that with respect to lumber, while following the free 
trade spirit, the United States had asked in its negotiations 
to conclude with Canada an agreement that is expiring soon, with 
the whole issue of countervail duties that was not beneficial to 
the sawmill industry in Quebec; quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the product is different from the one in British 
Columbia. 
Our trees are not as tall as British Columbia pines. It seems 
that the product from that province is equivalent to that from 
western U.S. states, and that is why Americans are more 
reluctant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-five per cent of all lumber comes from Quebec and over 50% 
is exported to the United States. I come from the 
Chaudière—Appalaches region, and this is an extremely urgent and 
important issue for that region. We have not heard from the 
member for Beauce, but it is an important issue for his region 
also. He did not think it was important enough to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He did speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> If he spoke, I apologize. I followed the 
debate all day, except for a couple of hours during which I was 
absent, so I assume he spoke during that period. He will not 
have to make a statement tomorrow to ask me to make amends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is extremely important for all areas alongside the 
eastern border, including Kamouraska, Témiscouata, Bellechasse, 
Matapédia, all of eastern Quebec. The member for Charlevoix 
underlined the importance of this industry for all of eastern 
Quebec, on both shores of the St. Lawrence River. It is very 
important since it is the main source of employment in over 250 
municipalities in Quebec. It is the industry that provides the 
largest number of jobs, even more than agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been there and will always be 
there to defend Quebec's interests until we achieve sovereignty. 
In doing that, we see that from time to time the government 
realizes that the Bloc Quebecois puts forward positive ideas 
that are not only in the interests of Quebecers but also in the 
interest of other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect the fact that until Quebec achieves sovereignty any 
discussion on exports has to be viewed in a federal framework. 
I fully understood the comments made by the member for Yukon, 
but I do not see why he was so surprised that the members from 
the Bloc Quebecois had properly welcomed the British Prime 
Minister, Tony Blair. We have always behaved properly in these 
kinds of circumstances. For us, Britain is an important economic 
partner. We also have to go back to history. Even in Quebec, in 
the national assembly, procedure is based on British procedure 
and we have always respected those rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted by the comments by the member for Yukon, but a 
little less by others aimed at recalling some negative 
situations due to statements by the current premier of Quebec. 
People seem to have taken offence. I would, however, like to 
remind everyone of a sad anniversary, the anniversary of passage 
of Bill C-20.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC)</B> 
moved: 
<A NAME="LINK260">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion 
of this House, the government should introduce legislation 
establishing a code of conduct for Members of Parliament 
and Senators, based on the March 1997 final report of the 
Special Joint Committee on a Code of Conduct of the Senate 
and the House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am honoured to rise to put forward a 
motion that I believe is very important and relevant, not only in 
its timing but in its long-term implications for the Parliament 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a motion that would bring forward a code of conduct for 
members of parliament and senators.  I would suggest with the 
greatest respect and deference to the report that was tabled by 
the current Speaker, the distinguished member for Kingston and 
the Islands, as well as the senator from Nova Scotia, Senator 
Oliver, the reference in this motion speaks of the 
Milliken-Oliver report which very much forms the basis of my 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue on which all parties during the committee process were 
united was that we should try to strive for and aspire to a 
higher standard of conduct for members of parliament.  It seems 
to have fallen by the wayside and has been put to one side.  This 
is not an effort to reinvent the wheel.  This is something that 
currently does not exist.  This is a void in the way in which 
this place operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My submission is that this would very much enhance and protect 
the integrity of members of parliament.  It would be a direct 
benefit to not only members of parliament, but to all Canadians 
by signalling our own desire to keep higher standards for all 
members.  The failure to address the issue leaves us with lower 
standards than other jurisdictions.  This includes other Canadian 
jurisdictions and international ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why one is left to wonder why we would not act or take 
the opportunity to put in place guidelines which would govern the 
behaviour of members of the Chamber.  This is the sort of debate 
I would put to the House that if it was put to a vote it would 
allow all members of the House to express their support for such 
an exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say quite earnestly that this is not a motion that would tie 
us to any particular standard at this point.  It is an exercise 
to engage all members in the drafting of such a code of 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point, I again refer to the Milliken-Oliver report 
that would be the premise and a good starting point.  There was 
significant research.  There was a great deal of effort.  With 
the greatest respect to the two drafters of that report, their 
efforts would be the jumping point to put forward a code of 
conduct for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we will not have the ability to vote on this 
particular item.  I suggest this sends a very wrong message. 
When the motion was presented to the committee, there was the 
usual practice in the process of trying to make this votable, and 
it was unfortunately turned down by the Liberal dominated 
committee.  Why? 
As in the case with many issues, it would be politically damaging 
to the government.  Surely it would rather just ignore the 
problems that exist.  This, I suggest, deflects the cynicism.  It 
further undermines public confidence in this place.  It is an 
attitude, sadly, that we have become quite familiar with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a recent example in the parliament of Great Britain 
where some senior members of parliament did not want the contract 
renewed for Miss Elizabeth Filkin, who is the British 
parliament's so-called sleaze watchdog.  Her contract is to run 
out next year.  Some feel that the movement by some senior 
members of parliament in Westminster to not have her contract 
renewed was very much tied to the fact that because she was doing 
such a good job in her capacity it was very threatening to some 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It demonstrates that when an individual is there with proper 
powers and the respect of all members of parliament, there is an 
incredible ability to watch over all members of the House.  There 
is the Damocles sword that hangs over the members.  The attempt 
by some members in that legislature to ensure that this 
particular individual was not renewed demonstrates that in some 
instances members of parliament would prefer not to have that 
deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can only wonder if that is in fact the case presently before 
us, the effort by the government not to have this code of conduct 
that would apply to all members.  Never before have Canadians 
seen such a blatant disregard for parliamentary rules, than we 
have during the past seven and a half years of Liberal 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent example was yesterday when the Minister of 
Justice's department provided a briefing and copies of a large 
omnibus piece of legislation to members of the media before 
members of parliament were given the opportunity to review that 
legislation.  Sadly, we have seen and have become accustomed to 
the practice of legislation being announced in the parliamentary 
press gallery prior to members of parliament, who have been 
elected by the Canadian public, having the opportunity to review 
and comment fully on that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice to test initiatives in the media, I would suggest, 
is a long-standing practice.  However, it has fallen further and 
further afield, and very much undermines the way in which the 
Chamber holds the respect of not only members but Canadians at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 8, 2001, and I know the Chair will recall this 
infamous date in this short parliament, there was a Reform 
opposition day in which the House was asked to adopt the policy 
that came directly from the Liberal red book and called for the 
implementation of it by the government.  It policy states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a Liberal government will appoint an independent ethics 
counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the 
day to day application of the code of conduct for public 
officials.  The ethics counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of 
Commons and will report directly to Parliament. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that instance, there was a motion debated here which 
essentially called upon the government to keep its word to 
fulfill a promise it had made.  We have seen time and time again 
that the government has never shirked or shied away from saying 
one thing in a pre-election platform and after very quickly 
abandoning its promise to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of credible members and leaving positions, we have the 
member opposite saying one thing while in opposition and another 
while in government.  I am hearing an echoing over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the supply day debate, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Government House Leader stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it another issue to the hon. member.  All of us in the 
House are busily holding forth on the issue of compliance with a 
code of conduct which would exist for ministers, for 
officeholders and for parliamentary secretaries.  There is no 
code of conduct.  For all of those here who are holding forth, 
there is no code of conduct for members of parliament.  They are 
very willing to hoist upon the other officeholders a code of 
conduct, but not one element of a code of conduct applies to 
members in the House.  That is business that we have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we wax eloquent on what is missing in all of the other 
codes of conduct, I suggest we get our own House in order.  I ask 
the hon. member to comment on that. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the parliamentary secretary's fine words on that sad 
day in parliament when he was chastising members of the 
opposition because they were calling on the government to do 
something that the opposition members themselves would not have 
to comply with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House 
Leader would do a perfect Olympic style, pike position backflip 
if he were given an opportunity to speak on this today.  He would 
reverse himself and explain away and slink away from the 
statement if given the opportunity to speak.  That, sadly, has 
become a common practice here.  Liberal members, confronted with 
words that they said earlier in campaign mode, like saying that 
they would repeal free trade and get rid of the GST, are common 
words now that ring around the country when we examine the ethics 
of campaigning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The red book promise has been shredded in terms of its 
credibility, but there is an opportunity to salvage some of that 
by supporting a motion that would hold members of parliament to a 
higher ethical standard than currently exists.  For years 
parliamentarians have been trying in vain to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 15, 1999, Bill C-488, a private member's bill to 
establish a parliamentarians' code of conduct was introduced. 
Like many pieces of useful legislation, it died on the order 
paper.  It was reintroduced as a bill in the next session but 
again it died on the order paper when the pre-emptive election 
was called.  Even the auditor general, an impartial servant of 
the House outside the Chamber, has expressed concern over the 
ethics of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general, in Canada's most recent 2000 report, had 
one chapter entitled “Values and Ethics in the Federal Public 
Sector”.  In that chapter the auditor general summarized the 
history of unsuccessful attempts to develop a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians.  He recommended that parliamentarians try 
again, arguing that it was very important to show ethical 
leadership for the public sector as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Prime Minister appointed the ethics counsellor 
insisting that in end that the buck would stop with him.  I will 
quote the Prime Minister from a speech he made on June 16, 1994, 
in which he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no substitute for responsibility at the top.  The 
Prime Minister sets the moral tone for the government and must 
make the ultimate decisions when issues of trust or integrity are 
raised.  That is what leadership is all about. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are pretty powerful words but my how times have changed. 
The Prime Minister does not feel that he did anything wrong when 
he invited the president of the Business Development Bank to 24 
Sussex to twist his arm to get a loan for a gentleman in his 
constituency.  He does not feel there was anything wrong with 
lobbying the Business Development Bank by phone and in his living 
room to approve a $615,000 loan for his good friend, Yvon 
Duhaime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the type of moral tone being set by the Prime 
Minister by backroom deals, government interference and trying to 
speed up or ensure the approval of questionable loans that are 
not based on merit, then it is not setting a good example.  We 
need a higher code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a completely independent ethics counsellor for a start, 
someone who would not report directly to the Prime Minister. 
However there has always been a focus on ethics with this Prime 
Minister and this government.  They have always brought this 
issue into debate, yet they have never lived up to their words, 
not even close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote again from the red book, where it said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will follow the basic principle that government decisions must 
be made on the merits of a case rather than according to the 
political influence of those making the case. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was from red book one, fairy book one, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BDC rejected the $615,000 loan application.  After a couple 
of phone calls and visit from the Prime Minister, all of a sudden 
the lack of merit of the case was overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand this is an unprecedented constant guidance and 
involvement from the Prime Minister's office.  There is no 
question about that.  It has been borne out repeatedly by the 
evidence produced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point the Prime Minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our election in October no goal has been more important to 
this government, or to me personally as Prime Minister, than 
restoring the trust of Canadians in their institutions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is laughable, given the conduct of the Prime Minister over 
the past number of years.  Since trust could be restored through 
a code of conduct, why would members on the government bench 
resist such a genuine attempt to try to restore some of the 
confidence that Canadians once held in members of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also quote the Prime Minister, from red book one, when he 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of government is put into question when there is a 
perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists exercising 
undue influence away from public view. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet a recent court decision echoes similar concerns over 
political influence in the awarding of helicopter projects to 
replace the aging Sea Kings.  We all recall the cancellation of 
the EH-101 project at a cost of $500 million to taxpayers.  It 
was all done with the simple stroke of a pen.  The Prime Minister 
said he would take his pen and write zero, and that is what he 
did.  It cost Canadian taxpayers $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the Prime Minister continues to maintain that he did nothing 
wrong in securing a loan for Mr. Duhaime in his constituency. The 
ethics counsellor was appointed by the Prime Minister and reports 
only to the Prime Minister, in private.  We know of the recent 
revelations that there were problems in terms of locating just 
where those pesky shares went when they were sold to Mr. Prince. 
They somehow went off into the abyss.  They were floating around 
out there and no one seems to be taking any kind of ownership of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the most recent opportunity that the government had to 
clarify that was met with, yes, wait for it, who are they going 
to put in place to answer some of these pesky questions?  Yes, it 
is going to be the Prime Minister's protector, the Prime Minister 
wannabe, Mini-Me, the Minister of Industry, who will be the 
person who will clear the Prime Minister again of any wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are going to be comforted.  They are going to be able 
to sleep at night knowing that the Minister of Industry is going 
to clear the Prime Minister of any wrongdoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry will similarly examine and, I am sure, 
instantaneously explore the circumstances surrounding this.  Yes, 
the man who would be king will no doubt clear the emperor and his 
new clothes and find that there is nothing wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all demonstrates the need for a code of conduct in this 
place.  I hope that all members would support the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Motion No. 200 presented by the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, which requests that 
the government introduce legislation establishing a code of 
conduct for members of parliament and senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that my hon. colleague has drawn on the work accomplished 
by the special joint committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons on a code of conduct, which was established by the 
government in 1995.  Specifically my hon. colleague refers to the 
committee's final report, which proposed a code to be 
administered by the House and the Senate that drew on many of the 
common elements raised during the testimony of its witnesses over 
the course of a two year indepth study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the committee mentioned the following:  that a list 
of principles should precede such a code; that a commissioner or 
a body be appointed to provide advice, take disclosures and 
enforce the code, as does the ethics counsellor for ministers and 
parliamentary secretaries now; the need for general rules against 
parliamentarians improperly using influence and insider 
information to further their private interests; the importance of 
dealing with disclosure of assets and interests; the need to 
address gifts, personal benefits and sponsored travel; the 
importance of clarifying the area of government contracting; and 
recognizing the distinction between the legislature and the 
executive by recommending that a permanent committee be 
established to administer such a code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee heard from many witnesses, including 
the federal ethics counsellor, the privacy commissioner, 
academics in the field, political scientists, respected members 
of the media and several provincial commissioners of ethics.  At 
the time, both sides of the House and the other place could not 
agree on this report or on the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us here today is very different.  It calls for 
a legislated parliamentary code rather than a code adopted and 
administered by the House and the other place itself.  Indeed, 
the final report of that special committee, referred to in my 
hon. friend's motion, recommended against such a legislated 
parliamentary code.  It was felt that such an approach would make 
any code too rigid to administer and difficult to adapt to 
evolving circumstances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT91"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT91"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special joint committee members expressed further concern that a 
legislated code might invite judicial interference in internal 
parliamentary procedures.  Consequently, the committee 
recommended that a code be implemented by resolutions in each 
Chamber.  That of course is different from a legislated statutory 
code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the special joint committee's report was 
not adopted because members of parliament themselves could not 
agree to adopt the report.  I recall as an individual member at 
the time being generally in support of having a code but asking 
if such a code would necessarily have to involve spouses of 
parliamentarians.  There were one or two spouses of 
parliamentarians at the time who essentially told us to go to 
hell, saying that they would not have their personal lives 
interfered with because of the fact that their spouses happened 
to be members of parliament and that their personal business 
dealings would not be made part of the public record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was just one of the obstacles members had to encounter at 
that time.  That was for ordinary members of parliament, not for 
cabinet ministers, recalling, of course, that cabinet ministers 
and parliamentary secretaries in this place are already subject 
to a code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge lies in the lack of agreement in the House, 
including the lack of agreement within parties in the House.  For 
its part, the government has taken specific actions on integrity 
and ethics, including the appointment of the first ever ethics 
counsellor in the history of Canada, who provides advice on 
issues relating to matters of conflict of interest and the 
ethical conduct of government officials, including ministers and 
parliamentary secretaries, and who reports to parliament on his 
duties and investigations under the Lobbyists Registration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new conflict of interest code for public office 
holders, which sets out principles and clear rules for all public 
office holders.  That includes ministers, secretaries of state, 
parliamentary secretaries, ministerial staff and full time 
governor in council appointees.  It was tabled in the House in 
1994.  That code of ethics has been functioning well for seven 
years, notwithstanding the jaded view of the opposition in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Lobbyists Registration Act amendments increase 
the transparency of lobbying activities.  All lobbyists now have 
to reveal more about their projects and their fees and are 
prohibited from including contingency fees in their contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has delivered on commitments to improve the 
standards of ethical behaviour in government, but the issue of 
ethics and a code of conduct for parliamentarians is not one for 
the government alone.  It is an issue for all members of 
parliament and for senators.  A code of conduct is a matter which 
all parliamentarians have and must have an interest in.  It is a 
matter that should have the support and agreement of all members 
of the House and the other Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, members have decided to rely on informal mechanisms 
rather than adopt a formal code administered by the House and 
Senate.  That is for ordinary members of parliament and does not 
refer to ministers and parliamentary secretaries.  A legislated 
code would appear to run counter to that view, as well as counter 
to the advice in 1997 of the joint committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I urge members to reconsider this and, in 
fact, not support this motion, which would in the end impose a 
piece of legislation, a statute codifying a code of ethics. 
Rather, I urge members to consider the template and mechanism of 
having a code of ethics adopted and administered by the House and 
a similar, if not identical, code of ethics adopted and 
administered by senators, members of parliament in the other 
place.

Madam Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague, the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, for bringing forward this 
important motion.  This is a topic that has garnered the 
attention of many people across the country and obviously of all 
members of parliament, because as elected people in the country 
who are representing our constituents we want to provide 
leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some examples of difficulties with ethical 
behaviour or the appearance of conflict in regard to the Prime 
Minister's dealings in Shawinigan, which is well documented and 
which I will be touching on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent 10 years as a teacher before I became a member of 
parliament.  I know that there was a very well defined code of 
conduct that we had as educators who are put in positions of 
trust working with children, parents, colleagues and different 
levels of the administration.  If that code of conduct was 
compromised, of course there were some very serious consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth revisiting this notion of having a code of conduct 
for members of parliament.  We would hope that there would be 
sound judgment used by all members at all times and that such a 
debate would not be necessary, but it seems as though some 
examples have brought this forward again and there does need to 
be a code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on a particular example that was brought to my 
attention regarding the actions of one of our current colleagues, 
that being the member for Waterloo—Wellington, in his riding 
during the recent federal election.  He is a parliamentary 
secretary.  He represents a minister of the crown.  He wrote a 
letter during the campaign which was viewed as very inappropriate 
by members of his own community.  I will not go into all of the 
specifics, but perhaps I will highlight some of the things the 
community mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Waterloo—Wellington wrote a letter which 
residents of the Morningside Retirement Village in New Hamburg in 
his riding were very concerned about.  In fact, they were shocked 
that such a provocative letter from the incumbent member would 
come forward.  In fact, I will quote directly from a member of 
the community.  Maryjean Brown, the director of a retirement 
complex within the community, said “I couldn't believe that kind 
of letter could be read at that kind of gathering of people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what happened was that the member of parliament wrote 
a letter attacking some of the members of this retirement 
community for some of their alleged responses to somebody who 
worked for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the letter the member wrote.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise this with you is because we discreetly 
followed half of these men and were astounded to discover they 
were residents of Morningside. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that he understands that most of the residents 
are “decent, law-abiding, God-fearing and kind individuals” but 
then said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next time this occurs, I will be pressing charges against these 
weak and hideous men under the Ontario Human Rights Code, and 
will be happy to make their name or names national headlines 
across Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was something one of our colleagues wrote in a letter on 
his parliamentary secretary letterhead to people in his community 
during the election campaign, which the people of the community 
viewed as very inappropriate.  Obviously on the face of it, I 
think all of us would be surprised by such a thing.  This was an 
issue that was brought forward during the campaign.  Some of the 
people in the community commented on this and were quite 
surprised by this action.  I will again quote again Ms. Brown, 
the director of the retirement village, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it had to be brought up, it should have been brought up by 
himself instead of sending somebody else to do his dirty work. 
Everybody here is very, very upset about it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had this letter read at a public meeting rather than 
attending himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very specific example of a member who is one of our 
colleagues and who used his privileges as a parliamentary 
secretary in a way which many would deem to be inappropriate.  If 
members have difficulty with lack of judgment in this kind of 
example, then I think it is a thing we need to discuss as 
members, because we need to be showing leadership in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn from that unfortunate incident to talk a bit about 
the Shawinigan affair.  I will also rebut a few of the comments 
made by my colleague, the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader, when he talked about the ethics 
counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough gave a good 
summary of the ethics counsellor debate that we had not long ago 
and how the government voted down a promise in its own red book. 
It was a motion brought forward by the Alliance and supported by 
all members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the government side mentioned that the ethics 
counsellor does report to parliament.  What he neglected to point 
out was that he reports to parliament at committee when called as 
a witness for estimates or some other thing.  What my colleague 
did not say, because it is not the case, is that reports by the 
ethics counsellor are not tabled in the House of Commons.  The 
ethics counsellor does not report directly to parliament on any 
investigations or provide any information, such as was brought 
forward with the Shawinigan case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance had a motion before the House that would 
have required the ethics counsellor to report to the House and to 
table reports in the House so that all members could be made 
aware of the facts.  It would have been a far greater thing for 
members of cabinet to be cleared of any wrongdoing.  If all 
documents and reports were tabled before the House and there was 
no wrongdoing there would be no wondering about what was in the 
report.  It would be a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly could not understand why the government defeated 
our motion, which was, in large part I believe, some of my 
Conservative colleague's motivation for bringing forward his 
motion today.  We need to have a debate about ethical conduct in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the circumstances surrounding the Prime 
Minister on a daily basis have not gone away and continue to 
percolate, even today in question period.  Circumstances like 
that are ones that bring into question the ethical behaviour of 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has a very strict code of conduct for members 
of the legislative assembly.  I have talked to some members of 
the provincial government who have told me that their code of 
conduct legislation states that even if there is an appearance of 
a conflict of interest an investigation will be done and, from 
what I understand, such reports are tabled in the provincial 
legislature.  That is far different from the ethics counsellor 
process we have debated here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be considering some changes.  If we want to restore 
confidence in this place in the minds and hearts of people, then 
we need to work together on many issues in the House.  We have 
done that on some occasions in this parliament already.  We did 
so on the motion in regard to the sex offender registry, which we 
voted on this week.  In large part, we had agreement today in the 
softwood lumber debate.  We did not have the same agreement on 
the ethics counsellor motion, which was unfortunate because it 
was designed to restore confidence in the minds of those we 
govern that we are serious about ethical behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Alliance Party will continue to work together to 
find ways to solve important issues in this place.  I commend my 
colleague for bringing forward this important motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only commend the hon. member for an initiative that would 
essentially provide for more openness and integrity in the 
governance of our nation. So it would be in order, as I said, to 
thank and commend the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am always surprised when I see my colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House, putting a damper on the whole issue of a so-called code of 
conduct, because I am sure everyone knows that it is not the 
first time that such an issue is put before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our former colleague, Gordon Earle, introduced two bills on this 
issue: Bill C-488, during the first session of the 36th 
parliament, and Bill C-226, during the second session. 
Unfortunately both bills were not made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But on December 16, 1999, we had the opportunity to discuss the 
last version of the bill introduced by Mr. Earle, that is 
Bill C-226. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government 
in the House came up with the same arguments as before, with 
lots of euphemisms, to say how important it is for members of 
parliament to have a code of conduct, and that parliamentary 
practice has over time led to the establishment of certain 
rules, and that it would therefore be utterly pointless to 
enshrine such a code of conduct in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, he asked us, as he did earlier and as he did in 1999, to 
take a close look at the rules that we have given ourselves over 
time, to make sure these rules are respected. However he remained 
totally vague regarding how the rules would be applied, who 
would be responsible for their implementation and what the 
sanctions would be, where appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are rules. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons is right when 
he says that, over time, a number of rules were put in place 
through the various acts, rules of the House and established 
practices, but have these rules prevented some rather dubious 
things from happening here in recent years? Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are currently in the midst of a scandal that has come to be 
known as Shawinigate, and the Prime Minister himself refuses to 
lift the shroud of suspicion by tabling documents that would 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not in a conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, today, we are once again forced to discuss such issues and 
confronted to this kind of situation, it is obviously because 
the current rules do not achieve the objective pursued. We must 
therefore give ourselves more compelling rules. There is no 
doubt in my mind about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the hon. member for Halifax tabled another bill, Bill 
C-299, to establish a code of conduct for members of parliament 
and senators. 
We will know later if this bill will be approved by the 
subcommittee on private members' business, so that it can 
eventually be put to a vote in the House after having been 
selected as a votable item through the luck of the draw.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the members opposite do not seem very eager 
to debate this type of issue. Just recently the government 
defeated a motion brought forward by the Canadian Alliance, the 
official opposition, in which it was simply asking the 
government to honour a promise made by the Liberal Party in the 
1993 red book, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will appoint an independent Ethics 
Counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the 
day-to-day application of the Code of Conduct for Public 
Officials. The Ethics Counsellor will be appointed after 
consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House of 
Commons and will report directly to Parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another promise that has fallen by the wayside, because 
the government voted against the motion. It no longer agrees 
that the House should appoint an ethics counsellor who would 
oversee the application of a code of conduct adopted by the 
House and who would report directly to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government got itself elected in 1993 by telling Canadians 
that it would bring in the necessary reforms so as to restore 
their confidence in public institutions and in the integrity of 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government done since it took office? Absolutely 
nothing. On the contrary, it had the opportunity to bring in 
major changes to the Canada Elections Act. What did these 
important changes turn into? They turned into a large number of 
changes, certainly, but mostly technical and cosmetic changes. 
It could have undertaken major reforms to help Canadians and 
Quebecers find their way though our electoral system, but it has 
not seen fit to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have changed the rules governing the financing of 
political parties. 
We can understand that a political party generously funded by 
corporations, which takes the power and finds itself in front of 
the pork barrel, may feel an obligation to return favours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present rules governing the financing of political parties 
are an invitation for the government to fail to respect the 
highest standards of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the motives of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for introducing his motion. That 
being said, I think I must reiterate what I said during the 
debate on Bill C-226 introduced by our colleague, Mr. Earle, and 
that is that it may be somewhat premature to consider adopting a 
code of conduct for members of parliament and senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should start by looking into a code of conduct for people 
around the cabinet, the members of cabinet themselves, 
parliamentary secretaries, senior civil servants, people who 
have access on a daily basis to privileged information, people 
who spend taxpayers money on all kinds of subsidies and who, if 
we put together the refusal to reform the Canada Elections Act 
with respect to the financing of political parties and the 
refusal to adopt a code of conduct for ministers and members of 
cabinet, could put themselves in rather embarrassing positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is almost up, I will conclude by saying that we 
would have hoped that, contrary to what the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader suggested in his 
remarks, the government would be more open to such a reform. 
Since it has shown very little openness so far to electoral 
reform, parliamentary reform, the introduction of a code of 
conduct and the appointment by parliament of an ethics 
counsellor who would be accountable to parliament, we should 
not be surprised by the remarks made this afternoon by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in favour of Motion No. 200, tabled by the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
introduce legislation establishing a code of conduct for Members 
of Parliament and Senators, based on the March 1997 final report 
of the Special Joint Committee on a Code of Conduct of the Senate 
and the House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons, this exquisite Chamber of vaulted 
ceilings, carved wood and coloured glass, is the heart of our 
democratic system.  Yet, when Canadians watch us in question 
period on TV they see us caterwauling and jeering.  They see our 
junior high antics and some very low grade behaviour.  We all 
know that does not serve us well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they see this place as a sideshow, as a zoo, by extension 
they see us, their representatives and their members of 
parliament, as objects of scorn and derision.  That is something 
we have to clean up.  We have to clean up our act, real or 
perceived.  We have to make sure that this place does not suffer 
from the shame of bad behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us back to the motion and the idea of a code of 
conduct.  It is not the first time that the House has grappled 
with the issue over the years.  On December 16, 1999, the House 
debated Bill C-226, an act to establish a parliamentarian's code 
of conduct, brought in by Gordon Earle, the former NDP member for 
Halifax West.  That bill would have gone a long way to move this 
item along on the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that debate Gordon Earle stated that the bill would in fact 
be realistic and would reflect in the provincial legislatures and 
in other nations' assemblies.  This code of conduct would raise 
the level of integrity of our parliament.  The bill was rooted in 
very practical and legitimate concerns that Canadians hold about 
their parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His bill was based on the following principles. Parliamentarians 
should have the highest ethical standards so as to maintain and 
enhance public confidence and trust in the integrity of 
parliamentarians and parliament.  Parliamentarians should perform 
their official duties and arrange their private affairs in a 
manner that would bear the closest public scrutiny. 
Parliamentarians should avoid placing themselves under any 
financial or other obligation that may influence them in the 
performance of their official duties.  Parliamentarians upon 
entering office should arrange their private affairs to prevent 
real or apparent conflict of interest.  If such do arise, it 
should be resolved in a way that protects the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, under that bill all parliamentarians would have to 
disclose all official travel when the cost exceeded $250 in cases 
where the trip was not completely paid for by parliament or by 
one of the few officially recognized sponsors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No parliamentarians would be permitted to be a party to a 
contract with the Government of Canada under which the 
parliamentarian received a benefit.  Parliamentarians would be 
required to make a disclosure of all assets once every calendar 
year and would be required to make public disclosure of the 
nature although not the value of all assets each year.  Finally, 
to ensure that the public interest and the highest standards were 
upheld, there would be an ethics counsellor to advise 
parliamentarians on any question relating to conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that Gordon Earle's private member's bill 
was reintroduced yesterday by our leader, the member for Halifax. 
She reintroduced legislation to establish a code of conduct for 
MPs and an ethics counsellor who would report on an annual basis 
directly to parliament, not to the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If such a code already existed, Canadians might have been spared 
the unseemly spectacle of the Shawinigan situation and the whole 
controversy surrounding the opposition leader's defamation suit 
and how it was handled financially.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would say that it is time we re-addressed the 
erosion of public confidence in parliament and in 
parliamentarians.  It is time to help MPs deal with complicated 
ethical issues, to restore their faith in the institution of 
parliament and to provide them with a clear rule book on issues 
of ethics and conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for 
moving the motion and providing me with the opportunity to speak 
this evening on this important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would begin by expressing my sadness 
that private members' hour has been turned into a partisan debate 
and an attack on the governing party, and the Prime Minister in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that because in the last parliament it was understood 
by both sides of the House, by all parties and all backbenchers, 
that private members' business would be dedicated to private 
members' issues and bills in a non-partisan way.  I am very 
distressed that this rule has been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would observe first that the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough began his remarks by saying that 
his motion was made non-votable because of the Liberal dominated 
subcommittee on private members' business.  Liberal dominated 
were the exact words he used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, Madam Speaker, I will tell you that there is only one 
Liberal on that subcommittee and four opposition members.  If he 
has a problem in making his motion votable, it is a problem on 
the opposition side, not on the Liberal side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, what disappoints me is the issue of a code of 
conduct for MPs, which is an important issue.  The report of the 
senate joint committee was an excellent report.  It dealt with 
gifts.  It set a ceiling on gifts which was very important 
because not every member comes from communities where they 
realize that it is not right to take expensive gifts from other 
people in the context of their duties.  The ceiling was set at 
$250, and I thought that was a little high actually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were provisions for travel by corporations and companies 
that were offering what is known in the newspaper trade as 
freebies.  All of this was very good but it was not something 
that had to be in legislation.  It not only could have been dealt 
with by resolution, but I say to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, that if he really believes in 
the principles expressed by the senate joint committee, then he 
should get his leader to stand and say that he supports those 
principles and that they should serve as guidelines in his own 
caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be done.  It does not require legislation.  All it 
requires is the various leaders of the parties simply saying that 
they agree in principle and then individual MPs could act 
according to their consciences.  It would be an enormous step 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the leader of the fifth party would actually 
address that, not only in spirit but in the practical sense. 
Maybe he would be required to disclose not only his assets and 
his salaries but the salaries of his wife.  I wonder whether his 
wife would even agree with it.  I do not know.  It would be a 
very interesting test. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Motion No. 200 put 
forward by the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
because it is very close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked to hear the hon. member from the Liberal side say 
that the motion had no relevance.  It is very relevant and there 
is a need for the government to introduce legislation 
establishing a code of conduct for members of parliament and 
senators.  This is the highest Chamber in the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, even professionals, like doctors, lawyers, 
insurance agents and real estate agents, have a code of conduct 
for their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder voter turnout has been falling.  We need to restore 
the public's trust in the reputation, credibility and integrity 
of members of parliament in this House. 
There is a need to restore the reputation, credibility, integrity 
and faith in politicians.  There is a need to set a higher bar 
for members of parliament and set an example for Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a need to address the issue of conflict of 
interest, particularly in light of the shadow hanging over the 
Prime Minister over the ethics issue.  Look at the government's 
record on patronage and its record of handing out grants and 
contributions and tying them to the donations given to the 
political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues make it so important for us to have this code 
of conduct.  It cannot be confidential, as the government states. 
I emphasize the need to establish a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank all hon. members on this side of 
the House who spoke so favourably and eloquently with respect to 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge Gordon Earle and his attempts to 
bring forward a similar motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take some umbrage with the unprovoked attack on the leader of 
the Conservative Party.  I do not think there is anybody in the 
Chamber who has set a higher ethical standard.  He is a man of 
pristine ethical performance in this Chamber with unchallenged 
ethical standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when I look back again over the words of the parliamentary 
secretary, on February 8, we see the melting of that moral 
outrage like the snow outside.  There is not even placid 
consideration of his own words based on what he said in the House 
today.  There is not even a consideration that this might be a 
good idea, even though just a few short weeks ago he called for 
this very motion.  It is very disappointing that a member with 
his length of service in the House would back away from his words 
so artfully.  The devil is in the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that no honest politician could ever be hurt by 
the implementation of a code of conduct, nor, for that matter, 
the appointment of an independent ethics counsellor to report to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear a lot of chirping from the chipmunks across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer again to the joint committee's report which was 
authored by the current Speaker, a member of the governing party. 
It touches on some important principles.  It speaks of ethical 
standards, public scrutiny, independence, public interest, gifts 
and benefits, something the hon. member said just moments ago 
that he was concerned about.  Again those words ring hollow.  Why 
would we not want to delve into issues of furthering private 
interest, using influence, insider information, declaration of 
interest, gifts and benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all the subject matter of the report that was tabled 
and put forward by the current Speaker and Senator Oliver in the 
other place.  Why would we not want to try to improve the 
tarnished image of this place?  Why would we not want to try to 
raise the bar somehow of what has occurred over the past number 
of years under the current government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of the Prime Minister is that he has lowered the 
ethical standards.  I do not say that personally.  I am referring 
to the comments that were made by Gordon Robertson, a retired 
clerk of the Privy Council and the head of the Public Service of 
Canada, who served under Prime Ministers King, St. Laurent, 
Pearson and Trudeau.  In the Toronto <I>Star</I> on January 6, 
speaking of the current ethical standards of the Prime Minister, 
Mr. Robertson said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in Shawinigan never would have met the standard set 
in Pearson's code of ethics.  I should know—I drafted it. This 
Prime Minister has lowered the bar. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of this Prime Minister is that he has lowered the 
bar, the erosion of public confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to have faith.  They very much want to have faith 
in the ethical standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I know it is at the 
end of the day, but I would caution the hon. members to be 
careful of the language they use in the House, including the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will govern myself 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to have faith in their elected representatives. 
They very much want to believe that their politicians are here 
for a strong purpose and are behaving within a higher standard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes a long time to build trust, and that faith is 
particularly shaken by the performance of the government.  If we 
are to even start to move toward having a higher standard we 
should have a tangible place to go when we examine the conduct of 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government House leader's 
parliamentary secretary did not at least take the opportunity to 
put forward some other alternative.  He made an oblique, vague 
reference to the fact that we could not do it because it would be 
legislated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should put forward some other alternatives or bring forward 
some original ideas.  We would be more than happy to wrap our 
arms around them because this is an issue of non-partisan 
importance in the Chamber.  If Canadians could see a demonstrated 
effort on the part of all members of parliament they would 
appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by asking that there be unanimous consent that the 
matter be made votable.  I know this is once again a leap of 
faith and that it will not happen, but I would ask that the 
motion be made votable.  I know we will get a resounding no from 
the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent?

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on February 19 I asked two questions about the 
ongoing Shawinigan scandal involving the Prime Minister in the 
Grand-Mère Golf Club.  The answers provided by the Deputy Prime 
Minister were simply unsatisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the facts around the Prime Minister's ownership 
of the golf course.  He apparently sold his shares in 1993 upon 
becoming Prime Minister.  However that deal fell through and the 
Prime Minister did not receive payment.  He contacted the ethics 
counsellor to inform him of this and the ethics counsellor has 
admitted the Prime Minister could have lost money on his 
investment had the value of the golf course property decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to ensure the value of the golf course property did not 
decrease was by ensuring the neighbouring Grand-Mère Inn remained 
afloat financially.  This is where the Prime Minister became 
involved and how taxpayer dollars started to flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the facts.  First, a $164,000 TJF grant was given for 
expansion of the inn.  By the way, the owner who took the inn off 
the Prime Minister's hands, a friend of the Prime Minister named 
Yvon Duhaime, had been convicted of drunk driving, assault and 
uttering threats.  Unfortunately he forgot to mention those 
details when applying for the grant.  I wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have since learned that he was involved in a high speed chase 
through Shawinigan going 127 kilometres an hour in a 50 kilometre 
an hour zone and was again charged with drunk driving.  This is 
the person who was apparently just a constituent of the Prime 
Minister's.  He was a friend of the Prime Minister, a fairly 
unsavoury character who had been involved in all kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is the famous loan for $615,000 from the Business 
Development Bank to the inn which the Prime Minister helped 
arrange via personal phone calls to the president of the bank. 
The Prime Minister in a 1999 letter to the <I>National Post</I>, 
said he had no direct or indirect personal connection with the 
hotel.  Revelations to the contrary have since become common 
knowledge.  By the way, the president, Mr. Beaudoin, was fired 
shortly after the bank called in the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, $2.3 million was put into the inn via the immigrant 
investor fund.  The Prime Minister met with Louis Leblanc, a 
broker who organized where the funds were directed.  The next 
day, March 1, 1996, the money started to flow.  By the way, the 
Prime Minister originally denied that immigrant investor funds 
had been sunk into the inn.  It has become crystal clear that the 
Prime Minister has been very involved in the Grand-Mère Inn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister helped secure funds for his friend and owner 
of the inn.  As a byproduct it can be argued that he helped 
ensure that he did not lose on the value of the golf course 
shares for which he was not paid until 1999.  It is clear to 
Canadians that the shenanigans in Shawinigan involving the Prime 
Minister remain unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the Prime Minister told so many different versions about 
his involvement with the shares of his golf course and about his

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not clear the air by undertaking an 
independent inquiry into all the details in his own backyard? 
What is it that the Prime Minister does not want Canadians to 
know in regard to his dealings with these shaky situations in 
Shawinigan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want answers to these very serious questions.  When 
will they be answered by the Prime Minister?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
Prime Minister of Canada has explained to the House on numerous 
occasions that he sold his shares in the golf course prior to 
becoming Prime Minister and that they have never returned to his 
possession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All relevant documentation has been reviewed by the ethics 
counsellor who told the industry committee, on May 6, 1999, that 
he had reviewed the agreement of sale.  He described that 
agreement as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it is unambiguous in language; it's fairly simple.  There is no 
basis for anybody trying to...say that there was an option aspect 
to it...It was a sale, and it was an unsecured sale. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He added to this statement by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Prime Minister doesn't own the shares and has not 
owned the shares since November 1, 1993, which, from my point of 
view, is the only issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the 
Conservative Party asked the ethics counsellor for further 
clarification of the matter during the recent election campaign. 
Once again, the ethics counsellor confirmed that the Prime 
Minister had absolutely no financial interest in the golf course 
or in a nearby hotel when he assumed office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should remind members that what is at the core of this 
issue is a hotel expansion project in the Prime Minister's riding 
which received the support of the local caisse populaire as well 
as the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project created 19 new jobs.  The hotel is open for business 
and employs over 60 people in an area of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is time the opposition dropped this fishing expedition 
and started dealing with matters of real importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
