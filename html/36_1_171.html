<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 26, 1998, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-302, an act to establish the rights of fishers 
including the right to be involved in the process of fisheries 
stock assessment, fish conservation, setting of fishing quotas, 
fishing licensing and the public right to fish and establish the 
right of fishers to be informed of decisions affecting fishing as 
a livelihood in advance and the right to compensation if other 
rights are abrogated unfairly, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I would like to begin by giving the 
House the assurance that discussions have taken place 
between all parties and the member for New Brunswick Southwest 
concerning the taking of the division on Bill C-302 scheduled at 
the conclusion of Private Members' Business today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe you would find consent for the following:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Saanich—Gulf Islands to speak to this private member's bill to 
bring forward a fishers bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few concerns about this bill.  However, I give my 
qualified support to the member for bringing it forward.  I 
believe some of my concerns can be addressed at the committee 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this bill is to bring accountability to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have travelled to both coasts of this country.  In Atlantic 
Canada we visited some 15 to 20 communities.  We visited 
approximately 15 communities on the west coast.  We listened to 
fishers from all of these communities who raised a number of 
concerns which consistently involved the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for New Brunswick Southwest has a very large presence 
of fishers in his riding and he is trying to offer some 
protection to them with this bill of rights, to which I give my 
qualified support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of what the member is trying to do, first and 
foremost, is to ensure that there is some form of accountability 
within the department.  We often see a lack of accountability in 
many areas of government, such as the decision which was brought 
down a few weeks ago in British Columbia by the judicial system. 
We need to address accountability within our judicial system when 
decisions are made that are completely outrageous.  I am making 
reference to the child pornography decision.  There are many 
examples where there is no accountability and we have to do 
something about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern about the right to compensation. The bill 
states that if the rights of fishers are abrogated unfairly they 
have an absolute right to compensation.  I do not think we can 
put that into legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been a strong believer that the fishery must be 
both environmentally and economically sustainable.  I accept the 
fact that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is the largest 
single factor.  There are other factors, but without question the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans has not been held accountable 
for the collapse of the cod fishery in Atlantic Canada where we 
have seen over $2 billion of taxpayers' money being paid to 
fishermen who sit at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the fishery was mismanaged, but I do 
not believe the answer is to send out more money, bad money on 
top of bad money.  The one area of concern I have is with putting 
something in legislation which would give a group of people the 
absolute right to compensation.  I think that is something that 
has to be addressed on a case by case basis and we have to be 
very careful in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to addressing that concern at committee.  Again I 
would offer my qualified support for this bill and suggest that 
we look at it when it comes back from committee to decide if we 
should support it at that time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to explain why Bill C-302 should not 
become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen and mariners alike know how easy it is to get lost at 
sea, especially in fog.  Debate on this bill seems to be like 
sailing in a particularly thick fog. 
The debate has wandered all over the map and has been lost in the 
fog of rhetoric and politics. It has strayed far from the facts 
and facts are what we need when we talk about Canada's fishery. 
Facts are what are needed here, not emotion, not fed bashing, not 
rhetoric and not scoring political points. Few facts have been 
advanced from the other side of the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important fact is that none of the opposition parties would 
support this bill in the unlikely event they were to form a 
government.  Why?  Because it is a bad bill that would become bad 
law, one that would neither preserve fish stocks nor help fishing 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During early debate on this bill my colleagues spelled out its 
many deficiencies, but today I would like to return to the issue 
of compensation which was raised by the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Alberni when this bill was last debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the right to compensation for those whose rights 
were taken away or abrogated by the federal government was 
probably the most controversial aspect of the bill.  It would be 
hard to say which is the most controversial aspect of this bill 
but this one certainly ranks close to the top.  The strangest 
assertion in the hon. member's qualified defence of this bill 
came when he said that government and DFO bureaucracy will fight 
this clause tooth and nail because it attempts to make them 
accountable for decisions they make about people affected by 
their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this clause contribute to making the government and the 
so-called bureaucracy more accountable than they already are? 
Presumably by making them pay for the so-called damage their 
policies have caused.  But who pays here?  What did the architect 
of the bill have in mind?  Where does the member think the money 
would come from to compensate fishers harmed by a government 
decision?  Not from the minister and the so-called bureaucracy, 
but from the taxpayer. This is from a party that prides itself on 
fiscal responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot afford the luxury of throwing taxpayer 
money around.  The government has to be responsible to all 
Canadians.  Sometimes that requires making tough calls, the kind 
which do not please everyone but which hold the greatest hope for 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member says that it is far easier for bureaucrats 
or ministers to sit ensconced, buffered and unchallenged and be 
securely protected from the results of their decisions, he 
implies several things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he implies that public employees and the minister are 
somehow unaccountable, but the fact is the government is 
responsible to the people of Canada.  When the people of Canada 
vote they pass judgment on the government's performance.  If the 
government needs to be held accountable for mistakes every 
Canadian can do so at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he implies that instituting a regime that would hand 
over millions of taxpayer dollars would somehow punish those who 
make decisions in Ottawa.  To this I can only say that it seems 
as if the fog has rolled in and completely obscured the hon. 
member's argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving aside the strange notion that public employees should be 
punished for doing their jobs to the best of their abilities, 
this clause would punish no one but the member's constituents and 
those of every member in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would it accomplish other than to burden the taxpayer and 
take money away from other worthwhile causes?  Nothing. 
Would it create more fish?  No.  Would it preserve the fish that 
are left?  No.  On the contrary, if the bill succeeded in 
discouraging DFO and the government from taking steps to conserve 
fish stocks it would do just the opposite.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking time with this argument because the hon. member for 
Nanaimo—Alberni said it was the crux of the bill to bring 
accountability to the bureaucracy. The women and men of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans are already accountable to 
their superiors who report to the minister, who is in turn 
accountable to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once more we can say how badly conceived and unnecessary this 
bill is.  The member went on to say the DFO bureaucrats would 
prefer not to deal with people affected by their decisions 
because plainly it is uncomfortable for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again let us look at the facts.  In September the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans convened a meeting with fishermen for a mid 
season review of the cod stocks in the gulf of St. Lawrence.  He 
took with him to the meeting those same DFO scientists and 
managers the member says would prefer not to deal with people 
affected by their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member would have us think that DFO does not seek input from 
fishers, but my colleagues have already recounted in detail how 
fishers across the country are participating in fisheries 
management decisions that affect their industry.  Fishers are 
actively involved in stock assessment, fish conservation and 
monitoring.  They participate in the development of integrated 
fishery management plans and the setting of fishing quotas.  Many 
fishers are already involved directly in managing fisheries 
through co-management or joint project management with DFO. DFO 
developed co-management to give the people who work in the 
fishery more say in how it is managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new fisheries act will offer individuals and communities 
even more say over the decisions that affect their lives. We need 
to bring this debate to a speedy conclusion so this bill can come 
to the floor of the House and be rejected, as it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are far better ways to serve the needs of Canada's fishing 
communities and preserve the fishery for future generations. The 
government has taken a number of important steps and is moving on 
others.  I urge the House to reject the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for New Brunswick Southwest for bringing this bill 
forward.  It is an attempt to bring attention to the terrible 
situation of the fisheries and fishing families. I would like to 
bring to the debate a northern perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people do not think of Yukon as being a place where there 
is a fishing industry, but it certainly sustains the first 
nations fishing industry.  The Yukon River starts at Skagway, an 
American city, and comes up through Whitehorse.  This year the 
salmon did not come.  The fish ladder was almost empty by the 
time the river got to Carmacks. Alma Wrixon, a first nations 
woman, could not put her fish net in and that is part of what she 
has done every year for generations to sustain her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Pelly Banks they would catch perhaps three fish in a week if 
they were fortunate.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about their winter food.  In Dawson City they 
could not fish.  By the time they got to Old Crow there was no 
fish.  The Gwich'in people depend on the fishery and the 
caribou.  They have one caribou herd that is under stress.  They 
could not catch any fish to make it through the winter.  That is 
like their savings account, their money, their potatoes, their 
way of life to get through winter to the next spring when the 
birds return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill brings accountability to the department of fisheries. 
It is another mechanism to make sure the public resource of our 
water and the fish in our water are available to the people who 
depend on and need them. It is not necessarily for profit, though 
profit is an important part of it.  It is the benefit of having 
food to make it through a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are families and towns that depend on fish.  Again I 
stress it is a public resource.  It is not anything that is 
privately owned.  They have a right to have a say in how our 
fishery is managed.  So far we have not seen a good record of how 
our fishery has been managed under the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To allow this fishers bill of rights would be an important 
in-road in the bureaucracy so that those who live on fish have a 
say in how they are distributed.  It devolves some powers to 
those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1988 the federal government has spent $4 billion to 
restructure the fishery.  What it has meant is a total collapse 
in our fishing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the folks who depend on fish but who do not get the 
limelight, and those who live inland and whose resources are 
dependent on decisions by people they never see, this would give 
them an avenue to have a stronger and clearer say in their 
livelihood. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma—Manitoulin, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join with a number of my colleagues on 
this side of the House and across the way as we debate Bill 
C-302. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I preface my remarks by saying that my northern Ontario riding 
abuts Lake Superior and Lake Huron.  The commercial fishery is 
something that is important to my area as well.  Even though an 
inland fishery, the Great Lakes are among the great waters of the 
world.  The commercial fishers who extract fish from this 
resource are among the finest fishers anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I believe the genesis of this legislation relates more 
to the difficulties facing fishing communities and fisher persons 
on the east and west coasts, it is important that the House be 
reminded that there are a great number of people involved in the 
commercial fishing trade in the Great Lakes of Ontario.  I hope 
they will take some comfort in the comments being made today that 
their concerns will be addressed as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to Bill C-302.  We have heard that while this bill 
is well intentioned there are many flaws.  This is not unusual 
when one attempts to make a simplistic response to a very complex 
problem.  This is not to denigrate in any way the initiative of 
the sponsoring member, but the issues are complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to our fish resources the most important thing is 
that sustainability be our primary objective.  It does no one any 
good and no fishing community any good if the long term 
sustainability of the fish stocks on which they depend is 
compromised.  As the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has said, 
above all we must ensure the viability of this fish resource. 
It is only from that principle we can ensure the long term 
viability of the communities, businesses and individuals that 
depend on it.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a number of my colleagues on this side have said, fishers do 
not need a bill of rights.  They need a healthy fishery, a 
fishery that is sustainable and that can support fishermen today 
and their children, grandchildren and future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average citizen who is not involved in commercial fishing is 
well aware through the media and news stories of the plight 
facing fishing communities and fishers.   While there may be some 
merit to ensuring that fishermen are involved in planning for 
sustainable use of the resource, I do not believe that a bill of 
rights for fishermen is the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of the government is to protect and conserve Canada's 
oceans and great lake resources on all fronts.  As the minister 
has said, fish must come first so that people can then be taken 
care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No so-called bill of rights will protect fishers when the fish 
are in jeopardy or gone altogether.  A bill of rights cannot 
prevent the disappearance of fish stocks.  Only sound management, 
conservation based management can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend my remaining few minutes outlining some of 
the initiatives the government has taken.  It is not by one 
silver bullet that all the problems can be solved but rather by a 
series of well targeted and well managed programs that objectives 
when it comes to preserving a sustainable resource of fish can be 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite may be quick to point out what has not been 
done, but we know that politics is the art of the possible and 
much has been accomplished.  We are living in a world where real 
achievement comes through patience, persistence and negotiation, 
not grandstanding.  So much has been done that I can only 
highlight some of those accomplishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June was a particularly productive month.  On June 19 the 
minister announced the $250 million Atlantic groundfish licence 
retirement program, which is part of the federal government's 
$730 million worth of measures for restructuring an adjustment in 
the Atlantic groundfish industry.  The licence retirement program 
will help to reduce the number of groundfish enterprises in 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec.  It provides financial assistance to 
groundfish licence holders who retire their licences and leave 
the commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in June the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development announced $400 million 
worth of additional measures to restructure and rebuild the 
Pacific salmon fishery and to help people adjust to the reality 
of a smaller conservation based fishery.  There is no denying the 
scientific evidence shows that wild coho are declining and that 
some stocks are at extreme risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister said at the time, “permanent change is 
necessary for the future of fish and fishermen.  We must get 
ahead of the curve and shift to a conservation based fishery”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada made a major breakthrough on the east coast in June when 
member states of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation 
Organization followed Canada's lead and agreed to a number of 
strong conservation measures.  Among these was NASCO's formal 
adoption of the precautionary approach in Atlantic salmon 
fisheries management.  Canada had already adopted a precautionary 
approach in its 1998 Atlantic salmon management plans.  Greenland 
joined us in this approach when it agreed to restrict its 1998 
fishery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress is being made.  It may seem at times that progress is 
slow but such is the way of the world.  The inexorable flow is 
toward a better and better understanding of our fish resources 
and a better and better approach to sustainable conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just rounding out those June accomplishments, the minister 
announced that the Davis Strait turbot fishery had been fully 
Canadianized and that no foreign vessels would be used in this 
fishery.  This should help allay the fears of those still raising 
the spectre of foreign overfishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year management plan the minister introduced was 
developed with the advice and recommendations of the Nunavut 
Wildlife Management Board and the views of the industry.  These 
measures and numerous others are quite a record of achievement, 
one that demonstrates conviction and determination to put 
conservation first.  It is not enough to say that mistakes were 
made in the past.  What good is it to criticize the mistakes of 
the past and then advocate the same behaviour today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change our behaviour, as painful as that may be. 
That is what the minister has been telling Canada's fishermen.  I 
believe that Canadians in my constituency, in particular in the 
riding of Algoma—Manitoulin which as I have said is a beautiful 
Great Lakes riding, understand the importance of making change. 
They trust that the government will make change in a responsible, 
caring way.  Above all, as a government we have always tried to 
put people first.  While I would be the last one to say we have 
never made any mistakes, I would put our record as a government 
up against any record of any government anywhere in the world, 
particularly against recent past governments of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill of rights for fishers is certainly not necessary, 
especially when we consider the record of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on this first day back to the House.  I 
would like to take advantage of this opportunity to wish all my 
colleagues a happy New Year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am even more pleased that I am speaking on a bill initiated by 
my colleague, the member for New Brunswick—Southwest.  The House 
is addressing a matter that is of great importance to a number 
of Canadian communities.  The fishery is not the focus of the 
economy in the majority of ridings represented here. 
Still, there must not be indifference to the ongoing crisis in 
the fisheries sector in my province, in the Atlantic region and 
in the Pacific region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to the scientists in the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, as well as the minister and senior 
departmental officials, those who earn their daily livings from 
the sea are the ones who know it best.  That is why I applaud 
the initiative of my colleague from New Brunswick—Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His intent in this bill is to ensure that fishers have a say in 
decisions which may affect their work, their community and their 
way of life.  What could be more praiseworthy? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing fishers to have their say is not so far fetched.  It is 
something we as elected persons have been struggling to do for 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans 
visited 15 communities over a period of nine days in the late 
fall of 1997.  The committee spoke with fishermen, plant workers 
and others involved in the east coast fisheries in Newfoundland 
and Labrador, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the witnesses who appeared before the committee felt 
betrayed by the federal government.  In their opinion the federal 
government was responsible for managing the fishery and did not 
meet its responsibility.  The committee heard about the 
inequities and the arbitrary designations of those ineligible for 
the TAGS program. 
Many plant workers were ineligible because of small breaks in 
employment despite a long attachment to the industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was felt that the licence buyout portion of TAGS was not 
successful because the boats, gear and other licences were 
transferred to other fishermen.  Therefore the capacity was not 
reduced.  Fishermen have little confidence in the ability of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans to manage the fishery.  As 
well fishers question DFO's scientific estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a concern about the independence of the fisheries 
resources conservation council as the council used DFO staff and 
office space.  Fishermen from all areas are criticizing the 
quotas for foreign fishermen.  One fisherman quoted in the 
committee's report said “The fishery is the biggest foreign aid 
program around”.  The east coast communities want fish caught in 
Canadian waters to be processed in Canadian onshore plants rather 
than on foreign vessels that process onboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee travelled in January 1998 to west coast 
communities where it heard many of the same concerns it heard on 
the east coast. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The west coast fishery has experienced a rapid restructuring, 
due in large part to the Pacific salmon revitalization program, 
but also to various other factors affecting fishers and coastal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very many fishers are of the opinion that DFO no longer has any 
interest in the future of their communities, but has centralized 
its decision-making process in the regional offices and in 
headquarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many witnesses have criticized the lack of resources allocated 
to new fisheries. 
Downsizing at Fisheries and Oceans has resulted in a shortfall 
of personnel available to develop new fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO policies have raised serious concerns in many communities. 
For instance, the village of Ucluelet has invested massively in 
enhancing its water supply system because the processing of hake 
requires huge amounts of water. Then, DFO announced it planned 
to review its hake policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, DFO imposed on municipal governments in the Fraser Valley 
complex and expensive requirements with respect to cleaning 
ditches, while not taking any responsibility or sharing any 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such departmental decisions may be warranted, but they are being 
made without any consultation or paying any attention to their 
impacts on the individuals and communities concerned. 
That is what needs to change. They must be accountable to these 
people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a wealth of information and plain good common sense to 
be had from simply listening to the people who know the fishery 
best.  It is time to rely on more than just the good graces of 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.  The time has 
come to formally recognize the voice of fishers in the decision 
making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill endeavours to establish the rights of fishers so they 
will be involved in the process of fishery stocks assessment, 
fish conservation, setting fish quotas, fishing licensing and the 
public right to fish.  The bill would establish the rights of 
fishers to be informed in advance of decisions affecting fishing 
as a livelihood and the right to compensation if other rights are 
abrogated unfairly.  The livelihoods of people in Atlantic Canada 
and Pacific coast fish industries have been affected by arbitrary 
decisions made with little or no consultation with those directly 
affected.

seems to be the case today.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-302, 
an act to establish the rights of fishers including the right to 
be involved in the process of fisheries stock assessment, fish 
conservation, setting of fishing quotas, fishing licensing and 
the public right to fish and establish the right of fishers to be 
informed of decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in 
advance and the right to compensation if other rights are 
abrogated unfairly, be now read a second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it really is a pleasure to rise and speak to Bill 
C-302.  I commend the member for New Brunswick Southwest for 
bringing forth this bill.  He is absolutely right in the fact 
that fishermen need more rights in this country. We only have to 
look at what government has done in the last 10 years on 
fisheries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spent $4 billion on fishers.  What has that got us?  It 
has got us an east coast fishery that does not work, loads of 
unemployment and nothing positive in the future that we can see 
right now.  What has it done on the west coast?  It closed down 
coho salmon fishing last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money does not solve the problem but consultation in the fishing 
industry would solve the problem.  With this minister and 
ministers before him we have not had consultation with the 
fishermen, whether that has had to do with commercial fisheries 
or sports fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the committee travelled all across Canada. If members 
of this House would read the report, east coast and west coast, 
they would see that the government has not consulted the 
fishermen in any part of the country.  That is why a bill like 
this one is a very good bill.  I would implore the backbenchers 
on the other side who have been speaking against this bill to 
read the reports written by members of the House, including the 
Liberal side, to see what the recommendations are. Those 
recommendations are in this bill.  More consultation.  Not just 
more money thrown at a problem.  That will not solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two examples of lack of consultation.  The first is on 
the west coast in my own constituency. The minister wiped out 
coho fishing this year in British Columbia.  This put a lot of 
people out of work.  There was a great deal of sadness because we 
had a great run of coho but nobody was allowed to fish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hatchery in my constituency a couple of years ago put some 
coho in Porpoise Bay.  The minister had to lift the embargo of 
fishing coho and allow people to fish in Porpoise Bay because 
there were so many coho. The coho were going to spawn and if 
there are too many of them they lay eggs one on top of the other 
and a disease starts which could cause a real problem.  There was 
fishing in Porpoise Bay for coho.  That was not good planning by 
the government.  The fishermen told the government the year 
before that it could not put a ban in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen were also told that they could not seed the open ocean 
because, and these are the words of DFO, there are already too 
many coho out there.  DFO said not to put any out there. Then 
what did DFO do?  It banned the fishing because it said that 
there were not enough.  That is the department of fisheries 
without consultation with the fishermen.  This bill gives 
fishermen rights to consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another story concerns herring roe on kelp.  This was not a 
native fishery.  This was a fishery started by a man and his 
family who live in Lund, British Columbia.  They built it into a 
fishery where they were getting $40 a pound for herring roe on 
kelp in Japan.  Over the years some of his employees left and 
started up their own herring roe on kelp business because they 
had learned the business and wanted their own business.  Over the 
years it dropped down to about $30 a pound, but it was still a 
very lucrative business. Four companies were doing it and making 
good money at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government came along and gave one of those four people $2 
million to buy the licence back.  What did the government do with 
that $2 million licence?  It gave it to an aboriginal group in 
British Columbia.  The government said, “It is not a natural 
fishery for an aboriginal group but it is a good business so 
let's get you into it”. Since then the government has given away 
in excess of a dozen more licences in this area of herring roe on 
kelp to aboriginal fishermen around the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened to the market in Japan?  It went from $30 down 
to $20 down to $10 as the government kept on giving licences away 
for free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other three licence holders wanted to be bought out too. 
They said, “If you can buy out this other guy for $2 million, 
why won't you buy us out. There is not going to be any industry 
if you keep on passing out these licences for free to the 
different native bands around the province”. But the government 
said it did not have any money to buy them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad thing is this lack of planning, lack of consultation. 
The herring roe fishery is zero because the native bands are 
shipping it to Japan on consignment and the other people are 
going out of business.  That is the lack of planning in this 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we wonder why people get angry when DFO does not consult, how 
would any member of this House like to be one of those fishermen 
with the herring roe on kelp who are now having to compete 
against people who got their licence for free and can ship it to 
Japan on consignment?  It is not right.  It is not proper.  We 
all should be voting for a bill like this one to allow the 
freedom and the consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I commend the member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
His bill says that it endeavours to establish the rights of 
fishermen so that they are involved in the process of fishery 
stock assessment, fish conservation, the setting of fishing 
quotas, fishing licensing and the public right to fish.  As well 
the bill would establish the rights of fishermen to be informed 
of the decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I just gave on the herring roe on kelp is a great 
example of why people should be advised in advance. 
These are people who put good money into their industry.  They 
are not being advised.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that fishermen 
have a problem in this country.  What does the government do? It 
just throws money, $4 billion over the last 10 years.  This has 
not solved one problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move DFO out of Ottawa.  Put a head office on the 
east coast for the east coast, and on the west coast for the west 
coast.  We need to get these 1,200 bureaucrats out of the 
business. There is no fishing in the Rideau Canal.  The fishing 
is on the east and west coasts.  There are too many bureaucrats 
making too much money who have made wrong decisions.  This is out 
of a report written unanimously by all sides of this House.  It 
is being ignored by the minister of fisheries and it is being 
ignored at the peril of this country's fishermen. It is time for 
a change.  We ask all members of the House to vote for this bill 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 11.55 a.m.,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for all of us in the House of Commons, politics and 
government are about one thing:  people.  They are about helping 
them build better lives for themselves and their families, about 
helping them make their dreams work, the dreams they have for 
themselves and for their children:  a better quality of life, a 
higher standard of living, a fair shot at a good job that pays 
well, and a society that gives them the support they need when 
they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making these dreams a reality has been our overriding objective 
since the government first took office in 1993.  That is how we 
won the confidence of Canadians.  The progress the government 
made in its first mandate earned it a renewed majority mandate in 
1997.  It is that focus on what matters most to Canadians that is 
how this government aims to keep the confidence and trust in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong economy is the key to building a more secure society. 
For proof, all we need to do is remember the Canada of five years 
ago.  The government faced a $42 billion deficit, the largest in 
Canadian history and it was growing. 
Unemployment was at 11.4%.  High inflation and high interest 
rates were dragging down the economy in a big way.  The debt to 
GDP ratio had been rising steadily for almost two decades.  Taxes 
seemed to know only one direction:  up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Serious questions were being raised about our ability as a 
nation to maintain our cherished social safety net.  Worst of 
all, we had lost our characteristic confidence in ourselves as a 
people and in our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past five years the government has shown what happens 
when we roll up our sleeves and get down to work.  When we listen 
to Canadians as we did during our prebudget consultation hearings 
and when we work side by side with them, when we trust their 
courage and their willingness to make sacrifices, and when we 
reflect on values and priorities, what happens?  Positive change 
occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> compared Canada's 
economy to that of a third world economy.  Recently the 
<I>Financial Times</I> of London referred to Canada as the top dog 
of the G-7.  The $42 billion deficit is now a $3.5 billion 
surplus.  The debt to GDP ratio is on a firm and permanent 
downward track.  In fact the Government of Canada has not 
borrowed new money on the markets for more than two and a half 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal taxes in the last two budgets have been cut.  They were 
cut by $7 billion in the last budget alone.  Our inflation rate 
is at its lowest level since the 1960s.  Our interest rates are 
also at the lowest levels in three decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has enjoyed the strongest economic growth of the G-7. 
Even with the recent global turmoil, the International Monetary 
Fund recently forecasted that Canada would be among the G-7 
leaders for economic growth in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment in Canada has fallen by almost 3.5 percentage 
points since we took office to its lowest level in nearly a 
decade.  Last year our job growth was number one in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Best of all, there has been a resurgence of optimism among 
Canadians and a renewal of confidence among Canadians that 
government can in fact make a practical difference for the better 
in their lives.  This was evident during the prebudget 
consultation hearings held across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A secure society is one in which people can count on their 
fellow citizens for help and support when they need it.  If they 
lose their job, if they need income support in retirement, to 
give their kids the good start they need in life or when they are 
sick, compassion and sharing are deeply held Canadian values. 
They are reflected in some of our proudest national achievements: 
insurance for the unemployed, the Canada pension plan, supporting 
children in need and our universal medicare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safeguarding these pillars of our society was a primary 
motivating factor behind the fight against the deficit and 
impressive work has been done to protect and modernize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet the needs of our new labour market, the government 
redesigned and refocused assistance to the unemployed, creating 
an employment insurance system aimed at helping people get back 
to work as soon as possible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In co-operation with the provinces the federal government 
established a new child benefit to help low income families with 
children.  By July 1, 2000 the federal government will be 
investing $1.7 billion in this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working with the provinces, it also achieved an historic package 
of reforms that will guarantee the Canada pension plan remains on 
sound financial footing, even in the face of an aging population, 
increasing longevity and retiring baby boomers.  The CPP will be 
there for future retirees.  They can count of it.  Securing our 
public pension system is something no other industrialized 
country has been able to do.  Moreover, the success in saving the 
CPP combined with a balanced budget and a stronger economy have 
allowed the government to reaffirm its commitment to old age 
security and guaranteed income supplement programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told us that access to quality health care is 
among their most urgent concerns.  The government has listened. 
Since it was first elected in 1993 protecting our universal 
medicare system has been a top priority.  As soon as the fight 
against the deficit gave the government financial room it 
followed the recommendations of the National Forum on Health.  It 
increased the cash floor of the Canada health and social transfer 
from $11 billion to $12.5 billion.  That means close to $7 
billion beyond previously budgeted levels, over six years, will 
go to the provinces to fund health care, post-secondary education 
and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional funding will permit the enforcement of the five 
principles of the Canada Health Act:  universality, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown its openness to modernizing the health 
care system.  In its first mandate the Prime Minister chaired the 
National Forum on Health which brought together Canada's wealth 
of talent and knowledge in the health care field to assess how 
the system could best respond to emerging health care issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget allocated over three years to implement key 
recommendations of the national forum:  $150 million for the 
health transition fund to help provinces launch pilot projects to 
investigate new and better approaches to health care, including 
home care; $50 million to establish a new Canada health 
information system to give health care providers timely access to 
quality health information; and $100 million to boost funding for 
the community action program for children and the Canada prenatal 
nutrition program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our prebudget consultations Canadians from coast to 
coast stressed the importance of health care in their lives. 
They said that the government should continue with its strong 
commitment to health care.  We believe that health care is a 
priority.  In the upcoming budget we will strongly endorse 
measures to strengthen the health care system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining a strong economy and a secure society in the new 
global, knowledge based economy requires that we invest within 
our means and in carefully targeted ways so that Canadians have 
the knowledge, the skills and the opportunities they need to 
prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key reasons the government fought so hard against the 
deficit was to regain our ability as a nation to make such 
strategic investments in our people.  For example, the millennium 
scholarship fund will generate over 100,000 scholarships each 
year for low and middle income post-secondary students over the 
next decade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada education savings plan is another example.  Our 
government is topping up new contributions to registered 
education savings plans, which are an enormous hit with parents 
saving for their children's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the Canada foundation for innovation, whose 
$800 million endowment is being used to fund cutting edge 
research facilities in our universities and teaching hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the connecting Canadians strategy, the goal of which is 
to make Canada the most connected country in the world by the 
year 2000, with our own fast lane on the information highway.  A 
key part of that strategy has been SchoolNet, which will mean 
that every one of our more than 16,000 public schools and 
libraries will be connected to the Internet by the end of the 
fiscal year.  We will be the first major nation in the world to 
do this:  ahead of the Americans, ahead of the British, ahead of 
the French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the youth employment strategy which consolidated 
approximately $2 billion in new and existing funding for the 
programs and services that young people need to acquire skills 
and work experience, find jobs and build careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures that we are taking are important because we compete 
in a global marketplace.  I am quite happy to see that as a 
nation we are getting ready for the challenges ahead.  However, 
let us be clear:  we are building on a solid foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is number one of the G-7 in home computer, cable and 
telephone penetration.  We have the lowest telephone rates of the 
G-7, the lowest Internet access cost of the G-7, the lowest cost 
of doing information technology business of the G-7, the lowest 
software production cost in North America and we are ranked 
number one in producing knowledgeable workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in R and D and the skills of our people, expanding 
educational opportunities, cutting taxes, investing in health 
care and reducing the public debt make perfect sense if we want 
to improve the standard of living of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that Canadians want their 
political and business leaders to focus on improving their 
standard of living.  They are quite tired of the turf wars that 
exist between levels of government.  They are quite tired of the 
politics of finger pointing.  They are not interested in that any 
more.  They want results from their elected officials.  They want 
results from their corporate leaders.  They want a brighter 
future for their children.  That is the focus which was quite 
clear when we travelled across the country listening to students 
and listening to people involved in R and D.  We listened to our 
educators.  In every city people told us that the standard of 
living is the issue on which we, as a society, must be focused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put an end to the era of confrontation.  Let us build an 
era of co-operation, one in which people's standard of living and 
quality of life are key issues.  This is not simply a debate that 
needs to be had in the halls of the House of Commons.  It has to 
happen in the communities and in corporate board rooms because we 
all have a responsibility to improve the standard of living for 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that is certain is that although in the past two years 
Canada has seen an improvement in its productivity, it has, like 
every other G-7 country, seen a decline in productivity.  We need 
to improve that because productivity essentially means a better 
standard of living for Canadians.  What can we as a government 
do?  What is our role to enhance productivity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure people understand that it is in the context 
of increasing the standard of living for Canadians that the 
recommendations were made in the finance committee.  Before we 
talk about the recommendations we made as a committee let us look 
at what the government has done to increase productivity in 
Canada.  What kind of measures or channels has it used to make 
sure the productivity gains seen in the past two years continue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at the government policies that promote a higher 
standard of living, they can be broken down into fiscal and 
monetary policy, tax policy, support for education and skill 
development, support for R and D, social and labour market 
policies, trade policies and policy that understands there is a 
role for the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at fiscal and monetary policy and clearly 
understand that a stable macro economic environment with low 
inflation and lower interest rates can boost confidence in the 
economy, enhance productivity growth and boost employment, what 
has the government been able to achieve?  There are a number of 
accomplishments we should take note of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal deficit has been eliminated.  The debt to GDP ratio 
is in a clear downward path.  There has been substantial fiscal 
progress at both federal and provincial government levels, and we 
have the low inflation records of the 1990s.  That is pretty 
clear, low interest rates, reducing the debt, reducing the burden 
on Canadians.  What happens when we do that?  We increase 
productivity and increase employment opportunities for Canadians 
and that is essentially what we heard throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the finance committee have to say about that?  We found 
a great deal of satisfaction on the part of Canadians when it 
came to these issues.  When it comes to fiscal and monetary 
policy the finance committee recommended that the Government of 
Canada continue to use prudent economic assumption in the 
formulation of budgets, that assumptions about short term and 
long term interests continue to be set at 50 to 100 basis points 
higher than the private sector average, and that the minister 
alter the prudence factor as circumstances warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the federal government continue 
to employ a contingency reserve which has set aside $3 billion 
per year.  At present the contingency reserve should not be used 
on increased program spending or tax cuts.  The committee also 
recommended that the government continue to use two year planning 
horizons for the conduct of fiscal policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that the federal government establish a long term 
target for a sustainable debt to GDP ratio.  We said that an 
interim debt to GDP target range of 50% to 60% should be achieved 
in this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fiscal and monetary policy is one issue but what are the other 
contributors in achieving a higher standard of living?  If we 
look at tax policy, taxes can affect the allocation of resources 
and alter the incentives to work, to save and to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government done, what are its accomplishments? 
We have seen the beginning of general tax relief, the national 
child benefit system to support working parents and the HST to 
reduce compliance costs.  These are three of the measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the world, in particular the group of seven countries, is 
spending a lot of time devising strategies for productivity, in a 
measured way this government is putting in place the types of 
policies that speak to the worldwide debate on productivity.  In 
the past three years we have seen an increase in productivity, 
which I hope is a trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the finance committee feel the federal government should 
continue to cut taxes?  Absolutely.  We have made a number of 
recommendations in relation to taxes.  Last year we called for 
the elimination of the 3% surtax.  This year we call again for 
the elimination of the 3% surtax for all Canadians.  We call for 
the announcement of a timetable for the elimination of the 5% 
surtax.  We do that because these taxes were introduced as 
deficit fighting mechanisms.  Now that the deficit is gone it is 
time for the minister to announce a timetable for further tax 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we did last year, we recommend that the 1998 budget measures 
to increase the basic personal amount and spousal amount by $500 
for lower income taxpayers be increased by a further $200. That 
would bring to $700 the amount of additional income that can be 
earned tax free. The committee further recommends that this $700 
increase in the basic personal and spousal amounts be available 
to all Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss what the government has done to enhance 
productivity.  We must make sure the people who work in our 
companies have the proper skill sets and education to do things 
better and quicker, that they can produce more, enhance and 
generate wealth for our companies and in aggregate for the 
country.  Support for education and skills development gets more 
people into the workforce by boosting the employment rate.  It 
helps people get higher wage jobs and achieve greater 
productivity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not essentially the type of society we want to build? Is 
the reason an industrially advanced country like Canada entered 
free trade agreements not because we wanted to compete and 
generate high paying jobs that require highly skilled workers? 
That is where our competitive advantage is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at education and skills development, what has this 
government done?  There are the Canadian opportunity strategy, 
Canadian millennium scholarships, Canada study grants and tax 
relief on interest on student loans, the Canada education savings 
grant, the increased education and tuition tax credits, SchoolNet 
to give young students Internet access, increased funding for 
youth at risk who lack basic education and job skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what it takes to build a country.  We need to invest in 
people.  We need to create the economic environment where we as a 
nation and as a people can generate wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key component of a productivity strategy must be 
researched and developed because it provides the innovation 
needed to improve production processes, thereby boosting 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has moved on several fronts with the Canada 
foundation for innovation, technology partnership Canada, tax 
support for R and D, and networks of centres of excellence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need labour market policies that work so Canadians can work. 
They influence work incentives and facilitate workforce 
participation by removing barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember this debate quite clearly when I was parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of human resources. I remember how we 
needed to modernize and restructure Canada's social security 
system so that it would serve our people well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a 1990s car cannot be fixed with a 1960s repair manual, the 
same thing is true of our social security system.  We need to 
modernize it.  I think EI reform did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Productivity is also impacted by our trade policy.  What does 
trade policy do?  It increases competition and allows countries 
to specialize in products they are good at making.  There again 
the end result is a boost in productivity and competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government done in the area of trade policy?  We 
have NAFTA.  We are a leading player in the WTO.  There are 
ongoing efforts to ensure the free flow of goods and services 
within Canada.  These are characteristics of a government and a 
nation that are forward looking, that understand that the route 
to a higher standard of living is higher productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important component of productivity strategy is 
letting the market work.  Regulation and subsidies can dampen 
market signals and distort the allocation of resources, 
inhibiting growth and inhibiting essentially productivity growth. 
Privatization can enhance and boost productivity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference between individuals who talk about these 
things and governments that do.  When we look at the government's 
record on the important component of increasing the standard of 
living for Canadians, we see that the government reduced business 
and transportation subsidies.  We have had partial or full 
privatization of Air Canada, Petro-Canada, Canadair, De Havilland 
Canada and CN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to me that the agenda of the government is working 
quite well.  I heard this throughout the country.  It is an 
agenda that looks to the future with a great deal of optimism. We 
have eliminated the deficit.  We have lowered taxes.  We have 
made key investments in education, research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a Canadian.  I am proud to be a member of the 
House of Commons.  It is due to the recommendations of members of 
parliament that we have been able to build a society and an 
economy that work.  Our next frontier is to work toward a higher 
standard of living, to secure that our children and our 
children's children will live in a better country than we live 
in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to enter into the debate on 
the report of the Standing Committee on Finance.  My purpose will 
be twofold.  I would like to make some comments on the report of 
the committee and then I would like to serve the broader purpose 
of offering some advice from the official opposition to the 
finance minister and the government prior to the finalization of 
the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has also consulted with Canadians with 
respect to their expectations in terms of federal finances. While 
we appreciate the consultations that have been conducted by the 
committee, we think that from our own consultations Canadians are 
much more specific on the expectations they have in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, Canadians are telling us and anyone who will 
listen that it is what the federal government is doing to our 
taxes and our health care that concerns us most.  They expect the 
budgetary policy of the government in the next number of months 
to focus specifically on addressing their concerns in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that the report of the committee and the 
statements to date by the government are not sufficiently focused 
on these priorities.  Therefore, my colleague, the member of 
parliament for Medicine Hat, the official opposition finance 
critic, and a number of his colleagues have produced their own 
prebudget submission entitled “Taxes and Health Care:  It's 
Critical”.   That is being released today.  I thank all those 
responsible for its development and commend it to the committee, 
to the House, to the finance minister and to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report has three emphases.  First, it proposes a real, 
substantial tax relief package.  For example, under that package 
a single income family of four earning $30,000 would receive an 
annual pay hike of over $4,000, not the pathetic $143 offered by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on the health side it not only proposes an additional $2 
billion per year of reinvestment in health care but complementary 
measures to start putting the patient first in the rebuilding of 
the crumbling health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, on the debt side it proposes a comprehensive debt 
repayment schedule designed to reduce the national debt by $19 
billion over the next three years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance 
entitled <I>Challenges and Choices</I>.  I do not want to begin by 
slamming the report or by dismissing its recommendations or 
analyses out of hand.  Like many of us I think there is too much 
of that in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our intention to slam every effort or proposal that 
comes from the government simply because it comes from the 
government.  I think the government tends to do that a bit:  if 
it comes from the official opposition, particularly if it comes 
from Reform, it is automatically banned.  Those attitudes on 
either side of the House cannot encourage debate.  They do not 
earn the respect of the public and they are not very productive. 
We do not want to fall into the same trap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the report we commend the committee for its 
extensive consultations.  I commend the committee on the first 
chapter of the report which provides a summary of where we are 
financially and in relation to the economy and the performance of 
the government financially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the committee for devoting at least two of its eight 
chapters to the priority areas of health care and taxes.  I also 
commend the committee for adopting some of the proposals of the 
official opposition, in particular the proposals for eliminating 
the 3% surtax, eventually the 5% surtax, and reductions in 
personal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think that three years ago the subject of tax relief was 
not in the government's vocabulary, we have to take some 
satisfaction in the House that the government is at least talking 
about it.  We are encouraged by these signs of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would like to point out two major 
deficiencies in the report.  The first is that the report devotes 
an entire chapter to a prudent budget making process, chapter 3, 
and then omits the most important step in prudent budgeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prudent budgeting begins with accurate, transparent, principled 
accounting and reporting of the government's financial position. 
Concrete measures are required to prevent the finance minister 
from playing a shell game with public finances and giving the 
appearance, rightly or wrongly, of cooking the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shell game on taxes, for example, is that the government is 
taking $40 billion more per year in taxes than it was in 1995. It 
gives $2 billion to $3 billion per year back to the taxpayers and 
calls this token tax reduction tax relief and hopes the public 
does not notice the difference between what was given and what 
was taken.  This type of rhetoric, this type of approach to 
presenting tax reduction fools no one.  It increases public 
skepticism about anything said regarding tax reduction at the 
federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also plays a shell game on spending, something 
that even the auditor general has commented on and gone further 
than commenting on:  he will not sign off on the financial 
statements because of this shell game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the old days when the federal government was running a 
deficit it practised what is called back end loading.  It tried 
to push costs, if there was any accounting way of justifying it, 
on to the next year to make the deficit look smaller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are into the era of surpluses the government is 
practising front end loading.  It is trying to pull as many costs 
as it can into the current fiscal year to make the surplus look 
smaller so that it is under less pressure to reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out on numerous occasions that if this was done in the 
private sector and the finance minister was the vice-president of 
finance of an oil company, he would end up making licence plates 
in some provincial penitentiary for practising that game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shell game is also played particularly with respect to the 
surplus.  Everything is done now to try to make the surplus look 
smaller so as to reduce the pressure for tax relief.  This 
includes spin doctoring of the projected surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find the initial projection of the surplus by the government 
was $10 billion to $13 billion.  A series of press releases came 
out, particularly over the last couple of weeks, indicating why 
those initial projections were out of line and that probably it 
would be less and less and less.  The purpose is to make this 
surplus appear smaller and, I am certain, to minimize public 
pressure for tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition therefore recommends that if the 
government wants to practise prudent budgeting Canada should 
follow the example of New Zealand and pass a financial 
responsibility act that creates a legal requirement for the 
government to produce financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, specifies what those 
principles are in the legislation, and holds officials legally 
liable for violating those rules.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second deficiency in the report which should be 
emphasized.  It centres around the report's recommendation that 
the federal government enter into a productivity covenant with 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word covenant is a religious term.  I do not know whether 
the intention was to deify the government or to imply that the 
Minister of Finance would go up the mountain and return with two 
tablets of stone prior to the budget.  If he does that, I hope 
the tablets will have something in bold print about thou shalt 
not steal and thou shalt not bear false witness.  However that is 
not my main point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition and elaboration of productivity in the report 
strikes me as curious.  I spent 20 years in the private sector as 
a management consultant working with companies for whom 
productivity was a real term which was measured.  They even 
developed computer models in the company to try to measure the 
development of productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this report the vague definition is used that productivity 
simply means getting better results with the same effort.  It 
looks like it was written by a Liberal spin doctor, not by 
somebody responsible for productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of productivity that is used in the real world, 
in business, in unions and in the marketplace where people have 
to produce, where this means something and where they will be 
measured against it, is a ratio.  Productivity is a ratio of the 
value of production over the cost of doing business.  The cost of 
doing business is the denominator in that fraction.  It includes 
taxes imposed by the government.  Anything that increases the 
cost of doing business without increasing the value of production 
decreases productivity.  It hurts productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to talk seriously about productivity and 
the productivity covenant with Canadians who are not 
stupid—there are thousands of people in my constituency who can 
define productivity better than in this report—it needs a clear 
definition of productivity that makes crystal clear the negative 
impacts of Liberal overtaxation on the competitiveness and the 
profitability of Canadian business and employment.  I urge the 
committee to address that point.  It fits in with public 
understanding of what the government is doing to our taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to a bigger and broader framework than is contained 
in this report for analysing the government's financial position 
of what should be in the budget.  When Reformers came to Ottawa 
in 1993 we had a four point list for fixing federal finances that 
is as relevant today as it was when we first came here: control 
and prioritise the spending, balance the budget, reduce the taxes 
and reduce the debt.  It is pretty simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five and a half years later under this administration only one 
of those matters has been dealt with.  The budget is now 
balanced, but that was done not by controlled spending but mainly 
through revenue increases and offloading to the provinces.  There 
still remains much to be done on the simplest fiscal agenda that 
is possible to get Canada's fiscal house in order.  That is the 
thrust of our prebudget submission and our advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take these categories one by one.  With respect to 
controlling the spending, the federal government is still not 
doing it.  In the 1997 budget plan the finance minister projected 
that government program spending last year would come in at 
$105.8 billion.  He called his assumptions prudent, taking into 
account normal demographic and inflation changes.  The problem is 
that when the final numbers came in, program spending for 1997-98 
was $108.8 billion or a $3 billion spending hike.  All the talk 
about spending control, all the talk about balancing the budget 
through cost reduction, and the first year into a surplus 
position spending escalated $3 billion over the estimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year it is déjà vu all over again. 
In the same 1997 budget plan the finance minister projected 
program spending for this year at $103.5 billion.  By the time 
his 1998 budget came out he had upped those spending predictions 
to $104.5 billion.  Now, according to the most recent financial 
information, program spending is slated to rise even further, by 
3.1% so far this year.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that if the finance minister follows last year's 
pattern and continues this year's already documented schedule of 
overspending, his spending is going to come in around $107.5 
billion or another $3 billion over what he told this House it was 
going to be.  That is spending control.  What it reflects is a 
Liberal predisposition to spend and the need for even stronger 
spending controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the official opposition recommends is really three things. 
First, to freeze program spending for three years at $104.5 
billion to generate the surpluses necessary for real tax relief 
and debt reduction.  That is not an unreasonable figure.  It is 
the figure that the finance minister himself said was adequate 
for last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that we cannot increase spending in priority 
areas.  But during the three year freeze it means that can only 
be done by reducing spending in other areas.  In other words, it 
forces the government to do what every household in the country 
has to do when there is not quite enough money and that is to 
prioritize.  Why should we not do what millions and millions of 
Canadians in households and businesses are forced to do every 
year and every month? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition therefore recommends increases in both 
health and defence spending, but primarily from reductions in 
handouts to business, interest groups and government to 
government foreign aid.  We propose increases in spending, but we 
would get the money by reducing spending somewhere else rather 
than adding to the deficit or adding to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members and the government may disagree with our spending 
controls and our spending priorities.  That is fine.  That is 
what we are here to debate.  But if they disagree, then it is 
incumbent upon the government to set out its own spending 
controls and priorities which will still have the effect of 
generating the surpluses we need for tax reduction, debt 
reduction and health care reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to debt reduction.  Again the federal government 
just is not doing it.  We have a $580 billion federal debt.  All 
we see is token debt reduction.  Under this government Canada 
continues to spend almost 30 cents out of every revenue dollar on 
interest on the debt.  That is a burden on the capacity to 
finance social services.  We bleed ourselves white paying out 
over $40 billion a year and then we wonder why there is not 
enough money for transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a drag on productivity.  The government says it is 
concerned about productivity.  The greatest thing it could do 
about productivity is to get the debt burden down.  If we work 
out its own calculation on its productivity, that $43 billion a 
year on debt service knocks the ratio out the window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lincoln once said that excessive debts were like rats gnawing at 
the vital organs and sinews of the state.  I cannot for the life 
of me understand how the finance minister can sleep at night with 
$580 billion rats gnawing at the vitals of the Government of 
Canada.  I use rats of course in a general sense, you understand, 
Mr. Speaker; not attributing it to any personality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the official opposition recommends is not rocket science. 
The problem here is not figuring out what to do; the problem here 
is to get doing it.  We recommend, first, that a debt retirement 
sinking fund be established; second, that a law be passed to 
direct a portion of the debt to be retired each year; and third, 
that a schedule be established to reduce the debt.  We recommend 
that the debt be reduced by $19 billion over the next three years 
and by $240 billion over the next 20 years.  Let us get serious 
about debt reduction and the mortgaging of the future of the next 
generation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about real tax relief, and I will draw a 
distinction between token tax relief and real tax relief.  I will 
draw a distinction between the shell game, where the finance 
minister pushes a shell that says a $2 billion reduction, a $3 
billion reduction and tries to pull to the back of the table the 
fact that the government is taking $38 billion to $40 billion a 
year more than when it came here in 1993.  I am not talking about 
the shell game.  I am talking about real, genuine tax reduction 
that can be felt in the pockets of consumers and can be seen on 
the financial statements of businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the taxation record under the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal income taxes are up almost 38% and now account for 8.2% 
of GDP, up from 7% in 1993, for a 17% increase.  Is it any wonder 
Canadians are struggling to get by?  I have asked public 
audiences all over this country “Government income has gone up 
35% to 40% since 1993.  How many of you can say that your 
personal income or your family income has gone up 38% during that 
same period?”  Not very many hands go up.  There is a rumble 
through that audience that the government ought to take into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada taxes paid by the average 
Canadian household were 15% higher in 1996 than in 1992. 
Canadians pay 46 cents on every dollar earned toward taxes, while 
Americans, our greatest single competitor and the American labour 
market being the great drawing card to many of our young people 
right now, pay only 33 cents.  In other words, as a percentage 
Canadian taxation represents 140% of the U.S. tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members cannot get out of this argument by saying 
“Oh, but we spend so much on health care”.  The Americans spend 
much more than we do on defence.  They wash each other out.  It 
is not that simple.  Our rates are simply higher, consistently 
higher, than those of our principal trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it another way, our personal income tax burden has gone 
up 136% in the past three decades compared with only 31% in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government collects $11.2 billion from 7.7 million 
Canadians who earn $30,000 a year or less.  We hear these great 
protestations of social concern from the government and the 
finance minister.  He wrings his hands in public about child 
poverty and he wrings $11 billion a year out of families, with 
children, which make $30,000 a year or less.  He sits in the 
House devising all kinds of programs to try to deliver some help 
to those families when the best help he could give them from a 
poverty standpoint would be to simply leave more dollars in their 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bracket creep is another area where the shell game is played. 
The minister stood in the House and told us how many people he 
would take off the tax rolls.  That is the shell that is pushed 
to the front.  What government members do not show us is the 
other shell which they pull to the back, the people who are being 
pulled onto the tax rolls through bracket creep.  They outnumber 
by far the ones who have been taken off.  More than a million low 
wage workers have been pulled onto the income tax net since the 
government took office.  More than 1.9 million taxpayers were 
pushed from the bottom to the middle tax bracket and 600,000 
taxpayers were pushed from the middle to the top bracket.  That 
is the government's record on taxation.  There is no tax relief. 
There is a consistent record of increased government revenues 
connected to increasing taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In place of this token tax relief proposed by the government the 
official opposition proposes real, substantial, broad based tax 
relief.  The proposals contained in the paper “Taxes and Health 
Care” include a reduction of $26 billion in federal taxes over 
the next three years, starting with a $7 billion reduction in 
employment insurance taxes, payroll taxes that kill jobs, and a 
$19 billion reduction in personal income taxes and capital gains 
taxes.  If members work out the impact of these numbers on the 
take-home pay of a single income family of four making $30,000 a 
year, the family gets an annual pay hike of $4,628 under these 
tax relief reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case this is too complex for some of our colleagues, it is 
the intention of the official opposition to go across this 
country showing people what their take-home pay is under the 
Liberal tax regime, including the token tax relief measures 
contained in the budget, and what their take-home pay would be 
under these tax reforms. 
I do not think there is going to be much doubt as to which 
paycheque the public would prefer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister plays the shell game and tells the 
government caucus that if it gives substantial, broad based tax 
relief the country will be back in a deficit position.  Some hon. 
members actually believe that argument.  That is simply not the 
case if one puts in place the other measures required to maintain 
the balance, such as the spending controls and the spending 
priorities referred to, the debt reduction measure that would 
reduce the interest on the debt, and tax relief that is 
substantial enough to stimulate economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government truly wants to enter into a productivity 
covenant with the Canadian people, let it be based on this 
proposition:  that at Canada's levels of debt and Canada's levels 
of taxation, a dollar left in the pocket of a Canadian taxpayer, 
consumer or employer is more productive than that dollar in the 
hands of a federal politician or bureaucrat.  That is a statement 
on productivity.  It lies within the power of this parliament to 
increase the take-home pay of millions of individuals and 
families this year simply by substantially reducing the demands 
of the federal taxman.  It lies within the power of this 
parliament to free up billions of dollars for future investment 
in health care and essential services by paying down federal debt 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore conclude by asking, by imploring, the Prime 
Minister, the finance minister and the 156 members opposite not 
to stand in the way of such noble objectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the report of the Liberal majority on the 
Standing Committee on Finance, which was tabled last December 
and suggests certain approaches with respect to the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal majority's report is a blatant piece of propaganda. 
It could have been—and was, I believe—written by the office of the 
Minister of Finance, so completely is it at odds with the 
comments we heard from individuals and from business and 
anti-poverty organizations in our travels across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the report touts the marvellous achievements of 
the Liberal government.  This is a change from the reports 
produced by the Standing Committee on Finance over the last five 
years.  They were mildly propagandist but this one is nothing 
but. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report glosses over the nasty tricks and lack of consensus 
on such issues as the millennium scholarships.  Nor does it make 
any mention of the fact that Quebec's opposition to this new 
Liberal government policy, this new intrusion into the education 
sector, is unanimous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also refers to issues that never came up during this 
consultation, such as the famous productivity covenant.  I do 
not know where this came from.  Again, the likeliest source is 
the office of the Minister of Finance, who has the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Finance to do his bidding.  This is the 
first time the committee chair has been nothing more than a 
puppet controlled by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also appalled at the arrogance of this report on such 
issues as employment insurance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the report of the Liberal majority, at page 55. 
Members are aware of the many problems with employment 
insurance, the increasingly limited access to it and the fact 
that fewer than 40% of the people contributing to it can now 
draw benefits.  These benefits have shrunk in the past two 
years, since the employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what do we find on page 55 of the Liberal majority report? 
This is what we find, and I quote “The committee thinks that the 
phenomenon is misunderstood.  The unemployed receive nothing 
because the system was not designed for them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never have I seen or read such arrogant remarks in a Liberal 
majority report. 
So, even though statistics come out every week telling us what a 
total fiasco the employment insurance plan is, how it does not 
serve the interests of the unemployed in Quebec and Canada, the 
Liberals say the Quebeckers and Canadians who appeared before 
the Standing Committee on Finance do not understand the plan 
when it is the plan that makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another arrogant remark in the Liberal majority's report is when 
they say that the Canadians consulted want the Minister of 
Finance to continue his very prudent management of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments gathered across Canada are not self evident.  On 
the subject of prudence, they do ask the Minister of Finance to 
be prudent too, but next 
above all, what Canadians across the country asked the Minister 
of Finance to do was to stop making up all sorts of stories, to 
stop saying things that do not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as regards the surpluses, the minister was told to 
stop viewing Quebeckers and Canadians as gullible and to stop 
being off the mark by close to 100% in his forecasts. This 
cannot go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that consultation, Canadians and Quebeckers asked the 
Minister of Finance to show greater transparency and honesty. 
Such comments were made by organizations from various sectors 
across the country. Honesty yes, but also accuracy, which is the 
very foundation of democracy and the basis of effective 
processes, such as the prebudget consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the prebudget consultation is conducted while relying on 
falsehoods and lies, how can we expect the citizens of this 
country to have a clear mind and to propose sensible ideas based 
on the real figures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we be expected, as lawmakers, to have a solid and 
credible basis to urge the government to make decisions, if the 
Minister of Finance is always fibbing about the state of public 
finances? He stated recently that the surplus—based on his own 
document, that is the last budget—would be somewhere between 
zero and three billion dollars, when in fact it will be in 
excess of six billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The content of the Liberal majority report confirmed that we 
were right, last year, to have decided to conduct our own 
prebudget consultation. 
During the months of August and September, the Bloc 
Quebecois—led by its leader, the hon. member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie and myself as its finance critic—toured 
Quebec to hear the comments, ideas and suggestions of the people 
of Quebec regarding the content of the upcoming budget and the 
use that should be made of the huge surpluses collected by the 
Minister of Finance, primarily to score political points. We did 
our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard is very different from what is found in the report 
of the Liberal majority. We look at the real issues. The people 
whom we consulted told us about the real issues. 
They said they had had enough of being told just any old thing 
by this government, of being told to continue to behave, to 
continue to make sacrifices, when the result of the 
sacrifices—far from seeing the benefits of these sacrifices, if 
we can believe the recent remarks by the Minister of Finance, 
they are not likely to see the benefits in the upcoming budget 
either—these people see the money saved on the backs of the most 
disadvantaged and the middle income earners reallocated to the 
most favoured classes.  This is not normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers and Canadians told us three things during these 
consultations.  First, they said their first priority for 
federal transfers was to fund higher education, social 
assistance and most importantly health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They discussed the Saskatoon agreement.  Remember that the 
agreement signed by all the premiers in Saskatoon provided two 
things, essentially:  that the federal government stop cutting 
some $6 billion year in and year out in transfers to the 
provinces, and Quebec in particular, for health care, 
post-secondary education and social assistance, as it had set out 
in its 1995 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also called for the right to opt out with full compensation 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
They asked that, if the federal government wanted another 
initiative there, provinces wanting to withdraw from a federal 
program in a provincial jurisdiction be able to do so with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is in the public interest to know what the Minister 
of Finance decreed in his 1995 budget.  He decreed it once, but 
nobody mentions it anymore and nobody will mention it until 
2003.  We are making a point of putting it back on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Minister of Finance decided that announcements of 
cuts to social programs, health care and education year after 
year were really unpopular.  So, he said, “I will do it once, 
and it will be valid until 2003”.  That is the plan for 
systematic cuts the Minister of Finance, the pretender to the 
leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, set in motion in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under that plan, every year, without any warning, provincial 
governments have to put up with an average shortfall of $6 
billion in the areas of health, higher education and social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the federal decision announced in the 1995 budget of 
the Minister of Finance, it was initially anticipated that, by 
the year 2003, federal transfers to the provinces for health, 
higher education and social assistance would be subject to 
cumulative cuts totalling $48 billion. During the 1997 election 
campaign, that position became so untenable—and the Bloc 
Quebecois contributed to this by constantly attacking the 
Liberal Party on this issue—that the Prime Minister of Canada 
announced with great fanfare that he would put back six billion 
dollars into social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he really meant was that, of the $48 billion that he had 
originally planned to cut between 1995 and 2003, $6 billion 
would not be cut. This meant that there would still be cuts 
totalling $42 billion, with annual cuts of $6 billion in 
transfers for health, for instance. These cuts have not been 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers made it clear when they met in Saskatoon, that 
these are the cuts they want the federal government to eliminate. 
The government talks about giving back $6.3 billion to the 
provinces to finance their social and health programs, but what 
the provinces want is for the federal government to cancel the 
cuts mentioned in the 1995 budget until the year 2003. 
In their wisdom, the provinces told the federal government they 
were prepared to accept an arrangement, whereby the $6.3 billion 
they are requesting to offset the cuts in health, higher 
education and social assistance could be paid over two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussions were not about $1 billion but rather $6.3 
billion. Since then, however, the federal government has gone to 
great lengths to allege that this $1 billion is a big deal, that 
it was the amount discussed in the negotiations, and that the 
government has a role to play in exclusive provincial 
jurisdictions like health. The Minister of Finance himself, in 
establishing the Canada health and social transfer, which 
combines all three federal transfers into one, stated its 
purpose was to give the provinces greater freedom to use their 
funds as they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of the negotiations concerning the social transfer 
and the provinces' demands on the basis of Saskatoon tell a 
completely different story. The federal government is intent on 
having a say in every decision on how funds are allocated, in 
spite of the fact that these funds belong to the provinces and 
that it could choose to give them back to the provinces for 
health, higher education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, with respect to this budget, the Minister of 
Finance should immediately initiate a process leading to full 
compensation for all cuts made since 1995, thereby cancelling 
the cuts in health, higher education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People must understand that the problems currently experienced 
in emergency rooms must not be blamed on their provincial 
government, on the Quebec government, but on the federal 
government, which has left the provinces broke with funding cuts 
averaging $7.3 billion a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor are we interested in their bleating about the misfortune of 
the disadvantaged and the ill, as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has done, when it is the Liberals that are 
behind the cuts and that will be maintaining them until 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec told us about another priority they had, a 
real priority, as opposed to the crass propaganda in the Liberal 
majority's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consulted people throughout Quebec, which we did with 
the assistance of all Bloc Quebecois members, they told us that 
their other priority was a substantial cut in personal income 
taxes.  Not in the taxes of the rich, of millionaires, or 
ministers, but of low-and middle-income taxpayers.  These are the 
folks who helped put the fiscal house in order.  These are the 
folks who, since 1995, have been footing the bill in one way or 
another, either through increased taxes—over the last four years 
they have been paying $20 billion more in taxes than they did in 
1993—or through various cuts that affect them directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is low and middle income taxpayers who are responsible for the 
improved public finances. 
They are the ones who should be reaping the benefits of the 
lowered deficit. They should be the first to enjoy tax breaks 
and relief in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should be the first because middle-income taxpayers—who are 
defined as those earning between $45,000 and $70,000—face the 
highest taxes of all Canadians.  They are the ones facing one of 
the highest tax rates compared with American taxpayers.  If 
there is going to be tax relief, it should not be for 
millionaires or friends of the Minister of Finance.  Nor should 
it take the form of a tax reform that would benefit 
international shipping companies such as Canada Steamship Lines, 
which is owned by the Minister of Finance. 
Nor will the taxpayer be helped by giving preferential treatment 
to the very rich, for example by allowing them to transfer 
millions, if not billions, all over the world in the form of 
family trusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be done by enacting a general lightening of the tax 
burden on two groups, the low and middle income groups.  This 
can be done by fully indexing the tax tables.  It can also be 
done by raising the minimum threshold, or in other words 
allowing people to earn more before they have to start paying 
income tax.  This would help those with low and middle incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this consultation, we were clearly given a third priority—I am 
talking here of the true consultation, not the one that led to a 
Liberal majority propaganda report, but the consultations 
carried out throughout Quebec by the Bloc Quebecois—and that 
priority was improved employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was unanimity on this in Quebec.  If I recall, during the 
prebudget consultations across Canada, people were also saying 
“It no longer makes any sense at all to have reformed the 
unemployment insurance program, changing its name to employment 
insurance, and to have severely cut back on benefits, so much so 
that fewer than 40% of people paying into the fund—everyone pays 
now—can draw employment insurance benefits”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three ways of ending up with stupendous surpluses in 
the employment insurance fund, as we have seen over the past 
three years. The first is by maintaining employers' and 
employees' contributions to the fund at an artificially high 
level.  The second is to successfully reduce access to the 
program.  The third is to reduce benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the three objectives of the employment insurance 
reform, which it achieves so successfully that every year we end 
up with a $6 billion surplus.  These surpluses are generated off 
the backs of the contributors, that is, employers and employees, 
and the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks, they have gone so far as to exert pressure. 
This has happened in a number of regions in Quebec.  I have seen 
it in Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot as well.  The officials at the 
employment centres are putting pressure on the unemployed, on 
those appealing decisions on overpayments.  Pressure is put on 
them to subtly take away their right to appeal.  This action is 
deliberate. 
The unemployed are being called and told not to appeal, there is 
no point.  There is a limit to the harassment of these people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know why they are being harassed?  Because the more they 
harass them, the bigger the surplus there will be to swell the 
popularity of the future leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, 
the Minister of Finance.  That is awful.  My colleagues and I 
discussed this at the latest caucus meeting.  We are going to 
wage all-out war against these claims by a little mafia gang 
trying to intimidate the unemployed and take away their right to 
be treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While things go awry with the employment insurance system, as 
things are a total fiasco, while everybody is criticizing the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, this gentleman is 
writing a book on his deep thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to our questions in the House, he answered all sorts 
of things making it clear to us that he was not on top of his 
responsibilities and that he did not know what was going on, but 
we did not know why.  We thought it was a matter of 
intelligence.  But now we know that he was writing his book, 
dashing off his deep thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He even had the nerve to talk about the disadvantaged in his 
book, when he actually had a hand in creating this situation 
where the unemployed, who no longer qualify for employment 
insurance thanks to him, find themselves marginalized. Do you 
know who this minister reminds me of? He reminds me of Lucius 
Domitius Tiberius Claudius Nero, commonly known as Emperor Nero. 
Nero set Rome ablaze and declaimed his sorrow as the city 
burned. I find it despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the unemployed see is a human resources development 
minister, who is supposed to be taking care of business and 
fixing a system that does not make sense anymore, out promoting 
the sale of his book and using his own intellectual resources, 
and probably departmental resources as well, to boost his 
popularity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under other circumstances, had he not had other 
responsibilities, one might have said he was provoking thought, 
but for a minister who has been doing a poor job since taking 
over his department, has been sharply criticized and is putting 
everyone in the street, to put his deep thoughts in a book as he 
did, is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, we hope that Minister of Finance will show common 
sense in his budget and put any surplus to use in the interest 
of the public at large and not a select few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope he will 
show respect for the unemployed and those who pay into the EI 
fund and show more respect than his Prime Minister did for the 
provinces that have had it with all this being done on their 
backs and having various conditions imposed on them as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone:</B> Go ahead and do it outside the House, and 
you will see what reaction you get. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member who has been so busy being 
negative in making his comments in this House, why Quebec and he 
representing the Bloc Quebecois, never calculate the amount of 
dollars saved by the Quebec government and the Quebec people by 
the reduction of interest rates to benefit them and to use their 
priorities in the allocation of funds both as a result of the 
reduction in tax rates and the fact that they have had not only 
lower interest rates, but have had an increase and a transfer in 
tax points worth many millions of dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the tax points and the lower interest rates, Quebec has had 
a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars which the Bloc 
members do not care to announce, do not care to acknowledge but 
just care to criticize and be untruthful in their approach to the 
things that are going on in Quebec.  They are certainly not 
interested in health care, certainly not interested in the 
citizens and certainly not interested in the education of their 
youth with the highest school dropout rate in the whole of 
Canada.  The member should be ashamed of his remarks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member had read the paper 
this morning, she would know that I have already commented on 
this to a journalist, from the <I>Gazette</I> furthermore.  As far as I 
know, she can read English.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made exactly the same comments about the Minister of Human 
Resources Development as those I made in the House, so it is not 
a question of having the backbone.  If she thinks the government 
is so wonderful with its tax points, she is mistaken.  In any 
event, she has been mistaken as long as we have known her.  As a 
member of Parliament, she is often mistaken.  But this time, she 
shows her ignorance by constantly harping on the tax points 
ceded to Quebec in the 1950s and 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tax points were ceded at a 1964 meeting between Mr. 
Pearson, a very sensible Canadian, and Mr. Lesage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to the member. 
If there had been no cuts, if things had been left as they were 
in 1994 where federal transfers to the provinces were concerned, 
what would the level of tax points transferred to the provinces 
have been?  Exactly the same as they are today.  This is 
undeniable proof that the changes in tax points are completely 
independent of federal government decisions.  This is a given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is someone going to go after the person who sold him a house 50 
years ago because the roof is now leaking?  It is the same 
thing.  As futile as debating how many angels can dance on the 
head of a pin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for her reference to the good things the federal government 
has done, my colleagues and I have tried to find some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We are looking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> We are still looking, and maybe one day will 
find some. 
But if one reads between the lines of the prepared words that 
come out of the PMO or the office of the Minister of Finance, 
one can see there has been nothing positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could there be when, since 1995, it has been decreed that 
there will be cuts year after year until 2003 in the health 
field?  How could there be, when they have the nerve to want to 
use the contributions of employers and employees to the 
employment insurance fund to finance tax cuts for the rich? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are these positive actions?  How are the interests of the 
people of the people of Quebec and of Canada being served?  We 
are still looking, and maybe one day we will manage to find some. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Bloc Quebecois member for his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is very familiar with the employment insurance issue, and he 
is aware that it is a very important issue in New Brunswick. Our 
province has suffered losses of $927 million in revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we put a question to him, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development tells us that he is giving back $5 million 
here and $2 million there, through various programs. My riding 
of Beauséjour—Petitcodiac is losing $35.8 million every year. 
People in Albert County only collected employment insurance 
benefits for 18 weeks, even though they live in rural areas. 
Also, fewer and fewer women qualify for the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a surplus that keeps increasing and that will exceed $20 
million. We know that poverty is on the rise in every region 
where unemployment is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell us what he thinks the government will 
do, more specifically the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who is always trying to make us believe that 72 per 
cent of workers qualify for unemployment insurance benefits and 
that his government is putting money back into the regions? Is 
the Minister of Human Resources Development telling us what his 
government is really doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker.  What the 
Minister of Human Resources Development tells us is the total 
opposite of the truth.  He twists the figures.  He twists them 
in a scandalous way.  Fewer than 40% of people can draw 
employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From December 2 last until March 31, employer and employee 
contributions to the employment insurance fund have been and 
will be used solely to increase the employment insurance fund 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the 15 cent decrease in contributions set by the Minister 
of Finance last November, the surplus in the fund is still going 
to end up over $6 billion. This is going to be used for 
something other than helping the unemployed in New Brunswick or 
anywhere else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the situation is so serious that not only has 
access been reduced, thus adding to the surplus, but the 
unemployed are, as well, now being harassed into not challenging 
claims for supposed overpayments before the Commission.  This is 
serious. It means that the rights of the unemployed are being 
denied, while the members opposite are pretending everything is 
just great, because there are not many appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day, the self-same Minister of Human Resources Development 
will be getting up to say “Judging by the number of complaints 
there have been in the past six months, things are going well. 
The number of complaints is dropping.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand, throughout Quebec and Canada people are being 
discouraged from appealing overpayments, and that will be 
reflected in the statistics the minister likes so much to refer 
to, although he does it all wrong.  This man has not served, and 
does not, serve the interests of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, I find it rather distasteful that he speaks in 
his report of the most disadvantaged and of his priorities, when 
in fact he is the one responsible for increasing collective 
poverty 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he is aware of the situation in which the Department 
of Human Resources Development could accuse an individual 
applying for benefits of fraud and force them to repay money, 
even though they have never received a cent from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation has occurred in the Atlantic provinces.  There 
are people there who apply and then go on to find a job.  They 
report it on their card, but if the amount is not exactly what 
they earned, even if the department has not paid them a cent, 
officials can come after them a year later and ask them to repay 
the difference between the amount they reported and the amount 
they actually earned working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But neither the Department of Human Resources Development nor 
any other department paid the individual applying for benefits a 
single cent. 
The individual never got a cent, but can be asked to repay the 
difference.  Is the hon. member aware of this situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say this is the first time 
I hear about such a situation. However, there have been a number 
of other cases where small overpayments were claimed. People's 
initial reaction was “I will settle this and pay the amount”, 
even though they knew they had not received that money. Since 
they could not prove their case, they paid the amount that was 
claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what they did not know—and these people are not told about 
their rights in human resources development centres—is that 
once they recognized that an overpayment had been made to them 
and once they paid the amount, they became, in the eyes of the 
minister and his henchmen, guilty parties. They now have a black 
mark on their employment insurance file, and the next time they 
have the misfortune of being unemployed and make a claim under 
the employment insurance program, the department will take a 
look at their file. 
Because they spontaneously paid the money back, these people 
will be penalized in terms of the number of weeks required to 
get their first benefits. People must be made aware of that 
situation and it is our duty to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to participate in 
this prebudget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that traditionally this debate focuses on the report of 
the finance committee's fall hearings, but today I want to take 
the opportunity to report on prebudget consultations that I and 
my NDP colleagues have been holding around the country. We have 
returned to parliament having consulted with a lot of Canadians 
on their vision for a renewed Canada and on the budget priorities 
needed to translate that vision into reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People we have met in every corner of Canada are concerned about 
the crisis in health care, the escalation of child poverty, the 
gutting of unemployment insurance and the national emergency in 
homelessness.  These are the devastating deficits created by this 
government's reckless disregard for the health of families, the 
health of communities and the health of our national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a series of community based economic round tables over the 
past two months bringing together people from all walks of life 
and all segments of the community to share their ideas on job 
creation, we heard very different views and priorities from those 
advocated by the Liberal majority on the finance committee 
telegraphing no doubt what the finance minister will say on 
budget day. Those Liberals think it is enough to cut the surtax 
for those in the highest income bracket and to throw a few token 
dollars back into health care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that they have made the sacrifices to balance the budget, 
Canadians want the federal government to reinvest in the social 
programs that bring security to their lives and stability to 
their communities.  They want some leadership from the government 
in tackling the challenges of the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to health care the Liberal government refuses to 
listen to Canadians.  Emergency rooms are overcrowded.  Waiting 
lists are getting longer.  Hospitals are discharging patients 
earlier and earlier without publicly provided home care being 
there for them.  That is why only 30% of Canadians give our 
health care system a favourable rating today compared to 60% in 
1991. It is why there are growing fears that our health care 
system, a uniquely Canadian combination of innovation and social 
responsibility, is going to surrender to a foreign American style 
two tier health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is busy advertising the upcoming budget as the 
so-called health budget, and yet having taken $2.5 billion out of 
transfers in each of the past three years, all finds would 
suggest it may restore less than one-quarter of what it has 
ripped out of the health care system.  Having reduced the federal 
share of health spending from the original 50% to 11% today, the 
Liberals have the gall to lecture the provincial governments 
about their responsibilities for health care. An immediate 
injection of $2.5 billion into health transfers to the provinces 
this year is the minimum required to get our health care system 
off the critical list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, any health accord between the federal and provincial 
governments must generate secure long term federal funding to 
enable the provinces to deliver home care and pharma care 
programs at a standard adequate to meet the needs of Canadians 
regardless of where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A decade has passed since parliamentarians in the House 
unanimously endorsed Ed Broadbent's motion, my predecessor, to 
end child poverty in Canada by 2000.  It will be the shameful 
legacy, the most lasting and damning legacy of this finance 
minister that on his watch child poverty was proclaimed a 
national tragedy and homelessness a national emergency in 
communities right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are disheartened by the federal government's 
abandonment of all responsibility for social housing.  They are 
humiliated at the UN's condemnation of federal Liberal policies 
that have dramatically increased poverty and homelessness during 
a period of economic growth, fuelling deeper and deeper divisions 
in Canadian society, and deteriorating conditions most 
drastically of all among our aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadians do not need experts to tell them about 
poverty and homelessness because they experience it every day in 
their lives.  Others who may not experience directly the 
punishing effects of this abandonment nevertheless share the 
sense of loss.  Canadians want a recommitment of a significant, 
not token, federal role in social housing and leadership in the 
reduction of poverty in our midst.  If this government's betrayal 
of the poor and homeless has resulted from heartless neglect, 
erosion of our employment insurance system has been an act of 
wilful sabotage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government set out to destroy deliberately what little 
security was offered by employment insurance, and it succeeded in 
spades.  Over 70% of unemployed Canadians received insurance 
benefits in 1989.  Less than 40% do so today.  In my riding of 
Halifax it is down to 29%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragically and predictably, this has imposed great hardship on 
many families.  It has driven many more into the ranks of 
poverty.  It has also sucked tens of millions of dollars from 
local economies in communities right across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must stop funding its general programs 
with resources collected from employers and workers for the 
benefit of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upcoming budget must recommit employment insurance funds for 
their intended use, for adequate income replacement for 
unemployed workers and for investment in training and other 
active transition measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has acted with the same lack of social 
responsibility with regard to post-secondary education.  The 
Liberals have simply transferred a portion of the federal debt on 
to to the personal debtloads of Canada's young people.  In some 
parts of Canada we have a university system today that is public 
in name only.  Tuition fees have skyrocketed beyond the reach of 
most working families.  Our so-called public universities are 
being transformed into institutions for the privileged elites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has betrayed a whole generation of young 
Canadians in much the same way that it has betrayed its own women 
employees in its refusal to negotiate in good faith on 
outstanding pay equity claims upheld by Canadian courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first call on the budget surplus therefore is for government 
to begin repairing the damage that its policies have inflicted on 
our social fabric, on our communities, on our hospitals, on our 
schools and on the programs which extend support to the 
unemployed and our most vulnerable citizens who for whatever 
reasons are not able to fend for themselves. Canadians insist 
that their government fulfil these social responsibilities in a 
fiscally responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades we have watched Liberal and Conservative governments 
adopt policies that led to annual deficits, a ballooning debt and 
rising personal taxes.  This happened not because the government 
was providing more and better social programs.  It is quite the 
opposite.  The mounting debt and higher personal taxes resulted 
from the artificially high interest rates forced on this country 
by the Bank of Canada.  In an act of supreme irresponsibility, 
the Bank of Canada knowingly deepened the last two recessions 
leaving lasting scars on both the public finances and on the 
lives of millions of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of that colossal blunder, Canadians are now paying 
higher taxes for fewer public services, paying more on interest 
payments on the debt than on any single social program.  It is a 
bit like a family paying ever higher and higher mortgage payments 
on a house that is getting shabbier and more run down every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must reverse this situation and we must begin with badly 
needed renovations on our house while also reducing the burden of 
our mortgage payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians therefore want and deserve a fairer tax system.  They 
want the debt problem addressed.  It is not a question of whether 
these things should be done but a question of how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On taxes the Liberal majority on the finance committee 
apparently thinks that the first priority should be to remove the 
surtax on those in the highest income bracket.  We in the New 
Democratic Party think there is a fairer and more effective way 
to grant tax relief.  The first priority must be the tax 
reduction that will benefit the most people, a reduction in the 
GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that a 1% reduction in the GST will give 
the biggest boost to the economy and create the most numbers of 
jobs while giving desperately needed tax relief to ordinary 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the debt, indications are that the finance minister wants to 
spend most of the surplus on direct repayment of the fiscal debt. 
This would be as imprudent and irresponsible as incurring another 
round of deficits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the uncertainties in the global economy Canadians could 
face a recession in coming months.  We have already seen the 
terrible impact that the collapse in commodity prices has had on 
farm incomes. The federal government has been desperately slow to 
respond to this crisis in our farming communities and must do so 
now, adequately and decisively in the upcoming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the threat of a severe economic downturn resulting 
from the crisis in international markets it would be 
irresponsible to add to these risks.  Overly aggressive debt 
repayment would put an additional drag on economic growth. 
Ironically such an ill advised course of action could slow down 
the economy to the point of forcing us into a deficit situation 
next year.  That is something we must avoid.  We need an approach 
that balances the need to lessen the burden of interest charges 
on the debt with the obligation to avoid risks with the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommitment to social responsibility and a responsible balanced 
approach to spending, tax relief and debt reduction are the 
things Canadians want in the upcoming budget.  These questions 
have been on the agenda for more than two decades.  Canadians are 
looking for some leadership, some vision and some imagination in 
dealing with the challenges of rapid technological change in a 
world of global economic uncertainty.  That leadership is needed 
to tackle the continuing high rate of unemployment and severe 
under employment that plagues too many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent disastrous decision that shows the government's 
insensitivity and unwillingness to respond to those continuing 
high levels of unemployment is its decision last week to pull the 
plug on Devco, an important engine of economic activity and 
growth in the Nova Scotia economy, a community suffering from an 
official unemployment level of over 20% and unofficially 
estimated to be above 40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership is also needed to reduce the insecurity and stresses 
on families struggling to deal with deteriorating health care, 
escalating education costs and the erosion of vitally important 
public services.  In the past 15 years the two parties holding 
government in this country has pursued virtually the same course, 
reduce inflation, cut the deficit, slash social programs, weaken 
worker ability to bargain selectively and somehow we will all be 
in economic clover.  This government calls it getting the 
economic fundamentals right.  It has not worked.  It is not going 
to work to improve the living standards of ordinary people.  It 
has not worked to lift families out of poverty.  It has not 
worked for the homeless.  The earnings of low and middle income 
Canadians have fallen rather than risen in the past decade. 
Ordinary Canadians are working harder and harder for less and 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's formula has not worked in its own terms. 
Getting the economic fundamentals right, as it loves to say, has 
not got the economic fundamentals right.  The Canadian dollar has 
declined to a level that would have been unthinkable a decade 
ago.  Economic analysts are unanimous in condemning the Canadian 
economy for one of the worst records in productivity growth among 
the major world economies.  Despite generous tax measures in 
place, corporations in Canada, especially foreign multinationals, 
rate very poorly in research and development, one of the keys to 
future economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the vibrant economy that we need, to create the badly 
needed jobs and to sustain the social programs that Canadians 
cherish we must get beyond the complacent and lazy notion that 
getting the economic fundamentals right is enough.  Canadians 
need government to encourage the kind of economic practices that 
will lead to a genuine widely shared prosperity that enables 
ordinary Canadians to make a rewarding life for themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first challenge is to reinvest in our social programs.  This 
will benefit the economy in general and it will generate decent, 
rewarding jobs in health, education and other vital public 
services like environmental protection and clean-up, benefiting 
those who fill the new jobs but also the community where those 
jobs are created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second challenge is to ensure that the savings of ordinary 
Canadians are channelled into the long term responsible 
investments that will lead to improvements in productivity.  Our 
current tax system treats short term speculation in exactly the 
same way as long term investments that create productivity 
improvements and sustainable jobs.  This has to change.  Our 
productivity challenge is to find practical ways of encouraging 
pension funds and other pools of savings into the kinds of 
investments that will improve productivity and assist community 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure that everyone, not just computer wizards, gets 
the training they need to keep up with the dizzying pace of 
technological change.  Canadians need ready access to educational 
opportunity and we must find ways to get employers to do a better 
job of investing in on the job training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When profitable companies like Bell Canada sell off one of their 
divisions to avoid paying their pay equity obligations and to 
drastically reduce the pay and benefits of long service 
employees, there is something seriously wrong with our economic 
culture.  An economy without expectations of corporate 
responsibility, where decision makers put shareholder value above 
all other values to the exclusion of their commitments to long 
serving employees and above their community obligations is one 
that is surely failing.  As long as employees have no reason to 
trust in the good faith of their employers, no sense that their 
loyalty and service will be respected and rewarded, our economy 
will not be as productive as it needs to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Bell Canada the CRTC must review whether Bell 
Canada's actions violate federal regulations, but in general 
Canadians expect their government to start building the framework 
for an economic citizenship where economic decision makers are 
bound not just by the short term bottom line but to their 
responsibilities to communities where they do business, to the 
environment and to their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The performance of our economy is not only a question of the 
quality of our technology.  It depends on the social capital of 
trust between employer and employee in a democratic workplace and 
on the good citizenship of economic decision makers.  To build 
such an economic citizenship in the context of globalization is a 
huge challenge and one that cries for federal leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another economic challenge requiring imagination is the 
situation facing Canadian families who are increasingly stressed 
out trying to juggle work and family responsibilities of 
children, of frail family members and of elderly parents.  There 
is a shortage of affordable quality day care and no financial 
support for parents who care for their young children or elderly 
parents at home.  Inflexible work arrangements make it difficult 
for parents to be at home when kids are forced to stay home sick 
or when kids return after school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the government nor the private sector has begun to meet 
the challenge of creating arrangements that reconcile a thriving 
economy with a thriving community that meets the needs of 
families.  Canadians need their government to make this a 
priority.  They need solid progress toward this important 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, to make progress in these areas will take 
imaginative visionary leadership.  Canadians are not getting that 
currently from the government or their Prime Minister.  How 
typical of the Prime Minister's arrogance and petty mindedness 
when before Christmas he said to Canadians that some mornings he 
wakes up and he feels like giving the provinces some more money 
for health, and other mornings he wakes up and he does not feel 
like giving Canadians more money for health.  He might as well 
have said let them eat cake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the leader of the New Democratic Party.  I 
am reminded of listening to Tommy Douglas in the 1960s and 1970s. 
The speeches do not seem very different to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue I hear coming across loud and strong is that we should 
spend more money.  Canada is the second highest spender on health 
care in the western world.  We have to recognize that we are 
spending exceedingly great amounts of money on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny that the member's argument contains a lot of 
concern about the delivery of the system.  However I wish the 
member would have taken more time to say how we could deliver 
health care more effectively to the citizens of Canada within the 
parameters of our current spending envelope rather than simply 
writing more cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are telling me that they do not want governments 
to spend more money in spite of the consultative process they 
claim to have gone through.  The people of Durham are saying that 
they do not want governments to spend more money.  In fact they 
want governments to have accountability for the money they are 
spending.  They want more service for the money being spent. The 
answer is not simply to spend more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to talk about labour productivity.  I am very 
concerned about the issue because labour is hiding behind a 
deflated and imaginary value of the Canadian dollar.  The day the 
Canadian dollar starts trading anywhere close to 85 cents there 
will be massive unemployment in the country.  The the association 
between labour productivity and the unemployment insurance system 
is inescapable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any commitment at all to balanced budgets 
in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that 
not only the Prime Minister is not listening to Canadians.  It is 
not just the finance minister who is not listening to Canadians. 
Backbenchers in the Liberal caucus are clearly not listening to 
Canadians.  This backbencher certainly did not listen to what I 
was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no rule in the House that requires him to do so.  I 
acknowledge that.  However, if he rises to ask questions one 
would hope that he would have listened to my making a point that 
I will make again very clearly for him to hear one more time. 
Canadians are looking for accountability in how their governments 
deal with health care.  That is why they are offended by his 
government ripping billions and billions of dollars, massive 
amounts of dollars, out of the health system unilaterally and 
refusing to be accountable for what it has done in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability is needed but Canadians are sick and tired of the 
hypocrisy of the Liberals saying to the provinces that they 
should be accountable for health care dollars.  The provinces 
should be accountable for health care but so too should the 
federal government be accountable for health care.

roughly a $14 billion deficit in a short period of four or five

government to account that they want to divert attention, to 
divert pressure and to talk about a provincial government of a 
different political stripe in a bygone era of almost a decade 
ago.  I do not think that is doing what constituents elected 
federal members of parliament to come to Ottawa to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs opposition members who are seriously 
interested in demanding accountability, in focusing on the

might be useful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have just seen a 
demonstration of one more way in which government members and 
official opposition members behave in the exact same manner. 
Members from neither party listen to a single word said in the 
House by anybody but their own apologists in their own caucuses. 
Members from neither party seem to understand the notion of 
walking and chewing gum at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear that Canadians do not want either/or. 
They do not want better and more accountable spending but 
recklessness with respect to dealing with the budget.  They want 
both/and.  If the government cannot deliver both, it is darn 
clear the official opposition cannot deliver either.  That is why 
we are prepared to present a real alternative.

the first week of February is White Cane Week in Canada.  This 
event, organized by the Canadian Council of the Blind and the 
Canadian National Institute for the Blind, is designed to focus 
on the abilities, concerns and needs of people who are blind, 
visually impaired or deaf-blind.  The white cane, associated with 
people who are blind since the 1930s, has become a symbol of 
blindness, courage and independent spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>White Cane Week was first launched by a group of blind people 
who felt there was a lack of understanding about what the white 
cane represented.  It continues to be an event to educate the 
public and to make all Canadians aware of blind people's 
achievements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>White Cane Week is an opportunity for everyone to find out more 
about the blind, visually impaired and deaf-blind.  We should all 
be more aware of this condition that affects so many Canadians. 
If anyone wishes to find out more about White Cane Week they can 
contact their local Canadian Council of the Blind or the Canadian 
National Institute for the Blind.  They are deserving of our

</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is in the Prime Minister's best interest to keep 
Canadians in the dark, he should come clean before the House 
about his conflict of interest.  The Prime Minister is required 
by law to put his business in a blind trust so Canadians know he 
is not abusing power.  But the Prime Minister ignores the law and 
gropes around in the not-so-blind trust anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises two questions:  What kind of ethics commissioner 
would have an open discussion with a public office holder about 
holdings in a blind trust?  Only one appointed by and dependent 
upon the Prime Minister for his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else has the Prime Minister not told us about his business 
dealings?  Bombardier gets a lot of lucrative, untendered

brought a wealth of skills to our country and continue to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians were shocked and deeply hurt to learn recently that an 
organizing committee chaired by a federal bureaucrat 
discriminated against the Christian faith at the Swissair crash 
memorial service held on September 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Christian clergy were not allowed to mention the name Jesus or 
use their New Testament scriptures.  The remarks of other 
religious groups received no such censure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As when any basic human right is transgressed, there are 
unfortunate and painful consequences.  This censure was unfair to 
the Christian clergy making presentations and it was a disservice 
to those Christians at the ceremony seeking comfort, solace and 
healing from their terrible pain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appropriately, the federal government offered an apology and 
expressed some responsibility. 
However, Canadians want to know that religious discrimination 
like this will not happen again.  They demand constructive 
solutions.

to be in the same situation as the government was in after years 
of not balancing the books and having a huge deficit. The 
government had to raise taxes just to pay unemployment insurance 
because it had a very large deficit and it had no choice.

down a budget this month. It seems we just paid for our Christmas

approaches tax time a little differently.  Some people dread it. 
Some people shrug their shoulders.  Some people say one thing and 
think another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Prime Minister has mixed feelings.  Will he tell us

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister at tax time 1999 feels much better 
than at tax time in 1994. He knows that the Minister of Finance 
has reduced taxes in the last two years.  He has reduced the EI 
contribution in the last four years.  I hope the minister will be 
able to carry on with the policy of balancing our books as well 
as payment on the debt, reduction of taxes, and money for social 
and economic programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

raising taxes.  Now we know he actually secretly admired him for 
raising taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we to know that when the Prime Minister says he favours 
tax relief now, he really is not secretly hoping that he can 
maintain high tax levels?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

increase taxes constantly.  It did not prudently manage at the

soon enough this government will demonstrate in a very tangible 
way its long term commitment to the health care system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is how can the Reform Party stand and pretend to 
speak in favour of medicare when it would spend nothing 
additional on health? Let me quote from a document that was 
distributed at a Reform meeting in Victoria recently.  This is 
what it would do with the surplus:  “Half of the surplus should 
go toward debt reduction with the other half devoted to tax 
relief”.  Nothing for health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

medicare.  He missed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the health minister trying to do?  He is trying to get a 
report card on the provinces for health.  What does the federal 
Liberal report card look like?  When it comes to transfers to the 
provinces, F.  When it comes to 188,000 people on waiting lists 
in Canada, F.  When it comes to 1,400 doctors having left this 
country in the last three years, F. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could this minister look at others for a report card on 
health care when his record is an F?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party would not do well in mathematics.  It might get 
an F because it seems to me that if we devote half the surplus 
toward tax relief and half toward debt reduction, we have not got 
any money left for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party really has an agenda that is quite hidden.  It 
talks about privatizing medicine, about removing the restrictions 
of the Canada Health Act, allowing Canadians a choice.  We all 
know what that means.  It is code language for an American style 
system of private health care.  We will never be in favour of 
that.

responsibility for federal cuts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if he has 
any sense of responsibility, will the Prime Minister recognize 
that it is the federal government that made cuts in the health 
sector, that accumulated budget surpluses after making such 
cuts, and that, consequently, it is the federal government that 
must unconditionally give back to the provinces the money that 
it deprived them of, so they can provide health services to the 
public?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in order to eliminate the $42 billion deficit which we 
inherited, we had to make cuts that affected everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, the provinces continued to receive federal payments in 
the form of tax points. Half of the amount referred to earlier 
by the Bloc Quebecois leader has already been paid back through 
the tax points that have led to an increase in provincial 
revenues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of federal cuts, the government now wants a report 
card from the provinces as a condition for reinvestment in health 
care.  Surely what is good for the goose is good for the gander. 
Canadians want the federal government to be accountable too. 
After all, it is the federal government that massively and 
unilaterally cut health care transfers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
had the member read what we were saying, we were proposing

a year on health care and we do not know what we get for the 
money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister hints that he may return 25 cents for every dollar 
he has ripped out of health care.  For this Canadians are 
supposed to be grateful, to bow down and kiss his ring. 
Meanwhile, some women are forced to drive 300 kilometres to 
deliver their babies because there are no hospital beds nearby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister today agree to return $2.5 billion to 
health care this year and commit today to long term stable health 
care funding?

ministers on behalf of the government, that health care is indeed 
a priority for this government in this particular budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply remind the hon. member that in fact health 
insurance was brought in by the Liberal Party in 1957, that

it would be so handy if the Canadian public and this parliament

seems to know what they are.  The ethics counsellor simply has 
coffee with and reports to the Prime Minister but not to 
parliament. He is accountable to parliament.  Could the Prime

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, dumping

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government made a deal with Shearwater Development 
Corporation, a Nova Scotia company owned by a prominent Liberal,

creditor for $500,000.

earlier today the finance minister boasted about the legacy of

remember the legacy of Lester Pearson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After broken promises of full consultation the government 
through the Minister of Natural Resources betrayed the people of 
Cape Breton, betrayed its own legacy.  Shame on them.  Only a 
third of the miners who have spent 25 years underground may

make for modifications.

question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's department has stated that one-third of the $200 
million earmarked for Devco will be spent on an economic 
development package for Cape Breton.  That works out to $68 
million for economic development.  This is just not enough.

economic development package would need to be developed in very 
close collaboration with the local community, including Mayor 
Muise and others in the Cape Breton community who have vital 
input to make into the entire package. 
This one needs to be built from the ground up and shaped by Cape 
Bretoners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the indulgence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise concerning last week's Devco announcement.  I was 
informed by the minister's office on Wednesday that no 
announcement was forthcoming. Subsequent events led to the 
announcement the next day in my riding.  As part of that 
announcement there was a lock-up for media and for personnel 
interested in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I had no notice of the announcement I had to change my travel 
plans and arrived at my riding by 3.30, not in time for the 
lock-up.  I had requested that one of my staff be allowed in that 
lock-up as I had been given no notice of this most important 
announcement to the people of my riding.  My staff person was not 
permitted by, I assume, the minister's office.  I find that a 
breach of my own representation and responsibility as a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not be there because the minister's office would not be 
forthcoming with the date of the announcement.  My staff was not 
permitted in to hear the dramatic effects on my community that 
this announcement would have.  I ask that the government make 
sure that members of parliament or their designated staff be 
permitted into those types of briefings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

question to be consulted and hopefully he can address this issue 
when he is back in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Convention is that when something affects parties in the House 
usually these points are dealt with under votes.  The minister 
momentarily has stepped out and I am sure he will want to address 
this issue immediately upon his return.  Perhaps the Chair will 
entertain waiting to adjudicate on this matter at a time when the 
minister has been able to give his contribution toward the point 
in question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before you make a decision on this instance, I ask that you look 
at the abuse ministers are taking on members in this House of 
making announcements and not advising members when announcements 
are being made whether in their own ridings or elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it behooves this House to give at least some form of 
credit and credibility to members on this side.  This is not just 
a one sided House of Commons where speeches and announcements can 
be made throughout the country and not inform everybody else 
about it, not letting us participate.  It is a bigger issue than 
this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I reiterate the concern of my colleague from Cape Breton, myself 
and all NDP members of parliament about the behaviour of the 
government in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, there have been previous points of order having 
to do with announcements not being made in the House.  That is a 
separate point and I acknowledge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If announcements are not to be made in the House of Commons, 
where many of them should be made and are not, then at least when 
the government makes announcements elsewhere it should have the 
decency to involve at least the members of parliament who are 
directly affected through participation in the lock-up and 
through prior notice of when the meeting is to take place and 
when the announcement is to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least the government should not indicate the day 
before the announcement is made that there is not to be an 
announcement.  What happened in this case is that the member from 
Cape Breton was told in a bare faced way that there would be no 
announcement.  Then there was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally reprehensible and is something the minister 
should answer for if not in the context of a question of 
privilege then at least politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will reserve judgment until the minister 
involved is in the House.  With regard to the point raised by the 
hon. House leader of the Reform Party, perhaps there is a larger 
issue he wants to bring to the House. If he wants to bring this 
issue to the House, I invite him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have in front of me right now is a question of privilege 
raised by the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria.  I will reserve 
judgment on this point until I hear from the minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition bears the signatures of 228 residents of the 
Mankota, Riverhurst and Swift Current districts in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that the MacKay task force on Canada's 
financial services sector has made recommendations that will 
enable banks to retail property and casualty insurance from their 
branches.  This would have a drastically negative impact on 
Canada's independent insurance dealers and would result in the 
loss of thousands of jobs.  The petitioners therefore call upon 
parliament to totally reject the recommendations of the MacKay 
task force report pertaining to the entry of banks into the 
casualty and property insurance markets and not to give in to the 
pressure of the banks on this matter.

series of petitions I get from people who are opposed to the new 
Firearms Act.  This petition is from citizens of the Annaheim 
district in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that there is no evidence that the 
criminal use of firearms is impeded by restrictive firearms 
legislation.  They state that the enforcement of regulations 
associated with Bill C-68 would place an unnecessary burden on 
law enforcement officers and that the search and seizure 
provisions of Bill C-68 would constitute a breach of traditional 
civil liberties and be an affront to law-abiding Canadians. 
Therefore they call upon parliament to repeal Bill C-68 and all 
associated regulations with respect to firearms or ammunition and 
to pass new legislation designed to severely penalize the 
criminal use of any weapon. This brings the total number of 
signatures I have received on petitions on this subject to 4,571.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The multilateral agreement on investment has now died a well 
deserved death at the OECD.  Nevertheless, petitions continue to 
flow in from Canadians who were concerned about the multilateral 
agreement and who were calling upon parliament to reject the MAI 
as fundamentally flawed and to recognize that Canadians reject 
the MAI approach to globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners instruct the government to seek an entirely 
different kind of agreement by which the world might achieve a 
rules based global economy that protects workers, the environment 
and the ability of governments to act in the public interest.  I 
imagine that they would certainly urge the government not to 
stubbornly persist in pursuing an MAI type agreement either at

with pleasure that I rise today to speak on the prebudget report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to see in the not too distant future in the 
upcoming budget the clear direction of the government on the very 
important financial matters facing our country. Members of the 
opposition and all Canadians are waiting with some degree of 
suspense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is changing at an unprecedented rate.  Globalization 
and the forces of technology create change on a daily basis. 
Governments have to lead and it is going to take significantly 
more response from the current government than what we have been 
used to over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government without a real agenda, without a firm 
vision.  It is government by cruise control.  The government 
instead of looking well into the next century in terms of where 
it wants to take the country is focused solely on the next 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
recently said that current trends in Canada could lead to a 
substantial decline in Canada's per capita income relative to the 
OECD average.  I repeat that there could be a substantial decline 
in our per capita income unless significant changes are made to 
the direction in which we are going as a country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The only economic policy that this government has had has been 
in fighting the deficit.  Our party and our members are as 
pleased as any party or any member with the fact that we have 
eliminated the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to 1979, it was the Conservative Party under the 
leadership of Joe Clark that introduced a budget which was the 
first fiscally responsible budget of a generation.  At that time, 
had that budget been implemented, instead of being defeated for 
purely partisan purposes, Canadians would have been better served 
and the deficit quite possibly would have been eliminated far 
earlier than it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are responsible for the elimination of the deficit. 
Canadians have borne the brunt of deficit reduction.  We have 
seen taxes in Canada increase from $114 billion in 1993 to $151 
billion last year.  That is a 23% increase.  At the same time we 
have seen transfers to the provinces cut by 35%.  Health care and 
education is reeling across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system is in tremendous shock, not just in my 
province of Nova Scotia but across Canada.  Every province is 
reeling under the effects of the unilateral cuts to the transfers 
made by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tells us to look at the fundamentals.  The 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister tell us that the 
fundamentals are sound.  We have, as part of those fundamentals, 
the highest personal bankruptcy rate in the history of our 
country.  Currently we have a negative savings rate.  We have the 
highest taxes of any of the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have cut the deficit by increasing taxes 
significantly, by cutting and by offloading responsibilities to 
the provinces.  Canadians have the highest personal debt rate in 
the history of our country.  While the government can pontificate 
about being in the black, Canadians are at an unprecedented rate 
of being in the red. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>The Economist</I> magazine has published articles on the 
Canadian situation.  At one point it reported that it was a 
miracle we were able to eliminate the deficit.  It gave credit 
not to the current government but to the previous government. 
<I>The Economist</I> magazine specifically stated that the credit 
for deficit reduction in Canada goes to the passage of time and 
the successful reforms earlier this decade made by the previous 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind members opposite of those structural changes in 
the Canadian economy.  Quite possibly they are wallowing in their 
own hypocrisy today because they fought these changes 
vociferously during election campaigns.  The changes were:  free 
trade, the GST, and the deregulation of financial services, 
transportation and energy.  These were the tough visionary 
policies that were required then to provide benefits to Canadians 
today.  I would posit that those are the types of tough visionary 
decisions that are required today to lead us into the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this government, a government of caretakership 
and cruise control, refuses to provide the type of visionary 
leadership that Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister keep saying that 
the fundamentals are strong.  These are some of those 
fundamentals.  We have an unemployment rate that is twice that of 
the U.S.  The dollar hit record lows throughout the summer.  Our 
productivity is lagging our G-7 partners.  Our percentage of 
global foreign direct investment has dropped from 8.9% to 4% in 
recent years.  The IMF and the OECD are both saying that taxes 
are too high.  Our comparative tax burden in Canada relative to 
the U.S. continues to pummel initiative, productivity and success 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian families making $30,000 a year are paying out a 
marginal tax rate of approximately 40% in combined federal and 
provincial taxes.  In nine of our ten provinces our top marginal 
tax rate is more than 50%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT55"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT55"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hit that top marginal rate at approximately $60,000.  In the 
U.S. the top rate, federal and state combined, is in the mid to 
upper 40% range.  Americans do not hit that marginal tax rate 
until they have an income of $271,000 U.S. or $410,000 Canadian. 
This type of disparity, this type of spread between our tax rates 
and the tax rates of our largest trading partner, is simply not 
sustainable.  It is one of the reasons that an unprecedented 
number of our brightest and best young people are going to the 
U.S., what is frequently referred to as the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1973 productivity in this country has been lagging behind 
our competitors.  We have seen a secular decline in the Canadian 
dollar, which is closely linked with productivity.  The Prime 
Minister's erudite response this summer was that somehow the 
dollar was not such a big problem and that it would help tourism. 
The finance minister, the Prime Minister and other members 
opposite seem to believe that Canada can devalue its way to 
prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact it is quite the opposite.  The contrary is true.  If 
these low dollar and low productivity policies continue we will 
have a self-fulfilling prophecy in that many Canadian 
manufacturers and employers will put off investing in the types 
of capital investments and productivity enhancement 
infrastructure they need to become better, more productive and 
more competitive in a global environment.  This will happen for 
two reasons.  First, many of these productivity enhancement 
items, such as equipment or software, are imported and are more 
expensive because of the low dollar.  Second, the companies feel 
that they do not have to become more productive and more 
competitive because they are hiding behind a non-tariff trade 
barrier, also known as a low dollar policy.  When that changes it 
is going to be a significantly difficult time for Canadian 
employers and employees as we see the effects of current 
government policies and inactivity in addressing the issues of 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues the government should be dealing with are lowering 
taxes, reducing the regulatory burden, working with the provinces 
to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers and working to 
address labour market flexibility.  Those are the types of issues 
that need to be addressed.  But the government has focused on one 
thing and one thing only.  It has forgotten the fundamentals of 
building a strong economy and making the types of investments 
required to lead Canadians effectively in a very competitive 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hoping that in the upcoming budget we do not see more 
Liberal focus group economics.  We are looking for leadership, 
not politics.  In the last budget, when there was a vague whiff 
of a surplus, the Liberals brought forward a millennium 
scholarship program which will only benefit about 5% of students 
seeking higher education.  Even then, it will only kick in in 
2000. It is a scholarship program which is not even available to 
students pursuing education in private career colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a global trend toward private post-secondary education. 
It is part of the labour market flexibility that will be very 
important if we are going to compete.  But this new scholarship 
program does not recognize a global trend in education.  In the 
last budget debate we suggested an amendment that students 
attending career colleges and private colleges, which are the 
wave of the future, could receive benefits from the millennium 
scholarship fund.  Instead the Liberals did what was politically 
expedient and not what was sound from a public policy 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned with a government that would spend $2.5 billion 
before it knew the degree of the surplus.  There is nothing like 
the smell of hard currency around the snouts of Liberal 
backbenchers to incite a feeding frenzy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals know a great deal about spending.  It was the 
Liberal Party in the late 1960s which was able to take a zero 
deficit to $38 billion by 1984.  The Liberals deserve some credit 
for having developed a certain proficiency in spending.  However, 
we hope they do not revert to their old ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a concern on this side of the House and certainly in 
our party that the Liberals are practising the politics of 
signalling right and then turning left.  We know in their own 
heart of hearts that they have had to pinch their noses and 
pursue policies of the previous government, which they knew were 
right, over the last several years.  We are somewhat happy that 
they have done that.  The only thing worse than the Liberals 
stealing Conservative policies would be for them to implement 
their own, which would be far more deleterious to Canadians in 
the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to be proactive in this country, if we are going 
to be successful in the 21st century, I would hope that the 
finance minister would spend a significant amount of time 
reviewing the prebudget report, and particularly the Progressive 
Conservative dissenting report within which he will find some 
very sound and forward thinking policy initiatives, such as the 
reduction of EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes are one of the single biggest impediments to job 
growth in our country.  The Minister of Finance has said in the 
past that payroll taxes kill jobs.  Now we are asking that he 
actually live up to his rhetoric, reduce payroll taxes and put 
the money back into the hands of employers and employees. 
Employers can create jobs if we give them the tools.  One of the 
things we are putting in the way are payroll taxes which are 
unnecessarily high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any Liberal opposite who would argue that high payroll taxes do 
not kill jobs would have to prove to me that the law of supply 
and demand is no longer relevant.  When the cost of input is 
increased, whether it is for labour or anything else, the demand 
for that input is reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the Liberals are proposing that we repeal the law of 
supply and demand, I would suggest that we need to reduce EI 
premiums.  We are proposing that EI premiums be reduced to $2 per 
$100 of insurable earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for a full indexation of income tax brackets. 
Now is the time, particularly in a post-deficit period, to 
eliminate the bracket creep and reverse the trend.  There have 
been 1.4 million low income Canadians who have been pushed onto 
the tax rolls and another 2.5 million Canadians who have been 
moved into higher tax brackets due to partial indexing.  We are 
calling for full indexation of the tax brackets and we are hoping 
that the minister will provide this in the upcoming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for an increase in the basic personal exemption 
to $10,000.  In the U.S. a low income American does not begin to 
pay taxes until reaching an income equivalent to $11,000 
Canadian.  In Canada, supposedly a kinder and gentler nation, we 
start taxing Canadians at $7,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal budget the Liberals said that they provided 
tax relief for low income Canadians.  In fact somebody making 
$10,000 per year received a tax benefit of approximately $78 per 
year in the last federal budget.  That is about one coffee per 
week at Tim Horton's.  If they go to Starbucks it is one per 
month.  That was the pittance, the insult, that the Liberals 
threw at low income Canadians in the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for an increase in the capital gains exemption. 
Throughout Canada we are seeing growth in high tech industries 
and in small businesses, particularly in the area of technology. 
The current amount of $500,000 simply does not reflect the values 
of these businesses. 
We must keep in mind that for many small business owners, really 
their complete life, their entire capital accumulation is within 
their small business.  If we are to encourage small business 
people and create an environment within which Canadians want to 
grow and succeed in entrepreneurial ventures, increasing the 
capital gains tax exemption makes sense and makes sense now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for an increase in the health and social 
transfers to the provinces. The Liberals have cut significantly 
since 1993, some 35%, in their transfers to the provinces.  What 
is interesting is on the health care issue now the Liberals, 
after having unilaterally cut the health care system across 
Canada, forcing Canadians to face significant losses in the 
quality of our health care system, they are saying they want to 
reinvest but they want to ensure they can protect Canadians 
against the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying they want to make sure they can have some 
control because they do not want the provinces making the wrong 
decisions.  It was not the provinces' fault what happened since 
1993, it was the federal government's fault.  The provinces did 
not reduce their transfers from the federal government.  It was 
the federal government that reduced those transfers that set the 
provinces and our health care system reeling across Canada. Now 
we have the patriarchal big brother approach by the federal 
government and the unbridled hypocrisy of federal government 
members when they say they want increased accountability from the 
provinces when in fact when given the opportunity to be 
responsible with health care they blew it since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for indexing the child tax benefit. There was a 
private member's bill by one of our members which was passed by 
the House.  We are calling for the government to follow up and 
index the child tax benefit to ensure that inflation, even at a 
very low rate, does not reduce and eliminate this benefit for low 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for real and measurable debt reduction targets. 
It is very important for our international markets to see that 
the commitments Canada is making or is willing to make to debt 
reduction are not simply going to disappear amidst new Liberal 
spending.  We need to see firm debt reduction targets with the 
goal of reducing our debt to GDP ratio to the G-7 average of 55% 
over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for an increase in the RRSP foreign content limit 
to 50%.  It is inconsistent with asking Canadians to invest to 
protect their future, invest and save for their own future, and 
then denying them the opportunity to achieve geographic 
diversification in their portfolios.  The Canadians equities 
market represents only about 1% to 1.5% of global equities 
markets, yet we are forcing Canadians to invest in one small 
equities market.  That is simply not consistent with maximization 
of the returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also calling for parliamentary control— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the hon. 
member's time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member referred in a number of instances to the effective tax 
rates in Canada.  He was talking about someone making $30,000 a 
year as an example.  I think he is mistaken and I would like to 
set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a taxpayer has $30,000 of taxable income they are just at the 
first, lowest effective rate federally, which is 17%.  Provinces 
have a variety of rates but they are roughly equivalent to about 
50% of the federal taxes. So that someone in Ontario, for 
instance on $30,000, would pay 50% of the federal rate overall. 
That means an effective rate of 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member failed to include in his calculation was that 
all Canadians get a non-refundable basic personal amount of about 
$6,500 which reduces the taxes otherwise payable.  Therefore the 
real tax out of pocket of a single person making $30,000 is only 
19.6%, not the numbers the member was giving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second matter the member spent some time on was with regard 
to the comparative brackets between Canada and the U.S. Clearly 
there are some differences there.  If all the member wants to do 
is have a comparable bracket for someone in the $250,000 range to 
be equivalent to the U.S., I suggest we establish a rate of 
29.01% which is the highest federal rate plus .01% more and set 
it at $.5 million and then we will be better than them.  It is 
really a frivolous argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask the member is on the CHST issue. As 
the member knows, there is a lot of misinformation concerning 
that.  In Ontario the actual cuts in CHST were less than $1 
billion and yet at the same time Ontario had tax cuts of $4.3 
billion.  It is clear that although there was an equitable 
reduction across the country with regard to the transfers related 
to health, the provincial governments themselves have to make 
decisions.  One of the decisions the province of Ontario made was 
to reduce taxes and to cut health services at the same time. 
These choices are provincial choices. They are not federal 
choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member whether he had the same situation in his 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member calls it a frivolous argument that the top marginal 
tax rate in the U.S. does not kick in until the threshold of 
$271,000.  In Canada it kicks in at approximately $60,000.  He 
calls it frivolous that we actually tax at a higher rate at the 
top marginal tax rate and we start at $60,000 and in the U.S. it 
does not start until the equivalent of $410,000.  How can the 
member justify his assertion that this is frivolous? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last year's prebudget debate the hon. member opposite when I 
was speaking about the brain drain said that Canadians should not 
want to leave this country because of our great health care 
system and because of all the social niceties. He listed various 
reasons why Canadians would not want to leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My response is that perhaps his time would be better spent 
standing at the border explaining to Canadians who are voting 
with their feet and choosing to go to the lower tax, higher 
opportunity environment why they should not leave, because they 
are leaving.  They are leaving because the government continues 
to tax at all levels of income far too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member still obviously does not understand the 
impediment to economic growth that high taxes are. When he 
mentions Ontario he forgets to mention that Ontario actually 
increased its investment in health care.  While the federal 
government cut its investments in health care, the province of 
Ontario and many other provinces increased their investments in 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right to identify there was a tax cut in Ontario. 
This tax cut led to one of the strongest levels of economic 
growth in our country.  It led to one of the strongest levels of 
job growth in our country.  Perhaps the member should learn from 
the evidence and the example of Ontario that tax cuts can create 
economic growth and that governments can make the right choices 
and cut taxes and invest more in health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the comments from the member for Mississauga South 
indicate once more that Liberal accountants may know how to count 
beans but they do not understand how to grow the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite said that it really is not 
consequential whether we have the highest marginal rate kick in 
at $60,000 or a quarter of a million or a half a million dollars. 
This really does suggest he does not understand the 
disincentives to work, save and invest among the most productive 
segment of the economy. 
I am offended when I hear a member from Ontario, who stood in 
this place and voted to cut billions of dollars in health 
transfers from his own people and his own province, turn around 
and blame the Ontario government for cutting taxes.  Yes, the 
Ontario government cut taxes but its income tax revenues went up 
by $5 billion because more people are working, saving and 
investing, something a Liberal could not possible understand as a 
rational response to tax relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member for Kings—Hants agree with me that the member 
opposite does not understand the supply side dynamic that tax 
relief provides as demonstrated in the crucible of Ontario in the 
past three years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not always agree 
with the hon. Reform member and this is not a message from the 
united alternative.  That being the case, I agree with him 
completely in his assertion that the Liberals simply do not 
understand supply side economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals believe Canadians will not be bothered by being taxed 
more and more and that the economy will not be stalled by this. 
They believe employment insurance premiums and payroll taxes do 
not kill jobs.  They do not even believe in the law of supply and 
demand. The Liberals believe in Liberal focus group economics. 
They have no understanding of the types of economic principles 
that are leading even their counterparts in social democrat 
governments elsewhere to produce more tax relief, jobs and growth 
than they are capable of producing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous government gave the Liberals a great start on the 
road to economic success with free trade, the GST, deregulation 
of financial services, transportation and energy.  We really gave 
them every opportunity to succeed and yet they still do not 
recognize what Canadians need now.  More than anything else 
Canadians need lower taxes, less regulation, more jobs, more 
economic growth. We want Canadians to succeed here.  We do not 
want them to have to succeed in the U.S. or in other countries 
where opportunities are growing faster because taxes are lower. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River.  I had the distinct privilege this year 
to be part of the Standing Committee on Finance and to have 
toured across Canada.   We heard that Canadians want and expect 
from this government integrity, accountability, consistency and 
above all that their voices be heard as part of this budget 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee met with Canadians from all walks of life. 
While it is important that we meet from time to time with the 
leaders of national organizations, we also met with grassroots 
Canadians across the country.  One of the things they said loudly 
and clearly is that they do not want quick fixes.  Canadians want 
us to operate on prudent estimates.  They want us to use 
realistic targets which are reflected in the finance committee's 
recommendation that the government continue to employ a 
contingency reserve by setting aside $3 billion per year. As at 
present, the contingency reserve should be used to fund neither 
increased program spending nor tax cuts but that it should go 
toward the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a survey in my constituency of Kitchener Centre.  Eighty 
per cent of respondents indicated that the government needs to 
work on paying down our national debt.  We must be attentive to 
this issue.  Our committee also recommended that the government 
establish a long term target for a sustainable debt to GDP ratio. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT60"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT60"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we heard Canadians say “Give us realistic targets so that 
we can move forward in a measured pace”.  This government has 
demonstrated its ability to do that by paying down the deficit 
and we are now ready to take on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our committee also recommended the establishment of an interim 
debt to GDP ratio, a target of 50% to 60%, that should be 
achieved in this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I heard about from my constituents in Kitchener 
Centre was the lowering of personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring the finance committee had the opportunity to deal 
with the Mintz report which looked at Canada's corporate tax 
structure as compared to the other G-8 countries.  While the 
report did make some recommendations, it also pointed out that 
our corporate tax system is in the mid-range of other G-8 
countries, roughly where we would hope to target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our payroll taxes in comparison to other G-8 countries, despite 
what we read in the media, are on the low side.  As a matter of 
fact this government has in four consecutive moves lowered EI 
premiums to the point where as of January 1 of this year they 
were lowered to $2.55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas where we need to be attentive is in our 
personal income taxes.  That is something the finance committee 
suggested we look at as we can afford to do it.  Again, it has to 
be a change that is sustainable and one that Canadians can count 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across this country in every province we heard concerns 
regarding health care, the universality of our health care system 
as well as the standards of our health care system.  It is that 
message that the finance committee carried forward in 
recommendation 17, recommending that the government strengthen 
its involvement in health care by further increasing the cash 
floor by $1 billion starting in 1999 to the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we add money and help to give a federal 
presence and federal leadership in health care.  But the problems 
facing health care are far greater than merely money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously I served at other levels of government as well as on 
a district health council.  I know that health care, not only in 
Ontario, in Kitchener Centre, but across this nation is changing. 
It is evolving from an institutionally based health care system 
to a preventive health care system.  We need to look at how we 
fund health care.  It is not just a matter of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard in many communities, my own included, that we need 
to be attentive to the issues of both home care and pharmacare. 
But again I hear the people of Canada asking for a vision, for a 
strategic plan, not just merely dumping money on problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 19 recommends that the federal government fund 
health care research and that this research money be doubled. 
This should be achieved within five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of standards of reporting in health care is very 
popular and certainly something which Canadians are interested in 
seeing.  A demonstration that has benchmarks so that we can 
measure the kind of health care we as Canadians enjoy needs to 
have the kind of research and statistics behind it in order to 
make those yardsticks meaningful.  Funding to medical research 
will help to get us halfway there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee also heard that research, not only on 
behalf of government but to encourage the Canadian private sector 
to enter this important industry, needs to be encouraged.  It is 
on that note that we suggested the networks of centres of 
excellence program have their funding raised as well as 
technology partnerships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community that I represent was largely manufacturing in its 
historic base.  I see that base evolving.  My community is 
looking for highly skilled technical workers.  These are the 
workers who will be needed to partner with business in the next 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also recommended that the government enhance its 
financial support for the National Research Council.  There are 
two universities and community colleges in my riding.  There is 
talk about the brain drain.  Giving funding to research and 
especially the granting councils because of the peer review 
aspect is the way not only to enhance research and the end 
product, but also the way to create a milieu where we will keep 
the best and brightest in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is an issue that I heard about across Canada.  It is an 
issue I care about deeply and certainly one that I have heard 
about in my community.  We are trying to address this issue 
through some of the recommendations in the budget.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that we build on the 1998 measures 
which increased the basic personal amount and spousal amount by 
$500 to again increase it this year by a further $200, bringing 
the amount to $700 of additional income that can be earned tax 
free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also recommended that we increase the basic 
personal and spousal amount by $500 for lower income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also suggested that we continue to take away the 3% surcharge 
which was partially taken off in last year's budget, and it is an 
issue of credibility that we now do it for earners above the 
$30,000 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the government reintroduce 
indexation when the fiscal situation improves.  In the meantime, 
measures should be taken to offset the impact of deindexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measurable, predictable actions of this government are what has 
put this nation on a stable footing.  It is essential that we 
continue down the path that looks at the impacts of global and 
domestic trends and that we respond to the evolution of health 
care and our social system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be a member of the finance committee that 
brought forward what I think is a very thoughtful, 
forward-looking prebudget document. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate with colleagues on both 
sides of the House today in this prelude to the upcoming 1999 
federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I lead into my remarks, which will be made within the shared 
time, I cannot help but think back to the way things were just a 
few years ago when I was first elected to this House in 1988. 
The backdrop of how we got here from there is still important to 
Canadians.  It is still important to all of us who understand how 
we got here from there as we try to lay out some kind of 
framework, some kind of direction on where we will go from here, 
what kind of leadership we will exhibit and where we will try to 
lead our Canadian economy within the ability that a federal 
budget can offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concedes of course that a government budget will not always 
be able to provide leadership and direction in all elements of 
the economy.  We do not run the entire economy from our desks 
here in the House of Commons, nor does the ministry of finance 
run the entire economy from its ministerial offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately seven years ago we had the recession of 1992.  I 
remember that it was supposed to be a difficult year.  It turned 
out to be for Canadians a very difficult three years.  It was not 
a one-year cyclical recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were reasons for that.  The cyclical recession of 1992 was 
exacerbated by several other economic circumstances, each of 
which was chosen by the government of the day as part of a policy 
option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they were not selected to exacerbate the recession.  They 
were selected because they were seen as necessary.  Some of it 
was necessary medicine.  Some of it was just the right time to 
implement policy.  However, it turns out to have been poor 
timing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that our colleague from the Progressive Conservative 
Party made reference to choices made by the Progressive 
Conservative government in the very early nineties which perhaps 
in some way laid some of the groundwork for our economy.  Some of 
those decisions that were taken did lay the groundwork.  As I say 
this, one has to remember that the timing was actually atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In opposition I and my colleagues did not spare the government 
at all in our criticism, as much because of the timing as for its 
effect on Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>High interest rate policies were pursued by the Bank of Canada. 
The timing was awful.  High interest rates mean high 
unemployment.  At the time of the recession the bank decided it 
would squeeze and crush inflation out of the Canadian economy. 
The timing was all wrong.  It succeeded ultimately, but at a very 
high cost to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government decided to implement a new GST, replacing the 
earlier MST.  However, there are economic costs in implementing a 
new tax like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were adjustments to the free trade agreement.  Those 
adjustments would have to have been paid in any event, but those 
adjustments, in terms of employment losses, occurred right at the 
time of the recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the hopelessly out of control government spending 
of the day that ran deficits from $25 billion to $42 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these factors exacerbated that very difficult recession 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember talking to constituents.  Most of us in this House 
have dealt with constituents who have been in difficult personal 
situations.  Some were unemployed.  I remember saying “This is 
just a cyclical recession.  It will be over in a few months or a 
year.  Don't worry, the jobs will come back”.  However, that 
situation persisted for several years at a very high cost to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it all ended, sometime in 1993, 1994 or 1995, as fate would 
have it Canadians elected Liberals in October 1993.  Our first 
order of business was to deal with the deficit.  We adopted a 
plan, a process which was called a program review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were tax adjustments.  There were effective tax increases 
at the time.  They were modest, but nonetheless they were 
increases.  The revenues increased, expenditures went down and we 
ended up balancing our Canadian budget approximately one year 
ahead of schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now entering a second or third year in which we will have 
a surplus.  The result of that backdrop has produced a situation 
that is described as “good fundamentals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can take the credit for it?  Certainly those who were in 
government.  As a government member I will ask Canadians to give 
us credit for dealing with the deficit.  I think they have given 
us credit for that, notwithstanding the desire of members 
opposite to discount that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other things occurred.  Interest rates came down, in part 
because of government action, but in part as well because of 
market reaction to other economic factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our interest rates now are the lowest in 25 or 30 years.  Our 
inflation is down to the lowest it has been in 25 or 30 years. 
That is very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free trade agreement then became the North American Free 
Trade Agreement.  We have adjusted to that and we are now seeing 
the benefits of jobs and exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our balance of trade has been in positive territory for a long 
time.  Our current account, which moved into positive territory a 
couple of years ago, is now slightly under and is heading back 
toward positive territory.  That is all very healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit is gone.  We are now faced with the difficult 
problem of how high taxes should be and what kind of a surplus 
there should be.  Certainly we want balanced books.  Maybe there 
should not be a surplus.  Maybe there should just be a balance. 
Then we would not need to argue about a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the finance minister's prudent planning we are facing 
small surpluses this year and next year.  That allows all of us 
to happily debate over what targets the surplus should be 
directed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has undertaken to use the surplus in three 
areas.  It will use it to pay down the debt, which was sitting at 
around $583 billion and has now been paid down in modest amounts 
to $570-some billion. 
That may be small progress with a billion here and a billion 
there but pretty soon it adds up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is growing at the same time, which means that our 
national debt to GDP ratio is dropping.  This is the measuring 
stick most economists use in looking at our ability to sustain 
and carry a debt.  That ratio is now poised to drop below 50%. It 
was riding up toward 60% at one point.  We are now headed below 
50%, which is positive territory for us.  We have to deal with 
debt management.  Like it or not it is there and we have some 
bills to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will have to restore the effectiveness of our social 
programs.  There is more than one way to do that.  Spending money 
properly is one way as well as sustaining them and making sure 
there is enough money to deliver on our objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is tax reduction.  In the last budget the government began 
to deliver tax reductions in modest amounts.  These reductions 
are showing up at the low end of the income scale.  This time I 
as one member of parliament would like to see tax reductions 
spread right through the economic spectrum.  In its report the 
finance committee mentioned the surtax which is still a part of 
income taxation at the federal level.  My constituents and I 
would like to see that addressed seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this is my 
opportunity to speak to the prebudget debate.  I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to criticize a government in power on a big issue 
like health.  I intend not to do too much of that today.  I will 
go over the record of the Liberal government on health and then I 
will go to the comments of some people in the country as to what 
they think rather than what I think on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was around for the red book.  I saw the promises in the red 
book.  The red book promised to preserve and protect medicare and 
to have a national forum on this issue to be chaired by the Prime 
Minister.  The public took those promises at face value and I 
expected those promises would be kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have preserve and protect ended up meaning?  Over the last 
three years it has meant $16.5 billion in cumulative cuts.  It 
has meant 188,000 people today on a waiting list for surgical 
procedures.  Over the last two years 1,400 of my colleagues who 
were trained in Canada and who practised in Canada have left this 
country never to return.  My latest information is that half the 
medical school students in Canada are now being trained to 
replace those who are leaving.  Those are straightforward facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go over what a couple of Canadians have said to me 
recently on this issue.  This letter is from somebody who lives 
in the town in which I practised medicine for over 20 years, a 
hospital in which I gave this kind of care.  She wrote to me 
saying that on December 15, 1998 she slipped on the ice in front 
of her home, a fall that caused multiple fractures to her right 
ankle.  She immediately went to the emergency ward at the High 
River hospital where she received quick, caring and responsive 
attention.  As the break was significant the decision was made to 
transport her to the Rockyview hospital in Calgary where she, as 
well as the High River hospital personnel, were under the 
impression that the surgery would be performed that evening as 
arrangements had been made by telephone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went to Rockyview.  The surgery was not performed on the 
Tuesday.  She was reassured the surgery would likely be performed 
on the Wednesday.  This was not the case.  She was kept on 
morphine without seeing a doctor until Friday.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday she asked “Where is my doctor?”  He came and told 
her that he would try to do the surgery that day but that some 
people in her condition had waited up to two weeks before they 
could find the time and operating space to perform this 
operation.  She went on to say that luckily she had the surgery 
that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is absolutely unacceptable in a country like Canada.  That 
would have been so unheard of when I started my practice that the 
patient would have come to me and said “Grant, that is 
malpractice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think of what she did for those four days.  She lay there 
with the swelling in her ankle worse.  She lay in pain on 
morphine.  She did not see a clinician.  She saw only the nurses, 
nurses doing wonderful work.  It was unacceptable.  She asked me 
why this was happening in a country like Canada.  I leave that to 
my colleagues across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a letter from somebody in Qualicum Beach, B.C.  I 
picked two letters from the west because they were closest to my 
home.  I get letters like these from every part of the country, 
from every province and every jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This individual addressed the letter to the Minister of Health. 
He watched an interview with the minister on January 17 on the 
CTV program <I>Sunday Edition</I>.  He stated that the minister's 
comments had generated a few questions.  I will not go through 
them all.  I will go to the last and the main question.  It is 
the individual's understanding that the federal government 
contributions toward health care in Canada had been reduced $6 
billion per year.  He asked if this correct was correct.  If so, 
he asked, why has the government seen fit to increase taxes in 
over 35 areas during this same period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated that it appeared the finance minister's so-called 
balanced budget had been to a large extent achieved through 
reductions to health care and through increased taxes, not 
through what he wanted them to do, which was to decrease 
government waste and a severely bloated bureaucracy.  He went on 
to bemoan the fact that health care would be the place that the 
Liberals chose to cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a politician.  This is not somebody with a vested 
interest other than the fact that some day he may be sick.  These 
letters are coming like a blizzard to my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the nurses say?  They are writing to me and asking me to 
put questions on the floor of the House of Commons in question 
period.  The first question from RNs in Alberta was: Is the 
government aware that Canadians' health and well-being are being 
affected by an impending shortage of registered nurses?  They 
await an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supplementary question was:  Is the government prepared to 
invest in the future health of Canadians by investing in nurses. 
They are saying that the percentage of money going to nurses has 
dropped, that there is a recruitment problem, and that nurses 
will not go to college to become nurses any more because of these 
horror stories.  They ask whether the health minister knows that 
qualified RNs are no longer able to deliver safe health care for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Canada's physicians say?  I am just one lone voice. They 
have an association that involves all health care workers in 
Canada.  I have never seen such unanimity on an issue.  They are 
saying the federal Liberal health care cuts are dreadfully wrong. 
I will not read what they say.  It is very obvious what they say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to criticize, is it not?  An opposition politicians 
can stand over here and berate the government for what it has 
done.  I would like to take a bit of a constructive approach then 
and say what the government should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we need stable funding for medicare.  The health minister 
said today Reform would not put any more money into medicare.  I 
do not know where he has been.  I would like to give his head a 
shake.  Let me give him the information:  $6 billion over the 
next three years is our proposal, to be reinfused directly into 
medicare.  New spending, not a chance; repriorized old spending. 
That is the difference.  These guys only look for new spending. 
We do not need new spending.  They are spending on areas they 
should never be spending on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need a thorough review of medicare.  I had someone on 
the phone just a few moments ago who said the wagon needed to be 
stopped and looked at, that funding alone would not fix medicare 
problems.  That is true.  We need to put the patient first. 
Today the bureaucrat, the politician and the medical profession 
are first in medicare.  The patient is not first, and that must 
change.  We need to put more accent on prevention.  Also, the 
government has been very harsh on natural health products.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have talked a lot about hepatitis C.  We need to have, 
and this is a commitment, a billion dollars of new money put into 
hepatitis C compensation.  I want to spend a moment on hepatitis 
C, a topic which is very timely.  Parliament has not been sitting 
for a couple of months and there have been some real significant 
developments in the hepatitis C area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the Arkansas prison connection.  Many of us in the 
country watched a TV show which showed a direct connection 
between Canadian regulators and dirty prison blood from Arkansas 
and Louisiana.  The RCMP should be looking at that information. 
There was criminal activity in the hepatitis C issue in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A big compensation package has just been announced for one small 
group of infected Canadians.  The Hepatitis C Society says it is 
unacceptable and inadequate.  It has major problems with it.  It 
is advising the public not to accept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very healthy to look at what is happening in other 
countries on hepatitis C.  This is brand new information. 
Switzerland has just charged the Swiss blood agency with 
endangering the lives of hemophiliacs.  It looks like people will 
go to jail in Switzerland.  Italy has just ruled that the 
ministry of health must pay compensation to everyone infected by 
hepatitis C, not just a few.  In France people are in jail.  The 
prime minister and health minister in France have both been 
charged.  In Canada we have zip.  We do not have anything going 
on except a few dollars being offered to a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prebudget debate on health care is not over.  The government 
says it will reinvest the pittance it will put in of $1 billion, 
$2 billion or $3 billion, until just before the next election 
when it will say it is okay to have angina and give back the 
money it took.  That is not acceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened this morning as the chairman of the 
finance committee delivered his prebudget speech.  Once I had 
listened for awhile I had no doubt that it was written by the 
finance minister's office, much in the same way as the activities 
of the finance committee and the witnesses that were called were 
organized by the finance minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to his report I wondered what finance committee he 
was travelling with.  I was also on that finance committee and on 
most of the things that he was saying this morning I was hearing 
quite the opposite.  As we travelled across the country we heard 
a loud and fervent cry for tax relief from average working 
Canadians, small businesses, professionals and large businesses. 
Everyone out there wants tax relief.  The government has been the 
instrument that has led them to seek tax relief because over the 
last five and a half years the government has increased taxes 
somewhere in the range of 36, 37 or 38 times in the billions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Minister of Finance stands and crows about balancing 
the budget which is not true, and I will talk about that next, 
for any increase in revenue he has just pulled his magic tax 
lever and the money has just flowed out of the pockets of working 
Canadians.  The average Canadian family has seen their household 
disposable income decrease by over $3,000 since 1993.  What kind 
of treatment is that for hardworking Canadians who are trying to 
have a better standard of living for themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set the tone by laying out exactly where we stand as 
Canadians in the tax system with which the government has 
burdened us compared with some of our neighbours, in particular 
our G-7 partners. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The personal income tax burden on Canadians is a full 56% higher 
than the other members of the G-7 countries.  The corporate 
income tax burden in Canada is 9% higher than the average of our 
G-7 partners.  These are countries that we compete with. Canada 
also has the highest property tax burden in all the OECD 
countries.  Of the 33 countries, Canada ranks highest in property 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the average Canadian family paid a total tax bill of 
$21,242, 46% of their gross income.  This is more than they pay 
for food, shelter and clothing combined which is around $17,000. 
Picture it. The average Canadian family with a couple of kids, a 
house, a mortgage, a steady job sees $21,000 a year go out in 
taxes and about $17,000 go out in shelter, food and the basics of 
life.  That is disgusting for a country with the potential that 
Canada has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last five and a half years there have been wage 
increases for Canadian workers.  They have worked hard for them. 
Their companies have worked hard to improve their bottom line and 
they have rewarded their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to those wage increases because of the Liberal 
government's tax policies?  The government has taxed back over 
150% of any wage increases that the average Canadian worker got. 
Imagine. If workers got a $100 increase, the government taxed 
back $150.  If they got $1,000 increase over the last five and a 
half years, the Liberal government taxed back $1,500.  If they 
got a $10,000 increase over the last five and a half years, the 
government taxed back $15,000.  How do we get ahead in this 
country when we have a government that wants to rip out of our 
pockets not only what we get in a wage increase but more.  It is 
a sad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canadians need tax relief.  There is no doubt 
about it.  As the committee travelled across the country we heard 
the call for real tax relief, not just tinkering around with the 
surtax like the Liberals have done in the past.  Canadians want 
real tax relief, something they can hold in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that we should not believe the finance minister 
when he talks about balancing the budget.  The fact is that this 
finance minister may say he has a balanced budget but the money 
he has used to make up that budget is the EI surplus which he has 
taken out of the pockets of working Canadians.  He has used the 
pension funds of the federal civil service.  He has taken that 
and has put that against the deficit.  All he has done is 
borrowed within the family and he says he has a balanced budget. 
He does not have a balanced budget.  He is still about $16 
billion or $17 billion short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the economy takes a downturn in the next couple of years, 
those EI funds are going to be needed.  Where are they?  They are 
in new spending programs the government has introduced, $3 
billion last year and another $3 billion this year.  What ever 
happened to the promise by the government and the finance 
minister to hold the line on spending?  No new spending.  It just 
ain't true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the EI fund.  There is about $20 billion in EI 
surplus.  Before the Christmas break we talked about how the EI 
commission has said that a $15 billion surplus would be fine.  It 
would provide not only sustainability for the fund but also a 
rainy day fund in case the economy took a dramatic downturn.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also said that any finance minister who really cared 
would probably want to return the $5 billion or $6 billion excess 
in the form of premium reductions to the people who were paying 
it.  Has that happened?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister continues to rape and pillage the EI 
surplus fund, to build his surplus to fund his increased spending 
programs, to enhance his opportunity to become the leader of the 
Liberal Party.  One has to wonder whether the finance minister 
has the best interests of Canadians at heart or his own best 
interests at heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier my colleague from Macleod talked about the crisis in 
health care.  We have a crisis. Over 180,000 people are on 
waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a true story from my riding. A neighbour of mine had 
been experiencing some severe chest pains and shortage of breath 
for a number of months.  He went to his doctor who tried to get 
him to a specialist in Vancouver.  Of course there are no 
specialists in Prince George, we cannot afford it.  He went to a 
specialist in Vancouver and had an angiogram.  It was determined 
that he has one artery completely blocked so an angioplasty 
cannot be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next option is a bypass. In the old days a single bypass was 
a routine procedure.  These days there is no money for a single 
bypass.  Two, three or four bypasses are needed before someone 
can get into the operating room.  That man was sent home in pain, 
in the same situation he was in when he went to Vancouver.  He 
was told “We cannot do anything for you.  Get another artery 
clogged and maybe we can look at you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the state of health care in this country. It is because 
the Liberal government has ripped the heart out of health care. 
Since 1993 it has taken out over $7 billion.  When is it going to 
put something substantial back and help Canadians who have 
serious health problems? 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this debate there has been the odd mention from time 
to time of the issue of bracket creep.  This issue is close to my 
heart and is something I would like to use my time to discuss.  I 
do not think many people really understand this issue. This is a 
cancer which exists within our taxation system.  It is as deadly 
as a cancer because it has crept through our taxation system in a 
slow and insidious way. It was ironic to hear the Conservative 
member talk about going back to our old ways because we have to 
go far back to understand how this insidious cancer became part 
of our taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1984 the then Conservative government stated that it 
would not allow indexation of tax credits and tax exemptions to 
occur unless inflation exceeded 3%. Back in 1984 the rate of 
inflation was 10%, so obviously people were getting a degree of 
relief, that is that portion which exceeded 3% at that time. 
There was very little debate about the issue of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today we note that it is the stated policy of the Bank 
of Canada to keep our inflation rate within a narrow band between 
one and two percentage points.  Needless to say because inflation 
is less than 3%, there is no indexation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this all mean to the average taxpayer?  Let us say 
that someone earned about $2,000 a month in 1992 and that person 
paid $800 in rent.  By 1998, assuming they had kept up with 
inflation and indeed a lot of people have not been able to do 
even that, their income would have risen to $2,360 and their rent 
would have been $944.  The reality is of course that that person 
is no better off.  The dollars they bring into their household 
buy less goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada taxes this incremental increase as if it were 
real income.  In this case the tax may be as much as 50% or $180 
per month for something that quite frankly has never happened. 
In real terms their income did not rise and the dollars will not 
buy even the same amount of goods because we have implemented a 
tax on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give another example which is a practical one, a family with 
two dependants from 1992 to 1997 saw their income rise by $900, 
but their income taxes actually went up $1,400.  This is the 
double compound effect which is known as bracket creep. These are 
not wealthy people.  They are not the idle rich.  They are in 
fact middle to low income earners.  We should be ashamed of what 
we are doing to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on the truly high income earner is almost negligible. 
As one's income gets very high, personal exemptions are less and 
less of concern because they represent such a small quantum of 
deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done a number of graphs on this.  They show that there is 
about $840 million worth of revenue we bring in to our coffers 
from this insidious tax called the bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect of bracket creep is that it creates a burden 
for people.  Indeed we can look at marginal rates of tax.  I will 
give a quick explanation of what a marginal tax rate is.  It is 
that tax on an extra dollar of income, not on the dollars that 
one has already paid or may have been eligible for, but the extra 
dollar that one pays tax on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to bracket creep, over the years we have slowly 
amplified this marginal tax bracket on low income earners who go 
from basically paying no tax—people who earn under $8,000 a year 
are not taxed—to paying some tax.  Suddenly, not only do we get 
the normal taxation coming into effect but we also have the 
problem of bracket creep.  As a consequence income earners 
earning approximately $20,000 suddenly find themselves earning an 
extra dollar which costs them 50 cents on the dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the impact this has on many low income families. The 
reality is that it is very difficult for them to get out of their 
so-called poverty trap.  I do not have to remind the House that 
Statistics Canada regards the low income cutoff of $20,000 to be 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a phone call from a constituent the other day.  He told me 
how he had become disabled and earned only $12,000 a year. 
Miraculously he was able to get a part time job and double his 
income to $24,000. When he looked at his take home pay, he 
quickly came to the realization that he had hardly progressed at 
all. I told him that he suffered from bracket creep but I had not 
been able to come up with a cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are not versed on the virtues of fundamental 
economics but they know something is terribly wrong.  From low 
income seniors to the working poor we are fleecing them to the 
tune of $840 million a year, $840 million of tax money on income 
that never happened.  It is a tax illusion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind this House that a voluntary tax compliance system is 
operable only when people believe the system is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have suggested a piecemeal approach to this such as giving 
increased child tax credits and other benefits directed at this 
group.  This is just what it entails, a piecemeal approach, a 
band-aid to cover a cut when the wound is still infected.  Put 
them back on the treadmill for a few more years and this 
insidious aspect of bracket creep will catch up to them again. 
This may be the expedient solution but it is certainly not the 
right solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month we read of the survey on Canada as reported by the 
OECD. It had some alarming conclusions about the Canadian 
economy.  It stated that our standard of living would likely 
decline so much so that by 2015 Canada's standard of living would 
be lower than the average of all OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons for this but I would like to read one of 
them, which is that indexation has pushed 1.4 million low income 
individuals on to the tax rolls over the 10 year period ending in 
1998.  Over 1.9 million individuals have been pushed from the 
lowest marginal tax bracket to the middle bracket while 600,000 
were pushed from the middle to the higher income brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a remarkable time.  People's income is not 
increasing.  Indeed it is declining.  Taxes are going up. Savings 
are being reduced and people are turning more and more to 
consumer credit just to stay afloat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal credit is reaching alarming levels made only possible 
by lower interest rates.  One hundred and sixteen per cent of 
disposable income now goes toward personal debt.  This is 
unhealthy.  A country that cannot save and maintain its level of 
disposable income is a country that is not progressing but on the 
decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have suggested other methods to reduce taxes, for instance 
the 3% surtax.  This will affect people with incomes in excess of 
$50,000.  One of my dreams for our budgetary process is to 
adequately address the issue of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope in the short period of time I have had I have been able 
to enlighten if not all at least some of our members of 
parliament and some of the people watching us of what is meant by 
bracket creep and how it affects the average income earner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that one of the things we will be able to address in this 
budget is some move to eliminating the whole concept of bracket 
creep.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise on this pre-budget debate.  As a member of the 
finance committee I have had the opportunity to travel across 
Canada with the committee to consult with Canadians and to hear 
from a broad cross-section of groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee invited many of the groups to come before 
it to discuss the application of our budget surplus.  The groups 
were asked in all cases to come to the finance committee  with 
their national priorities so we could report to the House and the 
finance minister how we should approach Canada's fiscal 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear that notwithstanding the request, many of the 
groups that came before the finance committee preferred to deal 
with their own priorities in isolation rather than the overall 
national interest.  It does pose some difficulty to the finance 
committee in terms of forming a consensus as to what Canadians 
believe when so many groups come before the finance committee and 
speak on behalf of their special interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One which concerned me at the time and still does was the 
intervention by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.  This group 
obviously represents major business and industry across the 
country.  It came before us with some scenarios of how that 
surplus should be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with the House what the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce felt we should do with the surplus, the so-called fiscal 
dividend.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first item was that 50% of any total surplus should be 
applied against the national debt.  The second was to reduce EI 
premiums by 15 cents.  The third was to eliminate the 3% general 
surtax completely.  The fourth was to increase basic personal 
exemptions by $500 for all taxpayers.  The fifth was to increase 
RRSP contribution limits by an additional $1,000 bringing it up to 
$14,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth item was to introduce indexing of RRSP contributions 
so that the amount of contributions could rise over time.  The 
seventh was to fully index personal income tax brackets and 
credits to the CPI over the medium term.  The eighth item was to 
increase the foreign content of RRSPs to 30% from the current 20% 
and the last item was that there should be no new government 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the written submissions and oral testimony given by the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce there was not one mention of health 
care. This concerned me.  It is reflective of the kinds of things 
the finance committee dealt with. It had to segregate those 
narrow interests of the wish list of particular groups and try to 
put them in the context of a national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was of concern to me and I raised it at the time at the 
finance committee.  I referred to it as the presentation from Oz. 
This was a presentation that demonstrated that they had the brain 
to figure out all these details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also had the courage to list nine items, each of which would 
benefit the highest income earners of Canada but not every 
taxpayer in Canada. It was skewed or biased on behalf of the 
highest income earners in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had brains.  It had courage. But what this proposal did not 
have was a heart.  We need a budget that has heart.  We need a 
budget from the finance minister that has the brains to figure 
out the priorities, to make sure the important priorities of 
health care, debt reduction, income tax reduction and social 
conscience are reflected in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said before the finance committee about a subject 
near and dear to my heart, child poverty. Child poverty is a 
convenient political synonym for the broader issue of family 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have through Statistics Canada an instrument called LICO, low 
income cut off.  It establishes levels of income given population 
areas, whether urban or rural, and the number of persons within a 
family.  That has been used from time to time to be the measure 
of poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada will clearly state that we do not have a 
poverty level established in Canada.  It is something that we 
have refused to do and I find it really important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the House of Commons dealt with a motion to deal with 
the elimination of so-called child poverty by 2000, a motion 
tabled by Ed Broadbent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Broadbent was in the House on his last day as a member of 
parliament.  He was leaving the place.  Most of the dialogue was 
giving tribute to Mr. Broadbent.  Those who had the guts to talk 
about child poverty were talking about food, shelter and 
clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we talk about child poverty and listen to advocacy groups 
talking about child poverty. One person, when asked for a symptom 
of child poverty, cited as an example a case where a child would 
not be able to go to a birthday party because they could not 
afford a good enough gift.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at that point that I recognized child poverty had become 
defined in a way that is much different from the perception and 
concerns of Canadians.  I raised the point with the finance 
minister that a measure of poverty in Canada is important, not 
relative poverty which is what LICO is, but real poverty.  If 
Canadians understood there are people who do not have the food, 
the shelter or the clothing they need then we would not be so 
desensitized to the seriousness of this problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers have become so large and so fuzzy in terms of what 
constitutes poverty in Canada, I believe Canadians have become 
desensitized.  I also believe that groups like the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce have become desensitized to the seriousness 
of that issue simply because of definitions and soft numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the health regime we have concerns about social poverty. 
In Canada 25% of children enter adult life with significant 
social or behavioural problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had many initiatives suggesting that we have to address 
these from the standpoint of prevention because each and every 
Canadian must pay for the cost of dealing with children with 
problems after they have them.  If we can get a better balance 
between prevention and remedial action all Canadians stand to 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current Income Tax Act we have the child care expense 
deduction which is up to $7,000 for a preschool child.  As all 
members know, the deduction is worth more to high income earners 
versus low.  It is my recommendation that the finance minister 
convert the child care expense deduction to a refundable tax 
credit and make it available to all families with children 
regardless of whether they are working at home or in the paid 
labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are some issues beyond basic fiscal issues.  It 
is the health of our children and the social deficit in Canada 
that we also have to address.  We must have a budget with brains, 
courage and, most important, a heart. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was very interested in the member's comments about people in 
the lower income area.  He would be aware that this government in 
its wisdom chooses to tax at a very high rate, for example, a 
family of four earning $30,000 a year.  Those people are still 
paying at least $4,000 a year in federal taxes. He should know 
that under the Reform proposal we would fundamentally eliminate 
those taxes at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member not understand the simple mathematics in 
this case?  If the government is to continue to extract these 
kinds of taxes from people at the low end and then turn around 
and give them back meagre pittances, meagre portions, meagre 
initiatives, why does he not understand that dollars left in the 
hands of those people, where those people at the low end of the 
scale get to make the decisions for their family, are far more 
productive than taking those dollars away and in turn turning 
around and giving them back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that since the Liberals came to power in 1993 
they have taxed back 155% of all wage increases.  It has not paid 
to have a wage increase under the Liberals.  Why does he not 
recommend to his finance minister to leave the money in the hands 
of the people who need the money rather than extracting it from 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member would broaden 
his thinking a bit I think he would understand the issue better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A family of four earning with $30,000 of taxable income pays 
19.26% of income tax.  What he has also failed to recognized is 
that family of four is also eligible to receive non-taxable 
benefits such as the GST credit, property and sales tax credits, 
the child tax benefit, the national child benefit and other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he would take all those things into account I think he would 
see very clearly that for low income people who get non-taxable 
benefits, if he incorporated those in, the tax burden on a family 
of four making $30,000 is less than 10%. 
I would be happy to sit down with the member and work out the 
issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to raise the non-refundable tax credit to which many 
refer as the first $6,500 tax exemption, it would mean that more 
Canadians would be able to earn income and not be taxed.  The 
member also has to remember that people with means, people with 
high family incomes who work casually and have some part time or 
on the side activities, can benefit by increasing that exemption. 
We cannot target those in need by raising the lowest level at 
which they start to be taxed.  We have to balance the need to 
target those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member may well know changes in the Tax Act take place 
very seldom and very slowly, but the philosophy behind it is that 
it is not just poor people who make $6,500 a year.  It is people 
who have some investment income because they split income with a 
spouse who is not working.  There are other situations where high 
income working families have casual income they transfer to other 
family members and on which they do not pay taxes in terms of a 
family situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the point is not to raise it on an across the board basis 
so that more Canadians get an increase, which is a very expensive 
proposition.  Why do we not simply look for ways to target tax 
benefits to those in most need.  I believe that is what the 
member has in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker,the member has unwittingly made 
my point.  He is an accountant. His explanation, as eloquent as 
it is, is proof positive of how totally mixed up, convoluted, 
thick and unworkable the Tax Act is presently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about putting money back into the hands of low 
income people.  From the point of view of the sheer volume of the 
words that he just gave us, I do not understand his answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member should listen 
once again.  If we were to raise the non-refundable tax credit by 
$1,000, that $1,000 tax credit would be equivalent to $250 in the 
pocket.  He does not understand that an additional $250 in the 
pocket would be for each and every taxpayer in Canada regardless 
of their level of income because every Canadian is entitled to 
the non-refundable tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member understands that it costs a lot to give every 
taxpayer $250, would it not be better to find a way to give those 
in need, the lowest income Canadian, the benefit of $500 by not 
giving it to everybody across the board?  That is the point I do 
not think the member has understood.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate on the report of the Standing Committee 
on Finance on pre-budget consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I was pleased and I am pleased to take part, but perhaps 
not happy to enter into the debate to once again try to show the 
government how wrong it is and how it is building a surplus on 
the backs of the most disadvantaged, the sick, the poor and the 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report marks the start of a new age, that of Liberal 
arrogance raised to new heights. 
The Bloc Quebecois vigorously dissociates itself from the 
Liberal report, which is nothing more than a semblance of 
democracy, than propaganda by the Minister of Finance.  The 
report is centralizing and makes a mockery of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the number of measures announced in health care and 
education, we are guessing that the secret wish of the Liberals 
is to govern a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report by the Liberal majority says that only the Liberal 
government is right and that Quebeckers and Canadians appearing 
before the committee were wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report by the Liberal majority distorts reality in a number 
of respects, in saying that the Canadians consulted wanted the 
Minister of Finance to voluntarily hide the surpluses under the 
guise of prudence, surpluses we estimate at $15 billion for this 
fiscal year, whereas the Minister of Finance estimates them at a 
maximum of $4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, two female journalists were interviewed at a TV 
station and they commented on the pre-budget consultations.  They 
are editorial writers very well known in English Canada.  These 
women reported exactly what would appear in the budget. 
According to them also, the budget surplus was higher than what 
the Minister of Finance had said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From one week to the next, his story changes from $5 billion, to 
$3 billion, to $7 billion, but I think he has led us to believe 
it is a bit over $4 billion.  These journalists said “We are 
going to tell you what is in the next budget”, whereas normally 
a budget must be kept secret until its release. They then set 
out to tell what would be in the budget, and it was totally 
believable, because there has already been a kind of leak and 
everyone is talking about it now.  So it will be no surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is known that $3 billion will be used for debt reduction. 
Another $2 billion will go for health, provided 
the provinces bend to the will of the federal government. There 
may be $2 billion, but if the provinces refuse, wishing to 
respect the Constitution, health being a provincial 
jurisdiction, the federal government will make it just $1 
billion for the entire health system across Canada.  We call 
that blackmail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have $3 billion, maybe $2 billion for health, and another 
$2 billion, for they are going to lift the hidden tax on 
middle-income taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding these figures together, I get $7 billion, apart from the 
billion or so to be invested, or already invested, which will 
also be in the budget.  That makes a little more than what the 
Minister of Finance tells us, a bit over $4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the problems in the health system across Canada are 
essentially a result of the brutal cuts by the federal Minister 
of Finance, the $6.3 billion yearly since this government has 
been in power.  Page 64 of the Liberal report states, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By reducing the health services they provided, the provinces 
challenged one of Canada's most cherished national symbols. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the height of arrogance, when we know that the federal 
government has dumped its deficit onto the backs of the 
provinces, the sick and the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois finds it unfortunate that, when it comes to 
health, there is no mention of the social union agreement signed 
by all Canada's premiers at the meeting in Saskatoon. 
Provincial premiers are calling on the federal government to 
return to the provinces the $6.3 billion in cuts to the Canada 
social transfer.  That is not mentioned in the report.  That is 
not important.  The 10 premiers want to see social transfer 
payments back at what they were when this government came to 
office in 1994.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This money does not belong to the federal government.  It comes 
out of taxpayers' pockets so that we can have decent social 
programs, and health care is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the federal government should give the money back to the 
provinces.  That seems clear to me.  But no, cuts are made and 
the provinces left to deal with the repercussions at their 
level, while health costs continue to rise because of the ageing 
of the population and the acquisition of new technologies.  The 
provinces are told that they are running the system badly, that 
it is their fault they have been cut. 
They are told that, if they want money, they can have it, but 
only if they get down on their knees.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that those listening will understand the situation, 
because it is not acceptable. This arrogant government is 
boasting how well it looks after us.  All that matters to them 
right now is to make it into the history books.  Prime Minister 
Jean Chrétien wants visibility in everything they do.  They 
could care less about the disadvantaged, the unemployed and the 
ill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec was cut almost $2 billion annually, $1 billion of it in 
health.  In just one term in office, Jean Chrétien's policies 
have cut federal government health payments by almost half.

country in the world.” This country is the home of 1.5 million 
unemployed and another 1.5 million children living in poverty, 
yet he brags about there being no quarrels, no problems, all 
being well and harmonious between the provinces. Come on, what 
planet does he live on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of homeless people is growing, as one can see on the 
streets of Toronto. I saw it on CPAC last week. It is incredible 
to see that more and more people are forced to live on the 
street. And we do not have any program for these people. 
Yet, when travelling abroad, we claim to be living in the 
greatest country in the world, when in fact, from coast to 
coast, our health system is being dismantled because we are not 
getting the money that belongs to us as taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unacceptable, and I hope that the government and its

Standing Committee on Finance on prebudget consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a bit of background, I travelled across Canada in 1997 
to listen to people and to their recommendations on what ought 
to be in the 1997 budget. Bhat happened?  Not a thing.  People 
were made to travel, much energy and money was expended to 
listen to them, but none of their recommendations made it into 
the last budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1998, in the latest consultations, once again 
people put themselves out to appear and to tell this Minister of 
Finance what should be in the budget.  Still more surprising, 
what these people had to say did not even make it into the 
report.

what a really great job he is doing.

dollars come from.  They come first from the unwarranted cuts in 
transfers to the provinces, health care services, social 
services and education.  My colleague from Drummond could talk 
for hours about the negative effects of these cuts in health in 
all the provinces of Canada, primarily in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the money come from?  Quite simply from the fact that 
over the years the government opposite has been raising income 
tax on the middle class and the poor by not indexing tax tables. 
Where do these surpluses come from?  They come from this 
government's shameless siphoning-off of funds from the employment 
insurance fund, to which workers and employers contribute to 
create employment insurance intended to help workers in trouble. 
But they siphon the money off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Minister of Finance is lucky, for the low interest rates of 
recent years have provided him with lower debt service costs, 
allowing him to save on income tax.  The world economic 
situation has also provided the government with more revenues 
than it expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this Minister of Finance and this government have not kept 
their promises. 
They told us “We will put a stop to this shameless wastage”. 
But they have not yet done so.  They also said “We will cut 
useless and outdated programs”, but they are creating other 
useless and outdated programs, such as the millennium 
scholarships.  They are going to spend billions of dollars 
rather than give the money to the provinces so they can manage 
it efficiently.  They are continuing duplication in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report refers to a productivity covenant.  Rubbish!  This 
government should start by being effective and productive and by 
doing a good job of managing taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year I did not travel across Canada listening to what 
people had to say on the budget. 
I sat down in my riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles—I am sure you will 
not mind, Mr. Speaker, if I say hello to my constituents—and 
asked members of the general public, bank managers and 
presidents of chambers of commerce what the government should do 
with the surpluses.  They came up with three or four ideas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, there was unanimous agreement that the government 
should return the cuts in provincial transfer payments so that 
the provinces could do something about the problems caused by 
the cuts in the health, education and social services sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second suggestion was to give the middle class and the most 
disadvantaged a tax break.  This could be done by indexing the 
tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third suggestion was to improve the employment situation and 
reduce the premiums paid by employees and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the Minister of Finance pay a little visit to the 
Gaspé and New Brunswick, that he pay a little visit to seasonal 
fishers with EI problems.  He should get out and see some real 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, everyone agreed that the government should clean up its 
act, as it has been promising to do since 1993.  Everyone 
remembers the famous red book of 1993.  This government should 
not establish programs like the millennium scholarships. 
Instead it should introduce the programs needed to create jobs 
and get Canadians and Quebeckers working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what an intelligent government should be doing, not 
boasting of its achievements at the expense of the provinces and 
the poor workers of Quebec and of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is not a prebudget 1999 debate.  It really is a 
prebudget year 2000 debate.  I think we all know that the budget 
for this year is pretty well carved in stone, as it were.  We 
really should be directing the government toward what the 
government should be doing in its budget for the year 2000. 
Governments need a lot of time to prepare the budget. I think 
eight to ten months is the normal timeframe that this government 
works on in preparing its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two issues I would like the government to address in 
the course of this year in preparation for next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One pertains to charities.  I think I am well known as someone 
who has advocated very strongly that the government should reform 
the charitable sector, should create rules of transparency, 
should create better corporate governance and also should 
redefine what charities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to a supreme court ruling which came down just 
this past week.  It called upon the government no longer to rely 
on the courts to define what a charity is, but to bring the 
matter before parliament and before all Canadians to look at the 
whole issue of the not for profit sector. I am confident that the 
government has taken this issue very seriously.  I am aware 
through my own contacts that various government departments are 
working on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new issue I would like to bring before the House has to do 
with the government's relationship to the aboriginals and the 
fact that we are spending a lot of money on trying to help the 
aboriginals in all parts of the country.  There seems to be a 
problem.  We still have a widespread indication of poverty and 
hardship among aboriginals both on reserve and off reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sit on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development.  The Assembly of First Nations came before 
the committee in April this past year. It made the observation in 
its report that the average income of aboriginals was about 
$14,000 and the average income of non-aboriginal Canadians was 
around $24,000. The assembly actually made an error which it 
later corrected in correspondence and noted that the average 
income of Canadians was actually $20,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took it upon myself, as sometimes is my wont, to examine these 
figures in greater depth.  I set the Library of Parliament on the 
problem.  I wanted to know not just what the average income of 
aboriginals versus non-aboriginals was, but the average real 
economic benefit of society that is accruing to both groups of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find it very comfortable to actually look at any group 
of Canadians based on racial background, but we have this problem 
in this particular instance where the aboriginals are defined 
separately in the Constitution and they receive separate 
treatment by the Government of Canada in many respects.  That 
makes this question one which we should and can address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a few of the figures. The first figures I have are 
the average incomes.  The document which the Assembly of First 
Nations quoted from is a report produced by the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development in 1991 or 1992.  It 
deals with per capita incomes of aboriginals and non-aboriginal 
Canadians as of 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting aside is that one of the things the report notes 
is that between 1985 and 1990 the income of aboriginal persons 
rose from $10,000 to $14,000.  The precise figures are $10,833 to 
$14,198.  It is interesting to note that this is an increase over 
that period of some 31.1%, whereas over the same period the 
incomes of non-aboriginal Canadians only rose by 6.9% to $20,264. 
There are two figures, $14,198 average income per year per capita 
for aboriginals and $20,264 a year per capita for all Canadians 
including aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have something else here which is part of the Library of 
Parliament study which it did at my request.  It contains 
Statistics Canada data and various data from other very good 
sources.  It points out that as of 1992-93 total federal 
government spending on aboriginals was $6 billion and some 
change. The provincial and territorial spending was $5 billion. 
This totals $11.628 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all very well and good but this chart I have before me 
averages it out to show that per capita spending on aboriginals 
both on reserve and off reserve in 1992-93 was $15,714.  Members 
should hold this figure in their minds because this chart also 
did the same work to determine how much is spent on all Canadians 
during the same period.  When we talk about spending we are 
talking about education, income transfers, housing, health care 
and social services, everything a government does for its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average for all Canadians from the federal and provincial 
governments is $10,026 per year per capita.  Just to repeat what 
I said, all governments spend an average of $15,714 per year for 
aboriginals and all governments spend an average of $10,026 per 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to get a picture of the real situation with our 
aboriginals and with the spending of all governments on 
aboriginals, we add the figure for spending on aboriginals and 
all Canadians to the figure for income of aboriginals and all 
Canadians.  The wealth we derive from society is what we can earn 
with our own labour and what we receive in the form of social 
services from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add up those figures we find that the total per capita 
economic benefit per aboriginal is $29,912. 
The total per capita spending for all Canadians is $30,290, a 
difference of only $378.  Something is terribly wrong.  For some 
reason the total economic benefit going out to all aboriginals 
and to all Canadians is within $378.  Yet we have problems all 
across the country on and off reserves with widespread poverty 
and people living in social conditions that are an embarrassment 
to the rest of the world.  Canada has difficulty holding its head 
high when we speak of how we treat our aboriginals.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government is listening.  The problem revolves around 
not how much money we are spending in terms of benefit or how 
much income the aboriginals are getting per person.  What is 
wrong is that somewhere there is a major glitch.  The $11 billion 
as of 1993 from this government and the provincial governments is 
not getting to the people effectively.  It revolves around issues 
of accountability and re-examining the entire structure of how we 
fund the aboriginal community both on and off reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here one of the most crucial and most difficult problems 
that affects Canadians and that every Canadian should worry 
about.  I hope the government will look at my figures and 
consider what it should do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke has probably given one of 
the best accounts of the situation with aboriginal people in 
Canada today that I have heard in parliament since I came here in 
September 1997.  I cannot speak to the 1992 and 1993 statistics 
and all those things.  Figures can be twisted around so that we 
are not too sure what they actually reflect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that with the wise use of financial resources we can 
make some immediate impact for poor people both on and off 
reserve.  The accountability issue is something that poor people 
on reserves across the country have been raising.  Accountability 
is seen by the simplest explanation I have heard:  “The chief 
lives across from me in a $200,000 house.  I am living in a house 
with no running water, no sewage and very little insulation in 
some cases”.  The funding that went into reserves for housing 
has been well documented over the years.  Why do some have so 
much and some so little?  This is the funding the hon. member is 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member keep speaking to the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and pressing his government along the 
lines he spoke about today?  If he does I would be pleased to 
support him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share my 
time with the member for Mississauga West.  I thank the member 
for his very kind comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal affairs issues are very difficult because they 
involve money and the privacy of individuals.  We do not want to 
interfere and deprive people of the ability to spend money in a 
way in which they control their destiny.  As I see the problem, 
governments have been far too sensitive about that issue and have 
not required the sort of performance guarantees we require of 
other sectors of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell the member opposite that I like the government's attempt 
to bring self-government to various aboriginal communities across 
the country, provided those self-governments have the same level 
of transparency and accountability that we expect of every other 
level of government and organization in the country that is 
dependent on shareholders or the support of the people.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is moving in the right direction.  There is a lot 
of resistance.  There is a lot of fear.  There is a lot of worry 
that we will upset the aboriginal community.  However we know 
that it has not been working in the past.  In this one area of 
politics we should all be on side, on all sides of the House, to 
try to solve the problem in a compassionate and effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, seeing as we have a 
minute left I would like to ask one more question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member who just spoke see any opportunity for having an 
auditor general type of accountability for moneys that go from 
the federal government to aboriginal reserves to be used in 
common for everyone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what seems to be lacking at this time.  There is the 
lack of an independent auditor who cannot be controlled by the 
people who are handling the money, in this case the chiefs and 
the councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the problem is that we 
would require an auditor general to oversee the spending of the 
municipalities.  Basically aboriginal self-government is the 
creation of the municipalities by the federal government. They 
are not really nation states; they are really like 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real answer in my mind is to require these organization to 
have the same type of rules of disclosure that exist in something 
like the access to information act or freedom of information.  It 
is the elected people who have to determine whether a government 
at any level is doing its job properly.  If we do not have those 
rules of transparency the people will never know and cannot act 
responsibly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is delightful to be back.  I thank my hon. colleague for 
leaving me some time to discuss some of the issues around what we 
are calling prebudget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made an interesting point.  He said we were debating 
two things at this stage, given that the actual budget will be 
released in this place on February 16.  We are talking about the 
budget in the year 2000 and we are also explaining to Canadian 
people the impact the 1998 budget has had on the economy and on 
our country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard members opposite calling quite loudly for tax relief. 
It is my sense that there will be some additional tax relief in 
the budget.  I am hopeful there will be.  There was over $7 
billion in tax relief in the 1998 budget, something that members 
opposite tend to gloss over.  The Canadian people know because 
they can see it.  They can see the actual benefits they get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to share some of them with members, for example, there was 
an increase in the child tax benefit from the $850 million 
announced in the 1997 budget.  An additional $850 million was put 
into that.  That will go directly to benefiting low income 
Canadians who need assistance to go to work and to provide proper 
care for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition a caregiver credit was provided in the 1998 budget. 
We do not hear members opposite talk about its importance. We can 
think about health care and the impact on families of providing 
care giving situations to their parents or other relatives.  The 
government recognized it in 1998 as important.  To give the 
detail, a caregiver credit will reduce federal tax by up to $400 
for Canadians caring for an elderly parent or a family member 
with disabilities.  This is significant tax relief targeted to 
help people who specifically need it.  I hope we will see more of 
that kind of budgeting in the budget coming up later this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there was an exemption on GST and HST for expenses 
incurred in the provision of temporary care to someone who by 
reason of infirmity or disability needed the particular care. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we would think we would hear members in this place 
telling the Canadian people that this is good budgeting, good 
financing to help the people who need it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in that budget the Canadian opportunities strategy provided 
tax assistance for Canadians who wished to advance their 
learning.  It did a number of things.  It provided tax relief for 
interest payments on student loans.  We heard from students at 
various committees and in our offices.  They have written letters 
talking about the incredible burden of graduating from school 
with a debt burden of $25,000 or more from student loans.  We 
provided some assistance and even an opportunity, if hardship 
could be shown, where that particular interest could be written 
off entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an opportunity in the last budget for tax free RRSP 
withdrawals for lifelong learning.  In today's society with the 
downsizing and the changes that have occurred there are many 
Canadians, many of them middle income Canadians, who cry for tax 
relief.  Many Canadians have suddenly found themselves going from 
being middle income to being no income simply because they have 
been downsized, their company has changed their method of doing 
business or whatever.  In many instances they are not only middle 
income but are also middle age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This allows them an opportunity to tap into an RRSP fund that is 
available for their retirement to allow them to take courses so 
they can perhaps readjust and create new employment for 
themselves.  It is tax relief with some sense behind it to say it 
will directly benefit those people who need the help.  There is 
also an education credit and child care expense deduction for 
part time students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two budgets of the government there was a real move 
toward providing some tax relief that made sense.  It was 
targeted to help people in either adjusting their lifestyle, 
taking care of dependants who might be ill, infirm or disabled in 
some way, or helping them provide education for younger members 
of their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk in terms of the next budget perhaps we as 
parliamentarians will have some access to it.  I believe, as my 
colleague mentioned, this budget has been put to bed.  Being only 
a couple of weeks from now perhaps there are some <I>i's</I> to 
dot and <I>t's</I> to cross, but at the end of the day the budget 
policies have been hashed out in this place.  The policies have 
gone before parliamentary committees.  They have been taken to 
caucus. There has been input from Canadians.  This budget is 
probably done.  The next budget will be for the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that this is really about fighting over the 
spoils.  When the government was first elected in 1993 it walked 
into a situation where people were describing us in cities like 
New York, Washington and others around the world as a third world 
country because of the size of our deficit at $42 billion.  I 
stress the deficit being the overdraft, the deficit being the 
shortfall in the operating budget, not the debt.  It is a 
different concept.  It is important that Canadians understand 
that in 1993 the government was spending $42 billion on an 
operating basis more than it was bringing in in revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world was looking at us and saying that for the size of our 
country of 30 million people, for the size of our GDP, for the 
entire output of our nation, a $42 billion debt was unacceptable. 
We were being referred to as a third world nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does incredible damage.  It is not just the psyche and the 
problem it creates for Canadians who are proud of their country. 
Canadians continually hear others outside the country saying we 
are the greatest nation in the world.  Canadians know that but 
were very uncomfortable feeling that no one was properly managing 
the financial store. I am sad to say that I think it was true. 
The proof was in the pudding.  The reality is that the deficit 
has been eliminated and the government has retired $13 billion in 
marketable debt.  For the first time perhaps since the days of 
Mike Pearson we see in a chart that there is a downward trend in 
the debt.  There is an upward trend in the economy. Canadians are 
feeling proud not only of being from this great country with a 
health care system, quality of education, our standard of living 
and being proud of our flag, they are proud that this government 
has dedicated itself to fiscal restraint and at the same time has 
put in place opportunities to assist Canadians who need it 
through our tax relief programs.  We are going to see more of the 
same and the country will continue to grow and prosper. Canadians 
know that and they speak about it in resounding numbers every 
day.  Things are strong and will get stronger.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks from the member 
for Mississauga West when he talked about fighting over the 
spoils of the surplus budget and resounding numbers of our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know if we have watched television or read newspapers 
lately, we see there are some resounding numbers in our economy. 
Homelessness, for example, is at a record level.  It is almost a 
national disaster and it is certainly a national embarrassment. 
This is something the Liberals have been architects of, so I 
agree with the member for Mississauga West about that resounding 
number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should look at the resounding numbers of people 
living in poverty.  There are more than half a million children 
living in poverty and in hunger since 1993 than before the 
Liberals were elected.  Those are resounding numbers and they are 
resounding in the sense of absolute embarrassment of the Liberal 
government's policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hoping that in the coming budget these issues will be 
addressed.  In Regina the employment insurance benefits for 
people who deserve benefits because they are unemployed and have 
paid into the system are no longer being provided.  The worst 
record in the country is in Regina where only 19% of unemployed 
people who have paid into the employment benefit system qualify 
for benefits.  The government arbitrarily has attacked those 
people who need the insurance help the most from the employment 
insurance program.  These are resounding bad numbers of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the member for Mississauga West has to say about 
these issues which are very disastrous for the Liberal government 
and what are its plans in the budget to address the issue of 
homelessness, poverty and the unemployed who are not receiving 
the benefits they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member might find it 
surprising that I agree with him on a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a national housing crisis.  However, I separate the 
issue of housing and homelessness.  The problem of homelessness 
needs to be tied more to health.  Anyone who lives on the street 
in Canada in February is not a well person and we have to address 
issues around mental health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the cuts. The member talks about his home province. 
Let me talk about my province.  We have seen the cuts that have 
happened in mental health.  We have seen the people who are on 
the streets because the current Conservative government in the 
province of Ontario has used its 30% income tax cut and taken 
that money out of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can blame the federal government for downsizing the transfers 
to the provinces.  We have to accept collective responsibility as 
a nation for some of that.  The reality is that it is the 
provincial Government of Ontario that has closed mental health 
beds right across the province and those people find themselves 
on the street.

that all levels of government need to get back into providing a 
social housing framework that makes sense for all Canadians.  I 
will support that and I will work toward that.  If it does not 
all show up in this budget, the government will work toward 
seeing there is some equity and some housing put back in the 
marketplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the hon. member said he was proud of Canada's 
health system.  No matter where we go the health system 
throughout Canada is a national disgrace.  It is a disgrace in my 
home province.  So please do not refer with any degree of pride 
to the biggest social problem facing Canadians.  It will be a 
problem for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make that point.  I believe I heard the hon. member 
say that.  If it is not so I will withdraw that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I did not say it I 
wish I had said it.  I probably did say it.  If I recall 
correctly I said that Canadians are proud of their health care 
system.  Yes, there are problems with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite interesting to have a Reform member stand here.  We 
heard Reform's solution that 50% of the surplus would go to tax 
cuts and 50% would go to debt repayment.  I guess the third 50% 
would go to health care.  Maybe that is Reform math. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if 
no one else will pick up the cudgel then certainly I will.  I 
will speak about three things this evening, tax cuts, debt 
reduction and transfers on the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First is the issue of debt reduction which in my submission has 
been ably done by the finance minister.  We have gone from a 
situation where we had about $42 billion in deficit to a 
situation where we are now running a surplus estimated at 
anywhere between $4 billion and $8 billion.  The question is 
really one of how Canadians want to deal with the surplus which 
is their own creation, a tribute to Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am more of a debt hawk than the finance minister.  I would 
allocate more moneys to debt reduction.  I consider the debt to 
be a burden on us and our country.  To my mind the $3.5 billion 
commitment is a minimal gesture given the size of our national 
debt.  I am something of a minority in this view.  This 
commitment to steady debt reduction is a first step and is 
something the finance minister needs to be commended for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very impressed by the finance minister's ability to see the 
gross debt to GDP ratio reduced from something in the order of 
73% down to something in the order of 66% to 67%.  That is an 
amazing accomplishment, an accomplishment for which he is to be 
commended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the finance minister presents his budget I urge him to 
restate the debt so it is somewhat more comparable to our 
competition.  When those people in red suspenders from 
Switzerland, talked about by our Prime Minister, actually compare 
our debt to GDP ratio with the ratios of other countries, they 
will realize this is quite an accomplishment.  When we are more 
comparable we will achieve some savings in absolute terms on 
interest rates.  I hope that will prevent the dead loonie bounce. 
We have achieved a great deal in absolute terms in the reduction 
of the debt and I commend the finance minister on his 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the finance minister to make it very public in this 
Chamber in two weeks that we have reduced or paid off market debt 
by $13 billion this year alone.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite an accomplishment and a significant sum of money. 
This means that Canada, as a government, is no longer on debt 
reduction.  It is no longer in the market for debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The direct effect is that we will make the moneys that 
heretofore had gone for government financing available to the 
private market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was fortunate to have a conversation with Governor Thiessen on 
this very point.  He was saying that because Canada no longer 
borrows money it therefore has money available to the nation in 
general and also to private investors for corporate borrowings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, borrowing on a bond market or borrowing in debt 
instruments is a cheaper way of borrowing money than going to the 
equity markets and borrowing on the equity market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have passed on to Canadians generally a tremendous benefit to 
those who need to borrow in order to carry on the capitalization 
of their companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in and of itself is probably a bit of an unsung consequence 
of doing things right in a fiscal fashion.  This government in my 
view has done it right.  We have reduced debt in absolute terms. 
We have committed ourselves to reducing debt in a steady downward 
trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have achieved a downward trend from 73% to 66% or 67%, which 
hopefully by the end of this mandate will be either in the low 
60s or the high 50s.  That in and of itself is a tremendous 
accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on the issue of debt, I urge on the finance minister two 
things, that he restate the debt to GDP ratio in a comparative 
fashion so that it is readily comparable to our competition, and 
that he celebrate Canadians' accomplishments in the absolute 
reduction of our national debt by something in the order of $13 
billion this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now to turn to tax cuts.  If there is a budget in which to 
accomplish tax cuts, I would like to suggest this is the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the beleaguered middle class taxpayer deserves something 
of a break.  The surtax can be removed at this stage.  This was a 
tax imposed on Canadian taxpayers in order to fight the deficit. 
The fight for the deficit is now over.  Deficit reduction has 
been completed and we are now into the realm of debt reduction. 
The rationale for that tax no longer exists.  I urge the finance 
minister that this should be a priority tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, 10% of the taxpayers pay 50% of the taxes.  As 
difficult as it may seem, we need to recognize these are the 
people who carry the financial burdens of the country. When 
someone is carrying the financial burdens of the country such as 
this 10% group is they need to be recognized on this level of 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat disappointed that the finance minister found 
himself a little politically boxed in with respect to the EI cut. 
As members know, 10 cents costs the government $700 million. 
This is a shocking figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government found itself in a situation where it had to pass 
on an EI cut.  We ended up cutting 15 cents or just over $1 
billion. That in and of itself uses up room for doing other tax 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a good argument to be made that other kinds of tax cuts 
could have been done in priority to the EI cut. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT84"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT84"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we looked at a variety of charts with respect to the taxes 
that Canadians pay, consumption taxes, corporate taxes, 
employment taxes and personal taxes, we would note that as a 
general proposition we are fairly competitive with other G-7 
countries in virtually all categories, with the sole exception of 
personal taxes where we compare somewhat unfavourably with our 
nearest competitors, the Americans.  There is something in the 
order of a 4% gap between where we would like our competitive 
taxes to be and where they are presently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one would have liked that $1 billion in EI cuts to have 
been applied to personal income taxes as opposed to employment 
taxes.  A dollar is a dollar is a dollar.  However, on the other 
hand it would have been nice to have spread those dollars over a 
greater number of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additional cuts that I would like to see are in the area of 
thresholds.  I know there has been a great deal of discussion 
about bracket creep.  I suggest to hon. members opposite and 
indeed on this side of the House that bracket creep is a little 
understood concept.  However, an area that is easily understood 
is that of thresholds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our tax system, generally speaking, is fairly competitive up to 
about $60,000 or $70,000.  After that our competitiveness with 
respect to our thresholds erodes rather rapidly, in particular as 
it relates to our nearest competitors, the Americans.  While we 
cannot expect that changing thresholds will in fact solve all 
problems, the only thing the Government of Canada can control is 
the area of its taxation systems.  We cannot control how much a 
young engineer from Waterloo University might be paid by 
Microsoft versus a Toronto or a Regina based company; however, we 
can have some impact on the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I would have liked to have seen something done in the 
area of thresholds.  My suggestion would be that we move the 
highest threshold up to around $70,000 or $80,000 as the maximum 
threshold and that we move the middle threshold up from $29,000 
to about $35,000.  That, in and of itself, would provide 
considerable tax relief so that we would not be taxing Canadians 
too quickly.  If in fact the finance minister has the budgetary 
room to be able to do that, I would think that is an area which 
should be seriously explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a certain level of hypocrisy in our approach to 
this.  As we see it, we are moving ourselves from a resource 
based economy to a knowledge based economy.  When we move from a 
resource based economy to a knowledge based economy we can 
reasonably anticipate that some Canadians will do very well 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we going to expect people to put the effort into 
improving their knowledge base if in fact the tax system takes it 
out at the other end?  We need to address this as a country as we 
do our budgeting over the course of the next number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final area I would like to address has to do with the CHST, 
the Canada health and social transfer.  This is of course the big 
block of cash and tax points which is transferred to the 
provinces.  It is in the order of $25 billion to $26 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have noticed in the newspapers a great deal of whining 
on the part of a variety of premiers concerning “reductions in 
the CHST”.  The biggest whiner of them all is the premier of my 
province who is blaming his entire incompetence and mismanagement 
of Ontario's economy on a reduction totalling something in the 
order of $938 million from the federal government over the course 
of six years.  What he neglects to point out in the course of 
generating his argument is that Ontario's revenues have actually 
risen over the past six years to somewhere in the order of $10.5 
billion. 
Even with what we call Mike Harris math in Ontario, he is ahead 
by something in the order of $9 billion.  However, when one 
philosophically commits oneself to tax cuts in priority to all 
other priorities, one will in fact generate a situation where one 
has to deal with other areas.  One has to make cuts to health 
care and education and one has to ratchet up the debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT85"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT85"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprise, surprise, but that is what has happened in Ontario. 
The debt has risen under Mr. Harris' stewardship to something in 
the order of $20 billion to $30 billion.  Depending on when he 
calls the election, it may be as high as $30 billion.  Right now 
it is around $20 billion.  This year alone tax cuts will cost the 
Ontario treasury something in the order of $4.5 billion.  Those 
tax cuts alone would wipe out the deficit and provide a small 
surplus, if properly managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other members opposite have said, there is some disgrace in 
our health care system.  It is not the system that we would wish 
it to be.  Those tax cuts could have been applied to educational 
priorities, but they have not been applied to educational 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, when one ideologically commits oneself to tax cuts in 
priority to all other priorities one necessarily mismanages the 
government's finances, and when one necessarily mismanages the 
government's finances one has to blame somebody.  Why not blame 
the federal government which has cut back the CHST to Ontario by 
a total of $938 million over the course of six years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not neglect to point out that the effect of proper 
management at the federal level has brought interest rates down. 
The interest rate reduction benefit to Ontario alone is something 
like $1.3 billion, which more than offsets the minimal reductions 
to the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In government management there is always a choice in priorities. 
What priorities are we going to take?  If one looks at the 
priorities of this government, first of all it gave priority to 
the reduction and elimination of the deficit.  That has been 
achieved.  It is a tremendous accomplishment to go from a deficit 
of $42 billion to a surplus of something in the order of $4 
billion to $8 billion in the course of six budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government then gave priority to reducing the debt in 
absolute and real terms.  Thirteen billion dollars off in one 
fiscal year out of the market is an enormous accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then prioritized tax cuts and last year made a number of tax 
cuts at the low end.  I applaud the government for doing that. 
Now I would like to see the upper end receive its tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this government has done all of this with a minimalist 
approach to the reductions in the CHST and it has accomplished it 
over the course of the six years with a great deal of notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is more than ten little fiefdoms with one taxing 
authority.  Canada is a nation.  The priorities of our nation 
have been set by this government and I support those priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge this government to continue the absolute reduction of 
the debt, to provide tax cuts to Canadians who have borne most of 
the burden and to continue to prioritize the needs of our country 
in the fashion that I have outlined. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to raise some questions 
with the member for Scarborough East.  He has stood in this House 
and has talked about the priorities that he believes the Liberal 
government has.  He also outlined for us, in a surprising 
fashion, that it actually has health care as a priority.  I just 
want to review that for a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I recall, in the 1993 federal election the Liberals had three 
priorities:  to abolish, get rid off, cut and eliminate the GST; 
to re-negotiate and roll back the Canada-U.S. free trade 
agreement, which they then embraced; and to support our health 
care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a member of parliament from Saskatchewan.  The hon. member 
opposite talked about the Ontario experience.  In terms of 
Liberal priorities, the Saskatchewan experience has been 
interesting to say the least, but they would not be viewed in 
Saskatchewan terms or in any other terms as priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we used to have a 50% cost sharing arrangement with 
the federal government for health care.  Do members know what it 
is now?  It is not 50%.  It is not 40%.  It is not 25%.  It is 
not even 15%.  The federal share of funding for health care in 
Saskatchewan has dropped to 14%.  That is how the Liberals define 
priority for health care.  They slash, hack and cut medicare so 
it is bleeding from a thousand cuts.  Fourteen per cent means 
that 86% of the cost of health care is funded by Saskatchewan 
people for Saskatchewan people.  This is a priority that I hope 
the member will address in the upcoming budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In five years we have seen $1 billion taken out of our health 
care system by the Liberal government which has prioritized 
health care.  How much would it have taken out if it was not a 
priority?  Maybe it would have been $5 billion.  We are not sure. 
A billion dollars in Saskatchewan is $1,000 for every man, woman 
and child.  That is what we have lost from our health care 
system.  But the NDP government, in its wisdom, found that $1,000 
per man, woman and child and did not pass on the cuts the feds 
made to the health care system.  We backfilled every dollar into 
health care which those members opposite said was a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen their wonderful priority in terms of tax cuts 
for Saskatchewan people and other Canadians.  They have 
eliminated the Crow benefit, which is another $1 billion that has 
been taken out of the Saskatchewan economy.  On top of that they 
raised railway transportation costs by between 25% and 33% to 
every farmer selling and shipping their products by rail.  That 
is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the issues of health care, transportation and 
agriculture, what we see in Saskatchewan is that even the 
provincial Liberals are saying that health care is a priority and 
that the NDP in Saskatchewan is not doing its job with respect to 
health care.  The NDP found $1 billion that this government cut, 
but the Liberal cousins in Ottawa continue to attack the health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member put his seat on the line?  If health care 
is not the priority that he says it is come the budget, will he 
resign his seat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I cannot speak with any 
authority on the numbers with respect to Saskatchewan.  However, 
the hon. member forgets, as does Mr. Harris of Ontario, as does 
almost every premier of Canada, that the CHST, which is the big 
block transfer, is a combination of cash and tax points.  I know 
that in Ontario the combination of cash and tax points has not 
amounted to a $6 billion reduction in moneys, as Mr. Harris would 
argue, but has been slightly less than $1 billion.  In the 
process, the government's finances have been put back in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that in Saskatchewan, which is arguably in 
unemployment terms one of our better provinces, the numbers would 
be similar and that in fact there has been very little reduction 
in terms of the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note to the hon. member opposite that the equalization 
payments have not been cut over that period of time, at 
considerable sacrifice to this particular treasury and to the 
taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, cash reductions in the CHST were stopped at $12.5 
billion, even though all of the provinces had signed on to a cash 
floor of $11 billion.  As a consequence, $7 billion was back in 
the pot for all of the provinces to obtain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note in the last budget $150 million was put into the 
health transition fund.  There was a further $50 million for the 
Canada health information system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of our deliberations the idea of a variety of 
report cards on how the best health care dollar can be obtained 
is being floated. I was shocked to learn that Manitoba's system 
does not compare to Saskatchewan's system which does not compare 
to Ontario's system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians spend something in the order of $80 billion annually 
on their health care system and they have no idea what they are 
getting for it.  It is something like 9% of the GDP.  Comparable 
health systems in other countries spend something like 7% of 
their GDP. How is it that they obtain a sophisticated, well 
managed, accessible system for something in the order of 7% of 
their GDP when we have to spend 9% of our GDP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would applaud the health minister who insists with the 
premiers and with the respective health ministers that they be 
accountable for the moneys that are to be put into the CHST.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is always 
interesting to listen to the member for Scarborough East and his 
sidekick from Mississauga West. The trouble with Liberal members 
is that we cannot pat them on the back because they are patting 
themselves on the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the prosperity in Ontario, last year 73% of all 
the net new jobs in the private sector was created by the 
province and a high percentage of the remainder was created by 
the province of Alberta. Is it not ironic that the two provinces 
with the lowest taxes have created the majority of the jobs and 
probably have also made the biggest contribution to reducing the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member from Scarborough say that the Ontario 
government had an increase in revenues of almost $10 billion with 
a 30% tax increase.  Is it not ironic that tax increases or 
decreases increase the revenue.  I would like the hon. member to 
comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that he was a debt hawk.  Would he then 
agree that if we had locked the $3 billion contingency reserve 
into a repayment schedule with the servicing costs we could pay 
the debt back in 35 years?  Would the hon. member support that 
type of a lock? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member has a 
minute left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know whether 
within a minute I can deal with the simple-minded correlation 
between the issue of tax cuts and proper management of the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Ontario at this point is experiencing something 
of a renaissance and that there is a great deal of job creation. 
However, there is not a correlation with tax cuts. I respectfully 
submit to the hon. member that that is about as simple-minded a 
correlation as he is going to find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact Ontario's economy is booming because of a great deal of 
investment in a knowledge based economy and a great deal of 
investment in other areas of the economy and its location 
vis-à-vis the United States.  The tax cuts do not necessarily 
correlate as the hon. member thinks they would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that it has done over the course of the period of the 
premiership of Mr. Harris has been to ratchet up the debt by $20 
billion to $30 billion.  That $20 billion to $30 billion has to 
be serviced on an annual basis.  Even at the minimal interest 
rates that we have now achieved by the good management of the 
federal government, that is still going to add about $1.5 billion 
in service costs on to the taxpayers of Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
sure when the government releases its budget it will sell it as 
the answer to everything, the answer to the government's failure 
to support our health care system, the answer to its failure to 
improve child poverty. 
As it has for the past year, the government will talk of the 
surplus and the need to decrease the debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are tired of the government's doublespeak.  Canadians 
knew with the budget last year that by not going ahead with 
further cuts the government was not putting dollars back in 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that dollars paid by workers and employers should 
not be used for government favours.  Canadians know that the 
finance minister's surplus should not include EI dollars. We do 
not need to abuse the EI fund to put an armoury in Shawinigan. 
We do not need to use EI dollars to have a millennium scholarship 
fund as a golden calf for the Prime Minister. Without those EI 
dollars, the finance minister's surplus dwindles.  His pat on the 
back should be resulting in a small burp, not the belching we 
must continually listen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality there should be no pats on the backs on the 
government benches.  The social deficit in Canada has reached an 
all-time low.  Let us recap a few of the government's wonderful 
contributions since the Liberals took the helm.  All that is 
missing is the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child poverty has increased by $500,000.  Homelessness is a 
national disaster.  Every province has called on this government 
to react to the critical state of our health care system and then 
the member for Scarborough East calls it whining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have taken a year to clean out their ears, or 
is it just so bad that even they are feeling the shame and 
embarrassment of Canada's drop in social standing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read from a letter that I received over the break: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very tough to survive on old age pensions in present times. 
My wife and I are trying to do just that.  My lady is 70 years 
old and I am 76.  The price of necessities is rising daily and it 
is so hard to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the government raised our medical target $300, so we now 
must pay $600 before we get any discount on the price of drugs. 
We are both on medication.  This is a low blow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of living in the north is horrific.  We pay top dollar 
to operate our cars.  We cannot afford a holiday which we should 
be entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has seen fit to forgive a $700 million 
tax bill to people who are already billionaires.  This will 
certainly fall in the laps of the average taxpayer to fill in the 
void. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the Liberal legacy as we enter the new millennium.  The 
government had best make a good showing with the next budget.  We 
cannot afford for conditions to get any worse.  Canadians will 
not tolerate this Prime Minister's lack of vision. This 
government must make a serious commitment to the people of 
Canada. What are the options to improve the sorry state of 
Canada's social condition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a bare minimum, $2.5 billion must be put back into the health 
care system.  The bare minimum.  Put the EI payments back into 
the program.  We have all heard the disgusting statistics 
throughout Canada as to the number of workers no longer able to 
collect benefits, not because the dollars are not there but 
because the government changed the rules so less and less can 
receive benefits.  What good is an insurance plan if it is not 
able to be collected by the people who most need it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre mentioned the 
deplorable numbers for his riding.  Only 19% of the unemployed 
are able to collect EI benefits.  Some employment insurance. In 
my riding $16.9 million less is being paid out in EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cut the GST by 1%.  This along with dollars put back into EI are 
the greatest encouragements to job creation and boosting local 
economies.  This way all Canadians benefit:  workers, the 
unemployed, the sick, local businesses, not just the billionaire 
who got the $700 million tax write-off.

Speaker, I would like to direct a comment and a question to the 
hon. member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with much of what she has said.  One thing bothers me 
with the talk leading up to the transfers, and I am sure the hon. 
member will agree with this.  Somehow with the transfers we now 
need what this government says is accountability. 
I have some problems with that because when the government says 
it needs accountability, what the government is saying is that it 
has not had it in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who knows best how to deliver a health care system in my 
province in my constituency than the people who live there? What 
is the point of demanding accountability?  Are you going to 
create an army of people to say this is where your health dollars 
go, this is where your education dollars go and this is where the 
welfare dollars go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not have any idea at the present time how to deliver a 
health care system to a village on the coast of Newfoundland. 
Does the hon. member agree with the government that says this is 
how much money you are going to get but you are going to be 
accountable to us as to how it is going to be spent, as if you 
are not capable of spending your own tax dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not have a 
problem with accountability. Canadians want accountability for 
their tax dollars, but reasonable accountability is what we are 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems again I am talking of the doublespeak that the 
government uses. We all read the comments of the transport 
minister when he talked about certain dollars that were signed 
away and that the process really was not there to keep track of 
it and there are toll highways in New Brunswick because things 
were not accounted for. It is important to recognize that we have 
to be accountable and the things that happened were wrong in that 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not have a problem within the health care system in 
Canada.  There was not a serious problem until this government 
took the helm and dollars became so scarce that the government 
had to get on somebody's case over where the dollars were going. 
We did not hear Canadians complain about the things they are 
talking about now, of not getting surgery for six months to a 
year and of not getting treatment for breast cancer until three, 
four or five months down the road.  That is the legacy of the 
Liberal government and it is not because of accountability.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I thought I heard that the member opposite wished to obtain a tax 
cut in the area of the GST. Does the member know how much the GST 
raised for the federal government?  What was the net effect of 
the moneys that were raised?  How much did that contribute to the 
federal treasury? Has the member contemplated how much a one 
point reduction in the GST would cost the federal treasury?  Is 
that one point reduction in the GST a priority the member would 
put in precedence to all other priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member know whether the consumption taxes set out in 
this country are comparable to consumption taxes in other 
jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, to get to the end 
result I am not aware of all the figures regarding consumption 
taxes in every area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one have never begrudged paying my dues for what I 
receive.  I personally have never begrudged my tax dollars.  I 
have benefited greatly as a Canadian.  My family has benefited 
through public schools, through roads and through the health care 
system. Personally I pay my taxes and I do not begrudge them when 
I receive the goods but that has not been the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the 1% on the GST, there is no question that the 
benefits to the local economies and to individuals will be 
benefits that will reach everybody if we use the 1% GST cut. That 
is not the case when one person receives a tax break. That is the 
problem Canadians want to address in the tax system.  They want 
something that is going to be fair for everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to rise 
and speak in support of Bill C-58 which has received 
consideration by the Standing Committee on Transport last 
November and has been finally referred back to the House for 
third reading.  I commend my colleagues for their diligent work 
on this significant piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two in depth reviews have been conducted to date by independent 
and departmental safety experts on the Railway Safety Act.  One 
was in 1994 and more recently another in 1997.  These reviews 
confirm the validity of the underlying principles of the act.  In 
both cases the overall excellent safety record of the Canadian 
rail industry was clearly acknowledged, and we are very proud of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However these reviews also identified opportunities to further 
enhance the legislation aimed at building and improving on this 
effective safety framework.  The amendments proposed in the 
legislation were prepared following a thorough consultative 
process with the railway industry, railway unions, the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Safety Council, 
Transport 2000, provincial officials and other interested 
parties, and there was a great number of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultations were held as late as October of last year.  These 
sessions provided stakeholders with an opportunity to reach a 
consensus on the intent of these proposed Railway Safety Act 
amendments which reflect best practices used in safety regimes 
from other modes of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of full consultation were amply demonstrated by our 
stakeholder success in seeing their views integrated into the 
improved legislative package.  As a result they expressed to the 
standing committee their high level of comfort with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform the House that the proposed legislative 
changes in Bill C-58 as approved by the Standing Committee on 
Transport will enhance our ability to give assurance to Canadians 
of the continuing health of railway safety in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the most important changes in the bill have been made in 
order to make our railway system much safer.  Among other things 
these changes include a new policy statement; authority to 
require railways to implement safety management systems with an 
auditing process; authority to require railways to report safety 
critical information, an absolute must; a new safety compliance 
order targeted at safety management system deficiencies; 
increased authority for railway safety inspectors which is 
lacking at the present time; and an improved consultative process 
with all partners concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that these and other measures proposed in the bill 
will benefit Canadians greatly through the continuous improvement 
of all elements of the railway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that Transport Canada considers railway 
safety to be of utmost importance.  As the Transportation Safety 
Board has noted, Canada enjoys a commendable rail safety record. 
To maintain this record departmental rail safety inspectors will 
continue to monitor all railway company safety performance across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada will also continue to take action to attend to 
any safety deficiencies that may arise to ensure that the safety 
of the Canadian transportation system is not compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of this act is characterized by co-operation among 
concerned parties.  Railways and unions, provinces and 
municipalities and professional associations have all contributed 
to the development of this act over time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Standing Committee on Transport last year many witnesses 
came forward to voice their support of what they felt to be a 
good piece of legislation.  Stakeholders, industry and labour 
commended the process by which the legislation had been 
developed.  In particular, they appreciated the opportunity to 
fully voice their concerns and to see these concerns being 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as a result of comments made by stakeholders to the 
Standing Committee on Transport the government was very pleased 
to add a new section to the bill, section 26.2, which states that 
railway equipment has the right of way at highway crossings. This 
provision has the wide support of stakeholders and was 
satisfactory to concerned parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem obvious that railway equipment has the right of way 
when one considers the mass of a train compared to that of a 
measly motor vehicle.  However, setting this out in clear 
language may help Canadians to realize that railway vehicles, 
unlike motor vehicles, require long distances to come to a stop. 
This section will therefore help in raising public awareness and 
advancing crossing safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technical amendments put forward by members of the standing 
committee have also been incorporated into the bill.  The 
Standing Committee on Transport has helped through its 
considerable efforts to improve an already sound piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains a very innovative approach to the problem of 
train whistles in our communities.  The whistle signals the 
approach of a train to a crossing.  This very simple device has 
historically been an effective safety warning.  Yet it can be 
very disruptive to people who live close to the railway line, 
especially if the whistles are blowing at three o'clock or four 
o'clock in the morning.  Over the years railways have ceased 
whistling at crossings in a number of communities.  This was 
initiated following strict guidelines established by Transport 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scheme set out in the bill, which was endorsed by municipal 
representatives and in particular by the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, will require railways to stop whistling where a 
local government has passed a motion approving whistle cessation 
and if the location meets Transport Canada's standards as set out 
in legislation.  We believe this will foster a co-operative 
approach to solving problems between railways and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, Transport Canada's first priority is the safety of 
the transportation system in Canada.  I believe these amendments 
to the Railway Safety Act will strengthen the regulatory 
framework governing safety in this critical mode of 
transportation and will provide the means to ensure that Canada's 
railways will continue to improve their safety performance as we 
head into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members of the House to give quick passage to 
the legislation so that it can be considered by the other house.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on December 7, 1998 Bill C-58, an act to amend the 
Railway Safety Act, was passed unanimously at report stage. 
Because the intent and general terms of the bill are beneficial, 
my Reform colleagues and I held our noses, gritted our teeth and 
voted for a bill that had been pushed forward with indecent haste 
and had not received full and proper consideration in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the parliamentary secretary has just said, 
there were stakeholders who were unable to be heard.  Moreover, I 
am unaware of any amendments proposed by the opposition parties 
having been even seriously debated in committee, much less 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the practice of adapting the committee's schedule to the 
convenience of the minister's office is the shape of things to 
come, I can assure the minister and the House that the official 
opposition will be less indulgent in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight I bring to the attention of the House a deficiency in 
the Canada Transportation Act which came to my attention as a 
result of an alleged breach of safety relating to a level 
crossing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1997 Ms. Linda Meyer and a companion were walking 
across a private railway crossing known locally as the Donatelli 
Crossing near Mission, B.C.  I have seen photographs of the 
location.  The right of way is not fenced and the crossing is 
marked with a stop sign.  From a safety standpoint the amount of 
brush along the approach is certainly unacceptable, but that is 
not the issue I wish to raise right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The couple were stopped on the crossing by a Canadian Pacific 
Railway police constable dressed in civilian clothes and driving 
an unmarked van.  They state that the officer informed them 
without warning or preamble that they were under arrest for 
trespassing.  They further claim that when they protested Ms. 
Meyer's companion was pepper-sprayed and she was restrained with 
such force that she required medical attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard this story my initial reaction was to wonder if the 
Prime Minister had been moonlighting as a railway policeman. 
However, the incident took place a few weeks prior to the APEC 
summit and it is therefore extremely unlikely that he would have 
been in western Canada at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trespassing charges are still before the courts and I 
understand that criminal charges against the constable are 
pending.  This legal escalation need not have occurred if section 
158 of the Canada Transportation Act contained a provision for an 
independent tribunal to review complaints against railway police 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, citizen complaints are only dealt with internally 
by other railway employees.  In an age where almost every public 
police force in Canada is subject to some sort of civilian 
overview, it is an aberration in my view that a private force is 
exempt from control or is exempt from external scrutiny. Even the 
RCMP is subject to its actions being reviewed by the allegedly 
impartial public complaints commission.  It is unconscionable 
that the security force of a private corporation does not have 
this type of public accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Ms. Meyer's complaint was not dealt with to her 
satisfaction by the railway company she appealed to government 
and found herself in a Kafkaesque runaround where nobody seems to 
be responsible for anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport initially passed the book to the 
Canada Transportation Agency.  The Canada Transportation Agency 
and the Minister of Justice both directed her to the solicitor 
general who in turn directed her, correctly I believe, back to 
the Minister of Transport where the matter rests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I gather from the response by the Minister of 
Justice that she is not even aware that trespassing on railway 
property is a breach of federal law under the Railway Safety Act, 
but nobody is perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I urge the Minister of Transport to introduce 
legislation to amend section 158 of the Canada Transportation Act 
to establish an independent commission to review and adjudicate 
complaints against railway police constables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, although we are now in the process of passing what is 
supposed to be the be all and the end all of railway safety, I 
suggest that the rather nebulous section 26.1 of the Railway 
Safety Act be further amended in accordance with last year's 
recommendation by the Transport Canada project team that “the 
responsibilities of all concerned parties with respect to 
crossings and trespassing be clarified”.  This is less important 
to me than the issue of lack of accountability of the railways 
for actions of their constables, but it is nevertheless a matter 
of public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that the potential, no matter how slim, for a 
trespasser on a railway track to be charged with an indictable 
offence pursuant to section 41 is overkill which should be 
addressed in conjunction with the review of section 26.1 of the 
Railway Safety Act.

the House, my colleagues and I would be very happy to support the 
initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased for the opportunity to take part in third 
reading of Bill C-58, an act to amend the Railway Safety Act and 
to make a consequential amendment to another act.  This act is 
basically the same as the previous Bill C-43 introduced during 
the last parliament.  Unfortunately it died on the order paper at 
the call of the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes amendments to the Railway Safety Act which 
came into effect in January 1998.  The statutory review took 
place after five years.  The result was the previous Bill C-43 
and now the bill that has replaced it, the one before us, Bill 
C-58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will provide the necessary authority to require 
railways to implement safety management systems.  This is a 
preventive measure that will work to enhance the procedures of 
railway companies.  The bill will also provide greater 
involvement of the affected organizations in rule making.  It 
will allow communities to become involved in the issue of train 
whistles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not sound very important but it is.  For one living in a 
community next to a railway track it becomes a disruption.  I am 
being told that this will ensure local communities will have 
their say on how that is handled, not at the expense of safety 
but by attempting to eliminate that disruption in certain 
communities because of rail lines and their crossings.  The 
community and the railway will be able to work together under the 
legislation to provide for minimal disruption of the community 
and, as I said earlier, to provide the highest level of safety at 
crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will now clarify and strengthen the federal powers at 
road crossings which will allow for safer crossings at a time as 
speeds and volumes are increasing, which makes safe crossings 
that much more important.  Particularly with the increase of car 
and truck volumes using our road system and the rail industry 
competing globally with increased volumes, it is much more 
important that we become vigilant to support or provide for the 
safest possible system when these two modes of transportation 
meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased crossing safety is the utmost importance considering 
the circumstances when there is an unfortunate incident at a 
crossing.  Railway crossing safety will become even more critical 
as volumes increase.  The Maersk-Sea Land's post-panamax strategy 
for North America may and most likely will include Halifax.  We 
are hoping Halifax will be the container port of choice by huge 
new vessels which will increase traffic volumes immensely.  Nova 
Scotia's economy, indeed the Canadian economy, will benefit 
greatly if Halifax is chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to impress upon the federal government 
the importance of the Halifax bid.  My seatmate from Nova Scotia 
and our transport critic from Cumberland—Colchester have been 
working very hard to make sure that the bid is given some 
recognition by the government.  Unfortunately the government has 
been what we call shamefully silent on the issue. It has to be a 
little more aggressive in that bid if Halifax is to be 
successful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting off topic a bit but the Halifax terminal is up 
against some pretty stiff competitors.  It all fits into the 
safety implications of the bill.  The container line coming into 
Halifax and the super port would increase volumes dramatically on 
the railways and on the highways simply because of the loads 
super carriers would be bringing into the port of Halifax if it 
were successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that annoys me about the federal government is its 
lack of support of the Halifax bid for the super port.  I have 
before me an article that was carried in the Halifax <I>Chronicle 
Herald</I> in September 1998 wherein the federal international 
trade minister was urging New England business leaders to back 
the bid of Halifax for super port status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that Halifax is looking for $50 million from 
the federal government to help with the bid to become the named 
port in competition with ports along the American seacoast.  Yet 
here we have the Minister for International Trade urging New 
Englanders or New England business to support our bid but not 
coming up to the line on behalf of the Government of Canada to 
support Nova Scotia in that bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax is on the short list and it is coming down to a choice 
between Baltimore, New York, New Jersey and Halifax.  It is up 
against some pretty stiff competition.  The federal government 
has to be a little more active on that file if Halifax is to be 
successful.  We can be sure that the Americans will use 
everything at their disposal to make sure they are successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a week or two ago I was listening to a New York radio 
station and I know hundreds of millions are now being spent to 
dredge the New York-New Jersey harbour in anticipation of 
receiving the go ahead; in other words that it will be the 
favoured port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are doing everything they can to secure that bid, 
and we are sitting in Ottawa doing absolutely nothing.  I urge 
the federal government to talk to the industry minister and the 
finance minister.  It is time we did what our American 
competitors are doing to ensure success by investing in the 
future of Nova Scotia, the east coast of Canada and the Canadian 
economy.  This is a big money maker, a big job maker.  It is time 
the government at least acknowledges the writing on the wall and 
plays hardball with our American counterparts.  Otherwise it is 
like rolling over and playing dead to the elephant.  I do not 
think that we can afford to do that any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transport minister's parliamentary secretary is here.  He is 
a very capable individual.  I hope he impresses upon his minister 
the importance of the bid so that we can move on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measures contained in the bill is the authority to 
regulate railway emissions.  Our environment is a valuable asset, 
one that we cannot replace.  It is not as if it is a renewable 
resource.  We have one and we have to take care of it.  We 
support any measures to protect it, and that is included in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last feature to which I will speak is the security of the 
railway system.  Bill C-58 will improve safety, not only for the 
travelling public who uses the rail system through VIA Rail but 
also the vital link which has a major impact on the success of 
the Canadian economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Railway Safety Act which passed in 1988 was a significant 
change in the way we regulate railways and how railways interact 
with government.  This has proven to be a very good approach, and 
with the legislation before us today I hope it will become that 
much better.  I might add that I was a member of the government 
that passed the legislation in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cumberland—Colchester examined the bill in 
detail at the committee stage and was glad to hear the witnesses 
who appeared before the committee, including CP Rail, Canadian 
National, the Railway Association of Canada and three groups 
representing labour.   We are also pleased with the exhaustive 
consultations that took place with the stakeholders involved and 
their valuable input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that it is a top priority of our party to ensure 
safe railway operation.  In conclusion, I am glad to say that we 
will be supporting Bill C-58, the Railway Safety Act, as we look 
forward to the safer railway system which will be a result of the 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on behalf of the New Democratic Party in support 
of Bill C-58, an act to amend the Railway Safety Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the product of an inclusive consultation process 
with representatives of the railway industry, organized labour 
and other stakeholders.  These stakeholders have indicated their 
satisfaction and support for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of consultation that culminated with the bill is a 
rare and refreshing change from the autocratic way the government 
usually operates.  Most of the time the government takes its cues 
from its business friends who are concerned with only their 
bottom lines and not with what is in the public interest.  This 
obvious bias is most apparent in the way the Liberal government 
has slashed health and social spending and finagled with EI funds 
that are supposed to pay for unemployed workers and job training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most government bills come to the House from the bureaucratic 
backrooms like lightning bolts from Mount Olympus with little or 
no public consultation.  When there is consultation it is usually 
only with high priced lobbyists.  That is why the bill is such 
a rare and refreshing change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a pleasure to see organized labour, municipal governments 
and the Canada Safety Council consulted in the making of the 
bill.  It was rare to see a balanced process, rather than one 
skewed by a one dimensional perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats and social democratic parties around the world 
know that business is fundamentally important to the public 
interest.  After all, it is the engine that creates our society. 
Business is a valid and important contributor to society but it 
is only one dimension in the multidimensional reality of the 
public interest.  In a healthy democracy business needs must be 
balanced with the needs of communities, with individual liberty, 
with compassion for the sick and the disadvantaged, and with 
other values that its citizens hold dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When business interests gain supremacy over others democracy is 
threatened.  We see this in many third world dictatorships where 
business thrives but the people are denied liberty and most live 
in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations that went into the bill are a case in point. 
Business was well represented by CP Rail, CN, Via and the Railway 
Association of Canada.  Surely they made valuable contributions, 
but other voices were at the table as well.  Labour was there to 
represent the workers.  The Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
represented communities and the Canada Safety Council represented 
the general public interest.  No wonder this process produced a 
positive bill that we are pleased to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things the bill allows for greater openness and 
transparency in the making of rules and regulations.  It 
addresses concerns about train noise in communities and the 
problem of train-car collisions at road crossings.  It clarifies 
jurisdictional issues over road crossings and extends the 
jurisdiction of railway safety inspectors.  It provides the 
federal government with the authority to mandate safety programs 
from railway companies and enables the government to regulate 
railway emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly welcome the provisions for greater openness and 
transparency in rule making.  The bill will ensure that unions 
and other interested parties have 60 days to review and comment 
on any new rules, rule changes or proposals for exemption. 
I know the transportation unions take the safety of the public 
and the safety of their members very seriously and will take 
advantage of this opportunity to add their input into the 
regulatory process.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most difficult issues this bill deals with is noise 
pollution from train whistles.  When these whistles blow at all 
hours of the day and night they disturb people living near 
railway crossing and lower property values.  At the same time 
train whistles are important for safety because they serve as a 
warning to motor vehicles and pedestrians crossing tracks.  Over 
95% of train fatalities are caused by trespassing on tracks or at 
crossings.  So the challenge in this bill was to balance the need 
for safety with the quality of life of people living near 
crossings.  After listening to the rather strange story the 
member from Cypress Hills mentioned, the challenge will also be 
to ensure that the rights of those people who are on those tracks 
are dealt with in a fair manner.  It would appear that is an area 
that will have to be looked at fairly quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution found was to turn responsibility over to local 
governments which, as we know, are more in touch with the needs 
of their communities than the Ottawa bureaucracy.  This bill will 
enable local governments to pass resolutions to limit train 
whistling.  In order to ensure safety, the municipalities will 
have to consult with the relevant railway companies and other 
stakeholders and the crossing will have to meet certain national 
safety standards.  Clearly this solution delegates a great deal 
of responsibility to local governments and depends on the 
vitality and good judgement of those democracies.  New Democrats 
and community activists everywhere will closely monitor this new 
system to make sure it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I support this bill overall, I would like to note one 
reservation regarding the section about the medical testing of 
railway workers designated as critical to railway safety. Without 
a doubt, the public interest demands that these workers be 
medically fit to do their important jobs.  My concern is with 
section 35 of the bill which states that these persons shall 
undergo a medical examination organized by the railway company 
concerned.  Medical records are personal and private and we, as 
members of parliament, must take care any time we pass a law like 
this one that violates the privacy of citizens.  I am concerned 
by the fact that this bill specifically states that the medical 
examinations are to be organized by the railway companies 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of experience with these kinds of issues, 
having worked for 25 years in the health care field.  For many of 
those years I served as a union representative and I have seen 
firsthand the kind of abuse that permeates with rules like this 
one.  It is possible that the railway companies will try to abuse 
this section.  Hypothetically they could have a company doctor 
declare a worker unfit to work in order to get rid of a union 
leader or to prevent an employee from having enough years of 
service to qualify for their pension.  On the other side of the 
coin the company could have a doctor overlook some legitimate 
medical problem to keep an employee on the job when they are 
shorthanded.  These kinds of abuses have happened before and we 
must ensure that they cannot happen again.  This underlines why 
unions are absolutely essential for protecting the rights of 
workers and why the railway unions must be vigilant in protecting 
their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this bill attempts to improve the safety of Canada's 
railways.  It presumes that the railway companies will not put 
profit before safety.  Only time will tell if this confidence in 
the railway companies is justified.  Despite these reservations I 
reiterate my support for the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, regarding the presentation 
made by the member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands he stated 
correctly that railway property is private property.  Therefore 
anyone trespassing can be arrested if there is an officer of the 
railway or someone representing the law enforcing body of the 
railway as it was possibly in that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to point out to the member and to members 
of the House that this bill is presenting a dynamic innovation in 
the whole area of railway safety.  In the past rules and 
regulations were made and they were carved in stone.  They 
remained that way for a great number of years.  The tools, the 
processes and the regulations that were imposed in this bill will 
provide a dynamic model which means that it will continually grow 
based on concerns and input from all the parties concerned, not 
only municipalities, not only victims of accidents on the railway 
but all parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety will be number one throughout this entire process. 
Changes will be in essence ongoing because this is a very dynamic 
model with all parties concerned.  I thank the member for New 
Brunswick Southwest for his comments with regard to the harbour. 
That issue has not yet been resolved because the Halifax harbour 
has not been chosen.  That issue will be dealt with at the 
community, municipal and provincial levels before we are notified 
of any decision.  We certainly cannot step into the picture and 
make declarations.  In other words, we only deal with the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Churchill for her comments 
pertaining to the process we were all involved in devising this 
bill. I will take into consideration and pass on to the 
government the kind of concern raised by the member at the very 
end of her presentation regarding health management problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, with regard to the 
ongoing process it is important for the dynamic aspect so talked 
about to really be there and for it not to be a lot of fluff. 
There is a concern that might not be the case.  I know the railway 
workers and the municipalities involved will be very vigilant in 
ensuring this bill really works to improve railway safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary has committed to ensuring that 
what takes place is up front.  We will see how things proceed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will comment on what the parliamentary secretary said 
in terms of private crossings although they are disappearing in 
my area.  Right in the middle of most towns in the prairies are 
private crossings, since the railway came in.  Although they are 
private crossings they have been used as public crossings that 
give the railway the right of way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary had listened carefully to the 
hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands, he would know that it 
was an unprovoked, unnecessary approach by someone employed as a 
railway police officer.  If this incident were to happen in my 
town we would consider it gross indecency on the part of the 
police.   We have to take what he said as true.  I know it is 
true and I know the hon. parliamentary secretary will give 
credence to what he has to say and that he will give some support 
to this individual case.  Eventually it will come back.  Right 
now it is laying in the hands of the Minister of Transport.  I 
would ask him to look into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no question 
that the story related by the member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands should be of great concern.  Without knowing 
exactly how it is proceeding through the Department of Transport, 
I am sure most of us here will follow up with the particulars to 
ensure it will not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure most Canadians do not realize there are private police 
and such on the railways and on that New Brunswick toll highway. 
Authority is given to the companies that run that stretch to 
police it.  I do not think Canadians realize that and I do not 
think they would be very happy to know that.  As the word gets 
out we might find that more and more comments come back if things 
are not done in an acceptable manner.  In this case it certainly 
appears it was not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the accident at Biggar, the Minister of Transport 
announced he would be postponing the introduction of changes to 
the Railway Safety Act in Parliament, to give his senior 
officials time to examine the need for new improvements to the 
act and develop mechanisms to assess safety and apply 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, as is the practice in all bureaucracies, a task 
force was set up to examine railway safety that comprised 
experts in risk management and in regulatory matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 31, 1998, the senior officials submitted to the 
minister their report containing a variety of recommendations 
arising from the work of the committee.  On March 18, 1998, the 
Minister of Transport announced his acceptance of the 
recommendations and gave his departmental officials the job of 
carrying out the statutory changes as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 5, the Minister of Transport tabled the proposed 
changes to the Railway Safety Act in the House of Commons.  They 
included a new statement of policy, the power to require railway 
companies to report all important information in order to ensure 
railway safety, the power to require railway companies to 
implement safety management systems and, finally, among other 
things, an increase in the powers of railway safety inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the objectives of the Railway Safety Act as 
amended by Bill C-58 are as follows:  first, promote and provide 
for the safety of the public and personnel, and the protection 
of property and the environment, in the operation of railways; 
second, encourage the collaboration and participation of 
interested parties in improving railway safety.  It could 
perhaps be mentioned that there is a provision in this bill that 
unions be consulted, that there be greater co-operation between 
workers and railways.  Our party can only give its hearty 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Front line workers are the best judge of optimum safety 
regulations, not managers in their ivory towers in Montreal, 
Toronto or Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore delighted that this bill makes provision for 
such participation and co-operation by the various parties 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this bill recognizes the responsibility of railway 
companies in ensuring the safety of their operations.  And 
finally, this bill facilitates a modern, flexible and efficient 
regulatory scheme that will ensure the continuing enhancement of 
railway safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, this is a very technical bill, the purpose 
of which is to improve railway safety, as I have several times 
mentioned.  This bill increases the government's power to have 
railway companies correct irritants and risk factors with 
respect to safety and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a problem, however, when there was a need to improve the 
safety of level crossings within a municipality.  We introduced 
an amendment at report stage.  It read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-58, in Clause 19, be amended by adding after line 7 
on page 12 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Section 24 of the Act is amended by adding the following after 
subsection (2): 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) A railway company that operates a line of railway shall 
reimburse a provincial government, city or municipality for 
expenses incurred by the provincial government, city or 
municipality, as the case may be, in respect of the line of 
railway for the purpose of complying with a regulation made 
under subsection (1).” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a fourth paragraph, we said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) For greater certainty, subsection (3) does not limit the 
scope of subsection (2) with respect to a provincial government, 
city or municipality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be pointed out, unfortunately, that, true to form, the 
government has not made use of the solutions or constructive 
suggestions offered by the opposition and has decided to do 
things its own way.  What we were suggesting were not mere 
whims, but reflected our desire to reflect the reality of 
numerous municipalities in Quebec and in Canada, and their 
ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I will read a letter over 
the signature of Mr. Pierre Gaudet, mayor of Aston Junction in 
the riding of Richelieu.  Mayor Gaudet wrote to his MP, my 
colleague for Richelieu, a most hardworking, serious and 
conscientious man, who referred the matter to me.  Together we 
discussed the matter and raised it within our party caucus. 
This is the reason we decided to move an amendment to Bill C-58.

responsibility.  Now, without our consent, we have become

responsibility.  For our small municipality—

Montreal, Longueuil or Brossard, with their rich property tax 
base.  The same goes for Saint-Lambert. 
I do not have exact population figures, but—still quoting the 
mayor—Aston Junction is a “small” municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming the letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our small municipality, such a responsibility represents a 
very high annual investment, since our role was to pay without 
any right of review of CN's projected expenditures.  We cannot 
afford such an expense over the long term. 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to familiarize you with this matter, we enclose a copy 
of the order-in-council and of the resolution passed by the 
municipality. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to illustrate with my comments on this is that, 
concretely, when safety improvements are involved, relating to a 
railway line which passes through a municipality—trains being 
unlike planes, this cuts the road in half to let the train 
pass—it is normal, logical, reasonable for the one responsible 
for blocking the road traffic to pay for improving the safety of 
level crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to raise your awareness of the reasonable character 
of this, but let us look at the ability of CN and CP to pay. 
First of all, CN. 
We are aware of the context in which the Liberal government 
privatized CN.  With passage of the act to privatize CN, 
something occurred that has never been seen anywhere else in the 
world.  When CN was privatized, it was given the lines as well. 
In Canada, the railway was an instrument of east-west 
development.  The rail lines, the rights-of-way, were paid for by 
the taxpayers of Quebec and of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very clearly what I had to say in 1994-95 in the 
House: that the government ought not to hand over the rail lines 
to the newly privatized CN, headed by that same Paul Tellier 
who, we will remember, received $350,000 when president of a 
non-privatized CN, then a crown corporation.  He got an 
interest-free loan of $350,000 to purchase a house in Westmount, 
and then the same Paul Tellier, CN's president, benefited from 
unbelievable treatment at the time of privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that the government made a mistake in handing over 
the railway rights-of-way when it privatized the railway.  Today 
this means that the passenger trains are at the mercy of the 
freight trains. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1920"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means passengers having to wait two or two and a half hours 
in the middle of a field in Kamouraska or Mont-Joli, because 
trains carrying Volvos from Halifax are arriving.  There are 
trains carrying rolls of newsprint.  There are trains carrying 
lumber that pass while passenger trains wait.  That is what has 
been happening since the privatization of Canadian National and 
its newly acquired power over life and death on the rails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport 
is listening to me, and I would remind him that, regarding the 
whole issue of the future of passenger rail service in Quebec 
and Canada, a sword of Damocles hangs over the two big 
companies, CN and CP. 
I hope the government will stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy the Standing Committee on Transport said, and that 
the Minister of Transport acknowledged, that freight companies 
should find ways to facilitate passenger rail service in Canada. 
There is a sword of Damocles over their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the government, but I hope it will stand up. But 
I hope the lobbies, the bagmen—and I did not say “Batman”, I 
said bagmen, those who carry bags of money for the Liberals' 
campaign fund—will this once stay in their place and that the 
government will respect passengers, because we are talking about 
the future of passenger transportation.  We are talking about 
lines, about franchising Via Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik is listening 
carefully to me. 
He is concerned about the sale of the Montreal-Senneterre line to 
a private company.  My colleagues in the Gaspé are concerned 
about the Montreal-Gaspé and Montreal-Jonquière lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will have to give this serious thought.  If CN 
had not been given incredible benefits and unwarranted 
conditions when it was privatized, we would not be at the mercy 
of these companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment proposes that small municipalities, and 
municipalities in general, taxpayers, those who live in small 
bungalows and pay astronomical municipal taxes because 
municipalities have had to absorb the costs of other levels of 
government, not have to pay.  The large companies should pay for 
the cost of making railways safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the government in another 
connection—and I think that is part of our role as a reasonable 
and responsible opposition. 
When the government falls short, we stand up and say so, but 
when it makes an interesting proposal, as it does in this bill, 
I have no trouble congratulating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we were elected.  We are trying to fulfil our 
responsibilities as best we can.  When the government does 
something well, we say so.  When it falls short, we would like 
the government to listen to what we have to say more often, but 
unfortunately we do not always get our wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions my colleagues, the members for 
Rimouski—Mitis, Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
and Beauharnois—Salaberry have told me about the problems of 
whistles being blown at all hours of the day and night.  I am 
happy to see that clause 18 of this bill amends section 23 by 
adding a section 23.1 that reads as follows: 
<UL>

an area within a municipality if

representatives listening to us this evening.  I remember the 
years when I had the joy and pleasure of sitting on the 
municipal council of Boischatel, which is where I live.  The 
first Monday of the month is always the public meeting, so they

public and municipal councils is that a municipal council 
operates by means of regulations or resolutions. A municipal 
council may therefore, by resolution, regulate use of whistles. 
It is agreed that the municipal council will consult the railway 
company and, if agreement cannot be reached, that it may forward 
the matter to the minister, with supporting arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, during Oral Question Period, there was a planted question 
from a Liberal member to the minister.  I always find this 
amusing, and I think that those listening are anxious to see the 
Standing Orders amended so as to put an end to this masquerade. 
Opposition members do not plant questions.  Ministers do not 
know in advance what our questions will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious waste of the House's time. 
There is so much work to be done, and each question period two 
or three questions come from members on the same side as the 
ministers.  The member reads the question, the minister reads 
the response and turns the pages.  This is a charade from 
another era that should have disappeared a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the parliamentary leaders of the various parties to 
have this system of planted questions stopped.  Nobody believes 
it anyway.  I hope everyone watching knows.  When a Liberal 
member rises to put a question to a minister, the minister knows 
the question is coming and reads the response, which he had 
ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, because Bill C-58 was to be debated tonight in the House, 
the minister had a question from the member for Cambridge, 
concerning whistles as a matter of fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say we support the principle 
behind the bill, because we all want to do the right thing, but 
there are some interesting provisions.  However, we would have 
preferred that the government be more open-minded and accept our 
amendment to clause 19.1 on giving municipalities relief from 
major investments they cannot always afford and for which they 
are obliged to borrow and tax an already overtaxed public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked the government to listen to us, but, despite 
everything, for all the reasons I have tried my best to 
enumerate, I must say that our party supports Bill C-58, which 
aims to increase railway safety.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, that is a pretty hard act to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enjoyed listening to this debate.  I want to inform hon. 
members, and some of the members of my party that I really am a 
railway man.  I was born on the prairies where the only source of 
communication was the mail which came in by train. Passengers 
came in by train.  All goods came in by train and the wheat went 
out by train.  The greatest social event every evening was to go 
down to meet the train coming in to see what lovely girls were 
getting off the train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. parliamentary secretary does not know that in 
Saskatchewan we named a fruit after the railway.  We called 
prunes CPR strawberries and it was not meant in a positive way I 
might add.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Railways were a part of my life and they still are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railway comes through most prairie towns with the station at 
the end and the crossings on the outside of town.  That is not 
always true in some of the larger centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary will probably know of the disdain 
the prairies had for railways, which they still have to some 
extent.  In grade six we had a special class.  All students were 
taught as they got older to hate the railways.  That has been 
part of our vernacular, to be very anti-railway.  However, that 
is coming to a close simply because the railways are 
disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to the transport committee.  I asked for a 
video.  It was a good video, although it was a little long, but 
it was totally made in the U.S.  I suggest once more what to do 
for the thousands of school children in Canada who still play on 
railway property.  We need a Canadian made safety video, which 
would be cheap to make nowadays, to send out across Canada.  I 
have tried to research this and as far as I know we do not have a 
safety railway video available for teaching safety in our 
schools.  That is a must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was once present at a scene where the speed of the train was 
not that great, but it hit a car and there were fatalities.  I 
will never forget that engineer stepping down from the engine. 
It was impossible for him to stop.  He had to live with that for 
the rest of his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is more than just a safety bill.  I believe it is to 
bring to the attention of the Canadian public that we still have 
railways, we still have crossings, we still have people who 
trespass and we need more education.  I urge the parliamentary 
secretary to take that message to the Minister of Transport, the 
Minister of Industry or whoever.  Let us design and produce a 
really good safety video to give to schools across Canada.  That 
would not be a costly venture.  One life saved would be worth the 
cost of the video. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will present to the House one of my intentions with respect to 
Bill C-58.  I wanted to have a firsthand glimpse of what has 
become a very unique problem in my constituency.  There are two 
places in my constituency where what I am about to explain takes 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each aisle in the House will represent a distance of exactly one 
mile.  That is the way the west was surveyed. Most of the trains 
currently in operation are unit trains.  Both incidents happened 
on the CPR Soo Line.  In the new operation, with newer cars 
coming on, the length of the train will only increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to picture this centre aisle as being the centre 
of the city.  Half of the city lives on one side and half lives 
on the other.  The fire halls are all on one side.  The train 
approaches and the flashing lights block off that crossing.  When 
he gets halfway there, this one is crossed. 
The engine comes over here, so we have two crossings now blocked 
by the same train because a 110 unit train will be over a mile in 
length. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fire alarm, but the fire truck is not aware that 
there is a train blocking those crossings.  The centre crossing 
is the one which is used the most.  The fire truck may arrive 
before we get past the first crossing.  By the time we have 
blocked this crossing at least 12 minutes have passed.  By that 
time traffic has built up on both sides of the crossing, so the 
fire truck cannot get through.  Even if the train started to move 
forward in five minutes or seven minutes, that crossing could be 
obstructed for a period greater than 10 minutes.  I witnessed a 
period of 13 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I bring this to the attention of members is because 
this in itself concerns safety.  I believe that the transport 
committee should look at the three groups involved:  the 
municipality, the railway and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no longer any need for rails, such as in the case of 
Regina, as there was no longer any passenger service.  When there 
no longer is a need, as is fast becoming the case in these 
smaller cities, it is incumbent upon the governments of the 
province, the municipality, the federal government and the 
railways to take a look at this situation because sooner or later 
there is going to be a catastrophe because of the length of the 
trains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my day, if there was a train which was a half-mile long, that 
was a long train.  The trains travelling now are well over a mile 
long in most cases.  These trains are presenting new problems. 
First, they need a greater distance to bring the train to a halt. 
Second, because of the length of the train they are often 
blocking two crossings at the same time.  They pose a 
communications problem, particularly for police but mainly for 
fire trucks in these centres.  I would suggest that we take a 
look at the problems that are being created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention one other point that was brought up 
tonight.  The hon. member spoke about the Halifax problem and the 
amount of money that is needed.  CN explained very clearly to the 
transport committee that they can take goods from the port of 
Halifax to the Chicago market, beating the U.S. not only in 
dollars and cents, but by almost 24 to 48 hours depending upon 
the cargo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is incumbent upon this government to take whatever 
steps are necessary.  Should the $40 million be spent?  Yes.  We 
must make sure that our port of Halifax does not lose this 
advantage to the United States.  If that happens, I believe we 
would find that the maritimes would suffer a very severe blow, 
even a greater blow than that which is taking place on Cape 
Breton Island at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if the Minister of Transport is really cognizant 
of the importance of ensuring that this Canadian venture stays in 
place and that we do gain this facility and keep it for the 
welfare of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we will be supporting this bill.  Yes, it was a timely 
bill.  I personally enjoyed going through this bill because of my 
background with the railways.  But let us not ever take it upon 
ourselves to think that this bill is the end all, that we do not 
have to touch anything more.  There are many other factors 
concerning safety which will be coming up with the new modes of 
transportation, the new cars, the new braking systems and the new 
demands on the highways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The railways and the department of highways have to work much 
more closely together than they have in the past.  That is a 
foregone conclusion.  It is not the case now, but it is up to 
this government to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could ever get into a pattern of having a national highway 
program, then the ease of doing this and the ease of working with 
the railways would become a reality and Canadians would benefit a 
great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a plug for the railways and a plug for the highways.  We 
have a national railway policy.  I see no reason why we cannot 
have a national highway policy too. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment.  Although at the end of his speech the 
member said that we have a national railway policy, sometimes I 
am not so sure that we have one.  Our policy in recent years has 
turned over half of our railways, that is to say the CNR, to 
American shareholders.  That is not something which I think is in 
the best interests of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the hon. member for raising the point about 
the longer trains.  That is what I came to the House to talk 
about.  He talked about 110-car unit trains.  However, I have 
information in my office, given to me by people who work on the 
railways, which concerns trains of 157 cars.  We are talking 
about trains that, instead of being 5,000 or 6,000 feet long, 
which was long anyway, are 10,000 feet long.  These trains have 
absolutely no possibility of clearing a crossing in the required 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent regulations are very vague with respect to what 
is required of the railways in terms of clearing crossings in a 
certain time.  They have been made deliberately vague so that the 
railways cannot be held to account for what they are now doing. 
What they are now doing is having longer and longer trains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the problem that the member brought forward, not 
just with respect to the clearing of crossings and the obvious 
safety aspects concerning ambulances and emergency procedures, 
not to mention just plain hassles for people who should not be 
held up that long, but the time it takes to stop and the fact 
that they are running these trains with fewer units, so that when 
trains break down they are stuck for longer periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reinforce the point that the hon. member made.  The 
government, instead of looking somewhat amused by the point that 
I am making, which the member made before me, should take this 
very seriously.  Some day somebody they know could be at a 
crossing, lying in an ambulance, wondering why they cannot 
proceed.  They have to wait for the trains running this way, in 
defiance of safety concerns, merely so the American shareholders 
who own CN can make more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what has happened since CN was taken over by American 
shareholders.  At one point, when it was run by the government, 
there was some notion of safety and the public good.  Now 
everything is according to the bottom line.  Everything is 
according to what Hunter Harrison wants so that he can please the 
shareholders in Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans or wherever 
they are.  Who cares what happens in Transcona?  Who cares what 
happens in Saskatchewan?  That is just a place to make money. 
That is just a place to have Paul Tellier make more money, thanks 
to the plan that the Liberals foisted on this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shameful and disgusting tragedy for which these people 
will be held accountable.  A hundred years from now they will 
still be talking about the betrayal of Canada that was foisted on 
this country by that bunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to go back in time a 
little.  I did some reminiscing and I would like to inform the 
member that, yes, we have lost a number of railways.  I have lost 
a number of miles in my constituency, albeit we knew some time 
ago that it was inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of the words of Will Rogers who visited western 
Canada.  He made the comment that Canadians were building 
railways just for the fun of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not entirely disagree with what my hon. colleague said, but 
from my time as a boy until now, when I look at the various 
safety factors that we have now compared to what we had then, we 
do have more safety factors concerning the railways. 
The hon. member is quite right.  The unit trains of coal which 
come out of Wyoming or come out of Estevan heading east are over 
110 cars.  Most grain trains are 110 cars.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Unit trains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen more co-operation of late between the departments of 
highways and the railways than I have seen for some time.  I will 
admit that it is not perfect.  I do believe that we are on the 
right wavelength as far as safety is concerned.  As I said, it is 
a never ending thing and I hope we do not just close this bill 
and leave it to gather dust on the shelf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe too that the idea of the railways and the 
deregulation and so on has nothing to do from my point of view 
with this bill.  It has nothing to do with the safety regulations 
in operating the trains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would say to my hon. friend that I think he is wrong.  A lot of 
this does have to do with deregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he does not want to admit it because it would be 
uncomfortable for him ideologically. This is a trend that the 
Reform Party, the Liberals and the Conservatives have all been 
together on: deregulation, privatization.  The fact of the matter 
is this does have a lot to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the ways in which the railway is behaving now, 
particularly with respect to longer trains and these kinds of 
things has everything to do with making short term quarterly 
profit margins larger and putting that as a priority against what 
might be in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we agree about the safety problem that longer trains 
pose, I would have to respectfully disagree with him about what 
one of the contributing factors is in the creation of these 
longer trains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the historical lesson from Will Rogers that 
Canadians were building railways just for the fun of it, but the 
fact of the matter is these railways were built.  They did serve 
a public purpose, an economic purpose, a social purpose. They did 
bring the country together. They ought not to be flippantly 
destroyed in the way that I think much of the infrastructure in 
western Canada has been destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a romantic view of the railways.  This is a future 
oriented view of the railways. Sooner or later, and it looks like 
it is going to be later with these guys, but sooner or later we 
are going to have to come to the view that railways are the way 
to go environmentally.  If we are going to be dependent on the 
internal combustion engine, then it should be two or three 
internal combustion engines pulling a train rather than an army 
of trucks going down the road clogging up the highways that 
should be there for the use of ordinary Canadians and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we have 
been talking about in the transport committee.  Even the Minister 
of Transport would agree.  In the hub, the central area from 
Toronto, most of the trains going down will replace up to 274 
trucks on the highway.  It makes good sense that we do this. 
Indeed I would like to see that happen. To me that is one of the 
ways of solving part of the pollution problem. Eventually 
southern Ontario is going to have to move to rail transportation 
whether they want to admit it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just do not want to take the meaning and the purpose of this 
bill and tie it up with deregulation because I do not think that 
has anything to do with the passage of this bill.  I want to make 
that clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-58, which 
deals with railway safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has particular responsibility for ensuring 
transportation safety.  In the past, decisions were not 
necessarily taken with full consideration to the importance of 
safety.  I will give the example of the creation of Nav Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1950"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nav Canada is the body which has taken over responsibility for 
air traffic, and which at a certain point pits profitability 
against the assurance of proper airport security and safety.  We 
see this in all that is going on concerning negotiations on 
airport control towers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, where rail safety is concerned, the bill is 
satisfactory as far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned.  It is a 
bill which modernizes the issue of railway safety.  It is a bill 
which simplifies a certain number of actions in an interesting 
manner, and it must be acknowledged that it is the result of 
work in committee coupled with approval by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting that, when railroad safety is properly 
organized, it makes rail travel even more interesting, and in a 
way gives the environment of Quebec and of Canada a chance, 
because train travel is a means of transportation which protects 
the environment far better than many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point of view, then, this is worthwhile. It is 
important that this be done properly, because we are in a period 
of major change in the rail sector, a context of privatization. 
I do not think that we need to decide between the pertinence of 
privatization and railway safety.  When making decisions on 
this, safety is paramount, because when private companies are 
involved, responsibility for safety takes on the legal framework 
given to it by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the private sector intervenes increasingly in the railway 
sector, it needs solid and proper guidelines to ensure the 
safety of both those who ride the train and those who use it as 
a means of transporting equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, short line railways have sprung up.  These rail 
lines give new life to the network.  For example, in our region, 
between Matane and Rivière-du-Loup, the Société des chemins de fer 
du Québec bought a rail line from the CN.  This local company 
will develop this section of line, possibly providing a link-up 
with ports and other means of transportation. 
These short line railways must operate in accordance with 
adequate safety rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have happened in the past, for example in Mont-Joli, a 
railway junction, proving the need for clear and compelling 
regulations for both businesses and other stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is that Via Rail is soon going to be franchised. 
This will have an effect on safety too, because it carries 
people.  How will they organize in the event of accidents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this bill had to be considered taking account of all these 
new railway market conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some very good provisions in this bill, but 
improvements that could have been made were not accepted.  I 
would like to return to an amendment that was proposed by the 
Bloc Quebecois, by the member for Argenteuil—Papineau acting on 
behalf of the member for Beauport—Montmorency— 
Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, to ensure 
that municipalities facing financial hardship occasioned by the 
cost of maintaining level crossings be given proper financing 
terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all municipalities can afford what it costs to upgrade level 
crossings and introduce appropriate safety measures. That is why 
the Bloc Quebecois proposed an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment was set out in the letter sent by the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency— 
Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans to Pierre Gaudet, 
the mayor of Aston Junction, on January 18, 1999. The letter 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois recently proposed an amendment to the 
legislation that would provide a solution by requiring railway 
companies to assume the costs of maintaining their lines.  After 
all, it is only fair that a company maintain what it owns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment indicated, I feel, a willingness to assign 
responsibilities appropriately and to see that negotiations 
between municipalities and railway companies were on an even 
footing.  When a municipality of 500 or 1,000 people comes up 
against CN in this sort of negotiation, the parties are not 
always fairly matched.  It would have been interesting to see 
the company's responsibility spelled out clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not done, but that is no reason to scrap the bill.  It 
would have been an interesting improvement for all small 
municipalities in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this bill will modernize safety in our railway sector. 
I would have liked to see provision made for experiments, such 
as giving passenger trains priority over freight trains on 
certain lines at particular times of the day, or setting aside 
certain lines for passenger trains rather than freight trains, 
and including this in the bill as interesting experiments.  If 
they were included in the bill, companies would not be liable 
and this would have facilitated the introduction of new 
approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular issue I am going to address concerns 
municipalities in my riding. 
By way of example, Saint-Philippe-de-Néri, a small municipality in 
my riding, and Trois-Pistoles, a small city that is important in 
cultural terms and because of its impact but that is part of a 
region.  I give Saint-Philippe-de-Néri as an example, because it 
is particularly relevant.  This municipality took steps to have 
enough barriers to ensure safety.  This way it could put an end 
to the famous whistle that bothered people at night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some interesting legislative provisions in this 
regard.  Now, with a resolution by the municipality, in 
accordance with the regulations, the whistle will be heard no 
more.  This is much simpler than before.  So there has been a 
gain in terms of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that, as in the other example I gave earlier, the 
financial responsibility for the studies required is not clearly 
established.  Specifically, Saint-Philippe-de-Néri was presented 
with a bill for $2,500 by Canadian National for a feasibility 
study to put the appropriate security measures in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadian National, with the profits it makes, $2,500 is not 
an astronomical figure.  But for a rural municipality, it can be 
pretty significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I approached the minister on this.  I think he lent me an 
attentive ear.  The minister's response today to the question by 
the Liberal member seemed to confirm this.  I hope that the 
companies will take steps to assume the costs when they are 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a case like this one, I hope Canadian National will return 
the money it demanded in order to have the change in place 
before the bill passed.  The bill was not passed, but changes 
were coming and Canadian National could have taken them into 
account before billing the municipality.  That would have been 
interesting.  It would have been a good gesture on the part of 
Canadian National as a show of social responsibility.  Something 
we did not see in the past with the job cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concrete example to help, with a little ad hoc 
financial assistance, a number of municipalities to have changes 
made to improve the quality of life of those living beside the 
railway.  At the same time, an appropriate safety system would 
be in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now municipalities would have a way of making changes simply, 
under the law, without being hampered by the size of the cheque 
they might get from CN or any other company owning the railway. 
That would be important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, there are a number of municipalities from La 
Pocatière to Saint-Simon that are crossed by a rail line.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will be wanting to take advantage of this possibility, when 
they see that the bill makes it possible. They will perhaps be 
stopped by the size of the bill that will be run up if CN 
maintains the same position it has to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, then, the Bloc Quebecois is pleased to vote in 
favour of this bill.  Once again, this is proof that, when a 
constructive bill is at stake, we are capable of going along 
with the government position.  In our first mandate from 1993 
to 1997 the Bloc was the party that voted most often with the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, when things runs contrary to the interests of 
our constituents, we are capable of showing that too.  We did so 
with Nav Canada.  Unfortunately, the reality is that these are 
two different cases, seeing what is going on with airport 
security and safety, and particularly the pressure that is being 
brought to bear on this body to ensure cost-effectiveness by such 
actions as cutting back on the number of control towers across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where air travel is concerned, we would have liked to have seen 
a result similar to what we have before us today.  Is the 
difference there because railway safety has been around a long 
time?  It is hard to know why, but we would have liked to see 
the government taking the same attitude to both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the bill is passed and that ultimately there 
are fewer obstacles to the safety of passengers and goods 
transported by rail, that this is achieved as simply as possible 
and, as I was saying earlier, with the co-operation of the 
companies, so that now that the administrative obstacles have 
been removed, we are not impeded by unacceptable costs to 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see what this bill will make possible in the years to 
come and, if in a few years improvements are required, let us 
hope that the government has the wisdom to agree to the 
necessary amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, we in the Reform Party truly would like to 
be able to support this bill because in many ways it fits with 
the Reform principle of devolution of decision making closer to 
the people who actually have to live with the effects of that 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For far too long the decisions with respect to aboriginal people 
in Canada have been made in Ottawa and the obvious results of 
that are everywhere across this land.  In that vein, we looked at 
this legislation long and hard and really wanted to support it 
and would really like to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we see some flaws in the bill that can be fixed with 
amendments.  We see some flaws with respect to the disposition of 
marital assets in the event of a marriage breakdown.  We see some 
flaws with respect to consultation with communities, surrounding 
municipalities and so on adjacent to reserves to be covered under 
the land act, and we see some real concern with respect to the 
expropriation rights that bands will receive under this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in talking about the way the Liberals respond to 
constructive suggestions, it is just typical for them to say “we 
don't agree with you”.  We could have had this legislation 
through the House before Christmas had the Liberals and other 
opposition parties agreed to fix these flaws in the bill.  Of 
course we have not been able to achieve that and that is why our 
amendments are on the table now and why we are debating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin with Group No. 1 amendments.  They deal with concerns of 
adjacent municipalities, municipalities that were not consulted 
with respect to Bill C-49. I think that is important because it 
really does tell a story about how the Liberals approach 
government and passing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been a relatively easy exercise to have the 
adjacent municipalities where this legislation was to have an 
impact notified, consulted and asked for their opinions prior to 
drafting the bill and prior to bringing the bill before 
parliament.  Sadly that has not happened.  Sadly municipalities 
have been left out of the picture. It also really does 
demonstrate the Liberal government's lack of concern on what is 
arguably a very sensitive issue.  We all know that this is a 
sensitive issue.  Land is always a sensitive issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good neighbours, in our view, always discuss development plans 
which may affect or impact on their neighbours next door.  It is 
only sensible that people would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago at my home I decided to build a fence.  The fence I 
was to build was on a property line separating my property from 
my neighbour's.  Before I constructed the fence I talked to my 
neighbour and told him what I intended to do.  I told him what 
kind of fence I intended to build and asked him if he had a 
problem with it.  I told him that if he had any objections that I 
would like to know before I spent any money on building the 
fence.  I told him that if he had a problem we could sit down and 
talk about it to see if we could work out some sort of 
resolution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation is vital in these matters.  In the matter of the 
bill before us it is vital that bands that are to receive the 
decision making authority under this legislation have some 
requirement to consult with adjacent municipalities.  That 
requirement for consultation should run both ways.  It should not 
just be one way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many things we must plan for such as transportation 
corridors, services and so on that there has to be some sense of 
reasonable integration.  All our amendment serves to do is 
require neighbouring municipalities and neighbouring aboriginal 
bands to sit down and talk about their plans, to make sure there 
is integration and that there are not two communities working at 
cross-purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I underline that our amendments are not intended to provide a 
veto for anybody else's decision making authority.  That is not 
so.  They are intended to require that a band coming under the 
umbrella of Bill C-49 actually proves it has consulted with 
adjacent municipalities prior to implementing changes in its land 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lack of consultation goes further than with just 
municipalities.  I will discuss the expropriation provisions in 
the bill.  That is really important.  It is important for 
Canadians to understand that.  It is important for those Liberal 
backbenches who are not familiar with this bill. It is important 
for them to understand the tremendous powers of expropriation 
that are to be handed over in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation grants the right to expropriate if “in the 
band's opinion it is necessary for community works or other first 
nations purposes”.  The phrase “other first nations purposes” 
is a very broad statement.  It is very wide open in terms of 
interpretation.  It could mean virtually anything. You could 
establish almost any reason as a reason for another first 
nation's purpose.  It could be a golf course, a condominium 
complex or a casino.  If the band were to determine that was a 
first nation purpose within the meaning of this legislation, it 
could expropriate people from their homes including band members 
and non-band members who may be on leased land on that reserve. 
That band could do this because it had decided this was a better 
purpose for the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know municipalities, provinces and the federal government 
must have a higher purpose than that before they enact 
expropriation legislation.  This bill would grant that kind of 
power without defining the actual services that might be required 
by the community for the band to enact expropriation proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Muskoday people have already designed a land code which I 
am familiar with.   Within their land code they have defined the 
reasons they would use expropriation.  That is a much clearer, 
more focused definition.  We certainly find it is much more 
agreeable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about this lack of consultation because I think it 
is so important.  Most of us are familiar with what happened on 
the Musqueam reserve in Vancouver.  This has come about as a lack 
of consultation.  The department of Indian affairs induced 
non-Indian lease holders to come on to the reserve in 1965 to 
build homes and to enter into long term leases.  The long term 
leases were between the department of Indian affairs and the 
lease holders.  In 1980 without any notice or consultation, the 
minister of Indian affairs of that day, a Liberal minister, Mr. 
John Munro, signed an authority under section 53 of the Indian 
Act that gave the band all rights to deal with the leases. 
Although the department of Indian affairs was named on the lease 
and that is who the lease holders had signed their leases with, 
it was the band that was dealing with the leases from that point 
on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No notice was given to the leaseholders.  That is the crux of 
the problem that many of those leaseholders face today. I have 
just come back from Vancouver having spent hours in meetings with 
the leaseholders on the Musqueam reserve.  They have not been 
consulted on Bill C-49.  They are not familiar with the clauses. 
They have not been told that this is coming.  They have had to 
find out from people like me and others in recent days that this 
land management act could very much affect them, and this is 
outside the problems they already face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong with this legislation.  There is no 
requirement to consult.  The people who are going to be affected 
by this ought to have that right and expectation that they are 
consulted.  They have not been consulted.  It is a flaw and it 
must be re-thought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am honoured to speak to Bill C-49, the First Nations Land 
Management Act, tabled sometime around June in the House of 
Commons by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an honour for me to be speaking this evening because 
we have chiefs with us here in the House of Commons, who come 
from Ontario among other places.  They are Chief William McCue, 
of the Chippewa of Georgina Island, Chief Austin Bear of the 
Muskoday First Nation in Saskatchewan, Chief Bill William of the 
Squamish First Nation in B.C. and Robert Louie, acting chair and 
former chief of the Westbank First Nation in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will apply to the 14 First Nations that developed this 
initiative and that signed the Framework Agreement on First 
Nation Land Management in February 1996.  It will allow First 
Nation participants to establish their own land and resource 
management regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government-to-government agreement puts an end to the 
discretionary power of the minister under the Indian Act, by 
allowing the 14 first nations to opt out of the sections of the 
act governing land management.  As well, it allows the 14 first 
nations to implement a community consultation process for the 
development of general rules and procedures respecting, in cases 
of breakdown of marriage, the use, occupation and possession of 
first nation land and the division of interests in case of 
marriage breakdown.   At the present time, the agreement and the 
legislative measure apply solely to participating first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative, a significant component of self-government,  was 
drawn up totally in conjunction with these first nations. These 
communities are opening up the way for changes to land 
management by implementing a new land management regime and by 
opting out of the Indian Act. 
This legislative measure will return administrative powers to 
the communities and will do away with the minister's 
participation in the day-to-day decisions on land management and 
in the activities of these first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Austin Bear, Chief of the Muskoday First Nation, 
“the framework agreement and the legislative measure recognize 
our fundamental right to manage our reserve lands and our 
resources.  As well, they ensure protection of our lands for 
future generations, by banning any transfer or sale, or any 
expropriation by provincial or municipal governments, both of 
which are now possible under the Indian Act.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief William McCue of the Georgina Island First Nation said: 
“I strongly urge all parties in the House to support this bill 
and to pass it quickly.  Once the framework agreement has been 
implemented, we will be in a position to respond to economic 
opportunities and to generate jobs and income for our members. 
Georgina Island will then truly be open for business.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government's message “Gathering Strength: Canada's 
Aboriginal Action Plan” establishes the direction of a new 
relationship between governments, native groups and 
organizations, and the private sector, founded on the principles 
of mutual recognition and respect, responsibility and sharing. 
This initiative is built on the kind of partnership that makes a 
positive contribution to the lives of aboriginals.

will be established by each first nation.  These regimes will be 
harmonized with federal and provincial environmental regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development, I call on the members in the House this 
evening to support this bill so as to help our aboriginal 
friends in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to talk about the process of consultation that went on for this 
bill to get to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 was Bill C-75 in the previous parliament.  Just to 
develop the framework agreement process the chief had to go to 
his council to be allowed to continue a process.  He next had to 
go to his elders for approval in direction.  He next had to go to 
his community.  They developed the framework agreement.  We are 
talking about 13 bands and the 14th joined later. They voted on a 
framework and a land code.  Then it had to be ratified by their 
community before they could carry on further.  We are talking 
about six years and then into parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 14 bands out of over 600 in this country, this legislation 
will allow them or hopefully will let them opt out of the Indian 
Act. This is not a land claim we are talking about.  We are 
talking about a land management act for 14 bands.  It would be in 
keeping with some of the recommendations by the Royal Commission 
on Aboriginal Peoples.  It would be something that would give 
some guts to the “Gathering Strength” document that is now a 
year old and certainly needs something to show for the vision 
that it put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would devolve power.  It would devolve political 
evolution for the first nations involved and it would give them 
some self-determination.  We are only talking about one section 
of the Indian Act and only for 14 bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land management will be the responsibility of the first 
nations.  I will give an example of something that came up at the 
committee meeting.  Some of the witnesses thought that first 
nations should not be given the burden of governing themselves. I 
disagree.  They have the right to govern themselves and in this 
small way we can assist them to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other comments at committee that the Indian Act was 
just fine, that in fact Bill C-49 was a racist document and that 
we were giving them this power because they are Indians.  The 
fact is we took away everything, their language, their children, 
their land, because they were Indians and enforced the Indian Act 
because they were Indians.  We are saying that it is all right to 
take it away because they are Indians but we will not return 
anything because they are Indians and therefore it would be 
racist. That is just not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only a small piece of legislation that will make an 
incredible difference in the lives of these 14 bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Union of British Columbia Municipalities met on November 13, 
1998 and set out an agreement.  The meeting was cordial and 
resulted in a general agreement on a process for mutual 
consultations between municipalities in B.C. and those first 
nations in B.C. who are parties to the framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill covers bands in many provinces and territories so 
hopefully that will be a standard set for other bands and 
communities to follow in order to come to mutual agreements.  The 
bands involved, as I said, are in B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Ontario and New Brunswick.  It is a pretty broad 
coverage of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of controversy over this bill, as I think there 
usually is when anything is in transition and means real change 
for people.  It is a major step in decision making power over 
land.  It has a lot of good points in it.  It replaces the Indian 
Act for these 14 first nations.  It gives them lawmaking powers 
with respect to their land and resources in development, 
conservation, protection, management, use and possession but no 
taxation power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be able to develop or lease their land but they cannot 
sell it.  They may expand through negotiation.  They can acquire 
land for community purposes.  It sets out very stringent 
conditions of accountability between the first nations and their 
citizens both on reserve and off reserve.  That includes all 
their members, not just those who live on the reserve but people 
who for whatever reason had to leave a reserve to make a living 
or get an education or who have chosen to live elsewhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government retains the fiduciary responsibility for 
first nations.  A lot of these first nations would probably opt 
out of the Indian Act if they could, but they cannot.  This does 
set out a community process that will be established by the first 
nations people for their bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of controversy is matrimonial breakdown. First 
nations people have different cultures. My immediate thought was 
that they should have divorce settlements and laws that are 
consistent with what I think is just.  Perhaps what I think is 
just is not what they think is just, considering that the 
property is community and my history is titled and property owned 
by individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations would have a different thought process on how 
they would look after families, women or children who do not have 
the same access to property that I do. The fact is first nations 
people have not had that process in place because the Indian Act 
did not allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill will do is that within one year first nations 
people will have to deal with how they will settle and look after 
matrimonial property. They will do it based on their culture.  It 
has been explained to me that some are already doing it.  This 
has never been recognized because the Indian Act has not covered 
it, but the first nations have been looking after their people 
the best way they can.

go forward very quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak at report stage of Bill C-49, the first 
nations land management act.  This bill was introduced in the 
House last June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased to speak to this bill as it will apply 
among others to the Chippewas of Mnjikaning first nation located 
in the riding of Simcoe North which I have the pleasure of 
representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the final step in the process to allow 14 first 
nations the power to opt out of the land management sections of 
the Indian Act and establish their own regime to manage their 
lands and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will ratify the changes brought on by a framework 
agreement.  It is an excellent initiative based on <I>Gathering 
Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan</I> and will bring real 
and practical improvements to the lives of aboriginal people 
including those of the Chippewas of Mnjikaning first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process began with negotiations leading to the signature on 
February 12, 1996 of the framework agreement on first nations 
land management, known as the framework agreement, and 13 first 
nations.  The 14th first nation was later added to the framework 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several other amendments were made to the framework agreement, 
including the application of the Atomic Energy Control Act and 
the clarification regarding the use, occupation, possession and 
division of interest in first nations land in the case of a 
marriage breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement will require first nations to develop a 
land code setting out basic rules for the new land regime.  First 
nations such as the Chippewas of Mnjikaning will also be required 
to enter into individual agreements with Canada to determine the 
level of operational funding for land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I previously mentioned, provisions have been included in the 
bill to address the concerns raised by native women and 
associations representing them.  These provisions should allay 
their concerns.  The bill will require a mandatory community 
consultation process for the development of rules and procedures 
applicable on the breakdown of marriage in relation to the use, 
occupation and possession of the first nations lands and the 
division of interest in that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One specific motion I would like to speak to from Group No. 1 is 
Motion No. 6.  This motion is to amend the bill that would 
require confirmation in writing that consultations respecting the 
land code have been completed with neighbouring jurisdictions, 
thereby changing the whole intention of clauses 45 and 48 of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is ill defined as it does not set out who falls under 
the rubric “neighbouring jurisdictions” and seemingly involves 
consultations not on the land code but rather on 
cross-jurisdictional issues, an altogether different matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to note that other first nations had expressed an 
interest in participating in a land management regime like the 
one proposed in the bill.  This is proof that the model being 
proposed is a positive one that appeals to many first nations.  A 
provision is in the bill to permit other first nations that may 
want to adhere to the bill the opportunity to do so subject to 
certain conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation is very much looking 
forward to the rapid conclusion of the ratification process.  I 
have had the pleasure of following the issue and providing 
assistance to the Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation regarding 
this important initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an exciting prospect for the Chippewas of Mnjikaning First 
Nation to have an opportunity as a community to collectively 
devise and manage a land management system tailored specifically 
to its needs.  It will also allow the Chippewas of Mnjikaning an 
opportunity to generate additional revenue through economic 
development activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I quote Chief Lorraine McRae of the Chippewas of 
Mnjikaning when she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative is an opportunity for the full and active 
participation of the members of our First Nations—elders, women 
and men, both off reserve and on reserve—to collectively develop 
land management systems appropriate for our communities based 
upon fairness, equality and accountability.  I am confident that 
through this government to government partnership, we will 
achieve true community decision making.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
rise to my feet I ask for you indulgence as I have a question. As 
I understand it, these amendments are at report stage and 
specifically the amendments put forth by the hon. member for 
Skeena, Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 7, are what we are debating at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been following the debate closely and noticed that a 
number of members did not follow that at all and actually got off 
on some tangential items, including the next series of amendments 
from the Bloc party which we will be debating after.  Am I 
correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for South 
Shore is once again proving just how wide awake he is.  While all 
the others assembled here did not pick up on that, he certainly 
did and brought it to the attention of the House.  He may be sure 
that the Chair will ensure that from this point forward the 
debate is strictly on the motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will speak to the report 
stage amendments to Bill C-49, the first nations land management 
act, and specifically Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 7 put forth by the 
hon. member for Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments allow first nations to join the framework 
agreement in accordance with section 45 but only on the condition 
that the first nations prepare land codes in consultation with 
neighbouring jurisdictions.  Approval from neighbouring 
jurisdictions would be required and they would have written 
confirmation that they meet the laws of the provinces in which 
they are situated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would impose on the first nations provincial or 
municipal laws without allowing the first nations to develop 
their own laws in consultation with the people of the first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the advantages of the legislation is to allow first 
nations greater autonomy over management of their resources and 
to remove the restrictions placed upon them by the Indian Act. To 
instead require compliance with provincial and municipal laws 
without allowing the first nations to do so within their own land 
codes and by their own decision contradicts the objectives of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may be advantageous for first nations to follow 
provincial laws—and some of the first nations have drafted land 
codes that reflect provincial laws—there is no need to change 
the legislation to make this mandatory.  This would not allow 
first nations to develop rules according to their tradition of 
consensus.

<A HREF="#LINKT114"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments ignore the purpose of the legislation, namely 
to allow first nations to manage their resources through 
consultation with their members.  This places an onerous 
responsibility on first nations that is not reciprocated by the 
neighbouring jurisdictions and is therefore not equitable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
must say the speaker who just spoke obviously has never been to 
B.C. where we have the potential for 50-plus different sets of 
governments with different rules if there is not some sort of 
conformity in the way that municipalities relate to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I was astounded to hear a member of the NDP, and woman at 
that, standing and defending the right of bands to deprive women 
of their matrimonial property rights on the basis of culture. It 
is absolutely amazing that position would be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same speaker also mentioned there was an agreement in place 
with the B.C. Union of Municipalities for consultation with band 
members.  That is simply not the case.  There was an agreement on 
a draft for a possible proposal which had to be submitted to the 
chiefs.  Since November there has been no confirmation from the 
chiefs that they have accepted that draft.  There is still great 
uncertainty in terms of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason I am taking part in the debate by discussing 
these motions is the pressure from the three municipalities in my 
riding affected by the bill that have no communication of any 
meaningful level with the band which will have the power to 
develop its reserve in my riding.  In addition, I have had a 
tremendous amount of submissions from rank and file Squamish band 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the early debates which took place at the beginning of 
December I was approached by a delegation of 18 Squamish band 
members who came to my office to urge me to oppose the bill. 
These are the very people who are supposed to be beneficiaries of 
the bill.  They came to me to complain about it.  Why?  I will 
read one of the petitions they sent today.  About 150 signatures 
came in on petitions today alone from Squamish band members in my 
riding.  Let us listen to what they say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge you to vote no to Bill C-49.  We are status members of 
the Squamish Nation.  Our band council did not inform us about 
Bill C-49.  We did not know that council signed a framework 
agreement on February 12, 1996.  We did not know that the 
Squamish Nation made representations on our behalf in Ottawa in 
December of 1998.  We are concerned that the manner in which this 
information has not been provided to us is completely contrary to 
the openness protocol for treaty negotiations that the Squamish 
Nation, Canada and British Columbia entered into on October 27, 
1995, which we were informed about.  We are concerned that the 
power that can be legislated to council pursuant to some sections 
of Bill C-49 will supersede the provisions of the band's own land 
code.  We are concerned that if Bill C-49 is passed our ability 
to participate in a democratic process will fail to be realized 
and we will not be able to define the future of the Squamish 
Nation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of input from people who are supposed to 
benefiting from the bill.  There is something wrong if more than 
100 people in one day sign a petition on that reserve saying that 
they do not want the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an obligation to represent their interest in this place. 
Their most serious complaint is obviously the lack of 
involvement, the lack of consultation with band members, which is 
the same complaint the municipalities are raising.  Despite what 
the NDP member said there is no agreement in place.  There is no 
process for communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reserve in my riding probably has the most valuable land in 
the entire country.  It is a strip of land along the foreshore of 
the harbour of North Vancouver with spectacular views of downtown 
Vancouver.  The concept that is contained in the bill is 
tremendous:  to allow the people who live there to develop those 
lands without the constant bureaucracy of the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the way it is being done is upsetting and causing fear 
for band members who do not know what the chiefs will do with 
this land.  The main objection or concern raised by band members 
was from those who hold what are called certificates of 
possession.  These are like our equivalent of fee simple titles 
to houses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2040"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT116"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT116"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2040

<A HREF="#LINKT115"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Band members can hand down these certificates of possession to 
their children and grandchildren.  However the provisions of 
section 28 of the bill state that the band council for no other 
reason than the council's deciding it is in the interest of the 
band can expropriate anything on that reserve.  People who have 
lived their entire lives on this land could have their homes 
expropriated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rumour on the Squamish reserve in North Vancouver is that 
the members will be uprooted and moved to Porteau Cove, which is 
on Howe Sound where there is another part of the reserve, so so 
that the entire piece of reserve on the foreshore of North 
Vancouver can be cleared and developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where it runs into the problem with the surrounding 
municipalities.  The bill permits the band to develop its land 
code with no consultation whatsoever with the surrounding 
municipalities.  There is no requirement, not even the basics 
that are present in the municipal act of B.C.  It does not even 
apply. In an urban setting in the middle of Vancouver we have 
this little entity that does not even have to consult with its 
neighbours and that can do anything it likes in its land code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A delegation of 18 members came to my office to meet with me. 
They told me they were terrified that even the voting on the land 
code would not be democratic.  It only requires 50% plus one of 
the band members to vote and only 50% of them have to approve the 
land code, which is about 25% of the total voting membership. 
That 25% in the Squamish nation approximates roughly to the 
members who work for the band council, the actual employees of 
the band council.  The fear being expressed to me as their member 
of parliament is that this means one family can basically control 
what is in the land code on this reserve.  The lack of 
consultation being expressed is a serious concern that we need to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have encouraged the chief to be involved in more consultations 
in the community.  It would help things go much more smoothly if 
there were a feeling of good will.  If the band and 
municipalities knew what was going on we could work together to 
make this a really successful bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Skeena and I have already said, the concept 
of the bill is good.  We want it to proceed but surely we need to 
put a few checks and balances in there to make sure certain 
processes take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill says that the land code must be developed by band 
members themselves.  I have discussed this point at length with 
the band members who have approached me.  Many of them, more than 
three dozen, have personally phoned me or come in to see me.  I 
have tried to convince them that they must take some 
responsibility for their own future.  They must get together, be 
proactive and take part in the process.  I cannot change that for 
them.  I urge those who are watching the debate to be active in 
the development of the land code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will pass.  We know it will pass because of the way the 
House works.  I urge members to listen to what I have said 
tonight.  I have not talked about ideologies.  I have talked 
about input from the people the bill is supposed to be helping. 
They are expressing their concerns to me.  We should listen to 
the words they are passing on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to support the amendment that at least requires 
some consultation in accordance with the provisions of the 
municipal act in the province in which a reserve is located.  It 
is not unreasonable for an urban riding smack bang in the middle 
of Vancouver at least to have discussions with surrounding 
municipalities about how to provide traffic access, how to 
provide water, electricity, sewage services and all the 
infrastructure needed to make it work properly.  It cannot be 
done in isolation.  It has to be done with co-operation and 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put incentive in the bill to make it happen.  Then let us 
support the measures so the bill can be effective in helping 
these first nation Indian bands develop their own land holdings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise again and restate my support for Bill C-49.  This 
act will implement the framework agreement on first nations land 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, this bill is a major step toward first 
nations self-government.  I am proud that the New Democratic 
Party has been the only party since our first days that has 
fought for first nations self-government.  This is their 
inherent right as the first people to live in our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the words of the Reform members regarding 
first nations issues.  Their arguments have been misleading to 
say the least.  They have been trying to exploit negative 
stereotypes about aboriginal people.  The most absurd claim has 
been that this bill will allow first nations to break federal 
search and seizure laws.  They have obviously forgotten about 
section 8 of the charter of rights and freedoms which protects 
everyone from unreasonable search and seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most dubious thing about this claim is the Reform Party's 
unspoken assumption that first nations intend to abuse power. 
They instantly assume the worst of the first nations.  They 
assume that if first nations have power they will abuse it.  The 
idea that first nations are unable to handle power or properly 
govern themselves ignores their history.  It overlooks the fact 
that they governed themselves for thousands of years before 
Europeans immigrated here and seized control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 31 first nations in my riding of Churchill, over half the 
first nations in Manitoba.  I know that the first nations do not 
want to manage their land so they can abuse power. They simply 
want to end their dependence on Ottawa.  The government has run 
their lives for over 100 years.  The result has been poverty. 
First nations know that they can run their lives better than 
government bureaucrats can.  This bill will give them the chance 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago the hon. member for North Vancouver copied a 
letter for me that he had sent to a mayor in his riding.  This 
letter expressed his opposition to this bill.  It said that Bill 
C-49 would let first nations pass laws.  As a result, the member 
said this would result in different first nations having 
different laws.  The interesting thing is that he left it at that 
as if it were obvious that this would be a bad thing.  The letter 
also said that this bill would allow first nations to have 
economic development without consulting neighbouring communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it should not be necessary, I am going to address 
the two points I just mentioned.  Perhaps the Reform Party is not 
aware that different first nations have different cultures.  Each 
has a unique history, a unique land and a unique economy.  It 
makes perfect sense that they have different laws in certain 
areas.  What a double standard for the Reform Party which 
promotes decentralization in federal-provincial relations to 
oppose it for first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for consulting with neighbouring communities on economic 
development, I agree that it is desirable.  I am of the 
impression that there will be a process for consultation.  This 
is as a result of a meeting with the first nations and the union 
of B.C. municipalities on November 13, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations would be wise to form friendly and open 
relationships with their neighbours.  These kinds of 
relationships benefit everyone involved.  In my riding many 
communities have a first nation reserve and a non-reserve area 
side by side.  The ones that do best are the ones where the first 
nation government and the town government work well together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a great step forward toward the eventual goal of 
full self-government for first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all the chiefs involved in reaching this 
agreement.  In particular I want to congratulate Chief William 
Lathlin of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation and Grand Chief Francis 
Flett of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak.  The Opaskwayak Cree 
Nation is part of my riding and is signatory to this agreement. 
Both these leaders were instrumental in its reaching this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am very pleased with this bill I want to conclude my 
remarks by reminding the Liberal government that there is still 
much to be done.  The United Nations has rightly slammed Canada's 
treatment of aboriginal people.  I quote from last 
December's report by the United Nation's committee on economic, 
social and cultural rights: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is greatly concerned at the gross disparity between 
aboriginal people and the majority of Canadians. There has been 
little or no progress in the alleviation of social and economic 
deprivation among aboriginal people.  In particular, the 
committee is deeply concerned at the shortage of adequate 
housing, the endemic mass unemployment and the high rate of 
suicide, especially among youth in the aboriginal communities. 
Another concern is the failure to provide safe and adequate 
drinking water to aboriginal communities on reserves—almost a 
quarter of aboriginal household dwellings require major repairs 
for lack of basic amenities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not have said it any better myself.  The words gross 
disparity sum up the status of aboriginal people in Canada.  The 
Liberal government says it is concerned about this but its lack 
of action says it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a duty to work in partnership with 
first nations governments to address these problems.  The Liberal 
government has ignored almost all the recommendations of the 
royal commission on aboriginal peoples.  Instead it has only made 
a few token gestures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever I criticize the government for its lack of action on 
aboriginal concerns, the minister of Indian affairs points to the 
aboriginal healing fund as though it solved everything.  Yet I am 
constantly hearing from my aboriginal constituents about this 
money not being available for vital projects.  It does 
not go nearly far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues have been calling on this government to 
implement the recommendations of the royal commission.  The few 
it has implemented are not enough.  Not implementing the rest is 
a betrayal of all aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat my call to the Liberal government to implement the 
royal commission on aboriginal peoples recommendations. 
Aboriginal people are tired of this government's stonewalling. 
They are tired of half steps.  The time for real action is now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak on report stage of Bill C-49, the first 
nations land management act.  This bill is a step forward. It is 
an initiative that came about in partnership with 14 progressive 
first nations peoples.  I call on all of my colleagues to realize 
that they cannot support Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for an alternative land management regime 
whereby participating first nations control their lands and their 
natural resources by removing them from under the Indian Act 
provisions respecting land management while the remainder of the 
Indian Act continues to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a positive model, a model not only to be implemented now 
but for the future transfer of land management to other first 
nations.  There was also a protocol by which other first nations 
could be added to this bill as a result of an order in council. 
There are procedures in the bill regarding how this could occur. 
Provisions have also been included to address the concerns raised 
by native women.  I know an earlier speaker brought up the 
situation of native women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the motion before us, it will in some way change the 
intent of “Gathering Strength” and the intent of this bill.  It 
is important for our Reform colleague to recognize that 
consultation cannot be mandated. To suggest at this point in our 
history that we will legislate consultations between the first 
nations and municipalities is unacceptable to the first nations 
and to us as Canadians who are working to arrive at justice, 
fairness, equity and all those things for our first nations 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the motion before us would modify the conditions that 
were already agreed on by 14 signatory first nations in the 
framework agreement.  The impact will somehow change the intent 
of the bill, to mandate, to define or to limit.  The intent is 
really to change the bill in some way. 
I think that we need the support of all members on all sides of 
the House to resist such a transformation and such changing of a 
bill which has so far the agreement of so many parties.

jurisdictional issues.  We need respect the codes we have before 
us. At the same time having had aboriginal people come together 
and agree on the items within Bill C-49 we should go ahead and 
support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I stand not to make a lengthy speech but really to support 
Bill C-49, to call on my colleagues on all sides of the House to 
oppose Reform's intention to dilute, to change and to modify the 
intent of Bill C-49.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not appreciate the name calling.  I 
think it is very undeserved. I do not know about the other 
members of this House but I have done more than just talk about 
helping aboriginal people and native people in this country.  I 
spent 15 years in northern Alberta trying to bring 
self-government to non-treaty Indians.  I have nothing to 
apologize for in the work I have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share some of these experiences in the north 
because I think it is very appropriate for this debate on Bill 
C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an interesting experience because I was helping 
non-treaty aboriginals in a community immediately adjacent to a 
reserve.  It was a case in point of how when the federal 
government moves in and hands over things to a community that is 
ill prepared to deal with them it is for not.  In the non-treaty 
community where we were providing potable water, sewage 
collection, land ownership, self-government we were producing 
results that were never seen in the reserve adjacent to the 
community although the people were related and from the same 
cultural background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that is the non-treaty Indians were accountable 
for the decisions they made. They were accountable for the 
dollars they were spending.  They were accountable to the people 
who lived in and shared the community with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw fire trucks going into the reserve with no support base 
and they were never used for the purpose for which they were 
intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the non-reserve side we saw a fire truck, after a great deal 
of debate and a great deal of work to get it, brought into the 
community, treated with respect and which provided services not 
only to the non-reserve community but to the reserve community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also saw the non-treaty community supporting the reserve by 
providing sewage treatment for the school that was built and for 
the health centre that was built.  For whatever reason the 
federal government under the Indian Act was ill prepared to deal 
with that kind of development.  It took the non-treaty, the 
non-status Indians in their community to provide that kind of 
community support and leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to wonder what will happen with this bill if it is 
not properly legislated.  There are some areas where I have 
difficulty accepting it as it is presented to the Canadian 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think people can foresee the future but we can look at 
what has happened in the past with the experiences we have to 
give us some indication of what might happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with the House an instance that happened 
in 1993 after I was first elected.  The very first situation that 
I had to deal with as a member of parliament was a community in 
the Semiahmoo Indian Reserve.  It was a community that was 
leasing property.  Some of these leases had been in their 
families for 40 to 50 years.  Because of a decision by Indian 
affairs of removing itself from the responsibility, nine out of 
the eleven people who came to my office looking for help ended up 
losing their homes, ended up having to leave.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share some of the comments with the members of 
the House.  These are excerpts from letters received from a 
couple of families.  They state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can you dismiss the fact that your department put us in this 
hell?  They refused to issue one year leases on instructions from 
the Semiahmoo band in September 1993.  They refused to take our 
lease money.  They have not cashed cheques from persons remaining 
on the land to date.  They refused to talk to us after 20 years 
of tenancy.  They refused to quell the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the remaining tenants, six have vacated as ordered by the 
DIA in a letter dated January....  The penalty is double rent for 
daring to speak out and the others have struck their own deal 
with the bands knowing that if they do not perform it will go 
against them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have lost their homes. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our neighbours we formed associations to negotiate a lease. 
We made an offer to lease.  We did everything that we were 
capable of doing.  They wanted us to sign a non-negotiable 
consent to lease offer before we had even read it.  If we did not 
agree we were out in nine days.  We could not sign it.  It would 
be like signing a blank cheque. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of situation these people were put in.  I would 
suggest that there has to be clarity in legislation to protect 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recommended two amendments to Bill C-49.  One amendment 
would require a clause to be written that this would in no way be 
considered to be a land claim under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act.  The second amendment would require that 
proactive consultations be held with adjacent municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share another experience that I had in Slave 
Lake, Alberta with the Sawridge Indian band.  I was on the town 
council when we negotiated a deal with the Sawridge band to 
provide them with water and sewer facilities which they wanted 
for a laundromat for the hotel they had built.  In an agreement 
with this band the town obtained the use of a little section of 
land going through a corner of their band property in exchange 
for providing them with water and sewer facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago I received a call from the mayor of the town who 
said “Val, you are the only one we can track down.  We need to 
know what has happened because Walter Twinn is suing us.  The 
Sawridge band is suing us for this piece of property that the 
town is using for the road which runs across a corner of the 
property”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a written agreement with the Sawridge band that this 
would be an exchange:  water and sewer facilities for a little 
chunk of road.  Twenty years down the road that agreement was not 
being respected and the town of Slave Lake found itself in legal 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that whatever we do in this House be better 
than what we have done before.  The Indian Act has proven to be a 
failure.  It has left people dependent on government.  People 
have lost their independence.  They have lost their self-respect 
in many cases.  It is a shame that we allowed that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be a part of continuing in that kind of 
environment.  Our aboriginal people have the right to be treated 
equally, to have equal rights and equal responsibilities, as does 
every other Canadian in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be going down this trail without clarity, 
expecting that the same thing will not happen.  Somebody gave us 
the definition of insanity.  It was doing the same thing over and 
over again, expecting a different result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to me to be what we continue to do.  We continue the 
same old policies over and over again.  We may use different 
words, but we expect different results.  It is insane to expect a 
different result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to, with clarity, come up with an agreement with the 
aboriginal people that will remove them from the dependent status 
they have and will continue to have under the department of 
Indian affairs.  We have to release them.  We have to encourage 
aboriginal people to take on the responsibility which every other 
Canadian has.  Bills such as Bill C-49 is not going to do it.

the same old thing over and over again, expecting a different

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise this evening to speak in 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to listen to the member for Churchill talking 
about amendments that we wanted to make to this bill and how we 
hoped that it would happen anyway.  Other members have made 
comments about the Reform Party and what its role is in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure there are a lot of good things in this bill, but our party 
asked for two amendments.  Our members said that if those 
amendments were accepted we would let this bill pass through the 
House.  However, the Liberal government refused those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read into the record a letter which I just received a few 
minutes ago.  The letter is from the Lower Mainland Treaty 
Advisory Committee.  For those members who do not know where the 
lower mainland is, it encompasses the majority of the population 
of British Columbia, all of the municipalities in the lower 
mainland.  It is represented by mayors who represent the New 
Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Reform Party and others. 
This is what they wrote today to the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management is an Act 
that will apply to 14 First Nations across Canada.  Under the 
Framework Agreement, those signatory First Nations will develop 
their own land codes to apply to their reserve lands.  The land 
code will set out the principles, rules and structures that will 
apply to the land.  Once a land code has been adopted, the Band 
Council may, in accordance with the land code, make laws 
concerning the management, development, use, possession and 
occupancy of the reserve land.  The new Act will replace the land 
management provisions (sections 53-60) of the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bill stipulates a number of requirements that a First Nation 
must meet in establishing a land code.  One requirement is a 
community consultation process (Band members only) concerning the 
development of general land code rules for the reserve lands. 
Secondly, before a land code can be enacted, it must be approved 
by a majority of eligible Band voters.  Thirdly, a Minister and 
the First Nation shall jointly appoint a verifier who will 
determine if the land code is in accordance with the Framework 
Agreement (the Act) and will monitor the community approval 
process of the land code. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of the Lower Mainland Treaty Advisory Committee 
are: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local municipal leaders and the UBCM have raised two specific 
concerns with Bill C-49: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The legislation provides no requirement for consultation with 
neighbouring municipal governments on land use and other issues 
of mutual interest, nor with non-aboriginal people living on 
reserve lands; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  Given that the Province of British Columbia is already 
engaged in the British Columbia Treaty Commission treaty process 
to address issues including land use and self-government, the 
application of Bill C-49 appears to be creating a second parallel 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the B.C. treaty process, municipal governments are full 
members of the Provincial negotiating team.  As such, their 
representative sits at the treaty table as part of that team and 
has the opportunity to provide comment and input to the 
Provincial negotiator on the treaty.  In the Greater Vancouver 
area, municipal governments co-ordinate themselves under the 
Lower Mainland Treaty Advisory Committee.  By contrast, with 
respect to Bill C-49, municipal governments have had very limited 
opportunity to consider and provide comments on its implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Consultation: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bill contains no provisions for any form of consultation 
with neighbouring municipal governing jurisdictions concerning 
the development of the land code.  With respect to third parties 
who have an interest in the reserve land that is to be subject to 
the proposed land code, the Bill states only that the Band 
Council shall, within a reasonable time before the vote, take 
appropriate measures to inform those third parties of the 
proposed land code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Squamish Band is one of the 14 First Nations across Canada 
who are signatory to the Framework Agreement.  The three North 
Shore Mayors recently met with Squamish Chief Bill Williams to 
discuss the Bill.  The issue of lack of requirement for 
consultation with municipal governments was raised at the meeting 
and the Chief acknowledged that the Bill contains no such 
provisions.  He stated that it was his intent that consultation 
with adjacent municipal governments will be a part of the 
Squamish land code. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from North Vancouver and I met with the same mayors 
and the chief and proposed the amendments to try to solve this 
problem now and not wait for something to come along later that 
will cause problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this statement appears reasonable, it actually leaves two 
major concerns for municipalities: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Municipalities would greatly prefer that any such requirement 
for consultation be included directly and specifically in Bill 
C-49.  This would provide the requirement for meaningful 
consultation (not a veto) as part of the formal document, and not 
be left up to whether or not any particular First Nation is 
willing to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the suggestion that this issue is primarily a concern 
in British Columbia and therefore need not be included in an Act 
which covers all of Canada and many other First Nations and 
municipalities, we would suggest the wording in the Act requiring 
a consultation would apply to: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Those signatory First Nations in British Columbia to this Bill 
and in other parts of Canada that do not presently have a formal 
agreement requiring reciprocal consultation”.  This would then 
enshrine the principle of consultation in the Act, whether or not 
such agreements already exist in other parts of Canadas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Municipal Act in British Columbia requires municipalities to 
refer a plan to the council of an adjoining municipality if the 
plan affects an area of that municipality.  This does not provide 
the adjoining municipality with a veto, only with the opportunity 
to become informed and make comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. Assuming that a First Nation does consult about a proposed 
land use with its municipal government neighbours, with or 
without a requirement to do so, what mechanism is there to 
resolve disagreements?  The only reference to dispute resolution 
in the Bill centres on disputes between a First Nation and the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, not with 
neighbouring municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drafters of the Bill may not have contemplated the concerns, 
raised above, particularly if their focus was on the many rural 
reserves across Canada.  However, not unlike the treaty process, 
arrangements and approaches that may work in a rural setting may 
be totally inappropriate in an urban setting.  Given the 
complexity of many different jurisdictions operating in our urban 
area and the need for co-ordination on issues of land use and 
transportation planning, it is essential that the Bill not be 
enacted by Parliament without first providing an opportunity for 
municipal governments to assess the Bill and provide comment to 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Parallel Process Concerns: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be an opportunity for municipalities currently 
engaged with the Provincial team in treaty negotiations to feel 
assured that Bill C-49 provisions will not eliminate the 
opportunity for negotiations to occur on important issues 
including land use and self government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Draft resolution from LMTAC meeting of January 27, 1999: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was moved and seconded 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Lower Mainland Municipal Association (LMMA) be advised 
that the Lower Mainland Treaty Advisory Committee has not had the 
opportunity to assess the ramifications and impact of proposed 
Bill C-49 at the local government level and that the LMMA request 
that the federal government delay further consideration of the 
Bill pending consultation with local (municipal) governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you for your careful consideration of our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sincerely yours,

the Prime Minister has set up to tell him why western Canadians 
do not vote Liberal.  This is a prime example.  The opposition 
has asked very fairly that two amendments be made to this bill 
which were recommended by all the lower mainland municipalities 
of British Columbia, and many of the mayors are Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing our job as the opposition to try to get this bill 
through the House.  As we said, if those two amendments were 
adopted we would vote tonight to get this bill out of here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not adopt those two amendments.  The 
majority of the people of British Columbia want those amendments 
to be made to this bill.  Every other municipality in British 
Columbia has to do what we are asking be put in this bill.  If 
they want to build something in my constituency in West 
Vancouver, they negotiate with my colleague for North Vancouver 
and tell him what they are doing and how they are going to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Squamish band is one of the wealthiest in the nation.  It 
owns the majority of the foreshore in North Vancouver and West 
Vancouver.  It leases that land at very high rates, including one 
lease that the Liberals signed 20 years ago for land to build an 
environmental building on.  That piece of land is still empty, 
with the lease at $4 million a year.  The lease rate will 
increase to $7 million this year for an empty piece of land.  The 
band is not doing poorly.

on their land.

quickly.  That is all we are asking of this Liberal government. 
Listen to the people of British Columbia. Do what they are 
looking for the government to do.  The government should not go 
blindly into what its lawyers are telling it to do.  That is the 
problem here. Lawyers dealing with the ministry are saying “This

giving something away”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to speak to the first group of amendments to 
Bill C-41 which includes Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start my presentation by reading a fairly lengthy paper 
by Wendy Lockhart Lundberg entitled “Native Women Threatened by 
Federal Bill”.  The author is a registered status Indian and a 
member of the Squamish nation in B.C. If the government is not 
willing to listen to us on this bill, I hope it will listen to 
the grassroots aboriginal people who have something to say about 
this bill.  I strongly encourage the government to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This paper makes a case for the amendments we have put forth in 
this group.  It makes the point very clearly that this 
legislation needs some change, that it is not as widely accepted 
as some members of the governing party claim it to be. It is time 
to listen.  Maybe the government has not listened to the 
grassroots aboriginals in particular but I encourage the 
government to listen to Wendy Lockhart Lundberg now: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While media attention focuses on the formal treaty process, 
federal actions are attempting a legislative end-run around 
treaties by offering bands powers over land management.  Native 
women will bear the brunt of these legislative provisions and 
will be denied the protections they could be afforded through 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little-publicized government bill, C-49, the first nations 
land management act, is scheduled for third reading in parliament 
next week and poised to become law.  Bill C-49 would give legal 
effect to land management agreements which have already been 
signed by 14 bands.  These include my band, the Squamish, as well 
as Vancouver's Musqueam band and ones across the country, and 
will be open to other bands in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 grants participating bands almost unlimited powers 
over the ownership, management, and expropriation of band lands. 
The implications of C-49 for the rights and position of native 
women are large, and the B.C. Native Women's Society (supported 
by three major organizations) has lodged a court case against the 
federal government to require that issues of native women's 
rights be properly addressed before enactment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the marriages of native women fail, as all too many do on 
account of poverty and related conditions, they and their 
children typically lose the family home.  Their ex-spouses 
typically get possession of the family home, based on decisions 
of the band council.  The women often have nowhere to live on the 
reserve, and may end up in the worst circumstances in urban 
ghettos.  Unlike all other Canadian women, native women on 
reserves do not have the protection of property division laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 contains two provisions which are particularly 
worrisome for native women.  First, it states that rules and 
procedures regarding the use, occupation, and possession of land 
upon the breakdown of marriage will be determined by the land 
codes of each signatory band.  Yet, there is little assurance 
that these future provisions will be any less tilted against the 
interests of women and their children than the results of the 
current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-49 offers band councils draconian powers of 
expropriation, which must concern native women as well as other 
native people living on reserves and non-natives with leasehold 
interests. 
Specifically, “a first nation may ... expropriate any interest 
in its first nation land that, in the opinion of its council, is 
necessary for community works or other first nation purposes”. 
The band need give at most 30 days notice to expropriate, and it 
is obliged to pay “fair compensation” that can be disputed only 
under rules set by the band itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to listen to this part in particular. 
It is worth listening to some of the problems that come as a 
result of the way this is being proposed. The paper goes on to 
state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only may these powers be used against native women; they may 
also be used against band members outside the governing elite. 
For example, the Squamish nation has valuable waterfront property 
in North Vancouver, rumoured to be the subject of band council 
plans for commercial redevelopment.  These plans could displace 
many band members living there to a reserve area up the coast, 
thus making expropriation powers very useful to the band council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, any party having a leasehold interest on a reserve 
has reason to fear the strong expropriation powers for bands in 
Bill C-49.  With the sword of quick expropriation hanging over 
their heads, current leaseholders will find few parties willing 
to buy their leasehold interests, and their property values will 
plummet.  A band can then expropriate their property by offering 
“fair compensation” at the depressed market values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A band council's expropriation powers will be unlike those of a 
municipal or senior government; it will be able to expropriate 
for any “other first nation purposes”, not limited to the need 
to build schools, highways, and the like.  Many bands see their 
lands as a major means for economic development, so that 
leaseholders can expect their land to be expropriated whenever a 
band finds a more valuable use (the band will fully control 
zoning). But with this ever-present threat, how many non-natives 
will want to make the investments needed for development or 
leasehold arrangements with bands? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I hope this government is listening to that thought which 
is coming from a band member.  It is well worth listening to 
because it is an important point. She goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother lost her native and band status when she married a 
non-native many years ago.  Her status was restored following the 
1985 amendments to the Indian Act, but her father's property was 
never returned to her.  The Squamish band allows someone else to 
occupy the property and uses its diverse powers to block my 
mother's efforts to regain her familial home.  Under Bill C-49 
her land could be permanently lost through expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Squamish nation has sent a council member to Ottawa to 
support Bill C-49, while not informing the general band 
membership of the existence of the bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to repeat this because I do not think that message is 
sinking in.  She says that the Squamish nation has sent a council 
member to Ottawa to support Bill C-49, while not informing the 
general band membership of the existence of the bill.  I think 
that really shows the lack of knowledge on the part of band 
members about this bill because they have not been told about it. 
I digress.  I will finish reading the paper: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Squamish nation has even intervened, on behalf of all the 
signatory bands, on the side of the federal government and 
against the B.C. Native Women's Society's Bill C-49 lawsuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that my mother's rights, and those of many other 
native women, will be lost forever if Bill C-49 is passed in its 
present state.  Their chances of obtaining legally binding 
provisions that restore their human and property rights would be 
much better served through an openly debated treaty process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 was introduced into parliament by a female minister of 
Indian affairs, and its passage would be enacted by Her Majesty 
in right of Canada.  I doubt whether either of these women shares 
native women's concerns about their lands, homes, and families. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up.  I remind the members of the 
government who are here that the author is someone who 
understands this issue extremely well. 
She has written a very thoughtful paper.  I think she has 
presented the case in balance.

tonight. The member for Vancouver North said 100 people from the 
band signed a petition in such a short time saying that they do 
not want this to pass. The member for West Vancouver—Sunshine 
Coast and the Lower Mainland Treaty Advisory Committee said that 
they do not want this to pass as it is, as did municipalities in 
the lower mainland.  The list is growing and growing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
we have before us tonight a historic piece of legislation.  Bill 
C-49 is a piece of legislation that provides for an alternative 
land management regime whereby the participating first nations 
control their lands and natural resources by removing them from 
under the Indian Act respecting land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased tonight to stand in the House and 
wholeheartedly support this legislation.  I am honoured to 
represent, as the member of parliament for York North, the 
Chippewas of Georgina Island, one of the 14 first nations 
affected by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real pleasure to know that Chief Bill McCue along with 
other members of the band council and members of the Chippewas of 
Georgina Island first nations are here tonight watching this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with somewhat mixed emotions that I stand here tonight. It 
is really appalling to hear what the members opposite, the 
members of the Reform Party have been saying throughout this 
debate on first nations. It is a continued refrain we hear from 
that party whenever we enter into debate in this House on first 
nations. It is rather disturbing to know that I have constituents 
here who have to listen to this.  The Reform members show an 
absolute lack of sensitivity and a lack of understanding of first 
nations issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there was a Reform member in this House who said that we 
cannot foresee the future, it is clear that the members of the 
Reform Party only see a bleak and negative future for first 
nations.  It is shameful.  The Reform Party should be ashamed for 
holding up this legislation.  This legislation is urgently needed 
by the Chippewas of Georgina Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 after I was first elected as the member of parliament 
for York Simcoe at the time, one of my first responsibilities was 
to attend a meeting with Chief Bill McCue, members of his council 
and members from the regional office at Indian affairs. It was 
through this meeting and subsequent dealings that I realized the 
difficult challenges first nations in this country have in 
controlling their own destiny and in controlling land that is 
rightfully theirs to control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the process of my dealings with the Chippewas of 
Georgina Island and after the urgings of Chief Bill McCue, I 
spoke to the then minister of Indian affairs and asked him to 
consider this legislation. He met with the chiefs from across 
this country and decided to go forward with this legislation.  I 
am pleased to say that the signing for the framework agreement 
was held on Georgina Island in my riding.  The chiefs from across 
the country were at this very historic event which Chief Bill 
McCue hosted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a wonderful opportunity to see how these communities have 
come together to work in a very progressive and enlightened 
fashion, to deal with the special and unique challenges of first 
nations.  They have grassroots support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot about grassroots.  I am not entirely sure what 
grassroots the Reform members are talking about but I can talk 
about the grassroots support I have in the riding of York North 
on this legislation.  They had 91% of the people of Georgina 
Island supporting this very important legislation. 
This work has been going on for eight years.  These people cannot 
wait any longer.  They have 500 leases that must be negotiated 
and are coming up for renewal this spring.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has shown an incredible level of 
irresponsibility in holding the legislation back.  It is 
appalling and it is shameful.  With regard to their concerns 
about how first nations operate and relate to municipalities, 
they take isolated situations and in typical Reform fashion blow 
them up into stereotypes which they continually present over and 
over again to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the House about the kind of relationship 
the Chippewas of Georgina Island have with their municipality. 
They have a very positive, progressive, well founded 
relationship.  They have signed service agreements in the areas 
of fire protection, garbage services, police, health and 
education.  They have shown themselves to be very substantial 
members of not only their community but of the larger community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from the Snake Island Cottagers' Association 
calling upon the government for speedy passage of the 
legislation.  The letter is dated December 2, 1998 and reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Sir, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As president of the Snake Island Cottagers' Association (SICA) I 
urge you on behalf of our members to expedite the second reading 
of Bill C-49.  This as you know will eventually result in 
self-government for several Indian bands, especially the 
Chippewas of Georgina from whom we lease cottage lots on Snake 
Island.  Our current 25 year leases expire as of April 1999.  We 
(SICA) strongly support the Chippewas band's quest for 
self-government and feel that the passage of Bill C-49 will 
facilitate a new leasing arrangement between our members and the 
band.  More importantly it will recognize the sovereignty of the 
band over their lives and lands. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this is all about and that is what members of the 
House must remember.  It is the sovereignty of our first nations 
and finding a way to correct the abuses of the past.  I tell 
Canadians who are watching tonight that this is what Reform 
members are missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians of good will and good intent see the necessity for 
the legislation.  I urge the House to speedily pass the 
legislation.  A few minutes ago I had a discussion with Chief 
Bill McCue.  For those who are interested, Chief Bill McCue said 
“It's about time we determined our own destiny”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
very privileged to be able to enter this debate.  There are a 
couple of points I wish to make particularly in reference to the 
member who has just spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a feeling that the only reason the Reform 
Party brought some amendments forward is that somehow we are 
opposed to the step that is being taken.  That is not the issue. 
The issue is that this is not the final word on how to grant to 
first nations some sovereignty over the lands and some of the 
things they want control over.  The issue is to determine a 
relationship with which we can all live with greater comfort and 
with greater harmony than has existed heretofore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to exist on the government side of the House almost 
a feeling of arrogance that once its members have spoken and 
presented a piece of legislation there cannot be a single iota of 
improvement to it.  How could that ever be the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a human being in the House who cannot improve 
whatever it is the government is doing.  That includes my speech 
this evening.  I want to make it abundantly clear that the member 
who just spoke deliberately misrepresented what the Reform Party 
stands for. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT126"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make abundantly clear that I am not rising in this 
debate to indicate to members opposite that I am totally and 
unalterably opposed to the bill before the House tonight.  That 
is not the issue.  The issue is that the bill attempts to do 
something which I think is a step forward, but as usual it is a 
tiny step forward. It is a timid step forward.  It is an 
inadequate step forward and it is an incomplete step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to lift the legislation to a level that they can 
be proud of, that the members of the House can be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order just to interrupt the hon. member for a moment.  He used 
language which I believe all of us would agree is 
unparliamentary.  He said that the member had deliberately misled 
the House.  I would ask him to withdraw those two words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would ask the 
member to kindly withdraw his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Madam 
Speaker.  I did not hear the same words the member said.  In fact 
I do not think that is what our member said.  I would like you to 
clarify with the Table exactly what was said prior to asking our 
member to withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Very well.  I will 
ask the Table to look at the blues and I will come back later 
with a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, if I used the word 
misled I withdraw that word, but I do not believe that I used 
that word.  I think what I said was misrepresentation, and there 
is a big difference between those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another illustration of not listening properly to the 
grassroots and not even listening properly in the House.  The 
time has come for us to get real and honest about these kinds of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize what the legislation is attempting to do. 
It is to draw some very clear boundaries.  Some people would call 
them fences.  There is a proverb that says good fences make good 
neighbours.  My good friend who is one of these land surveyor 
types says good laws build good fences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are trying to do tonight is build a law that is better 
than the one that is being proposed.  A fence is being proposed 
here but it has holes in it, some pretty big holes in it.  It is 
through those holes that we get some difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put clearly on the record for members opposite to hear 
and for my colleagues to support that we recognize among our 
first nations that we have some of the proudest and most 
respected citizens of the country.  They are hard working people. 
They are patriotic.  They do the kinds of things we want done in 
the country.  The fact that they want some self-determination, 
that they want to preserve their culture, is a demonstration of 
how strongly they feel about themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations of the country have a tremendous reason to be 
proud.  In the face of tremendous opposition and difficulty they 
have maintained their culture.  That is why we have this 
legislation before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that and commend them for it.  I also recognize that 
they should not have powers that are unique, better or different 
from those that exist for all other Canadians.  We are before the 
law, before the Constitution, equal Canadian citizens of Canada. 
That is an issue we do not want to forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some technical difficulties with the bill as well.  I 
want to deal with them now.  First I deal with the question of 
powers.  The bill gives powers to the council to enforce the 
standards that exist under federal environmental law.  It gives 
it powers to go beyond the provisions in the environmental law 
with regard to assessment and with regard to the process of 
projects with environmental implications.

<A HREF="#LINKT127"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read subclause 21(3).  It is a rather interesting clause: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nation laws respecting environmental assessment must 
provide for the establishment, in accordance with the Framework 
Agreement, of an environment assessment process applicable to all 
projects carried out on first nation land that are approved, 
regulated, funded or undertaken by the first nation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a separate set of observations.  They must be within 
the standards set up by the legislation, but beneath that there 
is a process and there are details that can be changed by the 
first nation.  As a consequence it can be delayed.  It can be 
altered.  All kinds of things can happen.  This is not to suggest 
that they would do this.  The idea is to create a law that 
creates fairness and equity for all participants who are affected 
by that law.  That is what we are concerned about.  That is a 
very significant issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House says that the band or the council 
shall have a land code.  That land code shall include, according 
to subclause 6(1)(f), a community consultation process.  However, 
subclause 10(1) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the verifier determines that a proposed land code and a 
proposed community approval process of a first nation are in 
accordance with the Framework Agreement and this Act, the council 
of the first nation may submit the proposed land code and the 
individual agreement to the first nation members for their 
approval. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is interesting.  In the first instance the council must 
have a land code.  That land code must provide a consultation 
process.  However, in terms of the actual land code there is no 
approval process for the members who will be directly and 
indirectly affected by that land code before it is approved. That 
is very interesting.  It puts the power in the hands of the 
council utterly and completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that whenever we put absolute power into the hands of a 
group, whether it is a first nation group or any other kind of a 
group, it has the potential of abusing that power.  I do not want 
legislation to provide that kind of an opportunity.  I want the 
legislation to provide checks and balances to power so that it 
will not be abused.  I not suggesting they will; I am suggesting 
we want to make sure that they will not.  This is the business of 
building a fence that does not have holes in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 is a very clear motion.  It says that there shall 
be consultation with the band council that has a land code with 
surrounding communities.  It does not say that there has to be 
agreement on everything.  The best solutions are usually found 
when there are opposing positions or there are different 
viewpoints on something. We are asking for consultations so that 
we can bring about a better resolution than is the case at the 
present time. That is not provided for in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must provide for that kind of consultation and make it 
mandatory.  Members opposite have heard the letters from the 
bands, from municipal councillors and from the mayors.  We are 
trying to help them.  Will they please listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are all products of our history and our environment. 
We all view the world from our own vantage point. 
It has been proven by medical authorities that it is more 
stressful for a human being to listen than it is to talk.  It is 
for sure that you learn more when you listen than when you talk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a diversity of circumstances, a diversity of 
communities and name calling that does not suit the side over 
there that has been doing it.  How long will this work?  We are 
not here to advocate wishful thinking.  We are here as 
legislators trying to create the best possible piece of 
legislation.   This legislation is amendable.  We could support 
it with amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore said that consultation 
cannot be mandated in the legislation but I beg to differ.  There 
is a lot of legislation in this country that mandates 
consultation.  That is what we are looking for.  We are looking 
for clarity. The fact that consultation is not viewed as 
something that would contribute to the bill is one more reason 
that it is not hard to understand why the Liberals need a western 
task force when common sense is in such short supply on that 
side. British Columbians are tired of imposition of a federal 
native agenda in British Columbia that is not sensitive to local 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Churchill said that Reform thinks first nations 
will abuse power.  This has nothing to do with race.  Any 
legislation we design in this place must be designed with checks 
and balances, native or non-native, it does not matter.  We use 
the same tests.  This has nothing to do with race, gender or any 
other circumstance.  We are not doing our job if we do not do 
this thing properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this legislation is even getting lost in this 
debate.  This bill will impact on relationships between bands and 
local governments in a number of areas, including land use 
planning, environmental regulation and protection of third party 
interests.  The federal government is imposing its will in terms 
of creating legislation that will disrupt local and provincial 
relationships.  The Liberal government is not saying that is what 
it is doing and it does not seem to care.  The implications are 
potentially quite far reaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to this bill in November.  I talked about lease holders 
on reserve lands that would fall into being on land subject to 
this bill because they would be lands leased to 1 of the 14 bands 
to which this legislation applies.  I spoke of my concerns and 
why the bill needed to be amended.  Lo and behold we have had a 
seven week running story in British Columbia about the Musqueam 
band and what has happened to lease holders with properties in 
that jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot possibly support legislation that does not address the 
issue of relations between communities and that does not deal 
with consultations on an ongoing basis regarding decisions that 
affect local and provincial jurisdictions in important areas such 
as environmental issues, land use, roads, other infrastructure 
questions and leases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs has been quoted as saying that 
her hands are tied on the Musqueam escalation of leases in the 
neighbourhood of $300 to in the neighbourhood of $30,000.  The 
reason her hands are tied is that the previous minister assigned 
taxation authority to the Musqueam without any checks and 
balances. 
That is the very thing we are talking about here today.  Now she is 
blindly walking into an expansion of similar situations for the 
Musqueam and others.  The lease holders are unilaterally having 
their leases rearranged so they are no longer with Canada.  They 
are subject to taxation without representation. Why is democracy 
being negotiated away?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development allowed 
three years of negotiations to occur in secret with the 
Caldwell Band near Blenheim in southern Ontario and is now 
suffering a public backlash.  Surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister now says the Caldwell land claim should have been 
handled with more public consultation and she gives the example 
of the Nisga'a comprehensive claim in British Columbia.  I can 
assure the House that is an empty statement.  The public was not 
consulted prior to the signing of the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forestry representative and member of the treaty negotiation 
advisory committee said publicly: “I cannot say we worked on 
this document because we never saw it until February 15, just 
hours before it was initialled.  Not one page, not one paragraph 
of this 150 page document was shared with the treaty negotiation 
advisory committee or any of the local advisory committees or any 
of the people with legal interests in the crown land that this 
agreement would give to the Nisga'a”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this government handles its aboriginal affairs is 
archaic.  There is no vision.  The expropriation powers in this 
legislation are sweeping: “A first nation may expropriate any 
interest in its nation land that in the opinion of its council is 
necessary for community works or other first nation purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I wanted to quote from a document from the 
Squamish Band but my colleague beat me to it.  I think it is very 
important to point out that these expropriation powers are above 
and beyond anything that a municipality or other form of 
government has.  So why does the minister perpetuate reserves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard about the definition of insanity.  We take something 
that is not working, repeat it over and over and hope that 
somehow it turns out different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Caldwell Band circumstances in southern Ontario were 
creating a brand new reserve.  Have we not a better idea after 
130 years of proving to ourselves that the reserve system is not 
the way to go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a very similar circumstance occur in the western United 
States, a band with no land base.  It was mandated to be given a 
land base, so what did it do?  The legislative authorities 
decided that they better try to do something different that might 
work for a change.  They came up with a land base and they said 
that land will belong to the band. That is your industrial base. 
We are going to ensure that you have homes in the community.  We 
will buy every beneficiary in the band a home in the community. 
It is yours.  You can do what you want with it in the future, but 
your land base is not zoned for residential use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me that is creative and avoids the problems of creating a 
community that may not work like so many of our reserve 
communities have not worked because of the fact that they are 
away from where the workplace really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we fail to recognize that checks and balances are needed 
in aboriginal legislation?  Why are we failing to represent the 
interests of tens of thousands of lease holders whose original 
leases were with Canada?   Do not tell me this is not affecting 
Ontario because I know it is.  There are lots of cottage owners, 
including a large group up in North Bay, I have been in touch 
with on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this bill tonight.  My colleague 
from another party said earlier that Reform was approaching this 
bill with a double standard.  I think not.  I think we are 
approaching this with a single standard for enjoyment of property 
and opportunity for all fairly.  That is the reason we object to 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a number of opinions on this bill and I think it is 
important to keep the focus on how we can improve the 
legislation.  Our aboriginal people have been marginalized for 
far too long and the government has rarely done something to 
improve that for them.  Hopefully we can change that this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a lot of problems and obstacles encountered by rank 
and file band members during formulation of this bill.  Many have 
not been involved and they are concerned that their interests are 
not being met in this lack of grassroots consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band councils have a responsibility to involve and include 
all aboriginals in the process.  There are a lot of grassroots 
concerns when it comes to dealing with section 28 and the issues 
surrounding expropriation.  Some band members are even afraid 
their own people will drive them out of their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 28 also leaves many unanswered questions about the 
process required when non-aboriginals are dealing with bands in 
land and lease negotiations.  The uncertainty is leading to 
dramatic decreases in the value of the land in the disputed 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 may only expedite land expropriations and escalate 
tensions unnecessarily.  It is important to remember that I am 
referring only to a small number here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless there is grassroots consultation there is a great chance 
that development will not match the aspirations of the community. 
This would be permanently divisive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family has had experience in the eastern part of the country 
where they too leased from aboriginal people 15 years ago.  When 
they leased to develop their property, the lease rates were low 
and attractive enough for them to move there and to develop 
property.  After 15 years the lease rates escalated to such 
heights that it lost the viability of having the property. They 
sold it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was that when they sold it, they could not sell the 
property for what they paid because the lease rates were too 
high.  There are dangers and risks of that happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many problems already exist for the current government systems 
on reserves.  How could a proud people who receive a decent 
amount of money each year end up in poverty?  It is because so 
much of the money does not get to the grassroots members.  We can 
understand their fears for granting chiefs additional power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some bands have millions of dollars in the bank but their 
members are relying on outside charity assistance to fill the gap 
left between the transfers to the councils and the transfers from 
the councils.  Many believe this legislation will only 
concentrate that power further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 28 is not the only problem area.  There are also growing 
concerns that the treatment of women under Bill C-49 would be a 
big problem.  There are not adequate provisions to govern 
situations of marital break-up.  The division of property, 
possessions and use thereof are not adequately addressed in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 contains two provisions that are particularly 
worrisome for native women.  First, it states that rules and 
procedures regarding the use, occupation and possession of land 
upon the breakdown of marriage will be determined by the land 
codes at each signatory band.  There is little assurance that 
these future provisions will be any less tilted against the 
interests of women and their children than the results of the 
current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs must get her head above the sand. 
The very people she is claiming to assist are the ones who are 
being left in the cold.  She must develop a clear communications 
network between all participants, particularly the grassroots 
members. 
This is the only way we are going to develop trust between the 
parties. An open and honest consultation process is essential. 
Currently this is not the case.  Many of the existing problems 
can be traced back to these fundamental communication breakdowns.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A communication network is essential outside the bands too. 
There are a lot of communities that deal with the band councils 
daily on a business level.  They need to be assured that there 
will not be confrontational styles of relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 will not provide enough assurances to outside 
communities that land codes will be consistent and in harmony. We 
could end up by having the new industrial area right next to the 
newest park.  We could have homes placed in the path of 
pollution.  I am sure we could think of many other examples. It 
is important to co-ordinate these efforts with the surrounding 
communities.  We must remember that people who live together must 
work together too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns that one level of government with powers 
restricted from others will cause problems and inhibit the 
co-operation I have been promoting.  There is a concern long 
before lawyers get hold of C-49.  After lawyers get hold of C-49 
we could be in for the ride of a lifetime, especially when 
dealing with clauses 20 to 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can lawmaking powers associated with criminal law be given 
to band councils?  Is this not the role of parliament?  Is that 
not unconstitutional?  There are many, many questions that have 
to be asked about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully recognize the good intentions underlying this bill and I 
know a great deal of work has been done in developing it. 
However, we cannot pass legislation that opens a legal can of 
worms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support development on the reserves.  It is important that 
aboriginals be free to contribute to their immediate and 
surrounding communities as they see fit.  If C-49 passes, we will 
see disputes and mistrust long before we will see co-operation 
and harmony.  We must remember that it has historically been 
these disputes and mistrusts that have prevented many bands from 
proceeding with development long before now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not right and in my humble opinion it should not 
pass.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I took the advice of one of the speakers from the Reform 
Party and I listened for the past couple of hours to the debate 
on the amendments to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening and talking to some of my colleagues and others 
and getting some advice on this, I have come to one fairly 
inescapable conclusion.  The Reform Party simply does not support 
self-government. I do not know how I could arrive at any other 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear to me that what the Reform Party has done is 
to put forward amendments that are pure nonsense.  I guess it has 
done this in an attempt to hide what it is really saying under 
the guise of supporting some minority individuals who have spoken 
out and expressed concern which under normal circumstances would 
be laudable.  The Reform Party simply does not want to see any 
self-government or any land claim agreements or any kind of a 
deal made with these first nation communities that would provide 
them with the dignity they have been negotiating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we arrive at anything else when we look at the fact that 
the provinces have been consulted and they are on side. The 14 
chiefs of the first nation communities have signed and gone 
through the democratic process on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really hearing is that the Reform Party does not 
trust them to be able to make their own decisions.  It does not 
trust these first nation peoples to be able to run a democratic 
community, allowing for people to have a say and a vote in 
establishing the land code.  What other conclusion could we come 
to if we look at the substantiveness or the lack of 
substantiveness of these amendments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at one amendment and found it almost laughable. 
Motion No. 7 is one of the three we are debating today.  This 
motion would delete the names of the 14 first nations from the 
schedule but would keep the empty schedule.  What is that? The 
Reform Party says “We are out of new ideas, so let us just 
delete the names of the 14 first nations that signed the 
agreement”.  That is the best the Reform Party can come up with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do Reform members not at least have the courage to stand up 
and tell the truth which is that they do not support 
self-government. They do not support this kind of a deal for 
these first nations. At least we could understand if they had the 
courage to stand and say that and not hide behind nonsensical, 
almost silly amendments, deleting the names of the participants 
to the document.  It is astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear concerns about expropriation.  I have looked at this.  I 
have read through the document.  I have read through the 
information in the bill. It is nothing more than fearmongering to 
suggest that somehow in the middle of the night they are going to 
come along and take away their family home with no opportunity 
for any kind of democratic protection.  It is just not true. 
Members should not say things in this place that are not true. 
We all know that.  We learn that the first day we come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like clarification, Madam Speaker.  The other day 
in question period I was shut down by the Speaker, so to speak. 
I was denied the right to speak when I used the words “not 
true”. I wonder if it has changed for this debate or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>   The hon. member has 
raised a point of debate and not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to help 
out by saying that I was not directing my comments at any 
individual member, to suggest that a member was actually uttering 
a falsehood or an untruth. I was saying that it is wrong and it 
is fearmongering to suggest that some grand powers of 
expropriation are being placed in the hands of some people who 
are going to ignore their own community and throw people out of 
their homes.  That is not true.  That is what I said and that is 
what I say again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the expropriation matter, it is like with any municipality. 
If the municipality needs the land for the common good, then 
there is a process.  There is law in Canada.  This does not 
abrogate that law or the responsibility of the band signing this 
agreement from living up to the terms of that law.  They cannot 
simply expropriate without due value, without due consideration 
and without due process in law, just like a municipality, just 
like a provincial government and just like the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to frighten these folks just because a few have concerns 
and to look for loopholes or ways in which the Reform Party, 
which happens to be the only party in this place taking this 
position I might add, I think there is a hidden agenda.  The 
hidden agenda might be Nisga'a.  It just might be the fact that 
the Reform Party has placed a tremendous amount of political 
capital on the table in the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members feel they have to cave in to some of the more 
extreme municipal officials perhaps. 
They are yelling so I am obviously making a point.  I guess they 
are getting their knickers in a twist.  It is fine for them do do 
that but they should stand up and tell people what they really 
are opposed to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality what we have here is a framework agreement that will 
be established and which will lay out the rules.  It is quite 
clear that the first thing that happens under that framework 
agreement is that a first nation must develop a land code.  That 
land code sets out the basic rules and procedures, reading right 
from the presentation, that will govern interest in land and 
resources after the land provisions of the Indian Act cease to 
apply to these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations put in place the land code.  People understand 
the rules. The people in the actual community get to vote.  If 
they are over 18, they will get to vote on the land code.  Sounds 
reasonably democratic to me.  I do not see anybody hiding.  I do 
not see anybody other than members of the Reform Party using 
scare tactics on this.  I do not see that happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this is putting in place framework agreements with 14 
first nation communities so they can establish land codes through 
a democratic process, through a duly elected council. One of the 
members said that this agreement places the power for governance 
in the hands of the council.  My goodness that sounds radical. 
Imagine that.  Giving power to elected officials.  And they get 
elected presumably over a period of time on an ongoing basis. 
They represent their constituents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  If the member wants to chirp she 
should sit in her seat.  She is eating an apple.  I am sorry, she 
is hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real truth of all of this debate here today is that the 
Reform Party is against giving any kind of self governance, any 
kind of authority to the first nations people.  Members of the 
Reform Party should be ashamed of themselves for standing in the 
way of this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK291"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to express our 
opposition to Bill C-49, the first nation land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is not an effective argument we have to listen for 10 
minutes to political rhetoric and name calling.  Let us focus on 
the argument and look to the lands officials, not the unnecessary 
political rhetoric from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will argue from the point of view of women on this bill.  The 
implications of Bill C-49 for the rights and position of native 
women are large.  The B.C. Native Women's Society, supported by 
three major native organizations, has lodged a court case against 
the federal government to require that the issue of native 
women's rights be properly addressed before the enactment of Bill 
C-49.  Yet this government still pushes ahead with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the marriages of native women fail, all too often because 
of poverty or related conditions, they and their children 
typically lose the family home.  Their ex-spouses typically get 
possession of the family home based on the decisions of the band 
council. These women often have nowhere to live on the reserve 
and many end up in the worst of circumstances. Unlike other 
Canadian women, native women on reserves do not have the 
protection of property division laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native women will bear the brunt of these legislative provisions 
which we are debating today.  They will be denied the protection 
they could be afforded through treaties if we go ahead with this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is for the information of members who are forced to toe the 
party line, those who are just following the talking points given 
to them.  For the sake of those members in the House, Bill C-49 
contains two provisions that are particularly worrisome for 
native women.

<A HREF="#LINKT134"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it states that the rules and procedures regarding the 
use, occupation and possession of land upon the breakdown of 
marriage will be determined by the land codes of each signatory 
band.  Yet there is little assurance that these future provisions 
will be any less biased against the interests of women and their 
children than the results of the current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill offers band councils draconian powers of 
expropriation which must concern native women as well as other 
native people living on reserves and non-natives with leaseholder 
interests in the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 38 of Bill C-49 grants participating bands almost 
unlimited powers over ownership, management and expropriation of 
band lands.  These powers will be used against native women, 
non-native leaseholders and band members outside the governing 
elite, despite the fact that they may have been living there for 
years and years and may have been paying taxes to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can any member in the House argue that two wrongs make a right? 
I do not think so.  This legislative proposal would allow 14 
bands including the Musqueam in Vancouver to expropriate 
leasehold and other interests with less than 30 days notice for 
community works and any other first nation purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, because of the refusal by the Musqueam band in 
Vancouver to talk meaningfully to their leaseholders and because 
of their hard line band leadership, the property values on 
Musqueam land have already collapsed.  Despite repeated calls on 
the Indian affairs minister to intervene, she has not.  She 
refused to intervene.  What is the definition of fair 
compensation after the Indian band has destroyed all equity and 
there is no market value left? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always enjoy listening to my constituents and representing 
them.  Let me quote a letter that I received from one of my 
constituents.  The letter stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing to request your assistance in dealing with several 
problems we are experiencing with our lease of land on an Indian 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know to what extent the problems are due to the nature 
of the lease or the nature of Band Administration or to the 
dispute between the various levels of government and the native 
bands, but I do know that they are producing substantial amounts 
of frustration, exasperation and anger, not just in ourselves but 
in many others in similar circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And while I sympathize with efforts of the government to at 
least redress the balance, I am becoming increasingly resentful 
that my rights, as a citizen, are being abrogated or at least 
lost in the shuffle of the questionable deals that various levels 
of government are offering to the Native Bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary problem is due to the expiration of the lease on 
31st of March 2000 and the fact that I am financially unable to 
continue to pay the yearly tax and lease.  It is also due to the 
fact that I am unable to sell the lease for the value of the 
substantial improvements, or even a reasonable fraction thereof 
that we have made on the property.  With less than two years 
left, no one is prepared to gamble that amount of money that the 
Band will renew the lease.  The Band has made no efforts to 
instil any confidence in the few prospective purchasers we have 
had that they would extend the lease and have acted in a manner 
to diminish that confidence.  Given that they provided us with a 
letter of intent that they would extend the lease at the end of 
the term, it is not understandable why they have actually refused 
to give the same assurance to a prospective purchaser.  This has 
to be extremely shortsighted if not actually dishonest, given our 
efforts and dealings with the Band over the last 10 years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a frustrated constituent.  This letter was sent to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and in her 
reply she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can appreciate your concern and frustration in securing a long 
term lease for your retirement years. 
As I am sure you can understand, we are both obligated to operate 
within the parameters of the terms and conditions of the existing 
lease agreement.  Also, in keeping with the interests of 
“renewing our partnerships” with Canada's Aboriginal peoples, 
we would not enter into an extension of the lease.

involved and her office cannot help.  What will this constituent 
do?  He is living in Canada.  He is paying taxes to the 
government and the minister is showing helplessness to the 
constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-49 must be rethought and amended.  If 
passed the way it is, without introducing any amendments which we 
are suggesting, we would be passing legislation without any 
reference to taxpaying citizens who are directly and drastically 
affected.  We will not be able to support the bill until the 
amendments are passed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is definitely not a pleasure to be addressing the 
bill tonight.  Bills such as this one are not about 
self-government.  They are about special rights for special 
people.  They are about different strokes for different folks. 
They are about rules for one set of people without any 
consideration for another group of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September the auditor general in a section of his report to 
parliament dealt with the ongoing treaty process in the country. 
He noted that non-native neighbours were ignored.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Settled claims can affect non-parties to the settlement—we 
found indications that little opportunity had been provided for 
their input on decisions on the allocation of land and other 
provisions in settlement agreements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also stated in his report that government must represent all 
Canadians and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In pursuing its objective, the government needs to fairly 
represent all Canadians, who are ultimately bound by the 
agreements reached.... Comprehensive land claim settlements are 
modern treaties that are significant not only to Aboriginal 
communities but to all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general observed that the government must represent 
all Canadians in the treaty making process.  By extension it is 
fair to say that the same should apply to the bill that is before 
us.  The government must recognize that the bill is not made 
simply for the people it purports to cover.  It will also impact 
on the neighbours of those people.  That is one part which 
bothers me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect bothers me which I want to mention right off the 
top.  It puts the whole issue into perspective.  It is a story in 
the fishing industry which occurred within the past year. Last 
spring after the herring fishery two constituents of mine were 
returning home to Delta.  They were approached on the ferry by an 
aboriginal Canadian who said “I heard you talking and I believe 
you guys are commercial fishermen”.  They said yes, that they 
were.  He said he used to be an <I>a</I> licence salmon fisherman. 
In other words he had a licence that allowed him to fish in the 
all-Canadian commercial fishery but when the government 
introduced a separate native commercial fishery they let their 
licences go and now they were fishing in the Musqueam fishery and 
were not happy with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sat down to talk with these fellows and explain his 
unhappiness.  He said that he had a licence which he held at the 
discretion of the chief.  The way it worked was as long as he was 
getting along well with the chief he could fish but if they had a 
falling out he would be off the list. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT137"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT137"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2225

<A HREF="#LINKT136"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he held the commercial salmon licence given to him by the 
minister he held it with some certainty.  There was comfort in 
knowing it could only be taken away from him if he broke the law. 
The way it is now he held his licence at the discretion of the 
chief.  If he were dating the chief's daughter and they had a 
falling out, he would be off the list and would not fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does not like that situation.  There are a number of them on 
the Musqueam reserve who want to see an end to the separate 
native commercial fishery.  We engaged them in negotiations.  We 
negotiated with members of the Musqueam band and the Tsawwassen 
band to see if there was a way we could level the playing field 
and bring it back to what it was prior to 1992.  The native 
people were eager participants in this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We met on the Tsawwassen reserve in a meeting room with a group 
of non-aboriginal and aboriginal fishermen to discuss the issue. 
We devised a way, knowing what government revenues were 
available, whereby we would have asked the government to put 
aside $12 million to buy licences for native people so they could 
re-enter the all-Canadian fishery.  They were happy to fish on an 
equal footing again with the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations went well.  Unfortunately when it went back to 
the Musqueam band, the people we call the double dippers, the 
native people who still held commercial licences to fish in the 
all-Canadian fishery and who were participating in the native 
only commercial fishery, put the kibosh to it and it ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was unfortunate but it showed that although people in that 
community had received a special right, one for which they did 
not have to pay and where there was no licence fee involved for 
them to participate in that native only commercial fishery, they 
wanted out of it.  Somehow a sense of fairness was lost.  They 
felt their rights were not being protected.  When we get right 
down to it, that is what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go through the details and could talk about the 
expropriation principles as others have.  Maybe I will come back 
to them.  However, another point is worth mentioning tonight in 
this debate.  It has to do with the rights of native people.  My 
friend across the way mentioned the Nisga'a treaty.  He said that 
all the Reform guys wanted to do was talk about it, that they 
were uptight about the Nisga'a treaty, and that they wanted to 
create uncertainty or discontent in these kinds of issues because 
they wanted to push their position on the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about that treaty in the sense of fairness and how 
the rights of people are protected in these circumstances.  My 
colleagues talked about the fact that if the bill were passed 
native women could lose their property rights.  If the bill goes 
through, their chances of appealing it through the court system 
would not be very great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in relation to the Nisga'a treaty both the federal 
and provincial governments have stated time and again that the 
charter of rights and freedoms will continue to apply.  Our view 
is that in a legal challenge that may not be the case.  It will

talking about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the 
rights and freedoms defined in it, subject only to such

our rights under the charter, but it is simply those rights that 
can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. 
If we look at how the charter deals with the rights section for 
native people, it comes at it a little differently.

the nature of a shield that can be invoked by the aboriginal

provincial or federal laws; however what really distinguishes the 
right of self-government is that it can be invoked as a “sword”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are at the report stage of Bill C-49. 
Our significant amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-49, in Clause 45, be amended by replacing line 16 on 
page 22 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“so signed, that a land code has been developed and adopted in 
accordance with this Act and that the governing bodies of 
neighbouring jurisdictions have confirmed in writing that 
consultations respecting the land code have been completed in 
accordance with the laws of the province in which the first 
nation land, for which the land code has been adopted, is 
situated”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very important.  It has to do with consultation and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say that the bill is well intended but is has holes in it 
big enough to drive a truck through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill ratifies and brings into effect the framework agreement 
of first nation land management concluded between first nations 
and Her Majesty in Right of Canada.  It provides for the 
establishment of an alternative land management regime that gives 
first nation communities control over the lands and resources 
within their reserves.  It also gives first nations the power to 
enact laws respecting interest in and licences in relation to 
first nation land respecting the development, conservation, 
protection, management, use and possession of that land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment also provides for a community approval process 
that enables first nation members to vote on a proposed land code 
and an individual agreement between the first nation and Her 
Majesty.  The community approval process is monitored by a 
verifier jointly appointed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and the first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak to the whole bill, but at first blush when one 
looks at the bill, it gives any reasonable person great concern. 
If a band or council decides to be malevolent, I think there are 
insufficient controls and balances to the powers given.  In some 
of the sections there are limits to the federal government but 
not parallel limits to the bands.  There does not appear to be a 
balance of power between the federal government in the bill and 
the bands in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significantly, there is a problem with section 12 and I will 
refer to it.  In section 12(1) on page 7 of the bill it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A proposed land code and an individual agreement that have been 
submitted for community approval are approved if 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) a majority of eligible voters participated in the vote and a 
majority of those voters voted to approve them; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) all those eligible who signified, in a manner determined by 
the first nation, their intention to vote have been registered 
and a majority of the registered voters voted to approve them; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) they are approved by the community in any other manner agreed 
on by the first nation and the minister. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us describe a typical situation in many bands.  We have 100 
eligible voter adults and of course the band has total control to 
decide who is eligible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT139"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT139"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2235

<A HREF="#LINKT138"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case 51 votes are needed for the overall vote to be 
valid and only 26 votes are needed to pass the code.  This could 
then certainly be reasonably within the realm of all the 
relatives and kin of one family that happens to hold most of the 
paid positions in the band administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the theme of accountability I am talking about, the bill 
talks about a vote and the supervision of the vote but nowhere 
are there assurances that the votes will be conducted by secret 
ballot, nor does it refer to a standard set of rules for how 
votes can be conducted.  There are just general rules in the bill 
that appear completely open to manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the bill grants statutes or status of freedom from judicial 
review and grants immunity from prosecution in section 35 for 
error.  There are limits on liability and provisions of immunity 
and freedom from judicial review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When regular municipalities in a province are in conflict with 
each other, the provincial government can intervene.  In British 
Columbia, municipalities are governed under the municipal act. 
It is a creature of the province.  The provincial authority is 
the fallback power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who mediates the powers of the band and other regular 
municipalities in a province?  It is not very clear.  There is no 
obligation in this bill to talk, let alone co-operate for mutual 
benefit between these jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The general intent of the bill is appropriate.  It is trying to 
go in the right direction but the details are an absolute mess. 
There are reasons why there is cause to worry, for the best 
predictor of future trustworthiness of how these bands will use 
these newfound powers is the past. They likely will be used in 
the same manner as has been in the past on reserves across the 
country.  The track record of band management so far tells us how 
it will be managed in the future. That is a worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, clear and fair rules and open accountable processes 
are the best protector of human rights.  What we have been trying 
to stand up to here are especially the rights of status Canadians 
under the Indian Act.  Those are the ones who have been 
contacting us and they are the individuals for whom we have been 
trying to stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, this bill appears to completely fail on those 
very important basics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the constituents of Nanaimo—Alberni it gives me 
great pleasure to rise and speak to Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is on central Vancouver Island and has a number of 
native bands scattered throughout the whole riding.  The 
Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, which is in Alberni, is basically 
the overseer of 14 bands that go from Bamfield into around Gold 
River, including the Opitsat, the Ahousat, the Dididat, the 
Theshat and other bands, including those on other areas on the 
east coast of Vancouver Island than Nanoose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out simply to say there are many issues, many 
different bands in B.C.  I was quite surprised to hear the 
government, particularly when it came to talking about the 
Nisga'a treaty, saying that we did not understand the issue, that 
we did not understand what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the Alberni valley two weeks ago at a town hall.  I was 
very pleased that the native leaders were there to discuss that 
Nisga'a treaty.  It was actually an excellent forum because they 
were there to debate their point regarding what they felt the 
Nisga'a treaty was.  I was there to debate what I got from the 
different points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many people in the audience who were most interested. 
The Nisga'a treaty I suggest took up probably 40% of that town 
hall meeting in the questions and answers.  It is not an 
insignificant issue in B.C.  It is before the provincial 
legislature at the moment and has great concern up and down the 
coast of British Columbia. 
People realize this is the first of perhaps 45 or 50 different 
settlements.  If this one is not accurate and correct, then the 
ones subsequent and down the line also will have the same flaws.

<A HREF="#LINKT139"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 has some of those flaws.  The issues are similar. Bill 
C-49 lacks accountability or clarification on what accountability 
means.  Who is to be accountable?  How are the band councils 
going to be elected?  How are the band councils going to 
represent the individual people within their constituency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many of my colleagues I have had representation from 
different native bands, in particular women. They feel frustrated 
because they do not feel represented.  They cannot go to the 
band. They feel the band does not represent them.  They come in 
frustration in many cases to their member of parliament because 
that is the only vehicle they feel they can speak freely with 
that will not be used against them in another forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-49 one of the issues that has come forward is leases. 
I was most surprised to hear one of the members opposite say who 
is going to take their house away?  It is all fearmongering on 
this side of the House.  If he had been in B.C. over the last six 
weeks he would have seen the newspaper reports on the Musqueam 
Band because that is the issue on the leases being taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the key issues in this bill that needs to be 
brought forward to this House and sorted out.  Clearly it is a 
huge issue in B.C. with the Musqueam, the Nisga'a.  The issues 
are very much in the forefront in British Columbia at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas in this bill, as my colleagues have 
mentioned, such as consultation with adjacent municipalities.  I 
have been on the school board.  Many members have been aldermen 
or mayors dealing in municipal areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do the bands report to?  Are they answerable to the 
municipal act, for example, in B.C.?  Are they answerable to the 
department of Indian affairs?  What is the hammer?  Where is the 
next level people can go to?  That is not explained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I touched on expropriation.  In the town halls I heard from many 
people within the Nisga'a area.  The concern was non-natives. 
They have no recourse.  If we are in a municipal arena, and I 
have been there where I have had land expropriated, there is a 
vehicle to have that done fairly.  If it is not seen to be fair 
it would go to the next level.  That is not covered in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us recognize if the highest need for an area is a highway 
to go through one's land, that may be the best way to go but 
there has to be compensation. That is not spelled out in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have to be checks and balances.  This legislation does not 
have them. We need to know how the power is to be used. Again, 
that is not spelled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has supported native legislation in this House 
on many occasions. We will support and have shown that we will 
support good legislation.  However, this is not good legislation. 
We cannot and will not support bad legislation.  We will not and 
cannot support Bill C-49 in its present form.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of my constituents of Okanagan—Coquihalla to 
speak to the amendments before us today in Group No. 1 of Bill 
C-49, the first nations land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have been listening this evening I can tell that we in this 
country have a lot of work to do when it comes to these issues. I 
listened to Liberal members across the way making allegations 
about the Reform Party which are without substance, without 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members that in my riding of Okanagan—Coquihalla I 
work diligently with native bands.  I have intervened with the 
minister on several occasions.  I have tried to assist when it 
comes to economic development and when it comes to situations 
regarding airport land transfers to our municipality.  I have 
worked with our native band in Penticton and I have worked on 
developing our native university, which will be breaking ground 
hopefully in the spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I take a great deal of exception to the comments and 
remarks made by members across the way when in fact all we are 
trying to do in the official opposition is put forward some 
amendments that will make a piece of legislation better for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Reform Party does support 
native self-government.  The Reform Party supports a delegated 
level of self-government for natives.  That is very important 
because what we see in this bill is self-government that is 
totally under the control of the bands in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of months ago I introduced a bill in this House of 
Commons which arose from a problem on native land.  What I was 
trying to do was help my constituents by dealing with the issue 
that the Residential Tenancy Act does not apply to native land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular situation, which I brought forward to the 
House in the form of a bill, septic systems had failed and left 
some 50 residents being evicted from their homes with no 
protection whatsoever from the Residential Tenancy Act in the 
province of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill did not pass because many parties in this House again 
raised the question and said that this was somehow racially 
motivated, that I was being insensitive to the cultural needs of 
the economic development of Indian bands.  That was not the case 
at all.  My bill was absolutely colour blind.  This bill should 
also be 100% colour blind.  But it is not.  It is not because it 
is granting special status to a group of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give members another example.  In the Westbank Indian 
band there are 514 natives.  There are 7,000 non-natives living 
on that band's land.  What happens to those people's rights?  Why 
are those people's rights not considered in this piece of 
legislation?  Why is that not the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I met with the residents of Bayview, a strata-type 
development on Westbank land consisting of some 200 homes.  These 
people thought they were leasing land from the crown.  No one 
ever told them about Bill C-49.  No one ever told them that the 
life savings they put into their $200,000 or $300,000 homes was 
not what is facing us today with the implications in Bill C-49. 
That was never explained to those people.  Now they have a 
situation where some of the retaining walls are crumbing.  They 
are falling down because building codes were not followed. That 
is leaving those residents with a $600,000 liability because 
building codes were not followed on this piece of land.

<A HREF="#LINKT141"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only case in the province of B.C.  Several times 
tonight we have heard the situation in which the Musqueam have 
found themselves.  The property values of those homes, which were 
$400,000 to $800,000, have plummeted to nothing.  This piece of 
legislation is not going to help those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a delegated type of self-government that would be 
controlled federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned here this evening, and I mentioned it as well, 
that the Condominium Act of British Columbia does not apply to 
the people at Bayview and Westbank, nor does the Municipal Act 
and the Residential Tenancy Act.  There is no protection for 
those people whatsoever.  Bill C-49 does not do anything to 
protect those folks.  What do we tell them?  Do they not deserve 
to have the protection of their federal government as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they do.  That is why we have brought forward these 
amendments to this bill.  It is not because of the ridiculous 
argument that we do not believe in self-government.  We do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to see treaties in the province of British Columbia.  I 
want to end the uncertainty that is caused by not having 
treaties.  I want each and every person, regardless of whether 
they are native or non-native, whether they live on reserve land 
or on non-reserve land, to have access to the laws equally, with 
every right and every power that they have at their disposal.  We 
cannot grant these leases, especially with situations like 
Westbank and those that are happening throughout the province of 
B.C., and not ensure that that will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition desires a better relationship with the 
Indian peoples of Canada.  We want to see that all people have 
the same powers and rights and that everyone is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I cannot stand here and say that I will vote for 
this bill because this bill is not colour blind.  It gives 
special powers to a designated group of people and that is wrong. 
Until we learn that, we will never get this type of legislation 
right.  I urge the Liberals to pass our amendments because they 
are the only things that will improve this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise, despite the late hour, 
to address report stage of Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would say that this is an important piece of 
legislation on which to have a full and open and debate in the 
House this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a bit remarkable that so few government members 
present this evening, at almost 11 p.m., here in beautiful 
downtown Ottawa, are rising in their places to debate this 
legislation.  It is quite the contrary.  What we have constantly 
heard this evening is heckling from the other side and remarks 
that we do not know what we are talking about with respect to 
this legislation.  They are the only ones who seem to have a firm 
grasp on reality, so to speak, or that is what they would lead 
the people to believe with respect to this particular 
legislation.  But nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the viewing audience at home is rapidly seeing that it 
is only the people on this side of the House who want to actually 
debate the legislation.  If we could turn up the microphones, I 
am sure the people at home would hear the rabble over there 
babbling on rather than rising in their places to actually take 
part in the debate.  I think it is quite appalling for members of 
parliament to act in such a manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I crossed the floor a bit earlier to consult face to face with a 
few members.  I actually encouraged them to take part in the 
debate, but obviously to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that the Reform Party, the official opposition, is 
actually asking for here? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT143"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT143"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2255

<A HREF="#LINKT142"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it really something so dramatic that we could not actually 
see Bill C-49 improved with a few amendments?  A number of my 
colleagues have pointed that out.  What is it about the Liberal 
government that it brings forward legislation but does not want 
to see it changed at all or does not want to see it improved? 
What is it about these individuals that would have us believe 
their legislation as brought forward cannot be improved upon? 
Perhaps the word arrogant would come to mind.  I would hesitate 
to use that word because it might be considered by a few on the 
other side as inflammatory.  However the reality is that anything 
can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would our amendments to Bill C-49 do?  They would require 
the Indian bands to consult with the municipalities.  What is so 
terribly wrong with that?  That is the question we must ask. What 
is so terribly wrong with requiring these 14 Indian bands to 
consult and negotiate with the municipalities that adjoin the 
reserve lands or with ensuring that any rules and regulations 
they would bring down or land codes they would develop would be 
fair and supported by the neighbouring municipalities and 
communities with which I am sure they work hard in a fair and 
open manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns being expressed this evening by the official 
opposition are very real.  They are concerns about the 
expropriation powers contained in Bill C-49.  A first nation may 
expropriate any interest in its nation's land that in the opinion 
of its council is necessary to community works or for other first 
nations purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out by a number of my colleagues, the opportunity 
for abuse is there.  Far be it for me or any of my colleagues to 
impugn motive in the sense that any of these 14 bands would do 
something like that.  However some very real concerns are being 
expressed by people about the sweeping powers contained in Bill 
C-49.  All we are asking for is that there be sufficient checks 
and balances, perhaps not for the existing band councils but for 
some band council in the future which may make an inappropriate 
ruling that dramatically impacts upon tenants or neighbouring 
communities.  The reality is that it could be done in an unfair 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for a simple amendment to ensure consultation 
takes place and that the neighbouring communities and 
municipalities are apprised and actively involved in the 
decisions being made.  I do not see what is so terrible about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some firsthand experience with a very similar ongoing 
situation in my riding of Prince George—Peace River involving a 
band on the west side of the Rocky Mountains.  The riding of 
Prince George—Peace River is quite unique in Canada as it is the 
only riding that is divided by the Rocky Mountain range.  On the 
east side of the divide the native bands are governed under 
treaty eight.  In other words they are treaty Indians.  On the 
west side there are no treaties.  The band in my riding is McLeod 
Lake.  It has tried for years and years to adhere to treaty 
eight.  It wants to come under treaty eight.  It has been 
somewhat successful over the last while with its negotiations and 
it appears they will be finalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part and parcel of that ongoing agreement we find that a new 
reserve will be established along with reserve lands.  I must say 
at this point that I am quite opposed to establishing additional 
reserves in Canada. 
I think that the whole reserve system has been an abysmal failure 
from the very beginning.  Yet we see this government continuing 
down that road of setting up more reserves.  I have to question 
in all sincerity the wisdom in doing such a thing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT143"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, what is taking place is that they want to have some 
reserve land set aside when this Indian band, the McLeod Lake 
band adheres to treaty 8, in the small logging community of Bear 
Lake which is on the Hart highway just north of the city of 
Prince George.  The residents of Bear Lake have expressed a lot 
of concern about this.  They have no problem whatsoever with the 
Indian people being granted certain lands that are adjacent or in 
their community if it is on a fee simple basis and if they end up 
being treated identically, equally and equitably as all the other 
residents of Bear Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface I would not say that is such a remarkable thing 
to ask for, that everyone be treated equally.  They would welcome 
Indian people to have those lots, to have their residence there 
with all the other residents of Bear Lake. But they have some 
very serious concerns when without adequate consultation the 
federal government and the provincial government with their 
negotiators negotiate with Indian band and arbitrarily decide 
that they are going to set up a reserve at Bear Lake and this 
will be part of the land settlement when the McLeod Lake band 
adheres to treaty 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this is outside the scope of this bill and the 
amendments we are discussing.  I wanted to point out to hon. 
members on both sides of the House what happens when inadequate 
consultation takes place.  That is what we are discussing.  That 
is the essence of the amendments put forward by the official 
opposition.  We are merely asking the government to see fit to 
amend Bill C-49 so that consultation is a requirement and that 
the bands themselves are going to have to consult with the 
municipalities in the neighbouring communities to ensure that 
fairness and equity are in place when they develop their land 
codes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
know there have been a number of people in the chair during the 
day, but I have been here on duty since 11 o'clock this morning. 
As you can see, Mr. Speaker, it is now after 11 o'clock at night. 
I have been listening very carefully and I have decided that 
there are a few things I would like to put on the record with 
respect to this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin with a little story from my own riding.  It has 
to do with our armoury.  Earlier this winter very serious 
problems arose with the structure of our armoury.  This is a 
historic building.  It is one of the oldest functioning armouries 
in Canada. There were serious problems with the roof.  The 
foundation was in terrible shape.  It cost $1 million simply to 
patch up the armoury.  We are looking at many millions more 
before the physical structure of the armoury is in good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is if we spend those moneys, after spending millions 
of dollars on this armoury, how can we ensure that we do not get 
the same problems again?  Although up front the problem had 
something to do with bricks, mortar, stone, tile and things like 
that, the real problem was one of absentee management. 
Our armoury in Peterborough was being managed through DND from 
headquarters in Trenton.  That has been the case for 90 years.

<A HREF="#LINKT144"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone in Peterborough would notice that there was a leak in 
the roof and they would make a mental note to remember there was 
a leak in the roof.  The following week, because the rain would 
stop, someone else would notice the leak in the roof and they 
would make a mental note.  Then one day there would be a flood in 
the basement and someone would phone the general at the head 
office in Trenton and tell him about the flood in the basement. 
The general would make a note.  Someone would then finally come 
up and look.  They would ask “Where did all this water in the 
basement come from?”  They would trace it through and discover 
that there was a problem in the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my fear with our armouries that even when we fix them with 
millions of dollars that if we do not change the management 
system, it will always be like that and one day our armouries 
will just cave in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed with the Reform Party members.  They are people who 
pride themselves in their interest in things local.  There are 
approximately 650 first nations across Canada, 650 very diverse 
groups of people with different languages, cultures, histories, 
physical settings, rural settings and urban settings.  They are 
managed by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our policy to get rid of the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development at a pace set by the first nations.  The 
reason for that is that we know, and I accept this, that many of 
the problems with those 600 or so first nations arise from the 
fact that there has been absentee management, and in fact one 
would say, as in the case of our armouries, absentee 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible for someone here in Ottawa, someone in this 
room or just down the road, to say what should be going on in the 
elementary schools of one of these first nations, or to say 
whether the sewer needs fixing, or to say whether one of the 
buildings needs fixing in the way I described it with our 
armouries.  It is absolutely impossible and we know it.  Yet, for 
generations that is the way these first nations have been 
managed.  It is our objective, granted at a pace set by the first 
nations themselves, to change the management system so that the 
people of those first nations can manage themselves and improve 
conditions for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about more than 600 first nations here.  We 
are talking about 14 first nations scattered all across the 
country.  We have heard a lot about those in British Columbia but 
it includes those in Ontario.  They are all very different.  We 
can tell by their names that their languages are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention one thing about the first nation that 
happens to be closest to me, the Mississaugas of Scugog Island. I 
do not know if anybody knows this, but the Mississaugas of Scugog 
Island are distinctive in one respect.  In World War II every 
single eligible male volunteered and served in the armed forces. 
Every single one.  One hundred per cent of the male population. I 
am sure many members already knew that fact.  That is one of 
these particular first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although none of these first nations are in my riding, I was at 
Georgina Island when the chiefs initialled this agreement, the 
one we are discussing here today.  We and the people watching and 
listening to this debate should know that this is the result of 
years, not months, not 12 hours of debate from 11 o'clock this 
morning until 11 o'clock tonight, even though we are here 
debating it at this time of night; this is as a result of years 
of negotiation.  The proposal came to our minister from the first 
nations themselves.  Chiefs came forward and suggested this 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the 600 first nations, because there are still 600 
first nations out there who are not part of this agreement, the 
idea is that here is one other experiment we might try of putting 
some effective power in the hands of these communities so that 
they can help themselves.  By doing so they can help the regions 
in which they find themselves. 
That is where we are.  This has come to our minister and our 
minister is responding to the requests of these first nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of consultation, we are talking about years of 
negotiation and discussion.  When I was at Georgina Island with 
the chiefs and other people from all over the country for the 
signing, there was an air of excitement that they had designed a 
land management system which they felt would work and which might 
well become an example for other first nations across the 
country.  If the other first nations do not want to try this 
route, they need not.  These 14 have decided to go this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a few of the remarks of some of these chiefs 
on the record.  Some of this material has been used before.  I 
think the people who are watching at this time of night should be 
aware of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Austin Bear of the Muskoday first nation said: “The 
framework agreement in this legislation acknowledges our 
fundamental right to control our reserve lands and resources. 
Furthermore they ensure that our lands are protected for future 
generations by prohibiting surrender or sale or expropriation of 
those lands”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion of women on and off reserve. 
Lorraine McRae, the chief of the Chippewas of Mnjikaning nation 
said:  “This initiative is an opportunity for the full and 
active participation of the members of our first nations, elders, 
women and men both off reserve and on reserve to collectively 
develop land management systems appropriate to our communities 
based on fairness, equality and accountability”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are direct quotations from first nations leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to be here after 12 hours.  I urge all members of the 
House to support this legislation.  Let us end all these delay 
tactics and get on with it.  Let us get on with it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, tonight we are debating Bill C-49 which is the first 
nation land management act.  For those who have just joined this 
debate, and I am sure there are many, I would like to reiterate 
that this bill would allow individual first nations to opt out of 
the land and property sections of the Indian Act and establish 
their own land codes to manage reserve lands and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this narrow area the act would grant powers of 
self-government to the first nations that choose to opt out of 
the Indian Act, but only in this narrow area.  It is interesting 
for me to hear government members wax eloquent about the virtues 
of self-government when here is a government which could bring 
that into effect but after five long years has touched only one 
narrow area in which to give aboriginal people and first nations 
any kind of self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would give first nations the authority first, to pass 
laws for the development, conservation, protection, management, 
use and possession of first nation land and second, to control 
the issue of leases, licences and other property interests.  This 
is not an inconsiderable step that is being put forward.  Some 
people have mentioned in this debate that it would essentially 
create a two tier Canada.  It would give special rights and 
privileges to some, and to some Canada's laws and Constitution 
would not fully apply. They would be subject to different laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a rocket scientist so I have been able to 
figure out that what this bill will lead to is a patchwork of 
individual land codes which will inevitably be riddled with legal 
ambiguities which will create chaos for the individuals affected, 
the first nations people who are affected and for the larger 
community.

<A HREF="#LINKT146"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the very realistic outcome of this bill even though 
there may be a good purpose served, the official opposition is 
proposing that there be a consultation process written into the 
bill so that there would be at least some opportunity for the 
people being affected not only within the aboriginal communities 
themselves but within the larger community to have discussions 
about proposals and intentions that will be carried out under the 
authority of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the life of me I cannot understand why this is such a huge 
nut for the government to crack.  Why is there such a resistance 
to the simple idea, the simple Canadian value of talking to your 
neighbours? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in this debate if we listen to speakers opposite I heard not 
one single speaker make a meaningful discussion of this proposal 
which is supposed to be the reason we are here this evening, to 
discuss the proposal that there be consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did hear was the member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore, for 
whom I have a great deal of personal respect, say, strangely, 
consultation cannot be legislated.  I must say that this is a 
rather novel statement because we have a whole variety of areas 
within our Canadian law and jurisdiction where consultations are 
a part of a legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my city of Calgary, for example, if a communications company 
wants to put up communication towers for purposes of cellular 
phone networks over a certain height there must be by law public 
consultation.  If there is development to take place within a 
certain community there must be public consultation before that 
can go ahead. There are federal-provincial consultations on a 
wide variety of areas. So this is not a novel concept. It is 
considered a civilized way of doing business with neighbours in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only other comment I heard which was on the point about 
consultation was by the last speaker who said there were all 
kinds of consultation about this legislation. The member was 
clearly missing the point that what the motion proposes is a 
consultation process written as part of the bill to take place as 
the bill's powers are being carried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting when the speaker who mentioned the 
consultation that had led up to the bill being proposed said the 
first nations themselves, the chiefs themselves, came forward 
with this proposal as if because somebody brings a proposal it is 
ipso facto a good thing and should be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could put all kinds of proposals forward to the Liberal 
government which I bet a dime would not be accepted.  Yet somehow 
because the first nations chiefs have put this forward that was 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard story after story that aboriginal people 
themselves who are to be affected by this legislation and people 
in the larger community who have lease hold interest which will 
be covered by this legislation were not consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole question of consultation adds up to the fact that 
there was little or no consultation prior to this legislation and 
its effect being brought in.  Nor is there a consultation process 
built into the legislation whereby communities, both inside and 
outside first nations lands, can work together in a co-operative 
manner to carry out the powers and intentions of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely it is only sensible to accept the motion being put 
forward to bring such a consultation process into the package. 
Yet not only is the government stubbornly and perversely 
unwilling to accept that sensible proposal, but it does not 
debate it in a meaningful manner.  We have no idea why this 
proposal for a consultation process has been stonewalled and 
rejected by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely if we are in this House to have meaningful debate that 
should be coming forward.  I have not heard it.  I invite members 
opposite to give some sort of a rational rationale, if I might be 
so bold, for rejecting this proposal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard one speaker from another party make a rather startling 
statement.  I think we should put that on the debate table.  The 
statement was that the Reform Party is suggesting that because 
the people carrying out these powers are first nations people 
they cannot be trusted and their powers must be circumscribed in 
some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly speaker after speaker from the Reform Party has rejected 
that allegation.  Let us look at the flip side of it.  The flip 
side is that the speaker from that party is suggesting that 
because first nations people are carrying out these powers, no 
checks and balances are necessary.  That is an equally ridiculous 
proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When human beings of any stripe or colour have power there need 
to be proper checks and balances on the exercise of that power 
and authority.  That is just the way civilized societies work. To 
try to bring racial bias into this or to accuse people who are 
suggesting sensible and moderate checks and balances of racial 
bias is, I think, very unworthy of debaters in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to carry out our mandate on behalf of Canadians, which 
includes first nations Canadians, and to make sure that there is 
fairness in the rule of law properly carried out in the future, 
we need to quit browbeating people in debate and assigning 
motives that are clearly unreasonable and simply address the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should there be a consultation process in this bill or not?  I 
think I have made the case as well as my colleagues that there 
clearly ought to be and should be.  I ask the government to in 
all reason and fairness put that to the House, pass it and let us 
get on with carrying out the intent of this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I stand with great pleasure to close the debate this evening. 
There are only a few moments left but I want to make a number of 
points that I think are particularly important to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the intervention made at the outset by the member for Skeena, 
the critic for the Reform Party, he said he cannot support this 
bill because he wants to consult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member sitting next to him from Calgary and the rest 
of the members of his caucus to know that it was before Christmas 
that both he and the member from Prince George, the deputy critic 
having sat at the standing committee, having listened to the 
witnesses, having gone through that legislation clause by clause 
in the committee, representing the Reform Party, voted yea to the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They voted for the legislation with one amendment providing 
constitutional protections and those were agreed to.  I want the 
Canadian public to know and I want the people of British Columbia 
who are watching this debate to know that both their members 
agreed to it.  They shook hands with the chiefs and council 
members who were there that evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had an agreement.  We had an agreement of trust and guess 
what we had here today?  We had the member leading off the debate 
saying that he wants to consult when he was trying to convince 
the rest of his members to support the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has done an absolute turnaround on this legislation to stand 
in the House now and say he wants to consult. For the comments 
made by the member from Calgary, there are 9 years of 
consultation involving 14 bands that have reworked this again and 
again.  They brought the legislation forth in this House once 
before only to have it defeated and thrown out.  They went back 
to their communities to consult again, to rework it one more time 
and they come back in the House again. 
This far from the goal line, after close to 10 years of 
consultation, and they want to kill it.  They want more 
consultation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  We did not say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is not true.  That is 
false.  That was a breach of a promise.  That is not true and the 
member knows it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about one of their most recent issues in terms of 
the Musqueam band case.  Why are they up in arms?  It is because 
the Federal Court of Canada most recently ruled that the Musqueam 
people have a legal right and title to fair rent based on market 
values that we all agree to.  It was the Federal Court of Canada 
that made this rule, not the Musqueam band.  It has set out the 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of consultation, in 1972 the Musqueam band asked the 
tenants association to renegotiate the contract.  They said no. 
In 1980, as the member points out, they asked to renegotiate the 
contract.  They said no.  In 1993 they asked to renegotiate the 
contract.  They said “No, we are going to court”, and have not 
paid the rent from 1993 up until now, ostensibly using those 
moneys for the court fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federal Court of Canada has said that an acre of land in the 
best property in Canada is worth close to half a million dollars 
a year, but they are paying $330 a month in rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian band in this case is willing to negotiate, to sit 
down with the people affected for a fair deal.  That is 
essentially what the bill does.  It provides opportunity, fair 
opportunity as equal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to talk about equal Canadians.  Here we 
have two parties wanting to sit down and negotiate.  They want to 
break the deal.  They want to create mischief and trouble and 
break the deal.  That is not right.  That is not proper.  That is 
not representing the people of British of Columbia, the people of 
Alberta.  I am asking the member, as he did in the standing 
committee, to do the right thing and support the bill again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people representing those 14 first nations have a right 
after 10 years of consultation to good and decent representation 
in the House.  It is incumbent upon members of parliament 
debating the issue—and we have heard today that they have an 
obligation—to pass the bill and do the right thing for those 
people.  What do they want to do with their bill and their lands? 
They want to commercialise it so that they can form commercial 
contract relationships with non-aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want it.  The member from the Sunshine Coast 
actually stood and said “We want them to consult with us before 
they build something on their land”.  I cannot remember a 
municipality having to do that. They want to impose unfair rules 
on the first nations, put chains on the first nations and drag 
them back to the dark ages, but we will not let it happen.  We 
will stand here and represent these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also speaking of consultation, the B.C. Association of 
Municipalities has met with the Musqueam band on eight occasions 
and has recently submitted a letter concluding that the 
discussion papers attached here are a very good starting point 
for the negotiation and ultimately the finalization of a 
reciprocal consultation agreement.  They are working out these 
processes with the affected band and it is working well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently the chief of the Squamish nation has met with the 
mayor of North Vancouver, met with the mayor of West Vancouver 
and the mayor of the North Vancouver District.  They have set up 
a consultation process.  They did not mention that today.  They 
do not want that consultation process because they do not want 
the outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to them the reason they flip flop here so unashamedly 
is that they are scaremongering.  They are trying to scare the 
good people of British Columbia.  They are trying to set up a 
scheme to pose to Nisga'a, but we will not buy it. The Canadian 
people will not buy it and we will oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 11.30 p.m., 
pursuant to order made earlier today this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
