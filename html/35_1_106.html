	The House resumed from October 6 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I wish to 
inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) the 
parliamentary secretary will be speaking for the regular allotted 
time of 20 minutes. All other government speakers today and for 
the remainder of the debate will be sharing the time in 
10-minute sections.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. We finished off 
yesterday by announcing that under Standing Order 43(2) we 
would be splitting our time. We had the last speaker last night. 
The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest had 10 minutes and 5 
minutes. I believe we should be up first today to continue our 
allotted time, finishing from yesterday.
<P>
<B>(1005 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to the social policy review, the discussion 
paper, the Liberal plan tabled by the Minister for Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	The credibility of the political process right now in Canada 
remains very low. People are looking to politicians to be 
specific, to demonstrate that they at least know where we are 
going, but what a lackluster performance; a discussion paper 
which makes a vague attempt to shape a social system which is 
collapsing.
<P>
	The minister acknowledges the obvious, a desperate need for 
change, but how do we get there? We diverge substantially. I 
would like to see a plan that recommends some courageous and 
creative changes but the minister obviously prefers to consult, 
discuss, review and study for another year before he institutes 
any changes at all.
<P>
	Adding to the confusion of the Liberals' plan for social 
reform is the damage created by the leaked details to the press 
regarding the $7 billion cut to support programs. The Liberal 
agreement has now been reduced to merely an issue over money. 
There are no numbers in the plan to support any defence the 
government may put forward to stem this challenge to its 
credibility.
<P>
	How can the minister in all good conscience continue with his 
consultation process until all of the questions have been 
answered with hard numbers to validate his approach to social 
reform?
<P>
	This government continues to spend taxpayers' dollars, 
giving the appearance of action, but it continues to be the 
Liberal version of action, continued overspending while doing 
nothing to reduce Canada's deficit and debt load.
<P>
	The Reform Party has always supported the idea of listening 
to the voice of the people, what we call the grassroots of Canada. 
We listen to what they have to say and we have tried to do for 
them what they have asked.
<P>
	Canadians are being quite clear. They want leadership and 
they are challenging government to produce real legislation to 
reform a shockingly wasteful and battered social safety net. We 
cannot afford to wait. Canada's debt and deficit are lodestones 
around the necks of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The government spends $110 million a day more than it earns 
on programs that are antiquated, misguided and that Canadians 
no longer believe in or support. Given this mindset the 
government now has an excellent opportunity to begin to 
overhaul the system and to redirect funds to individuals who 
need it.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that the people of Canada are this 
country's most valuable resource and that the nurture and 
development of human knowledge, skills and relationships are 
the keys to full participation in the 21st century.
<P>
	We affirm the value and dignity of the individual person and 
the importance of strengthening and protecting the family unit 
as essential to the well-being of individuals and society.
<P>
	Page 9 of the discussion paper states: ``As too many older 
workers and young families have been squeezed out of the 
middle class our society increasingly has begun to be polarized 
between well educated, highly skilled Canadians in demand by 
employers, today's economic elite, and less well educated 
people without specialized up to date job skills who have been 
losing ground. Thus  the key to dealing with social insecurity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6700"> 6700 </A></B>
<P>
can be summed up in the single phrase, helping people get and 
keep jobs''.
<P>
	How specifically are the Liberals going to ensure people get 
back to work? It is evident in Canada that the median family 
standard of living is falling even with two wage earner families. 
The number of people living in poverty is growing and within 
that group the number of those who work full time but are still 
poverty stricken is growing even faster.
<P>
	The number of unemployed, even counting the part timers as 
fully employed and not counting the 100,000 who are too 
discouraged to seek work, is at a shocking 1.1 million 
Canadians. It is time to get to the root of the problem facing 
Canadian families and their children.
<P>
	This problem is ultimately the state of the nation's finances. 
The reason so many children are reported to be living in poverty 
is that many are the children of parents who are unemployed. 
Unemployment still remains above 10 per cent in this country. 
Even though the Liberals have been throwing billions of dollars 
into the so-called infrastructure program the unemployment 
rate has only dropped two-tenths of a point.
<P>
	Why is the infrastructure program not working? The 
government is giving billions of dollars to infrastructure 
projects. Yet here we are one year after the election, billions of 
dollars poorer and the unemployment rate has barely moved.
<P>
	We are experiencing an economic polarization that affects 
everyone.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers are less able to buy the products that big 
industry produces. Industry consequently has fewer 
opportunities for further expansion. The rich consequently have 
fewer opportunities for investment. Workers consequently have 
fewer job opportunities. Less money now flows into normal 
projects and investment cycles. Wages are affected and further 
restrained and the end result is reduced employment. Who 
suffers? Our families.
<P>
	The Liberals continue a status quo approach to Canada's 
employment dilemma and divert attention from this problem by 
calling it child poverty. The Liberals suggest that Canada's 
children live in poverty. The Campaign 2000 group issued a 
report that condemned the Canadian government and indirectly 
the compassion and generosity of Canadians. It is alleged that 
our child poverty rates are higher than all other countries in 
comparison except for the United States. The statistics that are 
tossed carelessly about would have us believe that fully 20 per 
cent of all Canadian children live in poverty. This condemnation 
leaves a very graphic image in the minds of all who hear it. 
Children are seen to be living in a deplorable state: 
malnourished, poorly clothed, poorly housed and under loved. 
Such careless statements damage the image of Canada both 
within the country and internationally. This repeated suggestion 
that 20 per  cent of children in Canada live in poverty is not 
defined. What does this really mean?
<P>
	The report of the standing committee on health and welfare, 
social affairs, seniors and the status of women stated on page 5 
of its report that the Statistics Canada measures are continually 
and deliberately misused as poverty measures.
<P>
	When the Liberals state that 20 per cent of Canadian children 
live in poverty they are using a definition of poverty that does 
not conform to what most people think it to mean. This is where 
the confusion begins. This government is purposefully 
perpetuating this confusion and is misleading the Canadian 
public in terms of what the real problem is. Perhaps it has 
become easier to create a problem that does not really exist than 
to fix the real one.
<P>
	Let me explain to the House how this interpretation has been 
purposefully and carefully crafted. When the Liberals refer to 
poverty they are referring to a financial state measured by 
StatsCan low income cut-offs. Each year, StatsCan produces a 
series of income cut-offs that marks the level of gross income 
below which families must spend disproportionate amounts on 
food, clothing and shelter. The cut-offs are commonly referred 
to as poverty lines. They are adjusted for family size and size of 
the community in order to reflect differences in basic 
expenditures. StatsCan considers those whose incomes fall 
below these lines to be living in straitened circumstances. A 
poor child is one who is defined as one who lives in a family 
whose total income is below the low income cut-off.
<P>
	When StatsCan states that 20 per cent of children live in 
poverty what it means is that 20 per cent of children live below 
the low income cut-off point. This LICO is purely relative and 
does not relate in any way to actual comparable standards of 
living. Fully 18 per cent of Canada's LICO population own their 
own homes mortgage free. This issue becomes a matter of 
responsibility on the part of not only government but Canadians. 
My party supports the legitimate role of government to do for 
people whatever they need to have done but cannot do at all-or 
do as well for themselves-individually or through 
non-government organizations.
<P>
	The solution to Canada's dysfunctional social support system 
is less government interference. Provide assistance in 
meaningful ways. We need to offer incentives for parents in 
determining the best choices for child care. Social engineering 
policies that force parents to place their children into day care 
are intrusive and discriminatory. Treat all families fairly and 
remove the day care expense allowance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6701"> 6701 </A></B>
<P>
	Support single parent families by allowing private collection 
agencies to go after deadbeat parents delinquent on 
maintenance payments.
<P>
	Provide good jobs for Canadians and cut their tax burden, 
creating a climate of initiative and investment. Stop 
overspending, balance the budget and begin to pay down our 
debt which now totals over $533 billion.
<P>
	While I recognize the attempt that has been made to wrap 
some protective arms around Canadians in the name of social 
reform, the discussion paper is mere rhetorical flourish, long on 
words, short on numbers and devoid of any plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech. I have 
one very short question.
<P>
	The hon. member's party has repeatedly criticized everything 
that we have put forward so far, and the social reform is no 
different. It has said, and I caution it is in <I>Hansard</I>, that it is 
going to cut $15 billion. From where?
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to be quite blunt this morning in my response to the question 
from the hon. member on the other side of the House.
<P>
	All that happened yesterday during question period was an 
attack on the opposition side by the Liberal side of the House. 
Genuine questions were placed yesterday during question 
period and all we saw was an attack.
<P>
	I am going to give an answer this morning to the hon. member 
and ask him to look at the big picture because this government 
has failed Canadians financially, socially, economically and 
constitutionally. Quite frankly, Canadians are fed up, like I am, 
with this kind of approach to social reform. That is my answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister 
of Human Resources Development and this government for 
taking on a very important initiative. It is an initiative of 
historical proportions and is extremely important for this 
generation of Canadians as we deal with changing dynamics and 
the changing configuration of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	If there is one thing that is constant about our society, it is 
change. If we look at the social, technological and economic 
changes that have occurred over the past 30 years, it would 
follow logically that our social programs which were initiated 
many years ago need to be altered to better deal with the present 
reality.
<P>
	Our social programs touch every single individual who 
resides in this country. It is about the people in this Chamber. It 
is about our neighbours. It is about our friends. It is about this 
country's children. It is about the young people who today are 
struggling to get that very  first important job, to reach that 
milestone of getting the type of training they require.
<P>
	Underneath this change and new configuration there is a very 
simple notion, a simple premise which ties all the issues 
together. The best form of security for Canadians comes from 
having a job. That premise underlies every part of this 
discussion paper.
<P>
	Canadians want to work not only for economic security but 
for the sense of purpose and dignity that work provides. The 
Catholic Children's Aid Society in Toronto expressed this point 
very well in its submission to the parliamentary standing 
committee earlier this year. It said that people receive meaning 
and a sense of who they are from their work. Their well-being, 
social involvement and contributions are defined by their work. 
That is what social security reform is all about.
<P>
	If the best form of security is a job, then our social programs 
should help people get jobs. Unemployment insurance should 
really be employment insurance, a springboard to launch people 
back into the workforce. Employment programs should be 
measured by one simple criterion: Do they help people get jobs?
<P>
	Social assistance should help people find jobs, not hinder 
them. It should provide support where it is needed, but focus on 
helping people gain independence. That is not the way the 
system works now. For too many people it does just the 
opposite, making it harder for people to gain that independence, 
to access training. For too many people the system gets things 
backward.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	This debate is about addressing the real challenges and real 
problems of real people throughout this country.
<P>
	In a letter to the Minister of Human Resources Development a 
divorced mother of two writes about how she tried to get off 
welfare and how the system abandoned her as a result. She says: 
``It is very backward that I had to quit my job to provide better 
for my family''.
<P>
	A young man writes about his pride in staying off UI by taking 
short term jobs in his desire to improve his job prospects 
through training, training that he cannot afford unless he quits 
work and gets UI benefits. He comments: ``The price of values is 
extremely high under the present system''. How in heaven's 
name can we motivate youth with things as they are?
<P>
	An unemployed worker writes about the bureaucratic red tape 
that has delayed the training he needs while his UI benefits run 
out and his life savings are depleted.
<P>
	A young woman who lost her job writes about programs that 
seem irrelevant and ineffective. After a year in the system she 
finds herself no closer to finding a job than the day she started.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6702"> 6702 </A></B>
<P>
	A disabled athlete writes with enthusiasm about his plans to 
get off welfare and start his own business. He expresses his 
frustration with the welfare rules that stop him from raising the 
capital he needs to get the business started.
<P>
	Is the status quo working for these people? Is the system 
working for these people? Or is the system that is supposed to 
help these people actually denying them their rightful 
opportunity to bring about positive change to their lives?
<P>
	We could have chosen to do what past governments have done 
and shy away from this very difficult debate. However we asked 
Canadians and members in this House to take on the challenge of 
changing people's lives and their children's lives by providing 
them with a better tool kit.
<P>
	Everywhere I go, in every city and town, on every street and 
avenue, citizens of this great country are looking for change. It 
is our responsibility to bring about that change. It is our 
responsibility to give our young people a green light, not a pink 
slip. It is our responsibility to get people off the welfare rolls 
and on to the payrolls of our businesses. That is what this debate 
is all about.
<P>
	It is clear that things are not working. We can sit idly by and 
not answer to the changes which are occurring all around us, or 
we can take some tough decisions and engage Canadians in a 
meaningful debate about the type of social security system they 
want.
<P>
	I would like to look specifically at the options proposed in this 
debate. Let us look at increasing investment in our people 
through better employment programs, refocusing 
unemployment insurance to help people get jobs, and helping 
parents to balance work and family responsibilities through 
such measures as funding for better child care.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us bring children into the fold and give them 
opportunities. Let us get started the right way. Let us give young 
people, our children the support they need. Start them off on the 
right foot so they can look to the future with confidence because 
they have been given the tools, the nurturing and the love so 
many of them require. Let us support a welfare system that 
opens up opportunity and hope instead of locking people into 
dependence and keeping too many of our children in poverty.
<P>
	I hear the hon. member from the Reform Party heckling. I 
think the Reform Party should come clean with Canadians. The 
only thing it has offered in this debate is that the way to erase 
poverty in this country is by lowering the level at which we 
define poverty. That is a simpleton's approach to a very 
important problem.
<P>
	The federal government spends more than $3 billion on 
employment programs and services like job counselling, 
training and labour market information. It is or should be a good 
investment. It should help people get  off UI or welfare and back 
into paid work. However, far too many people end up in 
programs that have little to do with opportunities or their needs. 
Many get training for jobs that do not exist locally. Many are 
shunted from one training program to the next when all they 
really need is some basic counselling and advice on what jobs 
are available.
<P>
	The key is to build a flexible system. Social programs should 
serve people, not the other way around. People should not be 
made to fit into programs. Programs should be made so that 
people can have access to training. There should be flexibility so 
that people can go from one program to another to obtain the tool 
kit they require to participate fully in our economy.
<P>
	For example only 10 per cent of all UI claimants receive 
counselling. We have to change that. We have to provide 
Canadians with wider opportunities, a bigger menu. Sometimes 
we put people in training programs when what they really 
require is some counselling and a personal action plan. Give 
them better labour market information. Tell them where the jobs 
are and what they should be training for. Tell them what the 
opportunities are in the present market and give them the 
required tools so they can get back into the labour force.
<P>
	The action plan we are talking about would have to be 
supported by more flexible programs. As I said earlier, people 
need good information about the job market, more accessible 
training programs, different kinds of training, classroom 
training, on the job training, computer based training and 
distance learning to ensure they get what works best for their 
situation in their community.
<P>
	Let us talk about incentives for hiring unemployed workers. 
In some cases government could pay part of the wages for those 
unemployed workers who need experience and on the job 
training. This would make it easier for employers to hire people 
with employment problems. Funding could also pay wages for 
unemployed workers to do useful work in their communities or 
to help unemployed individuals start their own businesses using 
the available tools. We have to pay more attention to getting 
results, to making sure that people get the help they need to get 
jobs. This means less attention to rigid rules and procedures set 
in Ottawa, more flexibility in letting communities manage their 
own programs. Businesses, workers, and others in the 
community can often decide what kind of programs work best at 
the local level. Let us put the words empowerment for 
communities, empowerment for the individual, a reality. It is by 
far the best way to deal with the issues ahead.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at better ways to deal in a co-operative manner 
with the provinces. Let us talk about a single window approach. 
People should not have to go to 7, 8, 9, 10 different offices to 
find out who is going to help them during these difficult times of 
unemployment and restructuring in our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6703"> 6703 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us establish single windows in co-operation with the 
provinces, with local communities. Let us reach out at the 
community level and use what we have at our disposal to make 
sure that people are provided with better services, with better 
assistance, with a more efficient system that can help them deal 
with the challenges they face.
<P>
	In addition, discussions with the provinces should look at 
improving the federal vocational rehabilitation of disabled 
persons. This exercise is about maximizing human potential. It 
is about giving our country the best possible, best skilled 
workforce available so that people, so that businesses, will be 
attracted to our nation. They will invest and we will create the 
type of vibrant community business environment that will speak 
to generating wealth for our nation.
<P>
	Better employment programs will depend in part on designing 
a better UI program. The UI program works well for people who 
require short-term support while looking for a job but it does not 
work well for those who need help adjusting to the changes in 
the job market.
<P>
	Canadians who find themselves repeatedly out of work need 
better support to get and keep jobs. The program often 
discourages adjustment. For some unemployed people there is 
no incentive to learn new skills that are in demand by employers.
<P>
	The program is easily abused. Some workers and employers 
plan their work schedules around the UI program, alternating 
employment with UI benefits as a way of life. Many working 
Canadians, such as people in part time jobs or the 
self-employed, are not covered at all by the existing program.
<P>
	What does that say about a society that on the one hand speaks 
about self-employment, promoting business, but then does not 
provide the support mechanism that is required for business to 
prosper?
<P>
	The discussion paper outlines two basic proposals for 
unemployment insurance. One would work more or less the 
same way it does now but what is really the key is the adjustment 
component. Forty per cent of all UI claimants in the past five 
years have had at least three claims. That tells us that there is a 
dysfunctional relationship between that individual and the 
marketplace. So what do we do. We have to provide people with 
a tool kit that can reintegrate them into the workforce. These are 
new problems. We are not dealing with cyclical unemployment, 
we are dealing with structural unemployment. We cannot have 
the old form of unemployment insurance dealing with the new 
reality, the new economy. We need to change it, and this is 
proposed in the discussion paper.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	There are many options to explore in this approach. For 
example, we need to decide how long claimants can draw 
adjustment benefits, and how much they should get. Two of the 
hardest questions would be the following.
<P>
	Should benefits be income tested so that the amount a person 
receives depends on what other family income is available? That 
is one question we have to openly debate.
<P>
	Is it fair that an individual who makes $40,000 or $50,000, 
working eight months of the year, receives UI benefits? Is it fair 
that somebody somewhere making $18,000 or $20,000 a year, 
working 12 months of the year, actually subsidizes that other 
individual? Is that fair?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not fair, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Is it worth debating?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> It is worth debating, and that is why the 
government has placed it in the discussion paper.
<P>
	The second approach to UI reform does not distinguish 
between occasional and frequent users. It adjusts the eligibility 
requirements or the benefits available to all claimants. This 
involves increasing the time a person must work to get benefits, 
reducing the length of time that people can draw UI benefits, or 
lowering the amount a claimant receives.
<P>
	This approach could save money which might be re-invested 
in employment services. However, I feel it does not in itself 
address the real problems of people who have trouble getting 
and keeping work. Under either approach we should consider the 
needs of workers in non-standard employment.
<P>
	More people today work in part time or temporary jobs, or 
have more than one job. Also there are more self-employed 
people. Many are not fully covered by unemployment insurance. 
Some are excluded entirely from UI. If the current trends 
continue many of these kinds of employment will not be 
non-standard for long, they will set new standards. If the UI 
program is going to stay in touch with the needs of Canadians we 
will have to start thinking about where the new kinds of jobs can 
fit in.
<P>
	The discussion paper talks about child care. It talks about 
restructuring and modernizing Canada's social security system. 
Many questions need to be answered. I ask Canadians, members 
of Parliament who will be holding town hall meetings, 
Canadians whom I think should be sitting around their kitchen 
tables discussing these key issues, to participate in this historic 
debate so that we can bring about positive change to the lives of 
our people.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. There was much 
that was well-intentioned, but instead of all these words, I 
would have liked to hear figures and specific proposals.
<P>
	I would have liked the parliamentary secretary to tell us how 
much will be cut from employment programs, student assistance 
programs and income security programs for the neediest in our 
society. I would have appreciated some figures.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance brought down his budget, the 
figures mentioned were in the billions of dollars. I would have 
like the parliamentary secretary to show us the courtesy of 
explaining how this applies to the government's proposals, or in 
any case, the proposals mentioned in the paper. If that means 
three or four or five billion dollars less invested by governments 
in social programs, it would have been nice if he had said so. I 
think that is the least we could expect.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	I also wish he had elaborated somewhat on the implications of 
the minister's proposals for provincial jurisdictions. We are 
getting into a big federal-provincial squabble here. Of course, 
as a sovereignist Quebecer, I do not really mind because I see the 
federal government and the State of Quebec as having entirely 
different objectives, and I think they should each have their own 
policies. When I see the federal government massively invading 
provincial jurisdictions, it merely confirms my arguments in 
favour of Quebec's sovereignty. I should be pleased, but in a 
way I am not because, once again, the neediest in our society, in 
Canada and Quebec, will have to wait and listen to all these 
discussions, and meanwhile, there will be no solutions on the 
horizon.
<P>
	In other words, I would have liked to see some clearcut 
proposals at last. Basically, the minister is inviting us to 
participate in a big dialogue. It is like being invited to <I>Parler 
pour parler</I>, on TV. For six months, Canadians and Quebecers 
will discuss the minister's proposals but there will be no 
solutions on the table. I would have like to hear this: ``We, as a 
government, propose to deal with unemployment this way; we 
propose to deal with unemployment in another way; and we 
propose to invest certain amounts in income security''. Nothing 
is being proposed. We are invited to talk about it, to discuss it 
amongst ourselves. That was the comment I wanted to make.
<P>
	I also have a question for the parliamentary secretary. So far, I 
can see no proposals in this document concerning employment. 
However, the parliamentary secretary did say that some jobs in 
Canada were not being filled because Canadians lack training. I 
wish he would tell us which newspaper today, in English Canada 
or in Quebec, has pages and pages of want ads with jobs that will 
not be filled because people lack skills. We do not  find that in 
the papers. The papers tell us that the unemployment rate is 
between 10 and 12 per cent. The papers tell us that people want 
training but are not getting it.
<P>
	We have a society that tells us: ``We are going to help you find 
a job'', but as far as anyone can see, there are not that many jobs 
to go around.
<P>
	So I wish the parliamentary secretary would help me in this 
respect. Where should my constituents in Jonquière look to find 
all these job offers in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to what 
the hon. member said. I have a bit of a problem with some of the 
comments he made vis-à-vis federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	If the hon. member takes some time to read the program as 
outlined by the federal government, he will see that we have a 
very caring federal government which is reaching out to the 
provinces in a number of ways.
<P>
	We have a federal proposal dealing with the management and 
planning of the labour market, a single window approach which 
I am sure the hon. member would like to support in the province 
of Quebec, to make our system more efficient and to avoid the 
waste and duplication that occur in various programs we deal 
with as federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	On the issue of fiscal parameters, the hon. member should 
read that section once again. It is in the green paper. It is quite 
clear. We spoke about it in the last budget. The hon. member 
knows about the $2.4 billion that we cut from UI. That is in here. 
The government was elected on a commitment to reach 3 per 
cent of the GDP deficit reduction target. That is in this book.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	We are being extremely upfront with Canadians. In reference 
to job creation, I find it quite ironic that we have created over 
275,000 jobs. Nothing illustrates more the success of the 
government than what we have been able to do in the riding of 
the official opposition critic of human resources development. 
When she came into office in October the unemployment rate in 
her riding was 12.3 per cent. I am happy to report to the House of 
Commons that the unemployment rate in her riding is now 9.1 
per cent. I do not hear members of the Bloc Quebecois 
congratulating us on such initiatives, and may I add that 
members on that side rise in the House day in and day out.
<P>
	When we look at job growth the province of Quebec is number 
two in Canada. That speaks to the type of programs the 
government has initiated in bringing about what we refer to as 
positive change in the lives of the people of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6705"> 6705 </A></B>
<P>
	On the issue of the general philosophical thrust of the 
government, when we look at legislation that has gone through 
the House already; when we look at the fact that our Canada 
student loans legislation, which was approved by the House, 
has a section that deals with special opportunity grants for 
disabled Canadians, for women who are pursuing doctoral 
studies, for high need students, and for people who come from 
lower incomes; and when we look at the whole notion of 
deferred grants where students graduating with debt loads of 
$22,000 are seeing them reduced by $6,000 by the federal 
government, it speaks to the spirit in which we operate.
<P>
	Let us also look at the unemployment insurance changes we 
made in the last budget. Low income unemployed Canadians 
with dependants are receiving the highest possible benefit rate 
of 60 per cent; 27,000 people have benefited from that change.
<P>
	For the life of me I do not know where the hon. member has 
been in the past few months. We have moved very quickly since 
the October 25 election when we received an overwhelming 
mandate from the people of Canada on legislation that speaks to 
improving the quality of life of Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast, including those in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested to hear the member mention in his speech that we may 
have to take a look at the size of family incomes when we talk 
about social services. I think that is a really great idea.
<P>
	The biggest problem we face at the end of the process is that 
most members in the House will not be permitted to vote freely 
on whatever legislation the government decides to bring down. 
They will end up having to toe the party line regardless of all the 
consultation that took place in the ridings. As the House knows, 
I am originally from New Zealand and I have seen what happens 
when consultation goes on and on and on.
<P>
	Is the member taking responsibility for letting his 
constituents know that the whole area of social programs is 
costing a phenomenal amount of money?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I engage in very extensive 
consultation in my riding. I take great pride in representing the 
views of my constituents.
<P>
	Talking about free votes, I have not noticed too many people 
voting against their own parties; everybody stands at the same 
time. Let us put the rhetoric aside for a second and address the 
reality of the fact that the Reform Party operates more or less 
like any other traditional party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak on this very important subject.
<P>
	I recognize, as do many of my colleagues in the House, the 
need to reform our social safety net. There are several 
compelling reasons for that reform. We live in a world where 
more and more skills are needed to meet the  needs of more and 
more jobs today. It is also a world of rapid technological change 
and we have an aging labour force.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We live in a society where unfortunately marital breakdown 
has become more commonplace, leading to poverty. That is one 
of the reasons I am a strong advocate of returning to traditional 
family values and of polices which help families stay together. 
We live in a society where those in need can rely less and less on 
their families and communities for help.
<P>
	Canada's current income security programs were set up at a 
time when unemployment, regardless of skills, was a brief 
condition between jobs; when the one-income two-parent 
family was the rule; and when child poverty was hardly talked 
about, let alone measured.
<P>
	Canada has seen great change in the last decade alone. The 
former government was working on reforms that would help 
Canadians meet today's challenges, reforms that would reorient 
passive income support programs to an active investment in 
people; reforms that would remove barriers that prevent many 
from becoming active members of the labour force; reforms that 
would replace disjointed programs with a coherent system.
<P>
	Social policy must be designed for people. More specifically 
it should be designed for the people who need the most. 
Canadians already pay enough taxes to have some of the most 
generous social programs in the world. Our challenge is to use 
the money already in the system to make programs as flexible as 
possible so recipients can receive the benefits to meet their 
needs and become self-reliant.
<P>
	We must encourage individuals to break the cycle of 
dependency and help them to help themselves. I realize, as many 
Canadians realize, that if we do nothing the quality of these 
programs will deteriorate. Social policy must be updated to fit 
the realities of the nineties and the 21st century so that all 
Canadians can participate and face the opportunities and 
challenges ahead with confidence.
<P>
	I will be listening to my constituents in the days, weeks and 
months ahead and getting their input, but these are some of my 
initial concerns with the green paper. I am not convinced the 
government's discussion paper contains a coherent set of 
proposals that will let us move in the direction which I have been 
talking about.
<P>
	I am deeply concerned about the time it has taken the 
government to bring forward the discussion paper. It was a paper 
that we were supposed to see in the spring. We should now, 
according to the original timetable, be looking at legislation. 
While we were waiting and as we continue to wait, thousands of 
people and thousands of mothers and families wanted and want 
to leave welfare but could not and cannot because they would 
lose the dental and medical benefits their children need.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6706"> 6706 </A></B>
<P>
	As members of Parliament we are often called on to help 
people in dire straits, people who are not worried about 
constitutional niceties like a division of powers. For example, 
I know a family with a severely disabled child. In the past the 
family has been able to count on government support to help 
meet the needs of their child, but no longer.
<P>
	Families such as these look to the federal and provincial 
governments to work together to rationalize programs so they 
help those most in need. Some of the most worrisome parts of 
the paper are the suggestions for changes in UI, worrisome 
because in its two-tier proposal the government was unable to 
offer a definition of frequent user.
<P>
	In areas of Atlantic Canada we have people who can be 
considered frequent users of UI. It is not because they are 
abusing the system. Nor are their employers abusing the system. 
It is because some parts of our economy are highly seasonal. 
That is why Atlantic Canadians need a coherent system of 
programs that will allow them to move with the changing times. 
What they do not need are proposals that cut them off at the 
knees.
<P>
	Canada's strength has always been to combine a strong 
economy with a commitment to a secure social safety net that 
supports the needs of Canadians. Historically we have proven to 
be practical people who see that we have to move forward and 
adapt to changing conditions in order to keep our high quality of 
life.
<P>
	I am not convinced the government's proposals will let us do 
that. This has been said in the past but let me repeat it because I 
am a firm believer in it: Good economic policy goes hand in 
hand with good social policy and vice versa.
<P>
	We should all want to protect programs that work and change 
the ones that do not. We should all want to see to it that our 
workforce is trained to the highest standards. We should all want 
to make sure that our educational system produces graduates 
who can take full advantage of opportunities in a constantly 
changing economy. We want those graduates to have long term, 
high paying jobs. We want an educational system that 
encourages lifelong learning.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I do not believe Canadians will be well served by an approach 
to social policy that wants governments to borrow billions of 
dollars or impose more taxes on Canadians to retain a false and 
unrealistic sense of security. Nor will they be well served by an 
approach that will simply rip apart the social fabric. We need a 
reasonable approach with the watchwords of fairness, 
efficiency, self-sufficiency and dignity.
<P>
	I will support proposals that advocate that approach and make 
the system more proactive. Hopefully before it is too late the 
government can offer such suggestions because I fear the 
discussion paper released yesterday does not. In fact in the 
words of a wise man, ``never has a government taken so long to 
say so little''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remind the hon. member across the way that this is a 
discussion paper. Some of the things I have heard over the last 
day have really concerned me; I heard a lot of partisan politics.
<P>
	We were elected this time to do the very best we could. We 
should offer strong, viable solutions rather than rhetoric, 
niggling and sniping. I have heard very little concrete 
suggestions or very little from members about what they will 
actually do for input into the government before this is made 
government policy.
<P>
	I am really looking for some concrete suggestions. What will 
the member who has just spoken with such heartfelt feelings 
about some of the suggestions in the paper do to ensure that 
there is good input into this paper?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have time to 
answer the question after question period.
<P>
	It being 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

is an autoimmune disease that affects thousands of Canadians, 
mostly women during child bearing years.
<P>
	The cause of Lupus is yet unknown. As one of its priorities the 
government has issues relevant to women's health. Here we 
have an example of an illness that affects women for which 
treatment is limited and about which medical science has yet 
much to learn.
<P>
	I encourage all members of the House to support the many

annoying action being taken regularly by some hon. members 
opposite. Each day they list the current amount of national debt, 
down to the last penny.
<P>
	What they fail to do is list the assets balancing the debt. I have 
no doubt that if they were asked to list their personal net worth 
they would declare their property mortgage, car loan, credit card 
balance and maybe even the balance owing to their tailors for the 
suits they are wearing. I have no doubt hon. members would then 
list their property, cars, et cetera, as assets, pointing out the 
equity they had in the items.

	In the interest of fairness, if they persist in these statements I 
will at every opportunity list the assets of our country from each

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to our great surprise, the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, the Liberal Party's 
specialist on statements under S.O. 31, has dissociated himself 
from his party's caucus and expressed reservations about the 
proposed reform of social programs. He said: ``I have some 
reservations about occupational training, etc.''
<P>
	To show his dissent and to distance himself from his party, the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine joined a 
strategic friend in his party, the member for York 
South-Weston, who said: ``For the ten years we were the 
Official Opposition, we accused the Conservatives of reducing 
the deficit on the backs of the poor and we are doing exactly the 
same thing''.
<P>
	I therefore call on the Liberal Party's No. 31 to pay attention 
to his fine career, because breaking the party line is unlikely to 
please his Prime Minister or many other people, for that matter.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Monday night the Reform Party heard the views of thousands of 
Canadians during an historic nationwide electronic townhall 
meeting.
<P>
	Unlike the Prime Minister, these Canadians are willing to 
look at new methods of solving the problem. Ninety-three per 
cent of the more than 10,000 callers want to see an end to the 
national unity issue. Fifty-seven per cent believe the best course 
of action is to change the system for all of Canada, with 92 per 
cent saying that change should come from the people.
<P>
	While the Prime Minister has stated that he finds referenda 
revolting, he might want to pay attention to these results. The 
Prime Minister has also said that Reform wants to discuss this 
issue because we are a failure with other issues.
<P>
	Failure is defined in the dictionary as a falling short of what is 
wanted or expected, in not doing, neglecting. Based on these 
definitions, it would appear that the word failure is best used to 
describe Liberal policies when they have them.

is still up to his tricks, with a skill and subtlety that no one 
expected.
<P>
	This time, the incorrigible minister is telling us what he 
thinks about labour force training: he is offering the provinces 
half a loaf and suggesting that the other half will be negotiated 
later. He might as well have added that the federal government 
will take the best part and leave the crumbs for the provinces.
<P>
	However, the minister should understand that Quebecers were 
not born to accept crumbs.
<P>
	His intention not to transfer full responsibility for labour 
force training to Quebec, on the pretext of national standards, is 
the cavalier response of the federal government to the broad

	The cancer establishment continues to focus on basic 
research, treatment and diagnosis. We should be exploring 
further than that: toxins in the environment and their effects, the

malignancy. There is nothing lonelier or more fearful and there

	Former Prime Minister Trudeau said in this House: ``There 
cannot be one cultural policy for Canadians of British and 
French origin, another for the original peoples and yet a third for

<P>
	Designed to integrate and not assimilate all Canadians in 
every facet of Canadian life, the policy of multiculturalism has 
become the envy of countries around the world struggling to 
integrate minorities into the mainstream of their societies.

	Today multiculturalism continues to contribute to a shared 
sense of Canadian identity and societal cohesion.

I rise today to bring to the attention of Canadians the importance 
of business development corporations. At the same moment that 
we are looking at a wide ranging revision of our programming 
through human resources development it is important that we 
recognize programs that work well.
<P>
	Since 1981 over 200 BDCs have been providing loans to small 
businesses. In Ontario 55 BDCs have granted over $115 million 
in loans to almost 5,000 businesses. Companies exist today 
which otherwise would not.
<P>
	The job creation impact has been impressive. In Ontario the 
program has created 10,926 jobs at an average cost of only 
$6,200. Even more impressive is the realization that the 
corporations make loans which have been turned down by 
traditional lenders and that in 93 per cent of the cases the 
advances are repaid in an orderly fashion.
<P>
	BDCs are a success story of small business support and job 
creation. They deserve continued support.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday in

a speech on social programs. In that speech he outlined the type 
of attitude he felt would be needed in examining Canada's social 
programs, the need for co-operation, earnest debate, the free 
exchange of ideas and, most important, the need to refrain from 
deliberate, partisan cheap shots.
<P>
	No sooner did he get those words out of his mouth than he 
proceeded to deliver a cheap shot of his own by repeating the 
ludicrous charge that the Reform Party would cut $15 billion out 
of social programs. This is rubbish, old style politics and he 
knows it. It is the Liberal government that is facing $15 billion 
in cuts out of total program spending if it is to meet its meagre 
deficit targets.
<P>
	Canadians deserve better than this type of irresponsible scare 
mongering. Preying on the fears of the needy is no way to garner 
the respect of the people of this country.
<P>
	When it comes to partisan cheap shots the do as I say, not as I

nobody. By working with all Canadians we can deliver what we 
promised, a vibrant and prosperous economy in a country in 
which the need for social programs will decline.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, as of 
September 28 the government's infrastructure program claims 
to have created 71,000 jobs. Even if that were true, these jobs are 
only short term. By its own admission with the total expenditure 
of $4.5 billion just 10 per cent of these jobs are permanent. It 
comes as no surprise on this side of the House that some 
provinces have received no long term jobs at all.
<P>
	B.C., Prince Edward Island, Yukon and First Nations people 
have none. Saskatchewan, though, has six long term jobs and, 
hurray, Manitoba gets three. The most obvious fact is even less 
of a surprise; the lion's share, 73 per cent of the long term jobs, 
has been created in one province alone. Which province could 
that be? Of course, that province is the minister's own.
<P>
	The infrastructure score is Ontario, 5,140; British Columbia, 
zero. The taxpayer, as usual, loses the entire political shell game 
by $4.5 billion.

his provincial and territorial counterparts. Until recently, all the 
premiers were to accompany him with one exception: the 
premier of Quebec is still refusing to be a part of Team Canada.
<P>
	Contrary to the explanations of the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois that Mr. Parizeau has more pressing obligations, we 
have just learned that the Quebec premier will in fact be taking a 
holiday at that time. Instead of representing Quebec on Team 
Canada, he will apparently be on vacation. Imagine! This is

this past Monday the town of St. Andrews, New Brunswick 
launched its daffodil project by planting several thousand bulbs. 
This project is being carried out for two major reasons: for the 
beautification of the town and to complement the already 
thriving tourist industry in that area.
<P>
	These are the types of initiatives that assist in moving our 
tourism industries forward. I would like to congratulate the 
town of St. Andrews and its citizens on this worthy project. Not 
only did the community participate in its own program, but the 
town was also kind enough to provide daffodil bulbs for planting 
here on Parliament Hill.

this donation from St. Andrews by the Sea.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMREFORM">SOCIAL PROGRAM REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The centralizing offensive being mounted by Ottawa with its 
reform of social programs has already caused a general outcry, 
and not just in Quebec. Yesterday, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs categorically rejected, for the first 
time moreover, the complete transfer to Quebec of federal 
responsibilities in the area of manpower training.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
the statement by his colleague the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs that Ottawa is announcing that the 
federal government will refuse to transfer full responsibility for 
manpower training to Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, last spring we proposed a new 
three year agreement on manpower training to all the provinces. 
As I said yesterday in the House, it included a transfer of 
responsibility for institutional training and training that is 
purchased in community colleges and CEGEPs.
<P>
	We indicated our willingness to invite the provinces to plan 
priorities for federal resource investments in each province. In 
the case of Quebec where we spend about $800 million, that 
takes in an envelope of almost $500 million. We indicated our 
willingness to work with them on a system of guichet unique, of 
single window deliveries. We also indicated that if the provinces 
would be willing we would look at transferring responsibility 
for some of the programs which are more clearly in the 
educational field, such as stay in school programs and others.
<P>
	Several provinces have responded positively and quite 
constructively. We are in the process of negotiating with them. 
We have not heard officially from the new Government of 
Quebec as to what its response to that agreement would be.
<P>
	Let me make one important point. These are our proposed 
three year agreements. There is no point in having longer term 
agreements until we know what the new structure of our 
programs will be. There is no point in reassembling or 
reallocating programs that may not exist or that may be changed 
or altered. Therefore, the three year interim agreement is a very 
good demonstration of how we are prepared to be flexible. We 
are prepared to assign more responsibility to the provinces in 
areas of their competence. We want to work in co-operation 
with the provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has perhaps not heard back from Quebec, 
but former premier Johnson, a Liberal and a federalist as well, 
said during the recent election campaign in Quebec that he was 
not interested in this sort of half-measure from the federal 
government.
<P>
	I come back to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
who said that what they were proposing did not run counter to 
Quebec's demands, that they were meeting Quebec halfway. 
What they are saying is ``Take half the loaf now and we'll 
negotiate the other half later''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6711"> 6711 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the government realize that in stubbornly refusing to 
give Quebec the whole loaf in the areas of training and 
manpower, it is perpetuating the duplication and waste that are 
costing Quebec over $250 million, at the expense of those 
people who would like to return to work?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> On the contrary, Mr. Speaker. The federal 
government is showing a great deal of interest in working with 
provinces to redesign how we can better deliver services and 
programs.
<P>
	We already have agreements in place with a number of 
provinces. We just signed one with Ontario four weeks ago to 
establish a new Ontario training board where the federal and 
provincial governments would co-operate with business and 
labour to deliver services. We are certainly interested in doing 
that with other provinces as well.
<P>
	The study referred to by the hon. member, frankly, was a study 
not based on sound analysis. The hon. member took analysis 
done by the OECD covering 15 countries. He took an artificial 
figure and applied it across Quebec. He did not take the actual 
numbers. Therefore, any judgments being made are really 
subject to serious reconsideration. We have already submitted to 
the province of Quebec a reassessment of those numbers. I think 
you will see the duplication that is there is primarily because in 
many cases it is not on the federal side. We would like to see 
single window deliveries, and I think that is the key to it.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We need single window capability. All partners, the 
community groups, labour, the business community, the 
provinces and the federal government would share the work and 
collaborate on the review of services to serve every member of 
the public better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when he questions the $250-million figure, the 
minister is actually questioning Robert Bourassa, Daniel 
Johnson and former minister Bourbeau, all of whom happen to 
be Liberals as well as federalists. In fact, they should have said 
so during this past election campaign, but they chose not to for 
quite understandable reasons. It did not make much difference 
anyway.
<P>
	When the minister talks about co-operation, does he realize 
that, for two or three years now, there has been a consensus in 
Quebec amongst unions, business circles, the co-operative 
movement, the academic community and even the Liberal Party 
of Quebec that all powers concerning manpower should be 
repatriated in Quebec?
<P>
	How can the minister contend that his government is 
committed to discussing, or even co-operating, with the 
provinces, while it rejects from the outset one of Quebec's 
fundamental demands which enjoys widespread support among 
all the socioeconomic stakeholders in Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my first answer, we 
have already made an offer to all the provinces to transfer 
training responsibility to them. The member does not seem to 
have understood the importance of that particular statement in 
his scripted lines. It seems to me that would be a good 
demonstration at this time of how we can share.
<P>
	One thing not on the table is the unemployment insurance 
program. It is a national program. It is clearly in the 
Constitution. It is one program by which we can ensure that this 
country's resources are shared from one region to another to 
help those most in need. By the way, the hon. member well 
knows that Quebec has benefited mightily under that sharing 
over the past many years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Not only does the reform herald an unprecedented 
centralization effort, but one of its objectives is to reduce 
substantially the federal contribution to social assistance 
funding. This will leave the province no choice but to either 
increase their tax rates to compensate for the withdrawal of the 
federal government or cut back welfare benefits.
<P>
	How does the minister want us to take seriously his 
government's stated objective to do more for children living in 
poverty, when Ottawa is cutting its transfer payments to the 
provinces for social assistance? How can it be taken seriously? 
How contradictory, Mr. Speaker!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. 
member was last February or where he has been since, but that 
was clearly announced in the federal budget last February. I am 
glad that after nine months he is finally able to catch up with the 
figures.
<P>
	There was a clear declaration in the budget that we were going 
to hold transfer payments under these programs at the 1993-94 
level. As a result we have started to work with the provinces to 
find ways of more efficiently dealing with the problems of 
social assistance. We have already worked with provinces to 
find collaborative ways of enabling people on social assistance 
to get back to work, to begin to change the rules.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6712"> 6712 </A></B>
<P>
	That is one of the things which is part and parcel of the green 
book. We are prepared to immediately work with the provinces 
to change the rules under the Canada assistance plan to enable 
almost 50 per cent of those who are on social assistance and 
want to get back into the workforce to do so without being 
prohibitively discriminated against by losing income. The best 
way to handle the social assistance problem is to get people a 
job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister wishes to know where I was in February. I 
would like to tell him through you that, if he was to the left of the 
Liberal Party in the past, he is moving far to the right with this 
reform.
<P>
	How can he claim that he wants to help disadvantaged 
children, when the main consequence of his reform would be to 
impoverish the parents? How can he claim that he wants to help 
disadvantaged children?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously the hon. member has 
not talked to the people who are on social assistance. They want 
to have self-sufficiency. They want to have independence. They 
want to be able to earn an income for their families. They do not 
want to stay on dependency.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	That is what this green paper is all about. It is about giving 
people real hope that they do not have to be dependent on a 
program and cheque, but once again can go to work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government claims to be concerned about education and job 
skills for Canadians but the social policy discussion paper 
tabled yesterday calls for the virtual elimination of federal 
transfers in support of higher education.
<P>
	At the same time the government continues to spend billions 
of dollars on subsidies to businesses, interest groups and crown 
corporations. The minister must have had some set of spending 
priorities in preparing this paper. I ask the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, where does the funding of 
post-secondary education come in the government spending 
priorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it clearly comes very high 
because we are committed to an expenditure of over $8 billion to 
help the provinces in the area of higher education. It seems to me 
that we are prepared to put our money where our mouth is, 
unlike the hon. leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
slashing $1.5 billion from transfers to higher education hardly 
seems like an indication of high priority.
<P>
	In developing our approach on this issue, Reformers have said 
that the federal government ought to maintain as its highest 
spending priorities transfers in support of health care and 
education. We have advocated cutting virtually everything else 
in order to sustain those spending priorities.
<P>
	I ask the minister, why does the government not preserve 
federal funding for post-secondary education at current levels 
and get more bang for the buck by transferring that funding 
directly to students through educational vouchers rather than to 
the provinces and the institutions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question posed by the hon. 
leader of the Reform Party shows one thing clearly: He has not 
read the green book. If he had read it, he would have learned a 
couple of important facts.
<P>
	He likes to deal in facts. I am going to give him some facts. 
Number one is that present transfer arrangements under the 
existing EPF means the provinces are getting a substantial 
increase in revenue by the tax points we transfer to them. 
Therefore the revenue to provinces is going up for education 
through the tax points, but as a result of the existing formula the 
cash transfer declines over a period of time on a proper ratio.
<P>
	If the hon. leader of the Reform Party would understand that 
fact, he would not be using the kind of nonsensical statement 
that we are slashing programs. In fact the revenue is growing. 
We are saying that rather than having the cash disappear over a 
10 year period, let us use that money in order to lever an 
additional $3 billion back into higher education to assist all 
kinds of Canadians in going back to school. That is what is 
called creative government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
students know the difference between a repayable loan and a 
non-repayable voucher. I was endeavouring to get the minister 
to consider this more innovative way of transferring funding for 
higher education by paying directly to the students through 
non-repayable vouchers rather than through either tax points or 
transfers directly to the provinces.
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of students are worried that the federal 
government's withdrawal from federal support of higher 
education will damage the quality of their education. Students 
worry that the minister's scheme will end up loading themselves 
with a higher and higher debt load. Is the minister in his vaunted 
consultation process intending to travel and talk to university 
and college students to explain his position to them? I am certain 
he will get a warm welcome if he does.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole point of having an 
open consultation process which has been opposed by the 
members of the Reform Party is to allow a forum in which new 
ideas can come about.
<P>
	They say they did not do it. They have changed their minds 
since yesterday because five members of the Reform Party, 
including the leader of the party, got up yesterday and said: ``Do 
not have consultation. Do not have open participation. Do not 
consult the people. Do something now''. We do not believe in 
that philosophy. I say to the leader of the Reform Party that if he 
has a better way of proposing aid for students: ``Put it forward. 
Come to the committee. Here is the chairman right here. Suggest 
it to the committee. That is why we have an open process''.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I also say to the leader of the Reform Party: ``That is called 
democracy''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The social program reform proposes establishing two classes 
of unemployed workers: occasional UI claimants and frequent 
UI claimants, that is, 40 per cent of recipients, notably seasonal 
workers. We know that the Government of New Brunswick is 
particularly critical of the reform on this point.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development realize 
that the UI reform he proposes will heavily penalize the 
economy of the regions, which is very dependent on seasonal 
activities like fishing, forestry and tourism?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased the hon. 
member asked that question, because just about 45 minutes ago I 
had the privilege of being with the premier of New Brunswick in 
a public session wherein he said very explicitly that he supports 
the philosophy and direction of our reform paper.
<P>
	Furthermore he said that he appreciates the efforts we are 
making in the announcements we made last Monday in terms of 
a new employment enhancement program for seasonal workers, 
a new program of earning supplements and the experiments we 
are trying on UI eligibility requirements in the Atlantic 
provinces, particularly in Prince Edward Island, as a way of 
providing real support to make that transition.
<P>
	If the hon. member is at all interested I invite him to sit down 
with us. We would be prepared to go through with him, as we 
have done with the premier of New Brunswick, about how we 
can use this important time to have a real serious examination of 
the interest and concerns of industries with seasonal workers. 
That has not really been examined in the country for a long time; 
we have simply let things happen.
<P>
	Under this kind of review process we can seriously begin to 
look at the conditions and concerns of seasonal workers to make 
sure we build a new social security system that meets their 
needs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not surprised that Mr. McKenna was admonished 
by his federal big brother. Will the Minister admit, as his 
colleague of Intergovernmental Affairs did, that the reform he is 
proposing is not a miracle cure, that it will hit seasonal workers 
very hard, and particularly those in forestry who cannot work 
twelve months a year?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very unfortunate when 
members of the Bloc run out of any substantial argument that 
they turn to personal insult. The fact that they would have that 
kind of attitude toward one of the most distinguished public 
servants in Canada simply does not deserve a response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is unexpectedly for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister promised that he would make available 
technical papers containing estimates of the costs and savings of 
the reform alternatives he has set out in the green book. These 
estimates are demanded by everyone taking the reform 
proposals seriously. They are absolutely essential for the 
upcoming budget consultations by the House finance 
committee.
<P>
	Will the minister assure Canadians that these technical papers 
will contain estimates of costs and savings and give us a precise 
date for their publication?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I can give the assurance that 
we will give the economic scenarios that are required. We will 
work as quickly as we can to have all the papers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6714"> 6714 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member can understand, they are quite copious and 
we were busy printing the report. We will make them available 
as soon as possible, certainly for use by members of the 
committee when they begin the consultations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately time is of the essence. Budget consultations will 
have to be completed in seven weeks.
<P>
	Yesterday the Conference Board of Canada and a number of 
business economists predicted that this year's budget plan 
would not be met and that more spending cuts were needed to 
prevent a financial crisis for the country. All these experts say 
that cuts in social programs are needed.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Could the minister tell these financial experts and anxious 
Canadians that his reforms will lower social program 
expenditures in the next budget?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance have regularly told the House and the country that we 
will meet our targets.
<P>
	During the consultation process we will welcome suggestions 
from the opposition and from our own members on how these 
targets can be met effectively for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is also 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development. On page 63 
of the document he tabled yesterday, it is said that, and I quote: 
``It is true that replacing federal cash transfers would put 
upward pressure on tuition fees. This may be a necessary price 
to pay to put in place a permanent system for ensuring 
accessibility to post-secondary education''.
<P>
	How can the Minister pretend, as he did yesterday, that his 
reform will not limit accessibility to post-secondary education 
for thousands of young people when the proposed reduction in 
transfer payments will result in an increase in tuition fees? 
According to a Treasury Board memorandum which will not be 
released by the government, these fees could even double.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we have pointed out in the 
House, tuition fees have doubled over the past four or five years. 
They have already gone up that amount under the existing 
system. At the same time I point out that enrolment has 
substantially increased in that period.
<P>
	We have been providing through our student aid program, the 
student loan program, very successful forms of resources, but 
more is needed.
<P>
	In the document we have said that the decision on tuition 
increases is not ours to make; it is up to provincial governments 
to make them. If the provincial  governments are prepared to use 
the additional revenue they will be receiving through the EPF 
transfer of tax points to keep tuition rates down, it is their 
decision to make.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister also 
says in his document that students could use their RRSPs to 
repay their debts.
<P>
	Is the minister really serious when he suggests that students 
use their RRSPs? Does he really think that students have the 
means to invest in RRSPs while having to borrow even more to 
study?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we did not say that students 
could use their RRSPs. We said RRSPs could be used to help 
people get an education.
<P>
	That means parents who presently hold RRSPs could decide to 
use them to help their kids with an education. We want to 
develop other financial vehicles by which people could begin to 
invest in their children's future at an early age. We want to 
provide investment vehicles so that parents, grandparents and 
other relatives can begin to put money aside with some form of 
incentive from the government to save for education and 
training, not just for income security.
<P>
	I find it incredible that the Bloc Quebecois and others would 
somehow say it is wrong for the Government of Canada to 
encourage parents to invest in their children's future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has claimed 
repeatedly that he wants to consult widely with Canadians. I 
think he used the <I>c</I> word about a dozen times yesterday in 
question period.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister could tell the House why his department 
was actively promoting special interest group funding programs 
related to his discussion paper weeks ago, long before ordinary 
Canadians even knew what was in his discussion paper.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I announced last January 
that we were to undertake a process of reform I indicated we 
would be prepared to help groups that wanted to make 
presentations and consult their membership, particularly 
women's groups. We have provided funding at this point for 19 
different organizations in the name of equity. There are 
organizations and groups that have substantial resources. 
Business organizations, labour organizations and the Reform 
Party have all kinds of money they get from private donations 
which they can use to make their case.

to the same resources. In order to ensure there was full access 
and full participation we wanted these groups to be able to work 
with their membership and do the proper research so that we 
could have proper dialogue and debate in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting how the minister interprets equal access by funding 
special interest groups. I am pleased he has admitted that is 
happening because I was prepared to table a letter in the House 
showing that it was indeed the case.
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell the House again why he feels it 
is necessary to give special interest groups priority over 
individual Canadians. Where is the evidence that ordinary 
Canadians will have even the slightest influence on this social 
policy reform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize the hon. member is new 
to the House, but it would seem to me that one of the first 
responsibilities of a member of Parliament is to ensure that 
individual Canadians in his or her constituency have their voices 
and points reflected.
<P>
	The hon. member has a break next week. We have sent him all 
the information. I would encourage him to get back to his riding 
as fast as he can and start talking to his people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Initial reaction to the discussion paper on social programs was 
unanimous in denouncing both the approach and the content of 
government proposals. Some critics even come from Liberals. A 
colleague of the minister said out loud what many secretly think 
when he stated that ``the minister has taken a baseball bat to go 
after the poorest ones''.
<P>
	How can the minister hope to convince Canadians of the 
validity of his reform when he cannot even convince his own 
colleagues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to read part of an 
article written by Mr. Alain Dubuc in <I>La Presse</I>, a highly 
respected newspaper in Quebec.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-first, we must commend the Liberal government and minister Axworthy. 
They are the first ones to tackle head-on the interrelated problems of economic 
slump and social assistance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This article shows how independent observers, not partisan 
ones, support our government's efforts to develop a new 
approach towards poverty, unemployment and the problems of 
the poor in our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, would it not be 
simpler for the minister to admit that this discussion paper fully 
contradicts the principles which he supported when he was in 
opposition?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I came into elected politics over 
20 years ago with a couple of basic ambitions in mind: first, to 
make sure that people were treated fairly throughout the 
country; second, to make sure that people who had 
disadvantages were given opportunities; and, third, to make sure 
that we had a strong, effective country that could maintain its 
independence and integrity.
<P>
	Those values and purposes still exist. The green paper is 
reflective of how we can get those values and purposes to work 
better in today's world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	As the House knows, the social reform program is of crucial 
importance to the aboriginal peoples of Canada. We are the 
poorest of the poor. We see it as an opportunity to address the 
unacceptably high level of poverty among our young people. 
Our children face this prospect.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	What assurances can the minister give to the House that the 
aboriginal people will be heard in this important and pressing 
review?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.
<P>
	First I can indicate to the House that I have asked my 
colleague, the secretary of state for training, to undertake a 
special process of consultation and work with First Nations 
people. Because of their special problems and because of the 
very important initiatives by my colleague, the minister of 
Indian affairs, to move toward self-government, there is a need 
for a particular track of consultation and discussion.
<P>
	We have provided to this point close to $600,000 worth of 
support for a wide variety of aboriginal groups across the 
country to consult with their membership, to work with them 
and to begin to develop an ability to work in those very poor 
communities across the country to make sure there is a 
grassroots feeling of how they can participate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6716"> 6716 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that in the last day or two we have 
had major support from some of the national aboriginal 
organizations, like the National Metis Council, who say they 
too, like many other Canadians, want to co-operate and 
participate in finding a new and better way to help their people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Human Resources Development spoke 
repeatedly about the need to co-operate with and consult with 
the provinces. In fact I can recall one quote where he said: ``We 
have to really rely on wholesale co-operation by all levels of 
government''.
<P>
	He will know that since the paper has been tabled, there has 
been severe criticism of it by several provincial governments, 
including Ontario and Quebec. Yesterday his response to the 
premier of Ontario's concern was to take partisan and political 
cheap shots at the premier.
<P>
	Is this an example of how he intends to gather provincial 
co-operation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are faced with a curious and 
interesting piece of political acrobatics. We now have a member 
of the Reform Party defending Bob Rae. I am sure the folks at 
home in Calgary will be very pleased to know what the member 
has now committed to do.
<P>
	The fact to remember is that we are open to co-operation, but 
we ask the provincial premiers, as we have, to also reciprocate 
and show that they are prepared to participate in the national 
interest.
<P>
	The time has come to stop simply defending in an isolationist 
way their own interests province by province. It is time for 
Canadians to join together, as the premier of New Brunswick did 
this morning, and say this is something that is bigger than all of 
us. We must work together in a co-operative fashion. That is the 
kind of spirit and co-operation I would like to see from all the 
premiers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
House will note that the minister responded to concerns about 
partisan attacks on the premier of Ontario by taking more 
partisan attacks on the premier of Ontario and on the Reform 
Party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is to the same minister. Does 
the minister intend to adopt the domineering and centralizing 
attitude of past Liberal governments, or will he recognize that 
his proposals have an impact on areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand now why the hon. 
member from the Reform Party is supporting Bob Rae and the 
NDP. They are both at 10 per cent in the polls. They have 
something in common at this time.
<P>
	The hon. member once again professes that he wants to 
express himself in the spirit of co-operation. If he had read the 
green paper-I would suggest he now has a whole week to go 
home and look at it carefully-he would see that we have 
indicated very clearly various options under which we are 
proposing decentralization, not centralization.
<P>
	We talk about a new block funding arrangement on social 
assistance with the provinces. We talk about evolving many 
areas of training. We talk about how we can work to disentangle 
from education. Then the provinces would have clear authority 
over their educational institutions. These are the kinds of things 
that we want to propose.
<P>
	It is time for all governments to begin to think about how they 
can decentralize their bureaucracies, whether they are federal or 
provincial, and put more power in the hands of people and 
communities because that is where the real decisions should be 
made.

<P>
	At a recent international gathering of gynaecologists and 
obstetricians, Dr. Patricia Baird, formerly chairman of the 
Royal Commission of Inquiry on New Reproductive 
Technologies, once again emphasized the need for Canada to 
regulate this field.
<P>
	When does the Minister of Justice intend to table in the House 
a bill to regulate practices connected with new reproductive 
technologies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted with the question. I thought members had 
forgotten me. As far as new reproductive technologies are 
concerned, we are now working on a regulatory framework.
<P>
	I may add that we will have to work together with the 
provinces and other groups to deal with all the problems in this 
area. There are jurisdictional problems, and as members of the 
Bloc Quebecois are well aware, it is always important to talk to 
the provinces in order to avoid encroaching on their 
jurisdictions. So we are doing our job.

like getting up. I must point out to the Minister of Health that 
my question was directed to the Minister of Justice. I will put 
my second question to him, as I imagine he still remembers the 
first one and should be able to respond.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Justice agree that, as pointed out by Dr.

human embryos and thus preclude the possibility of research

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians are beginning to suspect that the government is using 
consultation as an excuse for inaction. It says it is consulting on 
the GST, on immigration, on agriculture, yet when it does not 
get the answers it wants from Canadians it ignores them.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Human Resources Development 
keep talking about wanting to hear from Canadians when it is 
clear he only listens to the people he wants to hear?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the Reform Party 
should begin to take the same line. Consistency has not been a 
virtue they have honoured very often, but I think it is about time.
<P>
	On the one hand we have a member this morning asking: 
``Why don't you have more consultations? Why don't you 
broaden it up, make it genuine, give people a chance.'' Now we 
have the hon. member for Calgary North saying not to have 
consultations at all. They cannot have it both ways, but they 
seem to want to have it both ways.
<P>
	I want to point out one important point. The primary 
consultation will be by a standing committee of the House of 
Commons which has representatives from all parties. If they 
bring an open mind to the issue and have a meeting of minds, 
then we can have a very genuine consultation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
saw yesterday, the minister seems determined to attack 
proposals Reform did not make instead of defending proposals 
he did not make. When we talk about consultation, we talk about 
honest consultation, giving Canadians the truth and information 
including real costs, not rigged consultations and rigged 
government funded special interest groups.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	How will this process be different? How will ordinary 
Canadians be heard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, we heard yesterday from the 
leader of the Reform Party about how they have been consulting 
for a year on social programs.
<P>
	The only result of that year long process was a statement by 
the hon. member for Calgary North that the Reform Party wants 
to cut $15 billion from social programs. He would not detail 
where, how or what. Reform members are now beginning to 
preach to us about putting the facts out. Where are their facts? 
Where is their study? Where is the result of their year long 
consultations?
<P>
	I have one simple piece of advice for the hon. member. Join 
the standing committee on human resources. Go back to your 
constituency and talk to the people. As parliamentarians we 
have provided the best place for Canadians to be heard, in this 
Parliament and through its committees.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power, employment has gone up 
significantly. We saw that 339,000 jobs were created, most of 
them full-time jobs. More than 97,000 jobs were created in the 
Atlantic provinces alone. Which policies helped to bring about 
this remarkable turnaround?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is an important question. 
Unlike the negativism we have been hearing, we can now 
explain to Canadians the positive news. Since this government 
was elected there have been 330,000 new jobs, 90 per cent of 
which are full time jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6718"> 6718 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the most important elements is that Canadians have 
confidence and trust in the government. Therefore they know 
we will have a good economic future and they are prepared to 
invest.
<P>
	Second, the infrastructure program has had a stimulating 
effect on the economy as have the employment programs we 
announced last year for young people; the youth services corps, 
the apprenticeship intern programs. The initiatives we have 
been taking recently like reducing UI premiums are now having 
a real impact.
<P>
	We are able to prove to Canadians that with a Liberal 
government we know where the jobs are and it is shown by the 
evidence we have today.

<P>
	Let me remind the hon. member that before the election the 
Prime Minister made it very clear that we would review the deal. 
However the maker of the deal decided to sign and went ahead 
despite the warnings. After we took office the Prime Minister 
reviewed the deal, found that it was not in the interests of 
Canadians and it was cancelled.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice, if the Hon. Minister of 
Health allows it. We were amazed to learn this week that the 
judges of the Supreme Court now admit extreme drunkenness as 
a legitimate defence for sexual assault. This attitude suggests 
that people can commit serious crimes with impunity if they 
have consumed enough alcohol or other drugs.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	My question is this: Does such a judgement mean that 
someone with a .30 blood alcohol level could be acquitted by a 
court while someone with a .09 level would be convicted? It 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice agree that it makes no sense?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, without agreeing to the 
interpretation put on that judgment by the hon. member I can tell 
him and the House that I am concerned about the implications of 
the judgment. I share some of the concerns that have been 
expressed during the week in the wake of its release.
<P>
	The whole general part of the Criminal Code has been under 
study for some decades actually. However in the coming weeks 
we are going to be releasing a discussion paper with respect to it. 
It includes the question of defences, including 
self-intoxication. We are going to make proposals for public 
discussion including the possibility that we can avoid this 
controversy by creating a criminal offence of criminal 
intoxication leading to misconduct.
<P>
	That approach which was discussed by the Law Reform 
Commission as long as eight years ago has its merits. It has 
disadvantages as well. We will hear during the discussion period 
how people feel about that approach and we will learn from it.
<P>
	In any event, I want to tell the hon. member that we are aware 
of the concerns arising from the judgment last week. We are 
examining alternative ways to ensure public safety.

	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to report on my visit to 
Eritrea, Ethiopia and Egypt in September. My participation 
there preceded the Cairo Population and Development 
Conference.
<P>
	Eritrea and Ethiopia are countries in which Canada directly, 
and indirectly through our non-government organizations, has a 
long and important involvement most recently through periods 
of drought and conflict. Egypt as you well know is a crucial 
country in the politics of the Middle East.
<P>
	Let me begin my comments with reflections on Eritrea and 
Ethiopia. These two countries were cut from Canada's bilateral 
assistance program by the previous government. By failing to 
emphasize that humanitarian assistance was exempt from the 
cut, Canada appeared to be abandoning Eritrea and Ethiopia just 
when peace was finally being realized after 30 years of civil war.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	My visit provided an opportunity to convey several important 
messages, the first being that Canada remains committed to 
maintaining bilateral relationships, if not assistance programs, 
with both countries. The second message was that while future 
bilateral assistance and partnership programs will await the 
outcome of the foreign policy review and be a function of our 
overall budgetary position, we will continue to contribute to the 
efforts of these countries to rebuild.
<P>
	By rebuild, we mean two things. The first is to help them 
make the shift from relief to recovery. The second is to help 
them begin building structures and institutions such as the 
constitution by which they will govern themselves more 
democratically and we hope more peacefully.
<P>
	Within the February budgetary allocations we have been able 
to provide $18 million in food security to Ethiopia and $7 
million to Eritrea this year. In addition we have provided 
$400,000 in assistance to Eritrean refugees returning from the 
Sudan. We have established a $500,000 fund for democratic 
development activities in each country.
<P>
	While there I applauded the efforts of the Ethiopians and 
Eritreans to promote regional peace and stability, certainly not 
an easy task. Both countries have been prominent in the Sudan 
peace talks which Canada is supporting. My meetings with the 
secretary general of the OAU, Salim Salim, the president of 
Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, and Eritrea's minister of foreign 
affairs, Petros Solomon, touched on this issue.
<P>
	I want to inform my colleagues that much more attention will 
be needed by western countries to support Africa's own efforts 
to bring peace to the horn of Africa. Within our budgetary and 
human resources limitations, Canada will continue to seek ways 
to facilitate this peace process as well as to help refugees in the 
region.
<P>
	Now for Egypt, a country with one foot in Africa and another 
in Asia. Over the past decade Egypt has taken on the role of 
bridge builder in middle eastern affairs. Its place on the 
frontlines has drawn it into many conflicts and the government 
is currently struggling to liberalize the economy while dealing 
with sporadic acts of terrorism. Rural Egypt where I also had the 
opportunity to travel is close to Africa in its poverty and in the 
severity of its ecological crisis.
<P>
	Canada is helping the Egyptians deal with their most precious 
resource, the River Nile. I journeyed to Qanater to see the 
strategic research unit on the second cataract of the Nile north of 
Cairo. This is only one project in which Canada is involved 
bilaterally but from conversations with senior Egyptian 
officials, one that is very much appreciated.
<P>
	In keeping with a longstanding commitment to help women in 
Egypt, Canada sponsors a range of projects. A creative effort is 
being undertaken in the Qena region in southern Egypt by the 
Foundation for International Training. It is trying to open the 
banking system of the country to women who are small scale 
entrepreneurs. In tiny workshops, in back rooms of houses and 
even in courtyards women have started small enterprises with 
backing from CIDA through the Foundation for International 
Training. The results to date not surprisingly for those of us 
familiar with the Grameen Bank, are a very high repayment 
record and a rapidly growing clientele.
<P>

<P>
	It was in these crowded homes and workshops that the hidden 
tragedy of rural Africa was revealed: the number of young girls 
who are not in school. UNICEF statistics tell us that 80 per cent 
of girl children in Egypt reach at least grade 5 in primary 
school. For Ethiopia the figure is only 10 per cent.
<P>
	On my last day in Egypt I announced on behalf of the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs that Canada is contributing $14.9 million to 
support primary education for girls in 15 African countries, to 
be channelled through UNICEF. I believe the education of 
young girls in Africa is the touchstone in a brighter future for the 
whole population. There is growing consensus that donor 
dollars spent on education of young girls has a positive impact 
not only on their lives, but on their families and on their 
communities. It was my privilege to be the bearer of this 
message of support to Africa.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
first of all like to thank the Secretary of State for Latin America 
and Africa for the report she just gave us on her recent trip to 
Eritrea, Ethiopia and Egypt and on Canada's aid initiatives in 
those countries.
<P>
	In the first place, let me point out the respect which the 
Secretary of State has for the work of the joint committee that is 
reviewing Canada's foreign policy. I would like to thank her for 
this. Her colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, shows little 
respect for the committee's work, which he himself initiated, 
need I remind you, and which is not yet finished; he is making 
choices and setting foreign policies that take for granted the 
results of a major review which is not yet complete. At least the 
Secretary of State has the decency to tell us that she intends to 
wait for the committee's findings before developing new 
bilateral aid and partnership programs.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	That being said, I think that Canada's efforts and initiatives, 
of which the Secretary of State has just informed us, should be 
well received. Canada must provide continuing tangible support 
for the colossal efforts that the Africans are making to establish 
peace and democracy in the Horn of Africa.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to talk about Eritrea. As you 
know, Eritrea became a sovereign state following the April 1993 
referendum, in which Eritreans answered a very clear question: 
``Do you want Eritrea to become a sovereign and independent 
state?'' The result was dazzling. Over 90 per cent of the vote was 
for sovereignty.
<P>
	Canada was one of the first countries to recognize the 
achievement of independence in Eritrea and we should be proud 
of this. Canada must make a clear commitment to recognize 
such democratic decisions when these are made in a context that 
meets criteria that appear to comply with the rules of 
democracy.
<P>
	This being said, we think that the government of Canada 
should feel a special duty to Eritrea, in that it represents a 
promise of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa region. In 
our view, this would warrant the allocation of special assistance 
to a long-term development and recovery program. Indeed, 
Canada should undertake to grant substantial assistance to this 
sustainable development and recovery program.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. Secretary of State as she told us about the 
strategic research unit in Qanater, north of Cairo, one of the 
projects in which Canada is involved. I sincerely feel this is a 
step in the right direction. In fact, sustainable development must 
be an objective that transcends Canadian foreign policy. I would 
even go as far as to say it should be the basic objective of 
Canadian official development assistance.
<P>
	We welcome the Canadian government commitment to help 
Ethiopia and Eritrea make the transition from humanitarian 
assistance to economic recovery. One of the main goals of our 
international assistance must indeed be to promote the 
development of self-reliance in assisted countries. We have to 
help these countries set up structures and institutions, including 
a constitution which will allow them to govern themselves more 
democratically and peacefully. The Secretary of State 
recognizes this essential condition.
<P>
	Finally, we must absolutely, through dialogue and 
co-operation programs, seek to reinforce respect for human 
rights, democratic development and good government. The 
promotion of sustainable human development and human rights 
must be at the centre of our policies. The Bloc Quebecois insists 
on that aspect. We feel that these factors are the key elements of 
any Canadian foreign policy.
<P>
	The commitment made by the Secretary of State towards 
Egyptian women and the announcement of a $14.9 million 
contribution to primary education for girls in 15 African 
countries, through UNICEF, is a step in that direction and we 
applaud that initiative.
<P>
	In conclusion, we believe that the government must 
nevertheless make other concrete commitments, including the 
promotion, through existing Canadian and UN programs, of the 
development of Erytrean NGOs and the use of local expertise in 
reconstruction and rehabilitation initiatives. These efforts must 
be pursued.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
welcome the secretary of state back from her overseas trip. We 
are glad she has arrived safely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6721"> 6721 </A></B>
<P>
	From our perspective the secretary of state speaks on several 
positive developments. On behalf of the government she has 
spoken supportive words for the most needy people of the 
world.
<P>
	We are glad the government has committed some more funds 
to Eritrea and Ethiopia, which have been areas of such heart 
rending famine and war in recent years. We need to help rebuild 
their shattered economies and make peace between 
neighbouring countries in that region. We applaud the 
government in its efforts.
<P>
	The secretary of state seems also to imply that the government 
may or will restore bilateral assistance to these countries. We 
are certainly not opposed to that as long as the governments in 
those countries do not siphon off our aid for military or other 
purposes.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Because of my association with the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, I do receive regular news bulletins about, for 
instance, the government of Ethiopia. There are encouraging 
signs of a trend toward democracy and stable, market oriented 
businesses in those newsletters.
<P>
	I do hope that these reports accurately reflect a growing 
reality.
<P>
	I wish to contrast her words with the current direction of the 
foreign affairs standing committee which at this moment is 
drafting its final report to the minister. Although I do not know 
what the final report will look like, and these matters are all a 
matter of negotiation, I am very concerned that the committee 
may fall to the lowest common denominator in order to try to 
please everybody and offer very few concrete recommendations 
in its report.
<P>
	I am concerned, for instance, that there may not be a 
legislative mandate for CIDA and that the committee will not 
recommend that our shrinking aid dollars go to the most needy 
people of the world. Examples of what she has brought to our 
attention today is the direction we need to head in the future.
<P>
	I am sure that someone in the minister's office, as well as the 
parliamentary secretary, is listening to this speech. I trust that 
whoever is listening will take note, especially in the office of the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs. I believe we need a very strong 
report, one that will reflect the secretary of state's words in 
support of the impoverished masses in places like Eritrea, 
Ethiopia and Egypt.
<P>
	Ministers, including this minister and the foreign affairs 
minister, need to speak to their Liberal counterparts on the 
foreign affairs committee and encourage them not to be 
tentative in their recommendations but to be firm in their 
support of the poorest people of the world.
<P>
	With regard to Egypt, there is no comment about the 
minister's participation in the population conference in Cairo. 
No doubt this is because of the contentious issues that were 
raised there. I just want to say a word about that conference. It is 
a well documented fact that the best determiners of population 
growth are the industrialization of a country and the health and 
education of its citizens.
<P>
	The best thing we can do therefore is to concentrate a good 
portion of our foreign aid on basic health and education in the 
third world. CIDA spends $120 million a year on Third World 
higher education degrees like masters degrees and doctorates. I 
believe we are developing, maybe wisely, but we are putting an 
increasing emphasis on the ruling classes in those countries 
where there are just a very few well educated people but the 
masses are ignorant and unhealthy.
<P>
	I note that CIDA also gave no less than $28 million this year to 
the International Planned Parenthood Federation. I trust that 
most of those dollars will go to the basic health and education in 
the Third World rather than to coercive population control 
measures and abortion which proved to be such divisive issues 
last month in Cairo.
<P>
	The way to avoid these negative practices is simple: educate 
the needy and upgrade basic health services for the general 
population.
<P>
	That is why we applaud the minister's travelling in rural 
Egypt, going to where the problems are the worst. We appreciate 
the programs she described to educate girls and we are very 
supportive of those as long as we do not also forget that boys 
also need basic education.
<P>
	We do not approve of every trip that this government takes, 
far from it, but in this case we think that this particular trip was 
very worth while in affirming Canada's support for the most 
needy people in the world. No doubt the minister's heart was 
touched with compassion by the poverty that she saw and no 
doubt her heart was also filled with satisfaction in seeing the 
difference that Canada can make even if it is in little ways.
<P>
	I can only hope that the minister will communicate the things 
that are in her heart to her Liberal colleagues on the foreign 
affairs standing committee and that she will use her influence to 
strengthen the committee's recommendations in these areas.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that the 
parliamentary secretary has asked that all questions be 
permitted to stand. I know that is the standard procedure. We 
also have an understanding in the House, in fact an order, that 
says that responses are to be made within 45 days.
<P>
	I am sorry to take some time but I wish to point out an 
experience I had recently. Just last week some questions were 
reported from me.
<P>
	As you are probably aware, Mr. Speaker, compound questions 
no longer seem to be permitted. If we have a question that has 
three or four elements, we have to use up the four spaces in our 
question quota all at once. Then we sit and fidget for 45 days, 
hoping that eventually the paper will clear and we can ask more 
questions. Last week I was faced with having to wait 135 days, 
which means that I am effectively muzzled for three times as 
long as I ought to be.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	To add insult to injury three of those questions elicited the 
response that the department, the ministry and the agencies did 
not have the data to provide answers. Why did I have to wait 135 
days for the department to know it had no answers?
<P>
	I urge the parliamentary secretary and the government to 
respond much more promptly, particularly where they have no 
answer, because they are effectively treading very close to the 
privileges of members' rights to information in this Chamber. 
By their slowness they have effectively kept me from looking 
for answers to further questions for almost 100 extra days 
beyond what should have been my right as a parliamentarian.
<P>
	I am not raising this as a question of privilege at this time, but 
I ask that the parliamentary secretary urge the departments to be 
much more prompt and forthcoming in their responses and if 
they do not have answers to let us know immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I sympathize with the hon. 
member in the predicament that he has outlined. I know the 
government makes every effort to respond promptly to 
questions.
<P>
	Sometimes questions are very lengthy in that they involve 
extensive consultation with numerous departments in the 
government. That often takes some time. In the case of the 
particular questions that the hon. member put on the Order 
Paper, I may say that the answers we received initially were sent 
back, because we were unhappy with the responses.
<P>
	I understand his unhappiness with the responses, but the 
agencies in question were not prepared to disclose, or were not 
able to disclose, or did not have the figures. We could not 
imagine that was possible. The questions were sent back to those 
agencies to make sure the answers were correct. That was part of 
the reason for the lengthy delay. Of course, the House was not 
sitting during the summer, which adds to it as well.
<P>
	I sympathize with him. I hope he will put more questions on 
the Order Paper. We will do our very best to answer them as we 
do for all hon. members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Briefly, Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member 
raised the problem of eliciting information from the agency 
involved, which was the Grain Transportation Agency under the 
WGTA, from whom a joint committee of agriculture and 
transport last May 6 found similar problems in getting 
information.
<P>
	They have urged the Minister of Transport to immediately 
appoint another person to take over from the WGTA the 
administration and control of the allocation of the grain car fleet 
in order to ensure that an adequate supply of rolling stock will be 
provided to producers for the efficient, reliable and effective 
movement of grain.
<P>
	Their response to my questions, which indicated they had no 
idea how many cars they had in the system or where they were, 
adds fuel to that. This was the finding of the joint committee as 
well. I think-

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member stated that she felt we should not be playing politics, 
that we should all deal with the social reform policies in a very 
responsible way. I agree with her on that.
<P>
	However I have to say that the starting point for social policy 
reform has to come from the provinces. If the Liberal 
government and the Minister of Human Resources Development 
do not have suggestions from the provinces, then in my opinion 
they do not have the solutions.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments need to rationalize 
the programs they have to make sure there is no overlap, and 
eliminate the duplication and overlap.
<P>
	Also, the hon. member mentioned meeting with one's 
constituents and getting back. It is my intention to meet with my

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in debate on the discussion paper tabled by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development entitled 
``Improving Social Security in Canada''.
<P>
	Over the course of this debate, a few basic themes keep 
returning over and over. One of the most important is that any 
government program reflects the realities of the time in which it 
was created. That is certainly true of the status quo of social 
programs.
<P>
	They were designed at a time when most people needed 
relatively few skills to get and keep work. What they picked up 
in school and on the job was usually enough to build a lifetime of 
earnings. People needed financial help between jobs. Others 
needed support if they could work at all, due to disability or 
family commitments.
<P>
	The old system was based on a stable world with stable skills 
and stable jobs for the vast majority of working people. Is there a 
person who believes that holds true now? Too many people have 
learned the hard way that the programs and services we have are 
designed more to keep people where they are than to help them 
to get where they could be.
<P>
	We have a system that gives people barely enough money to 
live but not enough opportunity to thrive, a system that at times 
rewards those who can manipulate the rules better than those 
who simply want to make something of themselves.
<P>
	People see that. People know there is an activity that fits the 
letter of the law while offending the spirit. For example, I have a 
letter from a man in Ontario who points out how larger 
employers use the UI system to encourage workers to take early 
retirement. It may not be literally against the rules but it is 
hardly consistent with UI as a source of income for people who 
are genuinely between jobs.
<P>
	Another person wrote about watching an economy develop in 
a small B.C. town around the unemployment insurance. He sees 
young people learning from their parents that it is all right to 
leave school relatively unskilled, work for only enough weeks to 
qualify for benefits and then collect UI benefits for the rest of 
the year.
<P>
	Is there a member who has not heard these concerns? What do 
we say to people who raise these issues? It happens too often to 
say simply: ``It is just an isolated case''. It shows us that the 
status quo no longer works well enough and is in real danger of 
losing the support of Canadians. It goes a long way to show why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6726"> 6726 </A></B>
<P>
78 per cent of  Canadians believe our social programs are 
essential but 85 per cent believe they must be reformed.
<P>
	The polls say it. Our mail says it. Canadians are not satisfied 
with the status quo. They know that a more effective and a more 
cost effective social safety net is not just possible, it is 
necessary.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The value of the discussion paper on social security reform is 
that it lays out facts, ideas and real choices. It is helping 
Canadians to translate their feelings and experiences into useful 
advice to their government about social programs.
<P>
	Canadians want to work. They want their fellow citizens to 
work. But between those goals and the reality of creating jobs 
and getting people into them lie a series of challenges. Some 
lack basic information on the labour market. Others are 
illiterate. Some have jobs but get little training to improve their 
skills. Other people face the issue of the lack of high quality, 
affordable child care. People with disabilities can list the 
barriers they face each and every day. The challenge is to set 
priorities based on needs and the probability of results given the 
real fiscal constraints that exist.
<P>
	One of the central ideas in the section of the discussion paper 
on working is the value of community involvement. In setting 
priorities the federal government fully recognizes there can 
never be enough money to meet every possible need. That is why 
the discussion paper suggests that some mechanism which 
allowed communities to set priorities and to act on them would 
be appropriate.
<P>
	What might our unemployment programs look like in the 
wake of real reform to social security? To begin with we might 
see communities with a centre of social program delivery. Some 
mechanism that allowed people to come together to determine 
local labour market needs and priorities would be a start. Using 
the best and most up to date information on what works in 
training, they might invest in a mix of employer based training 
and wage subsidies for the long term unemployed and for young 
people, and other forms of training from many different sources.
<P>
	A partnership between governments in that community might 
lead to the creation of one location for all unemployment and 
income support services. Picture a person looking for income 
support who could be referred for counselling and assistance in 
developing good job search skills. Picture the sole support 
mother getting help with child care, housing and literacy 
training in the same place.
<P>
	The agreement between the federal government and the 
province of Ontario to set up local labour force development 
boards offers a sign of things to come. These governments have 
agreed to work together with communities across the province.
<P>
	Local boards with people from unions, businesses, education 
and many other segments of society will have the ability to 
determine and set priorities for government labour market 
spending. They will decide what training is needed and what 
employment development should be emphasized. This will be a 
case of people who know the regions and who care about 
building a better future having control of the tools to help realize 
those visions.
<P>
	This kind of co-operation could lead to governments and 
communities working together to break the vicious cycle of UI 
dependence. Efforts to give people real skills, create real jobs 
and enable a real economy to flourish could all come together.
<P>
	The paper looks at the issue of how unemployment insurance 
could better help people find and keep jobs. We are asking 
Canadians if we need two approaches within our insurance 
system, one that would provide a straightforward insurance 
coverage and another aimed at people who face regular 
unemployment and may need more assistance. We are asking 
them if tightening the current program is a better option or 
whether we should take both approaches at the same time. We 
want to know how they would deal with the needs of part time 
workers, self-employed contract workers and other people who 
get no help now.
<P>
	These are real choices. Canadians deserve the right to 
determine their own priorities. We believe and they agree that 
giving people the skills and incentives to work is appropriate. 
We want to go a step further to explore what makes sense with 
the money we have.
<P>
	How to balance the social and economic priorities of 
Canadians is not a simple task. We recognize that to meet our 
social program goals and to meet our fiscal obligations to 
Canadians will require some hard choices. Our citizens are 
capable of those choices however.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious that no one wants us to create some new scheme 
and impose it on Canadians. They want us to listen to them, not 
just to special interests, not just to the experts, but to the people 
who may need these programs and who will pay for them. This 
government is committed to doing just that.
<P>
	With the release of this discussion paper we are saying we can 
get people back to work. We can build a society with skills that 
attract investment. We can help individuals meet the challenges 
of life in a society and an economy that face constant change. We 
can take steps to ensure that more people are better off in the 
long term, thanks to our actions in this House. The status quo 
will not be satisfactory. The time has come to act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's speech. I 
am glad someone on the Liberal side recognizes there is a danger 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6727"> 6727 </A></B>
<P>
of losing broad public support and confidence in our social 
safety net and the ability of government to deliver services on 
behalf of all of us. I am saying that confidence has already 
evaporated.
<P>
	I am also encouraged to hear the member admitting that 
change is inevitable, that the current situation cannot be 
sustained. It would not matter what political party was in power, 
we would have to move toward the reform of our basic social 
safety nets.
<P>
	I am also encouraged to hear that the member is looking at the 
priority of needs, focusing on social spending. In fact, a lot of 
what I heard from the hon. member today sounds like it could 
have come from a Reform member of Parliament. I detect 
somewhat of a divergence however in the encouragement and 
hopefulness he has and what his minister is saying. I hope he 
will do what he can from his side of the House to encourage his 
minister to truly live up to the optimism the hon. member has.
<P>
	I am not so encouraged by this hon. member's optimism that 
the government's plan is actually going to be delivered by the 
minister. Certainly there are hard choices to be made. He is 
suggesting there will be ongoing consultation to let the people 
speak. He certainly gives lip service or acknowledgement to a 
philosophy I agree with. However, I hope there is real substance. 
You might ask: ``Where's the beef?'' Well where is the real 
substance in what the minister delivered? I hope his optimism is 
not lacking in the long run.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, throughout this debate there is going 
to be a lot of smoke and mirrors based on the partisanship in the 
House. Unfortunately, Canadians from time to time are going to 
wonder if what members are saying is clear to all concerned.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development tabled a 
discussion paper. Yet time after time when I hear opposition 
members address the discussion paper, they criticize it as if it 
were a piece of legislation. As the member has just said, they 
ask: ``Where's the beef?'' Well, if it were a piece of legislation it 
would have each and every single step and program the 
government was proposing to address the problems, but this is 
not a piece of legislation. This is a discussion paper for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government has said very clearly that we can no longer 
simply tinker with social programs. It is necessary for us to 
make some major changes in the way and the kinds of programs 
we deliver to Canadians. That is why we have this discussion 
paper. That is why Canadians are being given the opportunity 
through their members of Parliament to express their views to 
make absolutely sure that all hon. members understand the 
needs, the desires and what we can afford to deliver to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to highlight for members of 
the House a number of initiatives in Atlantic Canada that 
reinforce the need for social reform and place a stronger 
emphasis on the federal-provincial co-operation and 
consultation.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	At the forefront of the social reform process is a discussion 
paper tabled by the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Throughout the discussion paper and at the core of social 
security reform is a vigorous emphasis on the need for continued 
and effective consultation. That means talking with Canadians, 
hearing their views and responding to their needs. However, 
consultation with Canadians is not enough.
<P>
	Every section of the discussion paper produced by the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, be it 
on learning, working or security, stresses that successful social 
reform is contingent upon a strong co-operative working 
relationship with the provincial and territorial governments. 
The key to developing that relationship and intrinsic to the 
social reform process is the strategic initiative program 
approved by the cabinet last May.
<P>
	This program provides a unique mechanism for both levels of 
government to take actions in the high priority areas of 
employment, learning, education, income security and social 
services. Approved projects are funded on a 50:50 basis with the 
province or territory. Not only will this initiative promote an 
open dialogue with the provinces and territories, co-operation 
of this nature will also help us to eliminate waste, inefficient 
allocation of moneys and duplication in the existing systems.
<P>
	There are many reasons why a strategic initiatives program is 
a critical component of the social security reform and there are 
many reasons why it is working. First and foremost, it gets 
Canadians back to work. It helps Canadians to help themselves.
<P>
	We have made tremendous progress already, particularly in 
the Atlantic provinces. The initiatives that have been launched 
in co-operation with Atlantic Canada governments will touch 
the lives of over 10,000 Canadians currently at risk of becoming 
dependent on social assistance.
<P>
	In New Brunswick over 1,000 Canadians will take their place 
in the ranks of the New Brunswick job corps. This program will 
give volunteers between the ages of 50 and 65 the opportunity to 
put their talents and expertise to work in their communities.
<P>
	In Prince Edward Island the ready to learn and adult peer 
literacy tutoring project will make it easier for young adults who 
have found it difficult to gain access to traditional education 
facilities. The project will provide literacy training, life skills, 
academic upgrading and skills training to unemployment 
insurance and social assistance recipients. It is hoped that the 
ready to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6728"> 6728 </A></B>
<P>
learn project will  remove the barriers to education that many 
Islanders have historically encountered.
<P>
	In Newfoundland more than 5,000 Canadians will benefit 
from the transitions initiative. This three pronged program 
targets the young people, candidates for post-secondary 
education, recent university and college graduates, and working 
age adults.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia 3,000 Canadians will benefit from four new 
programs designed to provide training and employment 
opportunities to working age adults currently out of work. The 
compass initiative targets those who need it the most, those at 
risk of long term dependency on social assistance: unemployed 
youth, single parents, and laid off fishers.
<P>
	Each of these initiatives will not only help get Canadians back 
to work, they will return a sense of dignity and pride. 
Unfortunately, these things are often forgotten when one 
becomes lost in the maze of the current system. But these efforts 
are just the beginning.
<P>
	Just this week the minister announced a new initiative in 
Charlottetown. Choices and opportunities will reinforce and 
strengthen social assistance for mentally challenged 
individuals. In St. John's, Newfoundland we have launched a 
pilot project centred around an earnings supplement initiative.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The spirit of co-operation that now exists between the federal 
and provincial governments indicates the importance of the 
federal-provincial collaboration and is indeed welcome. It is 
exciting to know that our provincial colleagues, Premiers 
McKenna and Wells, have announced their support and 
enthusiasm for the discussion paper, for this government's 
approach to social security reform in Canada, and for the 
initiatives that have already had an effect on their constituents.
<P>
	To date, the Atlantic provinces have been most involved in the 
consultation process and in the implementation of the strategic 
initiatives program. But this is only the beginning; there is much 
more to be done.
<P>
	Many workers in the Atlantic region are seasonal workers. 
The contributions of seasonal workers and seasonal industries 
are significant to our economic future. Tourism, fisheries, 
agriculture, forestry and construction are all extremely 
important industries and will remain so well into the future.
<P>
	For this reason I feel the government must make a 
commitment to ensure these people receive help in adjusting to 
the changes that are adopted, whatever they might be.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
indicated, this is a consultative process. I consider it very 
important to my constituents. That is why I have arranged for 
public forums next week and in November, in my constituency 
of Carleton-Charlotte, to provide the opportunity for direct 
input by my constituents.
<P>
	We cannot rebuild our social security system overnight. 
Successful and effective reform tailored to the needs of this and 
coming generations require a strong foundation. We must build 
our future system one day at a time. Together with all provinces 
and territories we must work with Canadians to create an 
improved social security system. We will mould it to meet the 
requirements of Canadians. We look forward to a stronger and 
more cohesive working relationship with our provincial and 
territorial counterparts.
<P>
	Together we can forge a social security system that will lead 
Canada into the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague used the word consultation many 
times in his speech. Consultations must be based on real 
information. If the public is to decide or to give broad support to 
the hard choices to be made, it must be told the truth about the 
numbers and the real tradeoffs. The discussion paper is a 
reflection of the concerns the Liberals can no longer deny or 
avoid.
<P>
	Will the member return to his riding and outline in cold, hard 
terms the choices to be made with the dollar value and the direct 
community result, not just for the few items in the green paper 
but for the whole social safety net package?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Culbert:</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member indicated, it is 
my plan to go through the consultative stage with my 
constituents and offer them every opportunity to bring forward 
their ideas and their suggestions.
<P>
	One of the early things I did, in conjunction with this paper 
the minister brought forward, was to have the minister confirm 
to me the exact opportunity he has put forward for the 
consultation. I wanted to be assured that it was true and factual 
that the consultation was going to be listened to and we would 
have an opportunity to make change.
<P>
	The minister has assured me of that. I am very confident my 
constituents will have suggestions and ideas that can be brought 
back to the standing committee, the minister and the 
department. This is helpful in the process of coming up with a 
plan and a program that will be beneficial to all Canadians for 
the 21st century.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wish to 
tell the House that, pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), the 
following period of debate allotted to our party will be divided 
in two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak about the reform of the Canadian social 
security system. Earlier I heard the hon. member say: ``We have 
difficult choices to make''. It seems to me that the choices are 
not so difficult.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6729"> 6729 </A></B>
<P>
	I also often heard the other side ask us to propose something. I 
have a proposal for you. I realize how difficult it is for the other 
side to make choices. When a bill aimed at changing the rules of 
political party financing was introduced 15 days ago, some 
members on the other side voted with us but most voted against 
us because their very wealthy friends put money in their coffers. 
It is easy to understand how subsequent choices can be 
extremely difficult to make.
<P>
	True, there are two choices. But why did we have to choose? 
In Mr. Trudeau's time, the government got this country into debt 
by going on a spending spree that continued under the 
Conservatives. It was not the fault of the opposition parties, not 
the Reform Party's, not ours and not the NDP's. They were not in 
power. Who got Canada into debt during the past 30 years? The 
two parties that were in power. We have a debt of $530 billion, 
with $40 billion worth of interest payments, and as a result there 
are some choices we must make.
<P>
	Which option do we choose? Are we going to take money 
from the haves or are we going to empty the pockets of the 
have-nots? We say get it where it is to be found. Let us do it, let 
us raise billions of dollars from family trusts, people who do not 
pay income tax and the multinationals in this country. That is 
where we should get those billions of dollars. Not the pennies in 
the pockets of the poor.
<P>
	That is what I would do. And now, a look at the other side. 
Last week, the Canadian Council on Social Development again 
sounded the alarm when it noted the distressing fact that more 
than one million children do not get enough to eat. One million 
children! In the schools where I taught, many children went 
without lunch. Fortunately, there were some Good Samaritans 
who paid for their meals. Why did these children go without 
food?
<P>
	Their parents were in debt. They had three or four children, 
and they bought a car, chain saw and boat on credit, and when 
school started, they also had to buy books and exercise books. 
They had to pay the student association membership. There was 
no money left for food. I am convinced that the purpose of social 
security reform in this country should be to fight poverty, not the 
poor. So far, the trend has been to take money away from the 
poorest in our society, and that is how I see this reform.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The objective should be,in this supposedly great and beautiful 
country, to create more social justice, not to come down harder 
on the neediest, the disenfranchised and the weakest members of 
our society. The objective should be to ensure a better 
distribution of wealth, which is not the case today. The rich are 
getting richer, while the poor have for years and years been 
getting poorer.
<P>
	I am not convinced that this is what the minister responsible 
had in mind, and I am not convinced that what he had in mind is 
right for this government. The unstated objective of this reform, 
as I see it, is solely and entirely to reduce government spending 
by penalizing more and more the disadvantaged, those who 
cannot speak for themselves.
<P>
	Conservative policies of this sort have the effect of causing a 
dramatic rise in unemployment and poverty levels in this 
country. Conservative policies are directly responsible for the 
systematic impoverishment of the middle class and 
lower-income taxpayers.
<P>
	This government acts like a producer who would stop feeding 
his cattle. Do you think that is the way to increase production? 
Do you think he would achieve better results by cutting rations? 
Do you think he would get a better yield if he stopped cultivating 
his land? To get results, investments must be made in the right 
places and cuts must also be made in the right places.
<P>
	Cutting in postsecondary education will make it impossible 
for a large number of people to get adequate training. Because, 
as I have pointed out repeatedly, there are still no general and 
vocational colleges in my region-there is one in Matane- and 
no universities-you have to go to Rimouski, Quebec, Laval, 
Montreal- cuts in postsecondary education will mean that 
hundreds of students will not be able to further their education.
<P>
	If the costs double or triple, we will no longer be able to afford 
sending our young people to university. The university in 
Rimouski is great, except that it does not offer all programs. 
That is why we have to go to Laval or some other university. 
Cutting in postsecondary education certainly is not a good way 
to help the labour force adjust to the present conditions of the 
future labour market.
<P>
	Literally crushing seasonal workers and the poorest of the 
poor by creating two categories of UI recipients certainly is not 
the best way to restore hope in our society. In our region, 
forestry workers have work for only four or five months each 
year; those who get to work five months are considered 
extremely lucky. During this period, because it is a very short 
period, they start work very early in the morning and finish very 
late at night. Many totally wreck their health in the process. If 
they undergo any more conditioning, this will increase their 
stress load.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	A few years ago, a family man had to keep chopping down 
trees even if he was very sick because he had to collect enough 
stamps, not because he did not want to work. Quebecers, 
especially the people in my riding, want to work. The 
unemployment rate in my riding is among the highest. The 
people want to work. They want the jobs that were promised by 
the Prime Minister during the election campaign. That is all we 
heard during the election campaign: jobs, jobs and more jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6730"> 6730 </A></B>
<P>
	The lack of jobs makes these people feel insecure and 
helpless. They appear to be almost ashamed, even when they 
are working.
<P>
	This government has waited much too long, even if it has been 
a year-just as previous governments waited too long-to find 
decent jobs for the people in the regions, especially rural 
regions. If this government wants respect, it should start by 
respecting the poor. Only then will it command our respect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker I thank 
the member for his dissertation. I found it extremely interesting. 
He is right in a lot of respects. Poor people have to be fed. When 
they are young it is very important that they are fed and oriented 
properly in order for us to prosper as a society.
<P>
	A very perplexing thing has happened to me since I came to 
the House. I understand that over the years we perpetuate things. 
Members of the opposition, and perhaps members on all sides of 
the House, get into political discussions and dissertations about 
how the pie should be cut. They want to keep the existing 
structures and situations because it is politically expedient to do 
so.
<P>
	At the turn of the century we changed from steam power to 
electricity. Right now we are at the advent of the information 
era. We know what has happened to Bill Gates. It is a good 
example of what happens by using resources and 
entrepreneurship and getting into new technology. If some of us 
had embraced that approach it would have helped us out of the 
economic recession which started in the sixties and is being 
perpetuated now.
<P>
	The objective of the whole exercise of social reform is: What 
do we do from here? How can we get people more prepared? 
How can we use resources better? How can we make sure that 
debt does not climb?
<P>
	I ask the member opposite to give us some ideas, 
notwithstanding the concerns. We all know about those 
concerns. The whole object of the exercise is to make the 
process better. How can we make it better, not complain about 
how many pieces of pie we can keep or whether we belong to one 
region or another?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has asked a very 
good question and I am very proud of him. Of course, there are 
ways to make it better. I will give you at least one example. The 
money we could spend on forestry, say, is not a subsidy but an 
investment. Mr. De Bané himself said when he was a minister a 
few years ago-he is now a senator, unfortunately-that it is an 
investment. Replanting forests no longer replenished by nature 
is an investment. There are so many other examples I could give 
you. We could hire twice as many forestry workers since lumber 
is now in great demand. They are reluctant to do that.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In my region, they have the Eastern Plan, which my colleague 
from Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is very familiar 
with. We fervently hope that it will be renewed as it can put 
people to work. Let me give you just one example in forestry.
<P>
	Most farm owners tell me that they only have two people 
working on their farms when there is often enough work for five 
people. These small farmers cannot afford to pay decent wages 
to their employees. Something could be done. We could create 
hundreds of jobs that would be extremely valuable to the whole 
community and would in turn benefit both the federal and the 
provincial governments.
<P>
	I could of course give you other examples but I will limit 
myself to these two just to show you that it is possible to create 
jobs.
<P>
	The federal government is very wary whenever we offer 
solutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for giving me the floor. It is always a 
pleasure to speak when you occupy the Speaker's Chair.
<P>
	I want to say right away that I am pleased to speak in a debate 
like this because I represent a riding in east-end Montreal which 
of course went through some very bad times in the last two 
recessions, in the 1980s and the 1990s.
<P>
	On listening to my colleagues, I said to myself that I am not a 
supporter of the status quo. I want to say that at the outset of this 
debate so that I can perhaps discuss it later in answer to a 
question that our colleague might raise.
<P>
	I think that the minister did something laudable in proposing 
social programs, but there is a paradox. The minister proposes-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I am grateful for the kind of co-operation from 
my friend, the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	However, there is a paradox because social programs are 
basically tools that now belong to the provinces. That is how it 
should be, with one exception: unemployment insurance is the 
only program where the federal government has any legitimacy 
at all to act. Let us remember the context. When the federal 
government announced the unemployment insurance plan, it 
was the first amendment to the 1867 constitution and it came in 
the wake of the Rowell-Sirois report. We know what things were 
like at that time: it was a time of trouble and war, which gave rise 
to heated discussions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6731"> 6731 </A></B>
<P>
	What a paradox! Imagine the 33 Fathers of Confederation-I 
apologize for the fact that there were no women-including 
Cartier, Langevin, Galt, Baldwin and others, coming back here 
to see the central government of a federation want to interfere 
in social programs, when neither those 33 Fathers nor their 
successors gave that government any authority to do that. That, 
in my opinion, is the problem with the Canadian federation.
<P>
	The problem is that when you are in Ottawa, you think that 
there is a single labour market. However, this is not possible, it 
is not true and it would not be good in a continental country like 
Canada. The fact is that there are fewer and fewer continental 
countries with a federal regime like Canada. And that does not 
make me sorry.
<P>
	The problem for any federal government, regardless of its 
good intentions-and I am prepared to admit that the minister 
does have good intentions-is that there are several labour 
markets. Canada is a continental country in which the job 
market in Rimouski and the Gaspe peninsula obviously does not 
reflect the same reality as in Calgary, for example. This is why 
social programs administered by Ottawa, because of their 
structure, are of course very inadequate.
<P>
	Many economists-and I hope we have an opportunity to 
discuss this issue during the referendum debate-see a rather 
direct link between the growth of the Canadian debt since 1970 
which, as the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane mentioned 
earlier, is around $540 billion, and the government's will to 
interfere in the social program sector through various schemes. 
What we are saying, and I think this is a reasonable suggestion 
which deserves to be looked at, is that the federal government 
has money.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The first part of the document, which includes an inventory of 
the federal initiatives as well as an overview of labour market 
patterns, is well done. However, things deteriorate in the second 
part. In the first part, we are told that federal contributions 
amount to $38 billion. How do you explain the fact that a 
government which has nothing to do with social programs would 
invest an almost unprecedented $38 billion?
<P>
	I was looking at the study released by the OECD during the 
last summit attended by the Minister of Industry. With its 
$38-billion contribution, the Canadian government is among 
the top investors; yet, because this money is badly invested, 
because it is not allocated where users could be the primary 
beneficiaries, the official unemployment rate in our country is 
still at 10 or 12 per cent.
<P>
	These are complex issues and we must be careful not to view 
them in an overly simplistic way. However, I am convinced that 
all of us, wherever we are, must work towards the 
implementation of a full employment policy. It is quite a 
paradox to see that the expression full employment is not used 
even once in this document.
<P>
	The minister's objective is to look after the jobless. This is a 
noble goal but it is not enough. We would have expected this 
debate to start with a policy on job creation, because the idea is 
not to manage the unemployed but indeed to integrate those 
trying to enter the labour market.
<P>
	When you look, as the hon. member for Mercier and other 
members of this House have, at the conditions under which a 
country, regardless of its political structures, can achieve full 
employment, you note a rather obvious correlation between the 
size of the communities or countries-the smaller the 
better-and the level of success achieved in that respect. This is 
understandable. To achieve full employment, you must first get 
the national partners to sit at an employment table so that, 
together, with their legitimacy, they can set economic 
objectives.
<P>
	We will never be able to have a national table to discuss full 
employment in Canada because the Atlantic fishermen, the 
people of British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec all have 
employment structures that differ radically one from the other. 
This is the first impediment, one that I consider to constitute a 
systemic barrier, therefore confirming to the federal 
government the fact that the greatest favour he can do the public 
as a public administration is to decentralize funding towards the 
authorities who are in the best position to achieve full 
employment, that is to say, in the first place, the provinces. 
Municipalities could even be made choice partners in this 
process. Why not? This government however yearns for 
visibility and it will soon, as soon as possible, have to face the 
Quebec electorate who will make a constitutional decision. I can 
understand the difficulty for a government like this one to 
readily accept to withdraw from this kind of visibility. However, 
that is the price to be paid if you want to put people back to work, 
in my humble opinion.
<P>
	In addition to the debt and other barriers to full employment, 
there is something else that is very disturbing. It is the fact that 
from 1990 onward, and especially the jobs are created in the 
year 2000-we both expect to live that long, Mr. Speaker-that 
those jobs will require 16 years of schooling. Sixteen years 
means a CEGEP technical diploma, that is what it means. 
However, and the minister said so in his paper, more than 
100,000 students drop out of our educational institutions every 
year.
<P>
	The obvious challenge for those who want to put people to 
work is to make the connection between training, education and 
the jobs available. In Quebec, we say that education is a priority 
and vital to our identity, and that is of course the choice we 
made.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6732"> 6732 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	This is different from the 19th century, when the job market 
was linked to immigration and to means of transportation, which 
is understandable from a historical perspective as they had to 
build a very sparsely populated country where immigrants' 
contribution had a major impact on labour policies. No wonder 
we talk about employment and immigration centres. That is no 
longer the case. The three components of labour force access are 
education, which is a provincial jurisdiction, as well as-I think 
the minister was right to mention it in his paper, although it is 
outside his mandate-all family support services.
<P>
	Things have changed since the typical family included a 
breadwinner working outside the home, a homemaker and 
children from a first marriage. This is no longer the Canadian 
reality.
<P>
	In conclusion, that is why we believe that the minister must 
tackle social program reform. But he must be generous, sensible 
and compassionate enough to recognize that the best thing he 
can do is to decentralize this money and allow the provinces, 
especially Quebec which has considerable experience dealing 
with the issue of full employment-A national forum on 
employment was held in 1985, and I must say that one of the first 
things the Parizeau government did was to make plans for 
creating a ministry of state mandated to consult on employment. 
The best thing this government can do to put Canadians and 
Quebecers to work is to decentralize this money and recognize 
that it is not the government best able to put Canadians to work.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I recently listened to the two members of the Bloc. One 
thing we can all agree on is that the buzzword is choices. That is 
the operative word.
<P>
	By talking about choices it assumes that we cannot have it all. 
The country is broke and we are still spending like a drunken 
sailor. The steering wheel of the ship of state is not being tended.
<P>
	We are talking about cutbacks today because we cannot afford 
the current situation. I think the members have highlighted the 
kind of thinking that has got us into the present mess. Fight 
poverty and need with deficit financed assistance rather than 
appropriately building an economy of opportunity that will then 
be capable of adequately providing for those who are 
disadvantaged.
<P>
	The present result is one of failure and his reasoning, 
continuing on the present course of continuing to deficit 
finance, will continue to bring us to where we are today where 
we cannot adequately meet requirements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. 
member for taking part in the debate. I think that what 
distinguishes us-and I say this up front-is that as a political 
party we are convinced that the best way to help  the 
disadvantaged is not just to let market forces prevail. We admit 
that our society never had as many poor people as it does today. 
That is true for Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto and many regions 
of the country.
<P>
	The difference is that we think what makes the government 
ineffective in fighting poverty is the political structure. Take the 
very concrete example of a man without work who comes to our 
riding office. Right away we see that various options are 
available if he is on welfare; they are not the same if he is on 
unemployment. Why? Because two levels of government 
administer these programs.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the need is the same; he needs training so that 
he can re-enter the work force. I am convinced that things would 
be much simpler if we had the government that is closer to the 
people, namely the provincial government, the Government of 
Quebec to take the example that I know; I think that the results 
would be much more satisfactory if funds could be concentrated 
in the hands of one single manager and if all the available 
options and programs were offered in one and the same 
structure.
<P>
	Sometimes people try to make a distinction between the 
constitutional structure and the labour market, but that is wrong. 
We must admit that the two are closely connected. If I were 
convinced that the central government is the best one to put 
people to work, I would not be a sovereignist.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I am not a sovereignist because I love the sound of that word. I 
am a sovereignist because I think that we should have only one 
government. When someone-who knows, it might be the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine-proves me 
wrong, I will be pleased to review my position, but for now I am 
not convinced.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has demonstrated that 
the Canadian fiscal position has constitutional connections. In 
view of this fact, is the slow, stop-and-go approach the 
government is planning to take in this reform not paradoxical? 
One gets the impression that it is trying to put things off until 
after a certain event has taken place in Quebec. I would like my 
hon. colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to comment on 
this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. Admittedly, the 
work plan presented to us a few weeks ago was supposed, as the 
minister stated repeatedly, to lead to the establishment of a 
much more precise schedule than the one before us at this time.
<P>
	Like my hon. colleague, I note and share the opinion that, 
having nothing to offer in terms of job creation and knowing the 
disastrous results the referendum will have from its point of 
view, this government has decided to buy time and defer the 
objectives it had set for itself.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to develop a little on the topic that was raised by my 
colleague from New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	Here we are 12 months downstream from the election with our 
total debt around about $45 billion higher than it was a year ago 
and with our entire social safety net in danger of collapse. In the 
time that it takes me to give this short speech our debt will have 
gone up by about $1 million. By the time this government 
actually gets around to doing anything we probably will have 
added another $10 billion to the debt. We will be that much 
closer to a total economic collapse.
<P>
	Governments always seem to take too long to take care of 
fiscal problems. This House knows that I am originally from 
New Zealand and that I am very familiar with the fiscal crisis 
that hit New Zealand in 1984. Dependence on social programs in 
New Zealand was in the end reduced not by consultation and not 
by long delays and green books. Instead it ended up being 
slashed to the bone because the country went bankrupt.
<P>
	A New Zealand style debt crisis is not the most pleasant way 
to reform social services.
<P>
	I think perhaps it is worth reviewing some of the things that 
happened in New Zealand. This may help some of our 
government members understand the seriousness of our debt 
and deficit situation and the threat that the debt holds for the 
very survival of our social programs.
<P>
	Getting control of government spending is a tough job and we 
know that. New Zealand's debt doubled from $22 billion in 1984 
to $46 billion in 1994 by the time the first surplus occurred. 
These numbers are small compared to the numbers for Canada, 
but the fact is that the total debt doubled before expenditures 
came under control in the New Zealand situation.
<P>
	When New Zealand hit the wall, the annual deficit could not 
be reduced to zero overnight. Emergency IMF funding 
permitted continued deficits while the economy restructured. It 
was these deficits over the 10 year period that caused the debt to 
double.
<P>
	Think about what would happen to Canada in a similar crisis. 
We all know that the only way to balance the budget overnight 
would be to virtually eliminate every existing social 
program-welfare, UI, pensions, you name it-in order to save 
the necessary $40 billion.
<P>
	In practice this could not be done because of the social 
consequences. The IMF would allow Canada to continue to 
incur decreasing deficits as social programs were abandoned 
and the population adapted to the changes. Just as in the case of 
New Zealand, this could easily result in the doubling of 
Canada's debt by the year 2004.
<P>
	In other words, if we hit the wall tomorrow it is quite likely 
that our debt would balloon to a trillion dollars or more before 
we began showing surpluses.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	By then, even if we have stable interest rates, the interest 
payments on the debt will be over $100 billion a year. Growth in 
the economy would help reduce the relative size of that interest 
payment but it is virtually equal to 100 per cent of today's tax 
receipts.
<P>
	This is a very serious situation and just like New Zealand, it 
will not be solved with green books and discussion papers. 
Every single month that we delay the decision to make 
significant cuts, we add another $3.5 billion to our debt load and 
we simply cannot go on this way.
<P>
	New Zealand was forced to take drastic action but a phoenix 
has risen from the ashes. New Zealand had a $600 million 
surplus this year and is forecasting $2 billion for next year. The 
government has promised tax reductions beginning in 1996 but a 
key to this is that New Zealanders must refrain from demanding 
any expansion of government programs or services.
<P>
	This is very important. Canadians too must learn to refrain 
from demanding any expansion of government services and 
programs. In fact they must demand less. In 1984 immediately 
after the debt crisis the New Zealand dollar dropped about 20 per 
cent to be worth 62 cents Canadian. It held there until about 
1992 by which time the reorganization of the economy had taken 
place.
<P>
	Since August 1993, it has gained 17 per cent against the 
Canadian dollar and now stands at 84 cents. In the same time, it 
gained 8 per cent against the U.S. dollar, a significant measure 
of the strength of the New Zealand economy.
<P>
	New Zealand introduced business style performance 
standards for public servants. The equivalents of deputy 
ministers were renamed chief executives, hired on fixed term 
contracts and made personally responsible for delivering 
measurable results.
<P>
	Like business executives, they had the power to hire and fire 
and to buy any equipment they needed but they had to perform. I 
wonder how long some of the government's deputy ministers 
would last if they had to deliver measurable results.
<P>
	Along with requiring results of its civil service, the New 
Zealand government passed a law requiring any surpluses to be 
used to pay down the debt and thankfully it is now into that 
cycle.
<P>
	New Zealand's youth now have a future of reducing debt 
burden to look forward to while Canada's youth still have a 
future of increasing debt burden. The enforced social program 
reform in New Zealand extended to farming and corporate 
welfare as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6734"> 6734 </A></B>
<P>
	Almost overnight came the complete removal of subsidies 
for farmers. Bankruptcy for farmers and the loss of food 
production was widely predicted but in fact there are more 
farmers farming today in New Zealand and making more money 
per farmer than they did before the government subsidies were 
taken away. They now grow what the world needs instead of 
what the government was paying them to grow.
<P>
	There is a lesson there. When one pays people so much that it 
is more attractive to sit at home than to work, when one 
subsidizes farmers to grow crops that the world does not need, 
when one gives out grants to business and special interest groups 
one produces a dependency that kills jobs, kills initiative and 
kills individual responsibility.
<P>
	When I left New Zealand in 1979 to emigrate to Canada, I left 
a socialist country very close to bankruptcy. The writing was on 
the wall there just as it is here in Canada today. However New 
Zealand today is a free enterprise country, very different to the 
one I left.
<P>
	I am absolutely convinced that by studying the New Zealand 
experience we will be far better equipped to handle our own debt 
and deficit situation. If there was one MP travel junket that 
would actually be in the interests of Canadian taxpayers, it 
would be an all expenses paid trip to New Zealand for the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. He needs to see 
what is coming and he needs to see it soon.
<P>
	There is no doubt that we need social service reform but it is 
highly unlikely that the 89 pages of fluff in the minister's green 
book will make any significant contribution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened with some 
interest to the comments made by the hon. member.
<P>
	We often hear this New Zealand example being given either 
by the opposition members or certain doomsayers of all kinds. If 
I am not mistaken, the population of New Zealand is three 
million and the active economy is not any larger than that of 
Alberta. I understand the process in what it had to go through in 
restructuring its economy and what not. If we look at the 
industrial and economic profile of New Zealand in comparison 
to Canada there is very little to compare except the debt figures 
that the hon. member would probably like to bring to our 
attention.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I would like him to give us a better description of what the 
realities were at the time in New Zealand versus Canada. Canada 
has a population ten times that of New Zealand with an economy 
which is closely linked to that of the United States and other 
western powers. We are a G-7 nation and we have a lot of things 
going for us than New Zealand had at the time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for paying close attention to my speech and asking 
interesting questions.
<P>
	The population of New Zealand is a fraction of that of Canada. 
The only message we can get from that is we are going to be 
given a lot more rope to hang ourselves than New Zealand was 
given by the international buyers of its debt load.
<P>
	Up to 60 per cent of our debt today is being purchased by 
foreigners. The day they pull the plug on us it will not matter 
what sort of resource base we have. We will be scrambling to 
find money.
<P>
	Sweden has had difficulties with its international financing. It 
is really not related to population other than you get, as I said, 
more rope to hang yourself.
<P>
	The New Zealand model is a very good model for what will 
happen here. It was pretty tough right after the debt crisis. 
However the average person on the streets in New Zealand was 
extremely happy to see the government finally taking the 
initiatives they had wanted them to take all along.
<P>
	It is no good pretending there are not people abusing our 
social services system. There are lots of them and we had better 
be prepared to stand up, admit it and get on top of the problem. 
New Zealand was forced to because the money tree was taken 
away. That may well happen here. But I hope we come to the 
realization that we have to do something before the plug gets 
pulled on us too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the great puzzles surrounding Canada's social programs 
has been that they have had very little success in reducing the 
country's social ills. This is so in spite of the fact that 
expenditures per capita in real terms have increased 
dramatically since they were initiated during the post war years. 
What has gone wrong?
<P>
	This question has occupied my academic research for some 
time. In the short time available to me today I want to share with 
you some of my insight on this matter. I do so because from 
these insights emerge policies appropriate for revisions of 
Canada's social programs during the present financial crisis and 
as we enter the 21st century.
<P>
	It is part of folklore that restaurants that have fire insurance 
burn more often than those that do not. The insurance industry 
attributes this increase to what is known as moral hazard 
phenomenon. In simple language it is due to insurance induced 
changes in behaviour. The greater number of fires that occur in 
insured restaurants is due in part to outright arson. However, 
many additional fires are started because in insured restaurants 
less care is given to the cleaning of greasy vents and other fire 
hazards. They are less likely to have sprinkler systems and fire 
extinguishers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6735"> 6735 </A></B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada provides insurance against the 
hazards of unemployment, poverty and old age, disability, 
illness and a wide range of other calamities befalling people. 
As in the case of fire insurance these kinds of social insurance 
programs induce changes in the behaviour of the insured that 
result in higher claims and costs.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me illustrate in the context of unemployment insurance. 
Undoubtedly unemployment and the costs of insurance are 
raised by some criminal cheating through the filing of multiple 
claims or receiving benefits while holding a job.
<P>
	Some claim that such illegal acts are rare while others think 
they are frequent. By the nature of the crime it is not easy to 
obtain reliable estimates. At any rate, clamping down on such 
cheating is not a contentious issue.
<P>
	Of greatest concern for the present discussion of social 
insurance reform is the fact that much of the present high 
unemployment is due to individual Canadians reacting 
rationally to the changes in the environment in which they 
operate.
<P>
	For example, persons with unemployment insurance benefits 
have higher standards on a new acceptable job than those 
without. The former will reject jobs with longer commutes, 
lower pay and higher retraining requirements than the latter.
<P>
	People who behave in this way do not break the law. They act 
rationally in response to opportunities created by the 
government. They can afford to hold out longer for a better job 
because being unemployed costs less. Such legal and rational 
behaviour nevertheless increases the rate of unemployment and 
the cost of the unemployment insurance program.
<P>
	Similar forces act on the welfare program, as was 
demonstrated when in the summer of 1993 in Ontario a woman 
created headlines with the revelation that she quit her job 
deliberately and went on welfare. She argued that by doing so 
she enjoyed a higher living standard than when she worked for 
$40,000 a year.
<P>
	The media made much out of the question of whether this was 
true. In my view, this question misses the main point. Consider 
as a thought experiment that the woman's income was actually 
reduced by $6,000 by going on welfare. This means that full 
time work brought her only $500 a month and the loss of time 
with her family in leisure activities and valuable work in the 
home.
<P>
	I know few people who condemn Canadians who make the 
choice this woman made. She was not violating any law. She was 
simply taking advantage of choices created by the system. Yet 
such behaviour swells the number of welfare recipients and 
raises the cost of welfare programs.
<P>
	The cost of unemployment insurance is increased even further 
by the adoption by society of institutions which take explicit 
advantage of the opportunities offered by the system. Industries 
with seasonal employment expand. Some governments arrange 
hiring to accommodate eligibility requirements. They all act 
rationally and within the law. No one is to blame but the system 
which allows the creation and exploitation of these institutions.
<P>
	How large is the cost of social insurance programs due to the 
insurance induced changes in behaviour and institutions? Social 
scientists do not have precise answers to these important 
questions. I have been the coauthor of studies of the effects of 
unemployment insurance on the unemployment rate and venture 
to guess that without the increased generosity of the UI system 
introduced in the 1970s, Canada's unemployment rate today 
might be about two to three percentage points lower than it is.
<P>
	More generally, there is little doubt in my mind that insurance 
induced changes in behaviour explain the puzzle of the post war 
years, the ever increasing costs of social insurance programs 
and the constancy of the problems they were designed to cure.
<P>
	The green book contains a graph of Canada's unemployment 
rate since the 1950s. It is on a steady upward trend. My analysis 
suggests that this is due to the effects of insurance induced 
changes in behaviour, institutions and the overall increased 
social acceptance of such behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	What does my analysis imply for social policy reform? The 
answer is found in the practices used by private insurance 
companies to limit opportunities for risk increasing behaviour. 
Fire insurance premiums are lower for buildings with sprinkler 
systems. All forms of private property and health insurance 
carry deductibles, co-insurance on claims, waiting periods and 
rates that differentiate between people according to the riskiness 
of their behaviour. For example, life insurance premiums are 
higher for smokers than non-smokers; sky-divers face 
discriminatorily higher premiums.
<P>
	It is important to note that the private insurance industry 
knows that moral behaviour cannot be controlled completely. 
Consequences of it are reflected in insurance premiums. Where 
control is extremely difficult and the costs vary as in the case of 
insurance against business losses, premiums have to be so high 
that no one is interested in buying the insurance. That is why 
there is no insurance against business losses.
<P>
	For very noble reasons the architects of Canada's social 
insurance programs have made only limited use of such private 
insurance methods for controlling insurance induced behaviour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6736"> 6736 </A></B>
<P>
	To me the most logical solution to the excessive cost of these 
programs is to introduce more of the true and tried methods of 
the private insurance industry. Deductibles can be raised. In the 
case of unemployment insurance and welfare this would take 
the form of longer waiting periods before benefits are paid.
<P>
	Co-insurance can be increased by lowering the benefits 
relative to previous earnings. Pensioners receive benefits only 
when they are older. The receipt of benefits can be lessened by 
requiring frequent reporting and evidence of job search, 
retraining requirements and a host of other measures which are 
equivalent to increasing co-insurance rates.
<P>
	Other countries which have had similar experiences to those 
of Canada have taken such measures. Sweden has cut housing 
subsidies and brought in vouchers for child care payments. 
Norway is tightening disability insurance payments. In France 
social assistance is tied to signing on for a work training 
scheme. In the Netherlands young people up to the age of 27 
have their social assistance set at no more than 50 per cent of the 
minimum wage. Germany and Italy are raising the age at which 
pensions can be claimed. In Britain income support is made 
available only on the basis of need and after means testing of

<P>
	I believe that the phenomenon of insurance induced behaviour 
holds the clue on why in Canada and in other countries of the 
world the cost of social programs has run out of control. It also 
provides the answer for stopping these runaway expenditures. 
We could do better than listen to what other countries are doing 
to control their problem with insurance induced behaviour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to acknowledge many of the fine points that the hon. 
member made. His description of a disincentive to work is one 
of the cornerstones of what is in the green book.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question. I acknowledge that 
unemployment insurance social benefits may raise the 
unemployment insurance rate. That is hard to quibble with. 
Some people think we should do away with unemployment 
insurance or lower the benefits of unemployment insurance. 
They often point to the Americans and say: ``Look at their 
unemployment rate. It is much lower than Canada's and the 
main reason is because they have less generous unemployment 
insurance benefits''.
<P>
	Is there not going to be a cost if we toughen up the system? 
Many thousands of people lose their jobs through no fault of 
their own. They have no available work to go to. I come from a 
community on the north shore of Lake Erie that suffered greatly 
in the last recession. We lost 5,000 manufacturing jobs in a town 
of 30,000 people. There were no real options for those people.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	If we look at the American example we see that they do not 
have decent unemployment insurance programs. They have 
people living on the street. They have entire families living on 
the street. They have charities for no other purpose than to 
provide medical care for children of people who live on the 
street.
<P>
	Is there not going to be a cost? We are going to have more poor 
people in this country. While making the system tougher will 
encourage some people to find jobs, there will be vast numbers 
of people, through no fault of their own, who will simply be put 
in a worse situation than they are. Crime rates will go up and all 
sorts of other terrible social conditions will come into the foray.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
thoughtful comments. Clearly this is the tradeoff we face as a 
society.
<P>
	I can assure him that in the sixties we expected a 
never-ending flow of funds. People thought so what if there is 
some insurance induced increases in the demand for services; 
we can afford it. The problem is we cannot afford them any 
more. We are being asked what kinds of tradeoffs there will be to 
reduce the expenditures.
<P>
	The green book is full of ideas which will hurt someone. If we 
are reducing expenditures, as we have to, in order to increase 
spending on some other worthwhile thing or to eliminate the 
deficit, as we would do, then somebody has to suffer.
<P>
	I am suggesting that it would be a good idea to imitate what 
some other countries have been doing that have thought about it 
a lot. If some people have to suffer let it fall primarily on those 
who have been induced by the system to change their behaviour. 
Clearly there is no such thing as a free lunch. I wish there were.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> On the member's last point, he wants the cost 
to fall primarily on those who change their behaviour, but there 
is no way to distinguish them. If we toughen up the UI rules 
there is no way to distinguish between persons who take a longer 
time to look for a job than others would and persons who 
legitimately cannot find a job because all the factories in their 
towns have closed.
<P>
	There is no way; the system is not that specific that we can say 
some persons are not looking hard enough for a job so we are 
going to toughen up on them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> I fully agree and that is the dilemma. What are 
we going to do about it? What is the member's party going to do 
about it? We have no choice.
<P>
	As socialists are so fond of saying, if we want to make an 
omelette we have to break a few eggs. If we want to bring the 
country from the brink of bankruptcy we are going to have to 
impose on some people a reduction in the proportion of 
replacement of earnings they will obtain. We will have to 
impose on some people a longer waiting period. The 
co-insurance deductible will have to go up in all programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6737"> 6737 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at the green book and reinterpret some of the ideas 
for savings, in the light of the analytical scheme I have 
presented, namely how does it limit insurance induced changes 
in behaviour, we will see that many are directed in this way. 
My plea is that we recognize this explicitly and pay more 
attention in future debates in the House and by consultations 
throughout the country to this idea. I believe it underlies the 
problems we now have.
<P>
	The first best thing society can do is to attack the problem 
directly rather than in some indirect way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a New Democrat the issue of social programs is one 
particularly close to me. Our social programs essentially came 
about as a result of pressure from CCF governments, CCF 
politicians and New Democrats across Canada to address the 
concerns of people in times of need.
<P>
	As a social democrat I am committed to ensuring that Canada 
is a more compassionate country rather than a less 
compassionate one. I am also committed to ensuring that if a 
person is unable to earn sufficient resources through the 
traditional economic marketplace to live in dignity, we as 
citizens owe it to that person to ensure that his or her basic needs 
are met. In order to do so we have to redistribute wealth from 
those who have to those who do not have.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	The report we have in front of us called ``Agenda: Jobs and 
Growth'' is none of those things. It is neither an agenda nor has 
it anything to do with jobs nor anything to do with growth. It is a 
continuation of the Mulroney agenda. While that government is 
dead clearly its policies live on healthily with the new Liberal 
government. Last October we saw a government change but the 
bureaucrats and policies stayed essentially the same.
<P>
	Those policies saw poverty numbers increase, taxes on 
middle and lower income Canadians increase, the deficit 
increase. Social programs kept for the last 10 years while tax 
breaks to the rich grew and while inequality in the country grew. 
We are now at a point where the gap between rich and poor is 
roughly where it was at the end of the second world war, after 
some gains in between. We are now heading backward to a 
situation of haves and have nots with an enormous gap between 
them.
<P>
	The Liberals are continuing the same Mulroney agenda in 
terms of the same monetary policies, the same fiscal, economic 
and trade policies which have failed Canada and Canadians so 
completely.
<P>
	Canada and Canadians support the reform of social programs. 
There is no doubt about that. We have a system of social 
programs and we have a society or an economy that is not 
working well for about four million Canadians. There is support 
for reform. There is the political will to look at reform.
<P>
	Canadians want real reform. They do not want empty words, 
which is what this book contains. They want to have proposals 
they can look at and be consulted on in a meaningful way. It is 
not possible to consult with Canadians if there are no specific 
proposals with which to discuss the issues at hand.
<P>
	There are a number of general criticisms that one can make 
before going on to suggest what might have been done. Clearly, 
as I have said, there is very little in the way of specifics in this 
paper. It is much too vague. The government has said that it is 
not committed to any of the proposals that are put forward in this 
paper. It is difficult to consult if something is not put forward 
that people can get their teeth into.
<P>
	Where is the leadership in this paper? What is it that the 
government really thinks? When will the government finally 
start to govern after a year in office of doing almost nothing? 
This has not progressed us very far along the way in actually 
dealing with the problems of either social programs or the 
economy or the deficit.
<P>
	It is clear, in spite of the government's attempts to hide this 
fact, that deficit reduction is a serious element or a serious 
component part of this so-called review. I would suggest that 
deficit reduction drives the social security review in the way it 
has been driven over the last 10 years. We are seeing an 
Americanization of social programs as our social programs 
continue under this government. There are choices, as many 
have indicated today and yesterday, between more people 
oriented social policies and those American ones the Liberals 
have chosen to follow.
<P>
	The paper does not really deal with the problem we face. It 
does not deal with the job side of the equation. It does not deal 
with the taxation system whereby we will ensure we have both 
the resources to address the problems we face and the incentives 
to ensure that economic activity continues unabated.
<P>
	Where are those issues in this whole debate? They are 
absolutely critical if we are going to ever appropriately reform 
social programs. It seems to me, and it seems to most Canadians 
from what I can understand, that the Liberals are continuing the 
attack on the deficit on the backs of the poor.
<P>
	It is time we took a more balanced approach to dealing with 
the deficit. It is time that we did not foreclose on all those 
options that would require the rich to provide for their fair share 
of deficit reduction costs. It is time that we had a balanced 
approach to dealing with the deficit, not just one targeted at 
social programs.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	Last, as a general comment, it is pretty clear that the 
consultation process with the provinces has been totally 
inadequate. Otherwise we would not have received enormous 
criticism from all across the country, from all parties both 
within the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6738"> 6738 </A></B>
<P>
Liberal caucus and outside, and from the leader of the Liberal 
Party in Ontario. We would not have had this enormous outburst  
of criticism of the paper had there been effective consultation 
with the provinces.
<P>
	Clearly the process of social security reform can only take 
place with the close co-operation of the provinces. As long as 
the provinces feel they are right in that the government's main 
intention is to slough off the deficit on to their already difficult 
financial situations, they will not co-operate and they should 
not co-operate in the whole process.
<P>
	Let us look at the words of the green book. I wonder how many 
different coloured books we are going to have. Its main focus 
appears to be that Canadians are unemployed in the numbers 
they are because they do not have the skills to fulfil the jobs of 
the new economy. We all have to support increasing training, 
upgrading and education for Canadians. We can only see the 
benefits from that. It is good to focus on these issues but, as we 
see from the green book, the expectations are modest. Above all, 
there are no jobs out there for people to take once they receive 
this training. We have already a serious expectation of finding 
people continuing to live in poverty but being a bit better 
educated and having a few more skills.
<P>
	Until we address the real problem we will continue to attack 
social programs. Unless we solve the jobs problem we will 
continue to have more and more people flowing on to 
unemployment and social assistance rolls and we will continue 
to see pressures to address the overburdened system.
<P>
	We need to ensure that the skills we have are adequate. We 
also need to ensure that the paper deals with the so-called 
disincentives to work. Those programs which make a transition 
into the workplace more difficult need to be addressed too.
<P>
	There are some specific proposals that need some attention. 
Among all the words here, one proposal more specific than the 
others deals with changing the funding arrangements with the 
provinces. If all the federal government is going to do is 
continue to address its deficit problems, albeit not very 
effectively in this regard, by transferring the deficit to the 
provinces that have done a much better job of dealing with their 
deficits, we have not only the continuation of the Tory agenda 
but we have the continuation of the consequences that generates.
<P>
	We have provinces, and I speak in particular of my own 
province of Saskatchewan, which have addressed the problem 
effectively. That particular province, under a New Democrat 
government, has reduced the deficit from the highest per capita 
in Canada to the lowest. It will balance its books in the coming 
year. It will be the first province to do that as a have not 
province, a province without enormous resources. It has done 
that in a balanced way while at the same time, I may add, it has 
increased social program spending. It is not a prerequisite of 
addressing a deficit to do it on the backs of the poor. The only 
way to do it is in a balanced way which requires  all citizens to 
pay a share, to make a sacrifice in dealing with this problem 
which affects us all.
<P>
	With regard to unemployment insurance, it affects many 
Canadians. There are 1.6 million people on unemployment 
insurance at the moment. Many more who would have been had 
previous governments not changed the rules. However to 
suggest, as this paper does, that perhaps we should continue to 
make unemployment insurance even more difficult-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is 2.14 p.m. and there was an earlier 
order. I wonder if there would be unanimous consent to give the 
member a few more minutes to finish his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I really only need about five more minutes. I appreciate 
the co-operation of members.
<P>
	It really is perverse for the green paper even to consider 
making unemployment insurance more difficult to get and 
indeed for the benefits to be further reduced.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	It seems bizarre that we were focused on that as a solution to 
the problem, again continuing to blame the unemployed for their 
unemployment.
<P>
	We need changes that would make unemployment insurance 
more encompassing with about 50 per cent of the population 
now being self-employed. Outside that system, we need to find 
a way though not easy to include them within the unemployment 
insurance system. We also need to include those part-timers 
who are not now included in the unemployment system.
<P>
	We need to look for creative ways to ensure that all Canadians 
who need assistance are provided with it. Again we are seeing 
the emphasis on training but training out of funds which would 
otherwise go to those Canadians who are unemployed who need 
the resources to feed their families.
<P>
	We still have to ask the question: Training for what? Are we 
really going to successfully train four million Canadians to 
re-enter the work place? That is simply unrealistic.
<P>
	With regard to child benefits, we have here another 
suggestion that perhaps we should increase child benefits. 
Indeed the numbers suggested are to double them.
<P>
	While that is fine as far as it goes, it is obviously much better 
for a child to have $2,500 to $3,000 a year than only $1,200, but 
this will basically merely delay the visits to the food bank by 
two or three days in a month. This will not address the problem 
and we cannot keep addressing problems in this band-aid way, 
responding to some of the symptoms of the problem.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6739"> 6739 </A></B>
<P>
	Children are poor because they are born to poor parents. 
Their parents are poor because they do not have the means to 
feed their families simply because they do not have work.
<P>
	The last point I would like to make with regard to the more 
specific proposals in the paper is with regard to post-secondary 
education. This really is a very perverse approach by the federal 
government. We all talk about and we all agree that a better 
educated, more trained, higher skilled work force is important in 
the new economy.
<P>
	We would then anticipate if we all believe that that we will 
find ways to make post-secondary education more accessible 
and not less accessible. It really is difficult to understand how 
the government feels that by making tuition fees higher, perhaps 
five or six times as high, by increasing student loans from what 
are already difficult burdens for students to what would be 
almost insurmountable burdens and by reducing accessibility to 
post-secondary education, that possibly can move us toward a 
better trained, more educated work force. The opposition found 
the education community indicative of the problems with that.
<P>
	Let me just close by suggesting two or three things which we 
really should do to address the problems that this green paper is 
attempting to address.
<P>
	The real solution can only be to ensure that more Canadians 
are working, to develop the environment within the economy to 
ensure that good quality jobs are created and that there are 
enough of them to satisfy the demand. We have a long way to go 
on that. Other countries have been much better at that than we 
have. We really need a national consensus on how to move 
forward to ensure that all Canadians who can work will be able 
to work.
<P>
	We also need to look at tax reform. We cannot continue to give 
$15 billion worth of tax breaks to those who can invest in RRSPs 
while children go to food banks. It is simply not possible. We 
have difficult choices to make as all members have suggested. 
That may be a difficult choice for the economy but we can 
clearly ensure a reduction in the deficit and an ability to fund 
more effectively our social programs if we look at serious, fair 
and progressive tax reform.
<P>
	There are many innovative things we can do within the 
workplace itself. We can look at shorter working hours and 
overtime restrictions to share the work that is there. If four 
million Canadians are not working and another eight million 
are, it does not seem to me to be very effective to ensure that 
those numbers can continue.
<P>
	There have been successes as we have seen in other countries 
with efforts to deal with that problem and indeed voluntary 
efforts on the part of trade unions and employers to move toward 
shorter working weeks. We have constantly done that. In past 
history people used to work seven days a week and now they 
work five days a week.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	In closing I think this is a debate about the quality of Canadian 
life, about our collective responsibility to one another, about 
inequality and ensuring that social policy responds to deep 
insecurities, changing family structures, high poverty levels and 
great insecurity in the work force.
<P>
	We have a lot of work today and I do not think this paper takes 
us very far along the way.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CORRECTIONSANDCONDITIONALRELEASEACT">CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 10 consideration of the motion 
That Bill C-240, an act to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and the Criminal Code, be read the 
second time and referred to a Committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
this society of ours, criminality, and particularly the kind of 
sexual offences Bill C-240 deals with, is a very sensitive 
subject. Sure, we have to talk about it, but as parliamentarians 
we have the moral obligation not to turn this into a circus. This is 
a very sensitive issue.
<P>
	The death of a child is always a tragedy. Whether a child dies 
in a car accident, of natural causes, or whether he is abused 
before being killed, it is still a death.
<P>
	As individual members of a society, regardless of who and 
where we are, we have the fundamental and legitimate duty to 
protect children who, after all, represent the generation for 
which all of us here work. Indeed, we must protect children. We 
must do everything we can to provide them with the best 
possible future in the safest possible world. However, it is wrong 
to want to eliminate anyone who dares get close to a child.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that the Official Opposition does not 
take lightly a tragedy like the one referred to by the Reform 
Party member, in his speech to this House, on June 10. I am 
alluding to the case of young Christopher Stephenson who, on 
the evening of June 17, 1988, was kidnapped and then physically 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6740"> 6740 </A></B>
<P>
and sexually abused for over 24 hours by a 45-year-old 
individual named Joseph Fredericks.
<P>
	No one in his or her right mind can tolerate tragedies like that. 
And I mean no one. We often hear people say that inmates are all 
like this or like that, but the fact is that they have their own code 
in detention centres. Indeed, even inmates who have committed 
crimes themselves do not tolerate such horrible crimes. All of 
us, including criminals, agree that to hurt a child is a terrible 
thing to do. In January 1992, some inmates in Collin's Bay 
penitentiary, Ontario, took justice into their own hands and 
Joseph Fredericks was stabbed while serving his sentence in that 
institution.
<P>
	You know, the worst thing is that, whether they have raped, 
injured, killed or done all of the above, child molesters have to 
face the judicial system to be sent to jail. They have to go 
through the whole usual process to be sentenced. And then they 
end up behind bars.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Once inside the penitentiary, they have to face another type of 
police, as I indicated earlier. That is why these individuals need 
the form of protection commonly referred to as inside 
protection, or the protect as they say.
<P>
	I am not here to champion unduly the cause of such offenders, 
but nonetheless, if the judicial system sentenced them once, we 
should not keep sentencing them over and over, any time we feel 
like it. The main fault we find with the correctional system is 
this huge number of inside policies that govern the parole 
procedure. In other words, giving too much of a free rein to 
individuals who are not necessarily appointed because of their 
high qualifications but, in some cases, because of their party 
affiliation. To put it bluntly, these positions are too often filled 
by party hacks.
<P>
	Once a person has been sentenced, members of the parole 
committee should not be given the authority to ``retry'' the 
convict by trying to find out whether for some reason, it would 
have been better to, or not to, and so forth, because there is no 
end to the administrative maze. If we do that, we will get into an 
incredible mess, a real mountain of red tape.
<P>
	When a judge hands down a sentence-it was a judge who told 
me this, and I think all judges would agree-he does so on the 
basis of his assessment that by the end of the sentence, the 
individual will normally have served his term and realize, after 
going through the system and the follow-up services that are 
available, that he must not repeat the offence for which he was 
incarcerated.
<P>
	Of course, if this worked every time, it would be an ideal 
world, and we have yet to achieve that objective.
<P>
	On the other hand, when we look at cases like the one 
involving young Christopher Stephenson, everyone deplores the 
mistakes that were made and, of course, mistakes were made, 
unfortunately. Everyone deplores such mistakes. However, 
statistics show-because we must look at both sides of the coin; 
we were not elected to act in demagogic or dramatic ways-that 
only 6 per cent of parolees reoffend within six months of their 
release. Granted, they can commit new offences after the  six 
months are up. But even if we go up to 10 per cent, which is a 
large increase, it means that the current correctional system still 
works for 90 per cent of the people. After a period of 
imprisonment, 90 per cent of the people can regain the freedom 
to which they, like you and I, are entitled.
<P>
	We live in a democratic and human system managed by 
human beings so, on the one hand, there will always be mistakes 
but, on the other hand, we must also work to improve living 
conditions for individuals like ourselves. That is what we call 
community.
<P>
	There will always be marginal cases; there will always be 
people who take undue advantage of the system, be they insiders 
or outsiders. Of course some people will get away, but when a 
system has a success rate of 90 to 94 per cent, I think that we 
must start on that basis and try to improve it and not just focus on 
the 6 per cent and dwell on them and go after them.
<P>
	Yes, there is work to be done, that is quite true, everyone 
agrees. But I think that letting people who are not even judges 
render a second judgement, as the bill would do, is going too far.
<P>
	I will conclude with that. Of course there is a flaw, as 
everyone will agree. As I just said, the system is not perfect. 
Many people from all backgrounds are working on it in good 
faith, I think. Even people who do not always deal with the 
public but are in the community or are senior officials. They all 
work hard and listen to the people.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Yes, we have to look for a solution, but I really doubt that we 
will find it in Bill C-240.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rocks-South Langley for moving such an 
important motion. We obviously need to better protect our 
children against repeat violent offenders.
<P>
	As a starting point and proof that such action is necessary, my 
colleague referred to the crimes committed by Joseph 
Fredericks. The senseless death of young Christopher 
Stephenson, murdered in 1988 by this chronic paedophile from 
Brampton reminds us, in case we need to be reminded, that we 
must act quickly to deal with the weaknesses of our criminal 
justice system and reduce the risk of similar tragedies, in future.
<P>
	The federal government, the provinces and all the various 
areas of the criminal justice system agree that they must work 
together to reach this common goal. As for the federal 
government, he is determined to act on this issue. This is why it 
has already taken measures to implement several of the 
recommendations made in 1993 by the coroner in charge of the 
investigation concerning the death of young Christopher 
Stephenson.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6741"> 6741 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, most of the federal measures recommended were 
implemented, which helped to improve the preparation of case 
management and risk assessment reports throughout the federal 
correctional system. We were also able to improve the exchange 
of information on offenders, the accountability mechanisms 
and the coordination of management and treatment activities 
for sex offenders. We have made some remarkable progress, but 
still have a long way to go.
<P>
	This is why we will work hard to implement the few 
remaining recommendations. These recommendations address 
complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight. They require 
global and sustainable solutions. Bill C-45, which amends the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act, is one measure that 
will help improve public protection. This bill, which was 
introduced by the Solicitor General last June, is now before the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	One of the proposed amendments would make it easier for the 
National Parole Board to keep sexual offenders who have a 
preference for children in prison until they have served their full 
sentence. As the Solicitor General pointed out recently, this 
amendment does not mean that sexual offences against children 
are more serious than those against adults. However, in the case 
of children, it happens quite often that the National Parole Board 
cannot keep a high risk pedophile in prison because it is difficult 
to prove that he has caused serious harm to the child who was the 
victim.
<P>
	The proposal would solve this problem by eliminating the 
need to prove that serious harm has been caused in these cases. 
The Board would therefore have the legal right to keep an 
offender in prison until he has served his full sentence if it 
believes that the offender is likely to commit another offence 
against a child. I think this proposal would be a great help in 
protecting our children against sexual offenders under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	However, we must keep in mind that real reform requires 
more than just amending the legislation. Sooner or later, most 
convicts are released. This is the reason why the government has 
taken a number of initiatives aimed at protecting society in the 
long run. Improving treatment programs for sexual offenders is 
a case in point. If I may, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few 
words on what we know about treating sexual offenders.
<P>
	Research shows that sexual abuse has many roots and that 
there is more than one approach to treatment. However, 
clinicians agree that, in many cases, the chances of re-offending 
can be considerably reduced through continuous treatment and 
preventing relapses.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Preventing relapses is crucial as it helps sexual offenders 
control their urge when they are back in the community. In this 
context, the Solicitor General announced that, as part of the 
public security reform proposed by the government, programs 
for sexual offenders will be improved and reinforced.
<P>
	To ensure that the corrections system makes use of the most 
effective means to deal with and treat sexual offenders, 
Correctional Service Canada undertook a complete review of its 
evaluation and treatment programs, last year, with a view to 
improve evaluation of sexual offenders' needs related to their 
criminal behaviour, to implement a series of treatment programs 
designed to meet the various needs of this group of offenders, to 
train corrections officers in the latest techniques for dealing 
with sexual offenders, and to conduct research aimed at 
improving the effectiveness of these approaches.
<P>
	During the last five years, it made spectacular progress by 
increasing the number of places set aside for sexual offenders 
from 200 per year to over 1,800 per year.
<P>
	In order to improve the national aspect of the management 
and treatment of sexual offenders, the Commissioner of 
Corrections recently announced the nomination of a senior 
psychologist as incumbent of a new position, that of sexual 
offenders program consultant. This is another example of action 
taken following the enquiry on the death of Christopher 
Stephenson.
<P>
	In accordance with other recommendations made during that 
enquiry, the government will take measures in order to help 
local agencies better protect children against abuse in their 
communities.
<P>
	The RCMP is at the forefront because it gives all police forces 
across Canada access to the data base of the Canadian Police 
Information Centre, the CPIC. Thanks to those data, the local 
police can determine the background of any person who applies 
for a job involving children and can transfer that information to 
local community organizations.
<P>
	With these data, the organizations can make sure child 
molesters and sexual offenders cannot come into direct contact 
with children through community work.
<P>
	In order that our national screening process be the best 
possible, some representatives of the Solicitor General, in 
cooperation with colleagues from Health Canada and Justice 
Canada, are studying possible ways of improving on the data 
bank of the CPIC so that the acquisition process would bring in 
more complete data on criminal convictions and investigations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6742"> 6742 </A></B>
<P>
	For our part, we will have a much better screening system 
at the national level and we will be able to prevent contacts 
between children and paedophiles or sexual offenders.
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank once again the member 
for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley who raised this vital 
issue in the House.
<P>
	We have the responsibility, in memory of Christopher 
Stephenson and as a protection for all children and parents in 
Canada, to do everything in our power to protect our young 
people against sexual predators.
<P>
	However, protection does not depend exclusively on 
legislation. It also depends on the design and implementation of 
effective treatment programs for sexual offenders, so the risk 
can be manageable once they re-enter society. It is only through 
a balanced reform of the criminal system that we will be able to 
build a safe society where children will not live in fear of 
violence or exploitation.
<P>
	The initiatives I just described and the efforts we will 
continue to make over the next few months exemplify the 
commitment of our government to a better protection of our 
children. I am confident that all members will co-operate with 
us in the fulfilment of this goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of Bill C-240. This bill, introduced by my 
colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, offers 
important changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act and the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Once again the Reform Party has taken the initiative to ensure 
that dangerous offenders are not permitted to walk free and 
commit more deadly crimes and to threaten their victims' 
families. Reform policy supports tougher punishment of crime 
and the protection of law abiding citizens before the rights of 
criminals. It is unfortunate that members on the other side of the 
House continue to be so reluctant to introduce substantive 
reforms to the justice system.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	The intention of Bill C-240 is not to lock up prisoners and 
throw away the key. Instead this bill protects Canadians by 
keeping the most dangerous inmates behind bars. As my 
colleague stated previously in the House: ``This legislation is 
targeting individuals who are not designated as dangerous 
offenders at the time of their original sentence but their 
behaviour subsequent to incarceration coupled with their 
criminal record has led Correctional Services Canada and the 
National Parole Board to deem them too dangerous to be 
released into society''.
<P>
	On this side of the House we have often spoken of the need for 
widespread criminal justice reform and Bill C-240 would do 
just that.
<P>
	Look again at the fear that Helen Leadley and her family face 
daily while they await word of the date of Robert Paul 
Thompson's escorted temporary absence. This House is well 
aware of the history of this man and his criminal record dating 
back to 1969 and I am not going to let go of this issue.
<P>
	By 1983 Robert Paul Thompson had served time for 
aggravated assault on a former girlfriend and was incarcerated 
for two hit and run incidents. Even then with his record of 
criminal activity and violence he was issued a day pass from 
prison. While on this day pass Thompson went to the home of his 
former common law spouse, Brenda Fitzgerald. He tried to kill 
Brenda's male friend by beating him with a hammer and 
stabbing him. He then brutally stabbed Brenda Fitzgerald to 
death. How stupid, how irresponsible that he was issued this day 
pass.
<P>
	For this brutal murder and attempted murder Thompson plea 
bargained and pleaded guilty to second degree murder. He was 
never classified as a dangerous offender. He was sentenced to 
life which made him eligible for parole in the spring of 1995. Is 
that not a flagrant contradiction in terms: sentenced to life yet 
eligible for parole.
<P>
	The case does not end with Thompson's conviction and 
sentencing. Two and a half years later Thompson stabbed two 
prison guards and took a 63-year old prison nurse hostage. 
During the hostage situation it took 10 guards to restrain 
Thompson. For these subsequent attacks Thompson received a 
sentence of 11 years to be served concurrent to his original 
sentence with parole eligibility still in April 1995.
<P>
	Even after these violent offences Thompson was still not 
classified as a dangerous offender. What does it take? What does 
it take for such a violent criminal to be considered a dangerous 
offender? The parole board recently approved an ETA for 
Thompson. His brother has a non-life threatening illness and is 
in hospital. Thompson wishes to visit him for two hours.
<P>
	It was an irresponsible decision to grant this man a day pass in 
1983. It is even more reprehensible that the parole board has 
elected yet again to grant this ETA. Despite the pleas of his 
victim's family who live in fear of this man, despite the fact that 
I have spoken in this House on this matter four times now asking 
that this man not be released on an ETA, despite all of this, the 
Solicitor General has chosen to ignore these requests. 
Apparently the parole board, correctional services and the 
Solicitor General do not consider Thompson's proclivity for 
violence to be sufficient to keep him safely locked away.
<P>
	A member of the parole board in New Brunswick admitted 
that about 70 per cent of parole requests are granted and stated 
publicly: ``Honestly, we would like  to see 100 per cent''. 
Vengeance is not part of the mandate of the board. Does the 
parole board not have a moral obligation to prevent vengeance 
against the victims and their families? That is what this is all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6743"> 6743 </A></B>
<P>
about. Thompson has been able to reach beyond his prison walls 
and terrorize Brenda Fitzgerald's mother. My colleagues and I 
are fighting daily to ensure that victims' rights are not 
compromised for the rights of the convicted.
<P>
	The parole system allows offenders such as Thompson to 
serve only one-third to one-half of their sentences. The board 
even admits that fully one out of three violent offenders will 
re-offend, yet classifying an offender as dangerous can only 
occur at the time of sentencing. Even then current legislation 
only allows the correctional service to keep dangerous offenders 
in prison until the last day of their sentence. Then they must be 
released back into society.
<P>
	Convicted serial rapist Larry Fisher served his entire 23 year 
sentence never once taking any rehabilitation program and he is 
now free to offend again.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-240 would put a process into place that would permit 
the re-revaluation of an inmate's release. Bill C-240 would 
allow the crown attorney to apply the dangerous offender 
provisions when recommended by correctional authorities.
<P>
	When the evaluation of an offender suggests the likelihood of 
reoffending, the offender would face continued detention. The 
option for continued detention would include the imposition of a 
definite or indefinite sentence or long term intensive 
supervision of up to 10 years. Provisions such as these would 
permit the detention of offenders beyond their sentence for 
those who demonstrate their continued violent tendencies even 
while imprisoned.
<P>
	Canadians are frustrated at the government's lack of real 
action to make criminals more accountable for their actions. 
They are growing tired of watching the government tinker with 
the edges and not make real changes. They are beginning to 
question the government's ability to keep Canadians safe on 
their streets.
<P>
	This weekend is Thanksgiving. I find it appalling that the 
corrections system would choose today as the date to decide on 
Robert Thompson's ETA. It hardly seems fair that Brenda 
Fitzgerald's family will have nothing to be thankful for, while 
her murderer celebrates the holiday.
<P>
	Bill C-240 introduced by my colleague introduces real 
changes to the corrections system. It is time the Solicitor 
General re-establishes some credibility and supports this bill. I 
will not let this rest. Thompson's parole comes up in April 1995 
and I will be back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on debate at second reading of Bill C-240, an act 
to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Sexual offending is an issue of great public concern. The 
Coroner of Ontario has used a series of inquests to focus public 
attention on heinous acts committed by individuals. The 
reaction generated by such cases often implies that there are no 
current provisions for dealing with such persons or that the 
mechanisms available are entirely inadequate.
<P>
	The Criminal Code of Canada currently has extensive 
provisions regarding dangerous offenders. These provisions 
have evolved significantly over the years. In 1948 criminal 
sexual psychopath legislation was introduced, which permitted 
the court to determine that person was a criminal sexual 
psychopath if he had been convicted of an offence such as rape, 
carnal knowledge, indecent assault, buggery, bestiality or gross 
indecency, or an attempt at any of those offences.
<P>
	If the court found the offender to be a criminal sexual 
psychopath it could impose a specific term of imprisonment for 
the substantive offence and an indeterminate period of 
preventive detention to begin after the initial sentence had been 
served.
<P>
	The concept of criminal sexual psychopath was modified 
subsequently to specify habitual criminals and dangerous sexual 
offenders. There was particular concern to distinguish between 
dangerous sexual offenders and petty offenders. The Criminal 
Code was amended in 1969 and the concept of a fixed term 
sentence was removed from the dangerous sexual offender 
legislation, leaving only the indeterminate sentence. The 
Ouimet committee considered dangerous sexual offenders and 
recommended creating a new category entitled simply 
dangerous offender.
<P>
	Dangerous offender legislation was enacted in 1977 to replace 
former provisions for habitual offenders and dangerous sexual 
offenders. The current law is described in the Criminal Code in 
part 24. In that part the definition of serious personal injury 
offence is given in section 752 and the practical definition of the 
nature of behaviours covered is given in section 753.
<P>
	This section is applicable to offenders who constitute a threat 
to the life, safety, or physical or mental well-being of other 
persons. This threat can be established on four different bases. 
The first is that the offender has demonstrated a pattern of 
repetitive behaviour showing a failure to restrain his behaviour 
and a likelihood of his causing death or injury to other persons, 
or inflicting severe psychological damage through failure to 
restrain his behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	The second is a pattern of persistent, aggressive behaviour 
showing substantial indifference on the part of the offender for 
the consequences of his behaviour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6744"> 6744 </A></B>
<P>
	The third is any behaviour by the offender that is of such a 
brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that his behaviour in 
the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of 
behavioural restraint.
<P>
	The final category relates to any conduct by the offender in a 
sexual matter where the offender has shown failure to control his 
sexual impulses, and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other 
evil to persons through a failure to control his sexual impulses.
<P>
	If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender it may 
impose an indeterminate sentence on the offender instead of any 
other sentence that might have been appropriate.
<P>
	I raise the history of the development of this section and the 
definitions in it to bring to the attention of the House that 
various governments over an extensive period of time have been 
involved in wrestling with the problem of dangerous offenders. 
The current provisions have been tested at the Supreme Court of 
Canada and have been found to meet appropriate legal 
standards.
<P>
	The possibility of changes to the current provisions has been 
the subject of consultations with the provinces who administer 
the provisions and the result is that there is general satisfaction 
with the current state of the law among those required to apply 
it.
<P>
	The issue of the potential danger of charter invalidation, 
which has been raised in respect to the content of Bill C-240, 
has been addressed by other speakers and I will not repeat those 
points at this time.
<P>
	The important issue which has to be addressed here is whether 
it is good policy to consider amendments such as those proposed 
in Bill C-240 which carry a significant risk of invalidation, 
when we already have comprehensive and effective measures to 
deal with the criminal aspect of dealing with dangerous 
offenders. Federal, provincial and territorial ministers 
responsible for justice have recognized that there are other 
important areas that need to be considered. There are 
jurisdictional difficulties which need to be addressed through 
greater and more effective collaboration between jurisdictions. 
Federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for 
justice will be meeting with their health counterparts to address 
these concerns.
<P>
	The identification and effective prosecution of individuals 
using the dangerous offender provisions is also a matter which 
has been recognized. A process to track high risk violent 
offenders and make information about these high risk 
individuals available to crown attorneys for subsequent 
prosecution is another important undertaking for dealing with 
these offenders.
<P>
	In closing, it is important to reiterate that the current state of 
our law and practice is the result of a long  evolution. It seems 
clear that the informed opinion among criminal justice 
professionals who administer provisions respecting dangerous 
offenders is that the Criminal Code is an effective vehicle for 
dealing with dangerous offenders.
<P>
	The proposals in Bill C-240 present a significant risk of 
invalidation to a system that has evolved over a long period of 
time. We are much better served over both the short and the long 
term by improvements in inter-jurisdictional collaboration, and 
by administrative and procedural improvements than we are by 
proposals carrying excessive legal risks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take the floor on Bill C-240, an Act to amend the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act and the Criminal Code.
<P>
	If this bill, introduced by the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley, were passed, authorities would be able to 
review, while it is being served, the sentence of a inmate guilty 
of a serious and violent crime, if they believed he would 
reoffend upon his release.
<P>
	Bill C-240 would even allow an inmate to be kept in jail for an 
indeterminate period of time if he were to be considered beyond 
rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	As one can see, the judicial system would be given significant 
powers. Before I explain my reservations about this bill, I would 
like to clarify a few points to avoid any misunderstanding.
<P>
	Like most Canadians and Quebecers, I am absolutely not in 
favour of releasing under probation offenders who are 
dangerous for society. I agree that violent offenders who are 
obviously not rehabilitated should be punished and serve their 
sentence. We must keep them behind bars as long as they are a 
threat to our society, and they should serve their full sentence. It 
is a matter of public security, and that position is generally 
accepted.
<P>
	In a system based on the rule of law, the judicial system, the 
law enforcement agencies and the political institutions should 
make sure criminals serve their sentence and law-abiding 
citizens can lead a normal life. That is the basis of the social 
contract binding the citizens and the State.
<P>
	We know that if we do not have clear rules and adequate 
penalties for those who break the law, we run the risk of anarchy.
<P>
	The bill before us, if passed unamended, would seriously 
undermine fundamental rights and rules of justice we want to 
protect at all costs. Let me explain.
<P>
	As I said previously, we live in a free and democratic society 
based on the respect of fundamental freedoms and the rule of 
law. In the field of criminal justice, that means the inalienable 
right of every individual to be presumed innocent until proven 
guilty. This is a rule of  law that we inherited from the British 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6745"> 6745 </A></B>
<P>
common law and which still remains a basic foundation of our 
legal system.
<P>
	Also, under these principles, an individual can only be 
punished once for the crime that he or she was found guilty of. In 
other words, no one can be tried and condemned twice for the 
same offence. Trying to forego this fundamental principle of 
justice would amount to unduly suspend the civil rights of the 
individual and to use the rule of the arbitrary. Obviously, this 
kind of situation is unacceptable in a society such as ours.
<P>
	The bill before us contains, in clause 25, a provision which 
would allow a court to keep an individual in prison despite the 
fact that they served their time. This situation would result of 
the fact that, in view of new evidence which had not been or 
could not be produced at the time of the trial, the individual is 
considered dangerous and should be kept in prison.
<P>
	From my interpretation of this bill, evidence that was not 
produced at the time of the trial against the accused could be 
introduced in court in order to keep them longer in prison. This 
provision, I think, would seriously undermine the fundamental 
rights of that person.
<P>
	I remind you that since it was enshrined in the 1982 
Constitution, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has 
been the best means of protection available to Canadians against 
otherwise absolute powers of the modern state. The Charter 
provides a list of rules and principles intended to protect the 
fundamental rights of an individual. In this regard and for the 
purposes of the debate, section 11 of the Charter clearly states 
that: ``Any person charged with an offence has the right (-) if 
finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried or punished for it 
again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the offence, 
not to be tried or punished for it again''. In other words, under 
the Charter, a person cannot be punished twice for the same 
offence in Canada. This is a fundamental right entrenched in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	To me, some provisions in this bill clearly violate this 
principle, as we could, from now on, convict for a second time 
someone who has already served his sentence if a court finds 
that the offender still represents a danger for society. Clearly, we 
would have to wait for a Supreme Court judgment to determine 
if this bill could overrule the principles set forth in the Charter. 
And I think that the Supreme Court would declare the bill 
unconstitutional.
<P>
	For the purposes of the debate, we must also consider that the 
Criminal Code of Canada already includes provisions for 
continued detention of dangerous criminals, even after their 
sentences are served.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, we know that the courts have the power to declare that 
these people are ``dangerous offenders'' who should be 
sentenced accordingly. But-and this is absolutely 
fundamental-the Crown attorney must make the point during 
the trial and not a few years later when  the accused is about to be 
released, as would be allowed with Bill C-240.
<P>
	Why should we pass new legislation to protect society against 
dangerous criminals while the Criminal Code provides us with 
all necessary tools to that end? Either we let the Crown attorney 
do his or her job, or we, as legislators, tighten the definition of a 
criminal offender.
<P>
	Finally, according to this proposal, it would be the 
responsibility of the National Parole Board to inquire and 
determine if there is enough evidence to proceed to another trial 
and, ultimately, to extend the sentence. I think this would 
substantially increase the Board's case load, with all the 
additional delays and costs. Besides, this is not its jurisdiction in 
the first place.
<P>
	To conclude, I want to reiterate my firm belief that 
fundamental human rights are inalienable and should not be 
suspended. Sure, we can present some foul crimes in such a light 
that people will think that, given special circumstances, 
fundamental rights should be disregarded. But I do not think this 
is justifiable, because as legislators we must uphold certain 
principles.
<P>
	If Bill C-240 is adopted in its present form, it would be 
possible, I repeat, for the courts to detain individuals for longer 
than their original sentences, under the pretext that they still 
represented a danger to society. In other words, they could be 
punished for longer than their original sentences. It is obvious 
that this is unjustifiable.
<P>
	Citizens must not be deprived of their fundamental rights 
under the pretext that society or the correctional system can find 
no other way to protect the public against dangerous criminals. 
This solution does not resolve the problem of dangerous 
offenders, who can pose a serious threat to society.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that once society begins to 
make exceptions to the fundamental rights of the person, its 
members have every reason to believe that society is becoming 
dangerously intolerant and that, in the long term, their personal 
freedom is at risk.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-240 seeks to address concerns about the incidence of 
offenders repeating violent offences, particularly sexual 
offences.
<P>
	The focus of the bill is upon the identification and further 
detention of a select group of offenders who are identified after 
sentencing during their period of incarceration as presenting a 
continuing and substantial threat of harm to the physical or 
mental well-being of other persons.
<P>
	Predicting violent behaviour is undeniably a highly valued 
goal in terms of achieving community safety. Attaining this goal 
is very elusive. Other speakers have addressed the wide variety 
of measures which have been tried or which are currently under 
way to deal with the protection of society from dangerous 
offenders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6746"> 6746 </A></B>
<P>
	There are, however, a number of obstacles to effectively 
carry out this highly laudable goal. Approximately 10 per cent 
of all crime can be called violent. The base rate for violent 
behaviour is therefore quite low. For example, given the fact 
that only 10 per cent of all crime is violent, if we were to predict 
that no one would behave violently we would be correct about 
90 per cent of the time.
<P>
	The crux of our problem is that no one is satisfied with even a 
90 per cent rate of prediction. Research over the past decade has 
made significant strides in the prediction of violent behaviour.
<P>
	Correctional Service Canada has been working hard at 
developing risk assessment instruments and has developed one 
of the better assessment and prediction tools in the world.
<P>
	The major predictors of criminal and violent behaviour have 
been reasonably well identified in research. These predictors 
include criminal companions, a history of anti-social 
behaviour, anti-social attitudes, family problems, cognitive 
dysfunction and low educational and vocational achievement. 
Some of the items in this list can be assessed relatively easily 
through extensive and detailed individual histories. Some, such 
as cognitive dysfunctions, require sophisticated testing.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	One of the better predictors relates to assessment of 
psychopathy which comprises many traits including 
callousness, manipulation, dishonesty, irresponsibility and 
persistent anti-social conduct.
<P>
	There are childhood predictors of violent recidivism 
associated with difficulties in pregnancy, especially the 
addiction of mother to alcohol or drugs, early childhood 
problems such as temper tantrums, and being the victim of or 
witnessing abuse or parental conflict.
<P>
	Various conduct disorders characterized by stealing, lying, 
fire setting, truancy, sexual aggression, violence, cruelty and 
running away from home are strongly related to violent 
recidivism.
<P>
	The research seemed to suggest that there is an increasing 
ability to predict dangerous behaviour. Accurate identification 
of the highest risk offenders can be achieved by combining 
measures of psychopathic traits, demographic variables and 
criminal histories.
<P>
	Although using such tools will optimize the accuracy of 
predictions, it will not unfortunately identify all persons who 
will commit violent crime after release from custody.
<P>
	Attempts to refine the predictions even further will result in 
high numbers of people wrongly identified as dangerous 
persons. It will greatly increase the costs of such measures and 
will impinge upon the rights of the many individuals improperly 
identified.
<P>
	One of the striking things about the predictive factors which 
have been associated with violent recidivism is that virtually all 
of them occurred years before the violent offence for which we 
are concerned. They were known or could have been known at 
the time of sentencing.
<P>
	The Criminal Code contains extensive provisions for dealing 
with dangerous offenders. The definitions in these sections have 
evolved over time and have survived or have been modified by a 
variety of legal challenges. Since we are increasingly able to 
predict dangerous offenders, the tools for managing the kind of 
problem being addressed in Bill C-240 already exist within the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	What is needed to address the kinds of cases leading to the 
current expressions of public concern is better early 
identification and prosecution of the most dangerous offenders. 
The various jurisdictions involved in administering criminal 
justice need to carefully scrutinize cases of violent and 
dangerous offenders to ensure that the appropriate use of 
existing dangerous offender provisions are made.
<P>
	Finding ways to identify and track high risk offenders from as 
early as possible in their contacts with the criminal justice 
system throughout their involvement with the law will enable 
prosecutors to better apply the dangerous offender provisions of 
the Criminal Code. Finally it must be recognized that some 
offenders will slip through the net of criminal justice 
prosecution.
<P>
	For these individuals, better co-operation and co-ordination 
at the policy level, at the level of prosecutions, in the 
correctional domain and, most important, with mental health 
can provide effective solutions to dealing with high risk 
offenders without exposing our current, effective and tested 
tools to the risk of invalidation on charter grounds.
<P>
	In closing it is important to recognize an unpleasant reality. It 
is ultimately impossible to identify in advance all those 
individuals who will commit heinous acts. Our long term 
interests are better served by more effective crime prevention.
<P>
	I quote from the 12th report of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and the Solicitor General entitled ``Crime Prevention in 
Canada: Toward a National Strategy'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Committee accepts that crime will always be with us in one form or 
another and will require police, court and correctional interventions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the same time, it believes that our collective response to crime must shift to

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak on Bill 
C-240, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act and the Criminal Code.
<P>
	This is a private member's bill and we are debating it at 
second reading with the hope that it will be sent off to the justice 
and legal affairs committee of the House. Private Members' 
Business is one of the few opportunities members who are not in 
cabinet have to bring forward ideas in the form of bills or 
motions. They are debated and on some occasions are even put 
to a vote by members of this House.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I mention this because it was not so long ago that my private 
member's motion on relaxation of the confidence convention 
thus allowing freer voting in the House came forward for debate. 
It was a votable motion. Due to the support this motion found 
among members opposite it passed.
<P>
	I mention this now because I believe it is important in the 
period called Private Members' Business that we as members 
should be able to use our own best judgment when determining 
how to vote on a particular matter. The whip should not be on for 
any vote in Private Members' Business. Members should be able 
to study the legislation on its own merits, not on the basis of its 
origin. That is the suggestion that all bills introduced by the 
government are good and must be supported and all bills and 
motions proposed by the opposition are bad and by definition 
should be defeated.
<P>
	This idea is not conducive to allow parliamentarians to do 
their job which is to listen to the people of Canada. It prevents 
members of this House from truly working together in the best 
interests of our country's government and in the best interests of 
all our constituents, the Canadian people.
<P>
	I remind members that this House did approve the motion I 
sponsored which endorsed freer voting. I hope members 
opposite as well as members of the Bloc will find this bill 
worthy of their support.
<P>
	On the law and order issue which is being debated across this 
great country, there is no question where the Reform Party 
stands. It stands squarely in favour of law and order. That is why 
this bill is coming forward at this time.
<P>
	Bill C-240 is one more initiative by Reform members to bring 
the necessary changes to our justice system to protect 
Canadians. It is a response to a need in our society, a need which 
has been eloquently expressed by those who are the friends and 
relatives of persons killed by criminals who are being let out of 
prison and who we all know will commit violent crimes again.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Calgary Southeast spoke a few 
minutes earlier about the need to retain such criminals as Robert 
Paul Thompson who murdered Brenda Fitzgerald in 1983 while 
out on a day pass. This offender has been sentenced to life and is 
eligible for parole in the spring of 1995. Such a bill as C-240 
would allow corrections to keep dangerous criminals such as 
Robert Paul Thompson in prison.
<P>
	As my colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
has mentioned, under current legislation corrections officials 
have the power to keep dangerous criminals in prison until the 
expiration of their sentence. However, there is no legislation in 
place to allow the federal corrections system to keep high risk 
offenders in prison upon the expiration of their sentence.
<P>
	At present there are high risk offenders who still retain violent 
intentions toward society but will be released on the Canadian 
public. The need for change is also expressed by families of 
murder victims and by those few who have survived brutal 
attacks by criminals who should have been kept behind bars for 
the rest of their lives.
<P>
	This bill is similar to a bill that was introduced in the last 
Parliament and seems to be similar to proposals now being put 
forward for discussion by the present government. If that is the 
case, then why would any of us oppose it?
<P>
	Let me take the time now to deal with two criticisms that have 
been raised. First, the government proposal is that public 
discussion and action on this matter should wait for the 
conclusions of this consultative process.
<P>
	My riding has provincial institutions such as the Fraser River 
Correctional Centre, Alouette River Correctional Centre, 
Boulder Bay and Stave Lake Camp. It has federal institutions as 
well, such as Mission Institution and Ferndale Minimum 
Security.
<P>
	Between the riding of Mission-Coquitlam and adjacent 
ridings we have provincial institutions such as Surrey Pre Trial, 
Ford Mountain, Mount Thurston, Centre Creek (Youth) and 
Chilliwack Community Correctional Centre. There are also 
federal institutions such as Matsqui, Kent, Elbow Lake, 
Mountain, Regional Psychiatric Facility and Harrison Mills. 
That is a lot of prison institutions.
<P>
	The people of my riding and the surrounding ridings know of 
whence they talk. The people who work and live in the cities and 
towns found in Mission-Coquitlam want this type of 
legislation put in place immediately. They do not want violent 
offenders who have caused sufficient trouble in prison and 
therefore have been required to serve their complete sentence 
getting out and living unsupervised in the community. This bill 
only applies to the most potentially violent of incarcerated 
prisoners. I am sure the people in my riding would much prefer 
that such offenders stay in jail.
<P>

<P>
	My householder contains a questionnaire to my constituents 
with questions relating to reform of the criminal justice system. 
I received what I believe is a very good return, over 6 per cent, 
on questions relating to criminal justice reform, particularly 87 
per cent and 95 per cent who wanted changes to respective 
criminal justice reforms.
<P>
	What is even more interesting is in the top concern in the 
general comments, over 76 per cent commented on changes to 
the Young Offenders Act, to sentencing, the parole system, 
victims' rights and it goes on and on.
<P>
	Canadians want change.
<P>
	Listening to my constituents is all the consultation I need to 
convince myself that this is a necessary piece of legislation. 
Moreover, with whom is the government going to consult if it 
asks the person in jail what to do as part of the consultation 
process? It is quite likely the response would be that that 
legislation is not needed.
<P>
	If government consults with the friends and relatives of those 
who have died at the hands of recently released offenders I am 
sure the response would be that legislation is needed.
<P>
	In her speech on this bill presented to the House on June 10, 
1994, my friend from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
eloquently pleaded the case in support of her bill by giving us 
details of the murder of an 11-year old boy at the hands of such 
an offender. I believe his parents would support this bill. 
Therefore I believe the people with whom the government is 
going to be carrying on discussions have already spoken and 
spoken eloquently in favour of this bill.
<P>
	The second criticism raised against this bill is that it might 
contravene the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Yes, I suppose a 
bill which deals in a harsh manner with dangerous offenders 
could be found in contravention of some section of the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms but is it? The charter has a saving 
clause, clause 1. By virtue of clause 1 the charter may be 
violated by a statute but if such a statute would be acceptable in 
a free and democratic society then that statute is valid.
<P>
	This is one of the compromises that went into the charter 
when it was drafted and I believe it is helpful in relation to Bill 
C-240.
<P>
	I submit that in a free and democratic society that it would be 
unacceptable to deal in the way proposed by Bill C-240 with 
society's most dangerous offenders.
<P>
	My Liberal friends will say that such treatment violates the 
convicted person's individual rights. That would be the classic 
argument raised by Liberals but is it not time that we looked at 
the rights of the community as a whole? Is this not a case where 
the greater good for the greater number of people in our society 
should win out over the rights of an individual, the rights of a 
person who is so dangerous to society?
<P>
	I believe in cases such as this the rights of society as a whole 
should be protected and, yes, protected at the expense of the 
rights of a very few to whom this bill would apply.
<P>
	I endorse what my colleague from Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley said when she first spoke in support of 
this bill, that if this bill can save even one life it is worth it.
<P>
	I believe the time to act on this matter is now. There is no 
point in consultation on this matter. People are demanding that 
we deal in a tough straightforward manner with society's most 
dangerous offenders. I urge all hon. members to look carefully at 
the purpose of private members business and if they believe this 
bill is necessary then vote for it, regardless of the party whips.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to address this 
important matter for the safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, I think we 
will call it the end of the day. The member for Churchill would 
have 30 seconds or something to speak, if that is acceptable to 
the member for Churchill.
<P>
	It being 3.20 p.m. the House stands adjourned until Monday, 
October 17, 1994, pursuant to Standing Orders 22 and 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 3.20 p.m.)
